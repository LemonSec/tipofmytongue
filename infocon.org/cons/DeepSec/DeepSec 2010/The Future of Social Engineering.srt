00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,960

6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,859
I feel free every day and

7
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:22,619
I've decided to step down from the
podium because I stand behind the podium

8
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,180
you really just kinda thingy

9
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,300
too short being that guy it's very very
useful for social engineering

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,000
because and security guard come along I
can hide any crack

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,690
I can hide under attack offense hours
100 F

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,530
hiding in two people go home from work
I'm that my colleagues regularly

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,930
threatened to post me into an
organization

14
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,379
in a box but I don't know if they will
poke at careful

15
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:51,289
the pop except got and

16
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:54,829
for mine and Sharon come he d I'm based

17
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:58,109
a London for I work other social
engineer

18
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,980
so I checked people I manipulate people
try to bypass security controls

19
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,409
up and ultimately gain access to
sensitive information

20
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:09,979
or thanked Tennessee I'm I think

21
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:13,150
one of my favorite job over the last two
years

22
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:19,189
was when a client came to me and said
Sharon and where big concerns about

23
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:22,869
how much our employees are talking and
the pup

24
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:26,540
so every Friday they go to the same
local pub

25
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:31,420
after work free reading worried we would
like to pay you

26
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,979
to go and hitting the pub lift across
all our guys are saying about

27
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:40,479
whack so I said top a great job

28
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,679
I'm Irish really really expensive

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,200
up but the next think they came back to
me and they said yeah it's great we got

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,689
loads of information back

31
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:54,590
we were right that they also frequently
go down to the fourth

32
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,719
club ribbit concerned about what they're
saying they're sitting in the sauna

33
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,000
fishing in the jacuzzi we'd like you to
go down a kitten

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,669
the jacuzzi and sauna for the day I I
have to draw the line there because no

35
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,259
way to give them the photos

36
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,230
about particular social engineering
engagement and

37
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:17,530
so today I'm going to talk another fish
about

38
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,989
for social engineering have come from
and in particular

39
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:25,480
for social engineering going in the
future so first vote the term social

40
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,429
engineering

41
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,050
at has been around for quite a fine I
know straws and towards the end

42
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,950
up the Industrial Revolution friend a
Dutch guy realize special order to run

43
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,560
and industrial plant you need to both
the mechanical engineers

44
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,050
to look after the machine I G need to
the social engineers to look after the

45
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,030
people side

46
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,569
running an industrial plant the time
from political fine

47
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:52,849
that goes back quite some time so I'm
going to give you a vision for fifth

48
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:57,410
stopped or social engineering over the
agent will start

49
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,900
social engineering a hundred years ago
and

50
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,500
I think the turn of the 20th century
with the golden era

51
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,620
up the Connacht there were so many
fraudsters so many con artist and they

52
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,019
had

53
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:14,790
used abused I'm many of you will be
familiar with the phone

54
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,319
think star Robert Redford I mean that
was standard scam but they had going

55
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:19,840
around

56
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,459
time but this guy here is one of my
favorite con artist all-time

57
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:29,099
his name is Victor look dick and this
guy

58
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:33,019
managed sell the Eiffel Tower not once
not twice

59
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:37,290
several times so after the First World
War

60
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:42,120
I think was about 1925 if God decided he
would represent

61
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,159
French government I'm at

62
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:48,940
he gathered from scrap metal dealers
into a fun

63
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,019
the room at the ritz hotel in Paris and
he said look represent a government

64
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:57,439
I'm we're running short on funds just
paid for a big war

65
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,849
thinking about dismantling the Eiffel
Tower coming up for scrap metal

66
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:06,760
he got some pretty good offers and

67
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,530
it happened several times he was
successful with this several times

68
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,580
because the first couple time happened
people were too

69
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,060
fire the plate so we got away with it
and he was caught eventually

70
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,350
but really it with the clock social
engineer its use current event

71
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,580
think every second virus that we get
today

72
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,060
is related to current events how they
get people to open enough

73
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,290
definition search engine optimization

74
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,100
for example at the news about the Apple
iPad 3

75
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,770
was released I think the first three or
four if actually link to my website

76
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:46,169
so you know if a similar kind to
technique this guy pictures of take

77
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:49,330
he impersonated someone in authority she
got

78
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:54,609
all the time and course it was a very
very good deal for buyers they thought

79
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,940
they were getting a bargain

80
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,719
and that technique has worked throughout
the ages and

81
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,460
again he was able to do this attack
execute the attack

82
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,840
again and again I'm

83
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,570
still help today this is an English guy

84
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,289
lorry driver with put in prison summer

85
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:17,759
because he tried to the ritz hotel and

86
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,759
I mean pretty close to feminist

87
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,340
happen all the time

88
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,050
so forty to fifty years ago I think the
most famous

89
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:33,300
social engineer with this guy anyone
recognizes

90
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,180
frank I began catch me if you can space
and

91
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,400
so frank I began with a fantastic social
engineer

92
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,530
he did really really intelligent guy he
did all this research

93
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,780
he thought the bar in California and he
was able to

94
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,949
backup Neft rose she played both

95
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:54,750
information so he would others K kind of
hard to grow

96
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,990
but there is a lawyer a doctor or I've

97
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,660
he's probably most famous for playing an
airline pilot

98
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,350
100 if this would still work today

99
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,970
most definitely so I in March this year

100
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:17,100
32 sky was arrested because he'd been
flying passenger

101
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,240
ever came for tech teen years without a
life

102
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,250
they have the right documents he looks
the part he had just right

103
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,400
I'm said the place rented by to take off
in the cockpit

104
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,080
keep going to rectum and they said look
relief

105
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:41,008
given up the defection after 13 years

106
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:45,039
is hump all the time shocked China look
it up in the news

107
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,318
so many I'm

108
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,970
feat rive myself because I could try
maybe being an airline pilot

109
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,080
or more possible for me I guess an air
hostess

110
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,599
so frank ogden hit time how to go to
great lengths

111
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,050
to get it airline costume anybody who
has seen the movie will know that he had

112
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,169
to go direct

113
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:08,380
to the manufacturer's social engineer
that up

114
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:13,069
well much easier today get the money
back

115
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:16,340
I've a day actually have section

116
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,470
transportation Aeronautica airline

117
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:23,020
clothing make it really easy for you

118
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:28,090
you can look it up according to
whichever airline you want to be

119
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,210
but I'm warning you and

120
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:35,620
these costumes aerostats customs relief

121
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,590
sell for 150 euros gonna beat me with
buying them

122
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:45,740
I really don't know don't have one yet
gotten one day

123
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,300
pretty for twenty years ago

124
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,080
kevin Mitnick with the big-name social
engineering and he was the first person

125
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,389
who kinda broke the term

126
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:59,199
into IT security this is his definition

127
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,289
ten years ago social engineering starts
to get

128
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:05,400
really interesting at we had love fire

129
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,759
which is the first time we received an
initial email

130
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,509
from our friends because they came in
from our friends

131
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:17,879
why wouldn't reopen there was no reason
not to we've never seen the Shiv Sena

132
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:22,789
coming in for my friend on a course he
had the first phishing attack

133
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:27,539
fisher's trying to take over AOL account

134
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:31,870
for the major social engineering
headline up 2010

135
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,940
of course firstly early this year we had
had to go

136
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,229
CNN story I'm what was interesting about
this

137
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:42,360
is that the attackers didn't target
Google of directly

138
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,290
identified Google friends were on social
network

139
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,130
and they took over their friend become
fen-fen they sent a message from the

140
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,500
Friends account to the Google staff
members

141
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,709
there are far more likely to open it are
taken the URL

142
00:08:55,709 --> 00:09:01,269
or download the attachment again because
it came in from a friend

143
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:04,310
that then we had the Facebook

144
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,810
charges people got an email saying
Facebook

145
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,190
about to start charging for monthly
access

146
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,279
people really me angry

147
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:19,130
Facebook is always being free how dare
they start charging for $99 a month

148
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:24,089
trackback so they objected and they were
able to join groups on Facebook

149
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:27,330
subject they're able to kick I'm just
like

150
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:33,750
download malware all around the place so
the great social engineer

151
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,670
anybody recognize lady anybody friends
with this lady

152
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,410
because if you lack start worrying

153
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:44,949
this a supposedly welcome page

154
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,100
security project done by provide
security

155
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,820
and they decided special a fake profile

156
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,019
on social networks for this lady a
federal

157
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:59,089
a profile picture on facebook my faith
LinkedIn

158
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:02,890
and and they decided to cover the tight
love

159
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:08,870
fiber thrashed and

160
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:13,220
they let the project run for 28-day sure
which they tried to connect various

161
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,290
security people around the world and
they're pretty successful in the course

162
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,779
of 28 days

163
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:23,339
they connected through over 300 security
professional

164
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:27,130
at they got the photo from an adult
website I thought that this Robin sage

165
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,269
might appeal to many people in the
security industry

166
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:33,500
over the course of the month robin stage
received

167
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,720
dinner invitation job offers

168
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,950
I'm really really sensitive information
including

169
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,390
troop locations what time helicopters
were taken off

170
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:49,290
fell there were few clues in robin
stages profile

171
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,610
mice major special if he did any
research on their soil

172
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,310
so firstly if she was trying to connect
to you

173
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:02,360
no way do you know where she Robin sage
is actually the name of a military

174
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,019
exercise

175
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:08,670
I'm robin stage such 25 years old

176
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:13,829
but that she had 10 years professional
cyber threat analysis experience

177
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:17,380
maybe she maybe she did maybe some kind
of kid but the time

178
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,120
are

179
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,600
I'm just going to add give you some part
in the future social engineering is ICS

180
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,010
first well we've seen with the party
that thing we've seen

181
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:32,899
selling the Eiffel Tower in funding
landmark

182
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:37,120
same trick it's the same tricks at work
over and over and

183
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,459
history we get the same fame com

184
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:43,750
repeated again and again just for a
change

185
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:48,450
technology so going to 10-15 years ago

186
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,459
phishing attacks appeared at that took
place over a male

187
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:55,700
to pay for Social Network now we've got
fishing

188
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,269
juices flow technology got mission that
uses SMS

189
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:02,690
I'm sure we got whatever issue comes
next

190
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:07,480
but abuse for example if he had fun fee
fraud

191
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,410
the Nigerian 419 scams that we see so
often today

192
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,920
actually date back hundreds of years

193
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,069
the first example I could find about
five hundred years old

194
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:22,070
and used to take place in the UK

195
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,600
around the time of the Spanish Armada

196
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,480
so they were tired as a member of the
aristocracy the con artist

197
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,170
find a nobleman find a beautiful funnest
looking lady

198
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:36,479
go to the nobleman okay despues 180

199
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,839
father imprisoned in Spain we need for
money to bribe the guard

200
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:44,279
to help relief and and if you give us
the money

201
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:49,029
not only will you be remember hundreds
and hundreds

202
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:52,480
goes June through me you can also morry

203
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,459
used mislaid that I have on my arm for

204
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:00,940
for people fell for this they give the
cash

205
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:07,130
they'd never see the money for the
beautiful lady again

206
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,779
so we stepped forward to I think 17 or
maybe early 1800s

207
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:16,200
I'm this guy Jean Francois trinh-duc
started his life

208
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,820
I'm criminal spent years and years in
jail

209
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,480
and then interstate interestingly went
on to found

210
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,570
the french police force as we know it
today

211
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:31,040
and so jean-francois be doc

212
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,480
published memorized and you can read
them on google or you can buy the book

213
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,170
on he mentions ASCOM the measure from
jerusalem

214
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,670
and again it was very very similar at
the target

215
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,260
a member of the artist oxy or someone
with a lot of money again

216
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,439
fit right in the Nasher give them some
reason to advance from cost

217
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,920
and might be something %uh 50 okay where
the assistant

218
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,790
today iris to cross and heel of the box
June

219
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,800
we need to find them somewhere we need
to pay for searchers

220
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,300
if you give us the money which ended
June 30

221
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,709
so I like the statistics that freed up

222
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:11,870
mentions he says a hundred leisure 20

223
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:16,690
were always accident because they were
very very very targeted attack

224
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:22,519
possibly the first a example we thought
spearfishing

225
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:26,570
my favorite pro quote from the doc it
sucks sometimes even

226
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,889
the Caribbean for this gone

227
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:35,570
very very serious

228
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:38,860
so throughout history again they've
repeated and

229
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,820
which get forward to the nineteen eighty
back from beef first started appearing

230
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,449
out of nigeria

231
00:14:44,449 --> 00:14:49,110
at the oil-based economy within the time
from Nigerian student thought maybe they

232
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,930
could take advantage of

233
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:54,329
I'm a compact a usually US businessman

234
00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:57,810
sending the measures are sending faxes

235
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:01,810
or even 10 X's saying we can cut you in
and that's really good business

236
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:06,310
if you don't let up this money and fun
the same thing over and over

237
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:09,769
on a course that eventually tended to
email attack

238
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:16,440
so this is a typical 409 come that we
see today

239
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,490
attackers will often try

240
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,850
to make their victims some kind motion
because we're emotional

241
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,930
whether it it's being angry because
Facebook earth got

242
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:31,160
charge for account access or whether
it's because

243
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,230
you're feeling obsession are sympathetic
because

244
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,240
that guy client all died

245
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,839
and a plane crash once you feel about
emotion you're more open to suggestion

246
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,269
so this guy says his bank clients and
its entire family

247
00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:50,790
died in a plane crash any money I'm
actually if you click through

248
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,250
or even type this URL in

249
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,970
it back ok story so this might work for
people in the security industry

250
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,440
but it could work for a lot of other
people well

251
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,920
this is the packed Concord crash that
happened in paris by ten years ago

252
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:14,920
and I'm not quite sure if I is referring
to a news story

253
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,490
but today it turned into more for
friends gone

254
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:23,300
I we often receive emails from my friend
night saying that they've been stuck

255
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,160
abroad

256
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,350
in the first time I received if the talk
even I have to think twice about whether

257
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,620
it's real or not

258
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,089
because I received from an acquaintance
rather than a friend

259
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:37,649
so I didn't know the lady that well a I
think I'd measure come to professionally

260
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:38,800
couple a times

261
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,079
I didn't know or background I didn't
know that she wasn't in Nigeria

262
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:46,089
maybe she could have been in Nigeria

263
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:49,240
so she says that she she was on the way
to the hotel

264
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,009
and she lost her bike and she now owes a
summer of 2000 others

265
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:57,060
but she needs me to help out with the
summer three-and-a-half huh

266
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,550
dollars urgently

267
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:04,280
know it was a hundred over that kinda
money but the interesting thing is fast

268
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,918
with the love these

269
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,419
a french guns the amount

270
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:13,309
of the exact same you'll see that 2003
and have fun

271
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:17,849
dollar amount repeated over and over

272
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:22,168
so with you know it old attacks reworked
offend the request comes in from your

273
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:22,990
friend

274
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:27,140
of course you're more likely to comply
with so they're getting very effective

275
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,970
the latest one appears to be the London
looking for this comes in via social

276
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:32,710
networks

277
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:38,000
from kinda chops your friend will say
I'm sorry I forgot to tell you

278
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,880
but when I was there smoked lost my bike

279
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,070
faith based on my money well this I need
you to give me

280
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,480
money again to pay for the hotel I live
in London

281
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,280
probably quite realistic

282
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,370
but I close I was surprised last year
when we had the whole volcano thing

283
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,309
going on

284
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:00,629
everybody was stranded across the world

285
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,840
that was the ideal time for social
engineer

286
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,049
take advantage I mean can you imagine if
you are after

287
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:10,710
particular organization most local
organizations

288
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,080
people somewhere because of the volcano

289
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,299
flying to the people are of in the next

290
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:21,129
of some kind of assistance there were
times the car

291
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:25,650
special people disclose their email
addresses

292
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,720
they disclose their telephone numbers
you know this guy I'm in Amsterdam and I

293
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,340
need to get

294
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,668
Dublin can anyone help if except to lift

295
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:36,970
anyone go that way so I didn't hear

296
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:40,910
any tax but you but you never know prime

297
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:45,049
grounds for social engineers

298
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:48,549
so next on social engineering the attack

299
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:51,668
I getting a lot more sophisticated

300
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:55,990
I'm a lot more targeted so take fishing
for example

301
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,990
now we still get blanket phishing attack

302
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,710
that are sent out to everybody but we're
seeing more and more spear phishing

303
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,940
attacks that are very

304
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,990
very targeted

305
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,190
this is an example love an email that

306
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,580
executive and the companies in the US
received last year

307
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,320
so with a subpoena telling them they
needed to appear

308
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,409
in court the following week or the
following one

309
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,429
first will you get the female you're
gonna be kinda worried

310
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:29,390
do you need to appear in court it looks
pretty professional

311
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,750
long way from the early fish talk it
looks really

312
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,799
really good issue to an individual

313
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,000
if they tend to group group of people
efficient

314
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,740
particular individual so I think this is
a very effective attack

315
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,270
at another example we have I think

316
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:53,660
station from last year already this year
and

317
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:59,299
with quite effective because the
fraudsters identify the main contenders

318
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:02,750
that dealt with particular companies and
then the email

319
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,280
they didn't have malicious URL be now

320
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,760
they didn't %uh official attachment

321
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,799
they actually often directly to open up

322
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,789
particular ports on the firewall there
to expect that particular IP

323
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:21,669
their company for really good attack the
reason that's good

324
00:20:21,669 --> 00:20:24,900
is because the fender knows a lot of
information

325
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,860
the new defender day they need the name
of the IT administrator

326
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,320
and in certain cases they knew the name
up the project that the IT teams working

327
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,129
on

328
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,230
so you can say the whole combination of
social engineering attacks

329
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,460
taken face before they sent the female

330
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,669
very effective

331
00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:48,419
record debate if not always going to be

332
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:52,429
online it could be in the real world it
could be a road opp

333
00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:56,760
in the real world maybe USB key
scattered around the car park

334
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,230
maybe nothing to do with it. at all
there's really good example

335
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,380
love attackers at

336
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,130
leaving parking ticket on some cars in
the US

337
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:11,970
and for the people came back I thought
they had parking ticket

338
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,500
and they were instructed to visit a
certain URL

339
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,480
to identify the photo of their car take
on this

340
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,530
I'm pay their fines a course what you
think happens when they kicked us

341
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,840
download all kinds lovely mother to
their machine

342
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,879
but causes at absolutely nothing to do
without me

343
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,159
I think really effective the people are
beginning to suspect

344
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,020
from the fishing they receive they're
beginning to expect from the crazy

345
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:40,580
pop-up

346
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,649
that appear in their screen on the
computer screen

347
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,940
in front your suspicion it in a car
parking

348
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,630
better paper left there for you you're
not special

349
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:54,809
so I think that's for social engineering
is going and

350
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:59,500
open for such creativity United more
creation your attack

351
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,880
more likely it is to succeed

352
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:09,510
I'm of course you can get so creation
you can find so much information

353
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:13,658
because social network I mean social
networking has really changed the face

354
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:15,120
of social engineering

355
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,500
over the past three or four years

356
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,580
social engineers like to use social
networks the company

357
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,789
such a huge attack for we

358
00:22:25,789 --> 00:22:29,789
all seen statistic on the number of
users

359
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:33,770
and course it's quick and it's easy
sometimes you can even

360
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,309
automation lookup phone numbers that you
can use in your mission

361
00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:41,470
for example got a low barrier

362
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,870
entry point you don't have to be
technically

363
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:49,640
leak to do social engineering attacks
fear social network

364
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,320
you just have to be a bitch imaginative
or you just have to copy somebody else

365
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,700
attack you hardly need any technical
skills at all

366
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,080
actions to work social networks and

367
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,799
realizing publicly available information
you know people published so much

368
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,490
about don't realize can be used social
networking attack

369
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:14,650
I'm what I like about is I don't have to
do so much dumpster diving

370
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,669
anymore because the information is
available online

371
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:24,110
and I dumpster diving dirty

372
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,179
so you know notes for example

373
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:30,280
other people publishing the information

374
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,030
this person lost their phone all their
friends to send their telephone number

375
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:34,820
three

376
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,220
so they all did and they all shared
friend tough

377
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,570
times for example like this

378
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:46,168
and social engineering via social
network

379
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:49,919
work because social networks are based
on trust

380
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,890
key social engineers like to exploit at

381
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:59,799
it's really easy to impersonate somebody
on social networks

382
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:02,860
this example up impersonation in the
real world took place

383
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:07,470
London some guys dressed up with
placement went into a data center

384
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:12,929
in the middle of London and fed at we've
had reports of people on your roof

385
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:17,130
we need to go in an investigation the
entrance to the data center

386
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:20,789
because they were dressed as policemen
daytime cough uncooked

387
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:23,980
security guy their chairs they walked
out

388
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:29,460
carrying the servers

389
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,770
bus execution attack like this take
money

390
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,179
you need to first well you probably from
a guy work

391
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:40,919
in groups don't go in on your own and
you need to procure

392
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:44,210
the cost you you need to get your

393
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,490
so either you need to purchase are you
need to get them illegally

394
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,710
and

395
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:54,539
there's potential for physically harming
people I mean they have to

396
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:59,360
hunk of the stock to the chairs far as I
know nobody was hurt but one person did

397
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,200
have to be treated for shock

398
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,010
teclado climbing I'm court when you're
doing a physical attack like this

399
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:09,190
much easier to get cost you compare this

400
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:13,330
setting up a fake profile online

401
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:17,879
watch easier

402
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,370
Social Engine social networks are
fantastic for performing

403
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:24,730
your research and you're kind of so once
you've

404
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:28,440
identify to your going to social
engineer whether it's a particular

405
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,330
person

406
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,029
or particular organization you going to
try and gather as much

407
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:36,320
information at the kind about them I
will

408
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,428
start LinkedIn LinkedIn super for social
engineers a

409
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:45,960
first will you can start by building an
organization chart

410
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,309
up the company you're trying to get into
you go to establish

411
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:52,899
reporting to him had which department

412
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:58,370
you go through it and you identify the
names of individuals working in there

413
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:01,710
you can target then you can pretend to
be then

414
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:06,130
are you could name drop their names like
if you know the name to CEO

415
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:09,200
you know the feeling on holiday could
maybe he's posters

416
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,059
and i couldnt request okay for LinkedIn
you go and finally got to the office

417
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:17,210
and say we want to me to do this work
are you doing

418
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:21,270
Spain any document Keith and its me so I
can get it

419
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:24,799
can see so much information of course
the confession

420
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,340
a fake profile I'm thinkin tear Targus

421
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:34,510
it's pretty easy to imagine who should
know who in any particular industry

422
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:38,320
and if people our friends on Facebook

423
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,439
if John and Jane are friends on Facebook
and change doesn't appear to have a

424
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,600
LinkedIn account

425
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,539
that one up under her name fen-fen join
LinkedIn request

426
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:50,600
probably gonna believe us

427
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,779
lot of people except LinkedIn request
from whoever something to them anyway

428
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,919
for you may not even have to set up a
fake profile

429
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,260
and a course we receive LinkedIn request

430
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,900
nearly every day you know it fucking for
our team and looks like

431
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,830
go first

432
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,879
so once he got the name of individuals
who work

433
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,960
for your target organization on LinkedIn
look them up

434
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,620
another social networking site see what
they have in their Facebook accounts

435
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,990
they're my faith can

436
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:25,620
do more tactical research on that person

437
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,179
here's an example you know the surveys
people

438
00:27:29,179 --> 00:27:32,600
like to publish online like to give away
their date to Kubrick

439
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,929
like to give away their home addresses
and more

440
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:39,850
but this guy bob I noticed that his
perfect pizza

441
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:43,700
is the dominoes me please pizza

442
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,440
so-called about ok you could use this in
the social engineering attack

443
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,470
it's very similar to what I did to
accompany

444
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:55,450
so you know what company bob worked for
Genova fishy he works in

445
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:59,409
face have a brunch City so you call
around to each branch

446
00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:03,169
continue identified which only works in

447
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:06,899
any by your Domino's delivery shirt

448
00:28:06,899 --> 00:28:10,320
they're really cheap on ebay you can
guess

449
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,789
for for $9.99 buy it now

450
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:18,049
so share them with your friends so you
got your delivery shirt

451
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:21,710
ordered me fifty from dominos

452
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:26,460
collectors go somewhere else put on your
delivery share

453
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:31,390
and bring the pizza to Bob of

454
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,840
if the object and says he didn't order
it

455
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:39,919
tell one of his friends did you got an
angel friends from Facebook account

456
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,090
so you're in the office to get a
wireless access point okay

457
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:47,899
keylogger actually physically take the
information highway

458
00:28:47,899 --> 00:28:51,440
if you think this is too risky

459
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,570
how about your email Bob voucher for a
free pizza

460
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,629
maybe his birthday is coming up next
week

461
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:00,690
hi bob thanks for being such a loyal
customer for Domino's Pizza

462
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:07,690
we'd like to offer you the next on the
house print the attachment check

463
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:14,450
this up and come out so well this one
other guy Joe and Joe was really really

464
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:18,169
useful to us not only did he published
all the information about

465
00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:21,260
already worked for you born what school
you went to

466
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:25,600
from the cunt make it i funny actually
says father incoming as well

467
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,799
so for attackers attackers point you
know exactly how much you can take that

468
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:31,710
guy for

469
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:36,090
so he's couple things on his survey
caught my eye

470
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:41,850
at it go this year is to give up smoking

471
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:47,350
deepest fear is creepy crawly and again
he's gotta favorite pizza in there

472
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:51,240
so how could you social engineer this
guy but a couple of ideas

473
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,570
you've got forty five friends MySpace
page

474
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:59,029
you know his birthday is add the clock
to break take right now to the comment

475
00:29:59,029 --> 00:29:59,950
feed even

476
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:03,419
century birthday cards on behalf of one
of his friends

477
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:06,789
with the CD or USB key in this

478
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:10,690
said Johnson supposedly have done for
the ladies are something like us in it

479
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,750
but obviously goes comprises machine

480
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:17,350
sending a stop-smoking pack again some
kind media

481
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,350
she needs to plug in or maybe even even
think to

482
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:23,840
should visit finally you can threaten
him

483
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,860
with creepy crawly until he gives you
the information that you

484
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:34,490
hadlock speaker spoke about 50 dot com
fantastic resource again

485
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:39,149
for social engineers and so you can
register your credit card to comfortably

486
00:30:39,149 --> 00:30:39,850
p

487
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:43,919
you can register your online purchasing
accounts like eBay right

488
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,350
internet picked that be and every time
you make a purchase

489
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:51,870
it appears a fell apart from people
knowing

490
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:56,010
exactly how much you paid for that gif
or how much you paid for the bottom line

491
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:58,320
but you've just brought to the party

492
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,330
it can be a review for social engineers
so take this example this guy just

493
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:08,850
rented a couple of movies and Netflix he
meant in Spartacus movies

494
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:12,820
so emailing or calling say our caller
from Netflix

495
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:16,809
how did you like the Spartacus movie
again offering the next one free of

496
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:17,519
charge

497
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,220
we'd like to thank you up and fucked
what's your email address

498
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:25,450
engine vulture

499
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,649
Foursquare dot com any kind geo-tagging

500
00:31:28,649 --> 00:31:32,399
a social networking sites it's useful
not only for

501
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,010
social engineers but for burgers

502
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,720
and I'm sure able team that plays rugby
project the schedule for earlier this

503
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,610
year

504
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:43,769
I'm that noted the location for people
and therefore

505
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:46,860
when their houses are likely to be empty

506
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:50,480
here's an example so you take this first
guy

507
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,039
he left home and he's going to this
lovely Irish pub

508
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:57,769
in Paris so if you're after this guy

509
00:31:57,769 --> 00:32:01,380
go to the pub he's got a photo there

510
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:05,110
you know what it looks like strike up a
conversation

511
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:09,230
Steelers I what he thought was robbed
I'm

512
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:13,429
break any from the got loads work stuff
in there so many things you can do it

513
00:32:13,429 --> 00:32:17,480
once you have this information

514
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,519
so social networks are great but there's
loads and loads technology

515
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:28,279
that you can use to wear improve are
also major social engineering attacks

516
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,390
to make it more effective 14 taken more
fun from

517
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:35,390
social engineers point you as well so

518
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:39,100
you got Photoshop again you can make
your own ID card

519
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:43,240
you can make your own business card
actually there's no the website

520
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,929
that you can use online to to produce ID
card business cards as well

521
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:51,519
that's not a problem you can use
multi-goal

522
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,899
or people to do some possible conference
so you've got the name of an entity

523
00:32:56,899 --> 00:32:57,549
whether

524
00:32:57,549 --> 00:33:01,230
an organization for an individual
multi-goal give you really good

525
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,080
graphical

526
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,850
representation %uh links between and see
another entity

527
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:10,360
so you put in the name of an individual
it may come back with email addresses

528
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:14,330
physical address telephone numbers X
Factor 32 youthful

529
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:19,059
at social engineers took it from social
engineer .org

530
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:23,510
began a fantastic for social engineers
one-stop social engineering shop

531
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:28,190
3d really good for running any
particular fishing program for example

532
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:31,750
a recreation tire website it can also
make

533
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:35,789
and in the payload IPS phishing email
really good

534
00:33:35,789 --> 00:33:39,789
on course are so many other things like

535
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:43,649
physical book but you can put into rooms
there's so much slicker now than they

536
00:33:43,649 --> 00:33:44,750
used to be

537
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:48,240
I've got humbug with the secret hidden
camera in this

538
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,500
that I bring around I can use that for
shoulder second paper

539
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,429
but they're typing in the CAF are can
use it for recording an entire social

540
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:57,240
engineering attack

541
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,630
and anacostia caller ID spoofing

542
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:04,330
which anybody could do these days just
by implication

543
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:08,389
us can buy a spoof card or you can buy
an application for your smartphone

544
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:12,240
I'm both cards is often the number one
feather on sites like

545
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:19,010
fear it's really easy to do

546
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,589
I feel like James Bond sometimes doing
social engineering attacks

547
00:34:22,589 --> 00:34:28,239
so much good equipment I really like
this one its it's at

548
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,139
memory cards inside according sometimes
when you going to data center

549
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:36,379
help over all your media on your
mobile.phone

550
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:39,949
everything like that but I heard you
gonna check everything calling you have

551
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:41,109
in your pocket

552
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:45,730
do you have to be careful what offenders

553
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:49,030
but what about and what about the
technology

554
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:52,409
the equipment that we might expect see
in future

555
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:55,510
a couple weeks ago fine-tooth make
another development

556
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:59,420
have it regards to in disability ok the
very very cautious

557
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:03,579
style can you imagine if you had
invisibility cloak and you're trying to

558
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:08,950
get into an organization

559
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,960
last week this hit the news there's a
laser camera

560
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,480
take photos around corners

561
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:21,050
pop-punk technology so the whole idea of
this laser camera that's the code for

562
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:21,760
the guys

563
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,540
that invented it if he could generation
mock before you go into a dangerous

564
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,000
place like a burning building for
example

565
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,060
or if you got a robotic are you can
compute rich

566
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:35,240
road should take before you even turned
the corner

567
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,650
so don't have from pretty good uses I
saw skylight called

568
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:44,730
how front optical for shoulder session
from afar

569
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:48,810
so this is where we are wear the purple
blob just here

570
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:52,150
a the Red Bluff are fine

571
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,470
nearby presumably with AT&T

572
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:59,280
so careful how about you from just about

573
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,500
there you could neither comer around the
corner from each of these ATF

574
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,589
cannot even near the ATM and you can get
people to pay

575
00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:10,770
few complications at the moment

576
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:15,210
later come with are about 25 room little
tricky

577
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:19,060
and the picture quality is pretty poor
for the imagine in future

578
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:23,078
how are you that would be

579
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:27,510
so finally but social engineering if you
don't want to do it yourself

580
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:31,260
you can outsource set up call centres
all over the place

581
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:34,820
to your social engineering for you so
that they will

582
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,829
provide you with professional callers
man female

583
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:41,290
any language any age that you want and

584
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:44,520
I'm it's approximately seven to fifteen
dollars

585
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,480
per call so

586
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,290
the whole idea behind this is obviously
and 3d

587
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:56,820
by credit card online but getting a
credit card

588
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,410
what you do with the supplied actually
got useful what you want to do with us

589
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:03,759
if I valuable ok equipment for valuable
things online

590
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,630
and then fell so you've paid two dollars
for your credit card

591
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:10,770
you want to buy a laptop online

592
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,230
maybe the nation's Mac but you want to
sell it for five hundred dollars

593
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:17,980
everyone's got a good to you you may cry
to healthy profit divest

594
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:22,140
but the problem is the credit card is
registered to 77-year-old

595
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,440
Italian lady and you need to call up the
bank

596
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,829
to change the delivery address change
the billing address

597
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:32,480
well chances are I don't see anybody in
here it looks like it or

598
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,810
sounds like a 77-year-old 180 and

599
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:42,240
so what do you think you get what they
call country isn't the case

600
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,460
they got some pretty slick or giant
screens now for you provide the type

601
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,250
avoid their

602
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:50,660
at what age group but you would like the
person to and I can you pay seven

603
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:54,078
fifteen dollars per call so this
particular

604
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:59,570
special call service example and take
calls for twelve dollars

605
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:02,750
a they'll only accept money for full CoV

606
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:07,640
I'm if an operation failed because the
insufficient data provided by the

607
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,500
customer

608
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,800
we hold no responsibility for example a
question

609
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,329
about the cardholder's neighbors as we
don't have this info

610
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:19,550
30 again it's encouraging you to
research more more

611
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:23,490
archer target so that you can increase
chances the

612
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:28,920
called been successful

613
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,720
scareware has been a huge issue over the
past year in particular

614
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,849
we often see the pop-up saying would you
like free

615
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:39,079
anti virus checker your PC and lately

616
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:44,310
what we're seeing in the UK if people
are receiving telephone call

617
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:48,270
saying with no surfaces micro suffering
from two week notice that you've got a

618
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,020
virus on your computer

619
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:53,950
would you like to outsource the
management of your computer to of

620
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:58,260
we'll keep it safe you just have to pay
a small monthly fee

621
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:02,660
on a course to get across or use the
credentials of paint

622
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:06,000
the face but they reckoned that this is
all happening vehicle

623
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,839
countries so if you don't social
engineer directly

624
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:14,589
just outsource this so that's about it

625
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:17,619
for me on at the future social
engineering

626
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:20,880
other going to be the same tricks
repeated again and again

627
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,200
different technology it's become a lot
more sophisticated

628
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,800
I'm a lot more targeted frequently
because I've

629
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,740
social networking pictures provided us
with a whole new attack surf

630
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,640
and so much more information about our
potential targets

631
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,799
there's more more technology that will
help you to improve

632
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,200
are also makes your social engineering
attacks

633
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,339
and now we've got social engineering at
the fair

634
00:39:46,339 --> 00:39:49,640
a course for me that mean for social
engineering has become an even bigger

635
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,970
problem lately

636
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:55,180
and there's going to be a lot more
social engineering test

637
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:59,740
fit for me if you've got any questions I
think I have

638
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,250
a couple minutes I can take

639
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:08,180
okay

640
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:15,180
xisbiga

641
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,039
okay I just keep wondering how many of
you nice girls out there to social

642
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:25,750
engineering some pool

643
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,940
what about you her yes what about you
guys here

644
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:34,390
so many view was sent here by a service

645
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,730
social engineering anyone speak up

646
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:44,730
means safe with us people use social
engineering

647
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,779
all the time came for tuft social
engineer

648
00:40:50,779 --> 00:40:55,000
lady

649
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,049
so how many times have you sold the town

650
00:40:58,049 --> 00:41:01,430
well I give you a good deal and if
you're looking to buy it

651
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:08,430
okay I'm considering I

652
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,200
what's been your best

653
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,450
tax most

654
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:25,800
well I really like to physical

655
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:31,310
ocean engineering actually physically
have to break into for data center

656
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:34,490
because he got such an adrenaline rush
when you're doing

657
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:37,530
I'm a pen tester is well and you know
her name

658
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:42,010
penetration system online you get into a
web application you get

659
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:45,730
both like social engineering when you
have people

660
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:49,190
of tea and the officer in some great
security guards could be right there

661
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:52,880
they may know you're in there from such
a both

662
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,740
I think one of the most fun when they
did

663
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:02,030
and friend you going to take you try and
social engineer

664
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:05,570
first time you do it you really quite
nervous got all the adrenaline

665
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:10,180
for G command you social engineer at you
go out again you think

666
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:14,290
five more races to get that organization
and you get really quite confident you

667
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,190
get a bit cocky

668
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:18,870
so I would be in one place and

669
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:22,370
they were recruiting temporary workers
friend for an event

670
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:26,660
that they were throwing that weekend
perception was very busy

671
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:30,020
people are finding an application form
so I just went

672
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:33,370
their have my laptop with me and

673
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:38,080
I thought there was loath network points
around the room i plug my laptop in 27

674
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:41,990
and they were dead this about three
security guards

675
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:45,010
and reception desk in this room but it
was quite busy

676
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:50,290
fair they didn't think but they had a
computer for the registered everybody

677
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:54,550
coming into the organization and that I
was just out in the middle of the floor

678
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,810
and it was obviously talked into the
network

679
00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:00,450
soco life I could plug my laptop in
there

680
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:04,830
pretty you so I'm racial security guard
said you mind if I check my email

681
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:08,940
there'll only be a second to take a
network cable out for about two min

682
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,290
95% CI no problem at all and he brought
me over a chair

683
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:17,330
I for really like fast

684
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:20,910
I think

685
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:25,190
and for remote attack quite

686
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:28,320
proud to be tucker did for iPhones a

687
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:32,670
on the company website thought they'd
heard from people who entered charity

688
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:33,380
marathon

689
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:37,840
preview week I do it done quite well so
if both an email that looked like it

690
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,350
came from

691
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:42,620
Martha organizers and I said
congratulations to Joanne John

692
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,470
became 89 in the market if you want to
be very kinky

693
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:53,470
taken the talks pretty successful target

694
00:44:04,969 --> 00:44:07,069
get freak

695
00:44:07,069 --> 00:44:11,769
every single time even if it's just a
remote attack

696
00:44:11,769 --> 00:44:15,219
yeah mitigate games causing any

697
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:18,700
Sep point

698
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,719
whatever tax yet

699
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:25,200
you have to be not stop

700
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,549
businesses oh yeah we do and

701
00:44:28,549 --> 00:44:33,809
care for the possible 15 I wasn't enough

702
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:37,130
fashion team meeting six people I was in
the room with them

703
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:40,859
people to confront no one of what I was
doing there

704
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:44,170
so they were having their meeting and
again took the network cable their

705
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:44,839
computer

706
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:49,089
I'm not sure

707
00:44:49,089 --> 00:44:52,349
few for what happened during the meeting
that guy goes %uh

708
00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:57,289
don't have been anymore reading 30 I
think take your network cable but here

709
00:44:57,289 --> 00:44:57,839
you go

710
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:01,808
and he didn't care at all but you do
have to be careful

711
00:45:01,809 --> 00:45:04,930
and you know we have a really tight

712
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:08,558
statement that work that sidelined Doki
what we're going to do what the client

713
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:08,849
wants

714
00:45:08,849 --> 00:45:12,229
to target or occurred two trophies
together

715
00:45:12,229 --> 00:45:15,640
so sometimes they don't even want to
against the network

716
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,499
sometimes might be a case up leaving
from evidence in their

717
00:45:19,499 --> 00:45:24,739
like a sticker thing Sharon here on a
certain date sometimes they want you to

718
00:45:24,739 --> 00:45:28,859
cocaine on simply get an IP address have
been in there

719
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:31,999
or more often than not it's just a
question of

720
00:45:31,999 --> 00:45:35,690
network traffic for 10 min just
proof-of-concept more than anything

721
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:38,969
after awesome same riff any

722
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:45,459
intern and did you ever get Colton

723
00:45:45,459 --> 00:45:48,698
went to jail good toward

724
00:45:48,699 --> 00:45:54,599
at no I haven't been calls it's been
close once or twice and

725
00:45:54,599 --> 00:46:00,890
and one particular occasion that people
in the organization had been warned in

726
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:01,348
advance

727
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:04,869
that we're going to be doing social
engineering to Richard

728
00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:09,059
often tell people not to do because your
software warned in advance

729
00:46:09,059 --> 00:46:13,180
not a realistic tech health real social
engineer with me

730
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:16,819
and I got to this organization

731
00:46:16,819 --> 00:46:20,239
and I made up my excuse for being in
there

732
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:23,900
make that okay but first we'll you have
to go and sit in the security room

733
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:27,190
with the head to security because we're
checking everybody who comes in this

734
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:27,719
week

735
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:31,069
from montana thought this guy and he
said I'm really sorry

736
00:46:31,069 --> 00:46:36,969
to do that for having something this
week social engineering test I fed

737
00:46:36,969 --> 00:46:39,979
boss any

738
00:46:39,979 --> 00:46:43,109
thankfully social engineering was people
reading

739
00:46:43,109 --> 00:46:47,180
dude up

740
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,368
dude so I got tired

741
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:53,589
I'm another time it was pretty close
well tonight

742
00:46:53,589 --> 00:46:57,690
my early days social engineering I
decided I'd pretend to be a fire warning

743
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:58,869
from the local for

744
00:46:58,869 --> 00:47:01,940
and so I went in with my clipboard

745
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:05,359
because sometimes local councils to
disband check to make sure you've got

746
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:06,808
all your fire equipment

747
00:47:06,809 --> 00:47:11,219
and K so I went in and I had the
document printed of comfort would

748
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:12,249
usually help

749
00:47:12,249 --> 00:47:15,900
on their website I went through went
into the office went through take

750
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:16,680
everything off

751
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,249
I often today have if policy and they
said we did but we can't find

752
00:47:21,249 --> 00:47:25,719
so after is gone they decided to bring
the local council to think they had

753
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:28,910
got the policy for stern cuz they
collect understand

754
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:32,879
and that's what I find I thought
impersonation public officials the

755
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,900
don't do that anymore up

756
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,930
yes yes yep

757
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:45,899
just my question just before the break

758
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:52,900
1

759
00:47:57,539 --> 00:47:59,400
d combinations

760
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:06,079
and said yep

761
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,729
and pretty frequently I mean not the
idea

762
00:48:09,729 --> 00:48:14,499
we would like to do because it shows but
any malicious attacker or monitor Street

763
00:48:14,499 --> 00:48:18,049
might be able to do for most realistic
and

764
00:48:18,049 --> 00:48:21,420
there may be one

765
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,499
one in four test that would be a full
attack threatening would just be

766
00:48:25,499 --> 00:48:26,410
restricted to

767
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:30,479
gotten an IP address or if network
traffic something like us

768
00:48:30,479 --> 00:48:34,039
the remote wonder of attack

769
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:37,170
