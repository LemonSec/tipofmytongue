1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,620
of good morning everybody arm thank you
for coming to my talk

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,389
I know it's still early for some people
even early for me um

3
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,419
so many people may be malware it's more
interesting

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,460
and ipv6 wall which we're

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,220
nearly at my first I'm topic of this
talk

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,599
first my name is Marco Rosa

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,810
you might know me from sousa Linux
because I wrote all the insecurity

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,730
stuff in susan i text like this was a
firewall heartening securities

9
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,390
six trips and stuff like that on more

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,430
probably you might know me as a fun
house or 10 Mikes items work programme

11
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,210
hydride

12
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,719
a map in she's getting other stuff like
that um

13
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,129
has anybody have you so all the slides
were even

14
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:51,440
for my talk five years ago an ipv6
security

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,699
anybody now you're still too young to
downright

16
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:59,690
by five years ago and ipv6 okay

17
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,059
what we see here what we see everywhere
yes

18
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:06,720
when we talk about I sixty-something I
think people have

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,330
my topic Star Wars like

20
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,640
in some distant future maybe we will
have have ipv6 hopefully not maybe

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,890
conduct the bullets

22
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:21,080
maybe we'll possibly don't react to it
we can order maybe we'll just wander

23
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,610
away

24
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,740
weekend do stuff that really matters

25
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,970
that's my image I have when when people
talk about ipv6

26
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,150
so hopefully it will not affect us
because we already have

27
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:37,119
enough stuff to do well in reality
there's nothing to touch because already

28
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:37,630
dear

29
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,850
first we talk about the operating
systems and routers and firewalls

30
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,200
stuff they all come ipv6 in a bit since
five six seven years already

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,290
so the ipv6 stuff is already here now
the question is

32
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:54,049
when will I can be 63 come being in
should use to it scare

33
00:01:54,049 --> 00:02:00,850
well next year this is because the big
tackle provider like t-mobile or

34
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,689
even I talk to one guy who works here at
the

35
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:09,420
in a mobile company they said they don't
have my kids anymore

36
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,810
and the more mobile users come with a
mobile phones who wants to be always on

37
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,140
and check your emails

38
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,720
they don't have the IP address for doubt
so what do they need

39
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,940
ipv6 because they don't get no ipv4
addresses additionally I know from

40
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,510
budget to conduct their

41
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,899
currently starting to deploy ipv6
created for business customers

42
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,940
so you don't gots ipv4

43
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,129
internet connections anymore when you go
to try to come but you

44
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:39,190
will start to get ipv6 connections and
same for DSL

45
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:42,950
ninety to 95 percent of all the

46
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,670
you spell internet connection singer
Mick are by Georgia Telcom

47
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,670
all the others I one-and-one free nets
and so on are just a reseller sold out

48
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,700
may also have to introduce ipv6 next
year

49
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,650
that's why they are happy scrambling to
get it running

50
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,300
and now we see some well human nature

51
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:07,150
alright still so far away still so far
away enough time to do stuff

52
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,670
and one maybe 40 fuck now we have to do
something and then you get results like

53
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,420
we see

54
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,470
into stock so

55
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,659
let's start with the basics because I'm
pretty sure not everybody's you strike

56
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:19,390
me six

57
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,170
and should start by saying this is a
technical talk

58
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,610
I'm and I think well it's the first

59
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,810
even the first technique of order
because certain pox of them after this

60
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,319
one will also be all technical

61
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,690
finally so ipv4

62
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,319
that's what we had everybody about has
currently it's four octets we have four

63
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:39,940
billion

64
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,329
possible IP addresses and its on the
bottom its

65
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:47,830
how it IP address might look like it's
an example I hope everybody

66
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,250
no stop night pp. 6 address 16 bytes
long

67
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,830
16 octets I'm I don't know how to
pronounce dis

68
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,939
possible numbers of IP addresses let's
say it could be enough for a while

69
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:06,480
and how it typical I P ipv6 address
looks like it's like top

70
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,510
still pretty short thats that has
reasons

71
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,000
even if its 16 bytes if this is our
example address

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,529
the six 16 bytes

73
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:22,780
are grouped by two bites which are
present in hexadecimal they're separated

74
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,500
by a colon

75
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,729
it set up point forgot

76
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:31,650
not before leading tours are omitted so
it would be serious here is your for

77
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,849
and along the chain of Heroes

78
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:40,600
are replaced with just two columns
because of that the ipv6 address

79
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,380
can look very short even shorter in ipv4
address and related reality it's very

80
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,630
long

81
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,130
submit typical stuff and this is a
standard and this will be

82
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,159
everywhere so this is not just people
technical or

83
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,970
let's say only if you will really do
that everybody will use sixty

84
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,750
slash 64 subnets a single stop

85
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,930
that but you're just my clock in one or
two pcs

86
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:13,009
in other words has the address space of
four billion times the whole internet

87
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:20,009
so every so often is large enough for
for everything we have already

88
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,580
down a broadcast address anymore nothing
like okay I dress a remote broadcast

89
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,258
into some Smurf attacks

90
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:30,600
there are more Picasa dress but you can
only access doesn't want to cuz address

91
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,250
from your local network

92
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,389
so if you want to accept what the costs
addresses from a different network

93
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:37,650
doesn't work

94
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,330
so this has some impact

95
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,669
especially when it comes to remote
scanning

96
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:48,250
if you don't know what IP addresses the
other end using

97
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,800
well how do you find that if the size of
this office is four billion times the

98
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,610
whole internet

99
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,699
the question Yukon just two

100
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:01,889
a broadcast being to make this to make
it easier to find something

101
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:05,740
well because it's not broadcasting so
you really have to test

102
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,289
every IP address not group no broad
cause

103
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:12,330
not the whole something just doesn't
work

104
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,590
that it's one of the issues when does
come for example to penetration testing

105
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,930
ipv6 networks

106
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,340
from remote dell also features one is

107
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,740
of the consecration that something which
my penis pretty cord is plug-and-play

108
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,410
you clock in any fights and you don't
need DHCP because as a DHCP replacement

109
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,789
everything works out of the box

110
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:35,139
you get your get your arm local network
address

111
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:39,030
you get a router or you get to the masts
everything if there's a new router

112
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,190
coming on the network

113
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,340
don't have to come here and everything
is automatic for the climb

114
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,750
everything's autoconfiguration

115
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,270
IPSec is mandatory in the protocols
every device which has ipv6

116
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:55,419
also has IP sec which is also a nice
feature

117
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:58,539
if it ever is introduce a largescale

118
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:04,180
there is no mobility option so this is
not necessarily implemented everywhere

119
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:08,880
which means you can travel with your
laptop keep all your sessions

120
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,819
but trouble in the trench let's say
Russell and Russell your flights

121
00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:16,490
to New York and there you go to
conference while keeping euro

122
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:19,500
telnet sessions life

123
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,800
ASO at least this is what division yes

124
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,819
if it's really possible like that well
but thats the vision

125
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:29,500
ipv6 is a lot about vision hope things
could be when

126
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,460
but it's not really sure if it were
really work out like that

127
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:38,169
because there's not be the deployment on
hold scale for the experience is missing

128
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:41,448
and of course enough addresses for
everybody I think I saw something like

129
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:45,849
every script centimeters on planet Earth
can have 10,000 IP address ipv6

130
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:46,830
addresses

131
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,940
they should really be enough does out an
ipv6 header

132
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:56,419
looks like um if you know how an ipv4
header looks like you will see

133
00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:00,370
go out this looks easy this look simple

134
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:06,120
wheres all the stuff of course yes
source in this nation this is larger

135
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,419
but beside that where's all the other
stuff and now the interesting question

136
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:13,639
what is the stuff which is missing

137
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,870
yes one thing which is missing is the IP

138
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,650
Iddi identification field um first
there's no heckling

139
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,770
anymore the reason hatteras is now fixed

140
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,289
I could before its dynamic so if you
have options take

141
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:31,580
the header can be larger is best for
alters a course that never know

142
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,708
if they receive a packet what is part of
the what is part of the header what is

143
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:37,310
part of the data they are not interested
in

144
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:42,039
to know it's fixes 40 bytes there's no
one to pick identification

145
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,290
up field anymore simply because they
thought

146
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,939
it's not needed now now after 25 years
of

147
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,740
ipv4 Internet we see was interest

148
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,980
interesting idea and in the beginning
but we saw it was not needed

149
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,940
so we can drop it from ipv6 there is no
check some anymore

150
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,820
and not before there's the checks on on
the ipv4 header

151
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,990
now it's at the Internet it's a reliable
enough

152
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,250
if we don't meet up and if there's a
check some it's done by the upper layer

153
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,550
so TCP ICMP ICP now ICP version 6

154
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:22,459
as mandatory check some so it's only
UTPA where check summers

155
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:27,600
optional and the check some include
source and destination

156
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,120
and the next header there is no
fragmentation

157
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,170
header and now it's interesting question

158
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:40,069
state and fragmentation ipv6 Austin
Texas know what's that also

159
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:44,000
said to be unnecessary we're confident

160
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,320
and there are no options because then
again they had a weird

161
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,890
would not be fixed shift so every option
is an extension header

162
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,069
extension header is what is new an ipv6

163
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,830
everything which is not absolutely
basically necessary for

164
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:02,790
routing a packet from A to B is optional
an optional means it's an extension

165
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,480
headers Hatter of it on

166
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,779
which lies between ipv6 header anti

167
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:11,140
she's a beauty better had a

168
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,490
Andheri of lots of stuff fragmentation

169
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,430
because not every packet must be
fragmented so it make sense to make this

170
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,959
option to put it into any take letter
saw started coming

171
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:25,190
is coming back now we have sauce writing

172
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:30,860
back in ipv6 IQ sec destination options
hope i helped as a lot of other stuff

173
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:36,079
so there's quite some hatteras

174
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,810
this is how it a packet can look like it
has multiple extension headers we have

175
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,110
the ipv6 header

176
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,220
there it's eight next header is the
routing header which is the

177
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,980
source routing header now next heresy
fragmentation Heather because it

178
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:53,589
the package spectrum entered and then
would be the Yuki header plus

179
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:59,160
the first part of the day tre this is
how an ipv6 packet can look like if they

180
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,649
are

181
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:05,110
arm more extension headers

182
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,399
so if we look at that it looks much

183
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,399
Center if you compare ipv4 ipv6

184
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,839
ipv4 this peak after so many options
what do you do

185
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,240
this is way sumpter so it should of
course be

186
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,420
more secure because we have all the
experience with ipv4

187
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:29,360
ipv6 just we learn from our mistakes it
made it better and

188
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,899
archer and the features we might need in
the future

189
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:36,000
so everything should be fine right well

190
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,870
just in theory as we can already start
by seeing about

191
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,510
while they are extension headers week
mites

192
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:47,649
assume that it's not so simple as it
seems in the first place

193
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:51,600
for example an extension Adam H

194
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,910
be there only ones on me is its legal to
have

195
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,630
true sold starting as a sort of
fragmentation headers

196
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,800
in what order made the trek make the
difference

197
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,410
extension headers maybe what options are
to: for

198
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,819
extension headers recorded numerous
options for every of this

199
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,329
extension headers and in this way
restarts

200
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:16,649
is just the start with things that
complex so ipv6

201
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:21,519
is reality so much more complex night
before

202
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,850
did even all the RT designers of the
ipv6 protocols and

203
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,000
sup protocols and stuff and they're
writing all they are clever are obscene

204
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,570
stuff

205
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:35,440
are overlooking water abilities even
from all the necessary and ipv4

206
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,019
so this is a reason why there are lots
of our abilities and desist just the

207
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:40,760
stuff which is in CV

208
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,310
now where there's a CD Co registration
over on our ability

209
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,360
well as the 2002 there were 21 abilities

210
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,500
yeah but you see its growing cause more
implementation but also more awareness

211
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,130
and more

212
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,600
security testers

213
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:02,170
on this what is currently in 2010 but
the problem is if you adjust for CB

214
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:07,329
now you get a number but not but the
number is just being published once you

215
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:11,410
as as researchers say now you can make
it public which means usually off to fix

216
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,709
the stair

217
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:16,130
look even in fee from March April of
2011

218
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,380
there will be new CPE which has 2010 at

219
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,439
in there now so this is why

220
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,170
this is the expected cap washes what is
still in there and

221
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,269
it's not copy my own CD entries because
I still have to make them which would be

222
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:30,560
three or four

223
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,440
at so this will even spike larger than
out

224
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,290
so kids in 2005

225
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:44,069
I did already in presentation on my ipv6
security research

226
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,899
now I will shawty Redd up really
shocking about 20 percent dear

227
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:51,510
and present use to of course your
because

228
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:55,000
used up it all

229
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,500
the wall surrounds a toolkit I'm
programming because when I started

230
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,560
drinkin 56

231
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,730
I want to do some security testing and
noticed don't know tools

232
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,600
I want to see how disrupts I wanted
create that packet and about no

233
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,320
to love able to do that even the most
basic attacks notable

234
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,990
even today lucky and Matt can at least
to connect Canton ipv6

235
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,529
and we have to meet us but with which
has ipv6 support

236
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:22,260
beyond thats still after five years

237
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,300
stairs one more man in the middle to
which implements the stuff

238
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,449
I already implemented five years ago so
you know no new stuff and that's it

239
00:14:29,449 --> 00:14:32,750
now so every everything in my research
really

240
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,089
walls about that whole kit which
contains no I think

241
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:41,420
35 tools so good luck examine my took it
because you just feel well

242
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,230
all the stuff which is invariant not the
best documentation

243
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,589
like that so first what we know and I
before as

244
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:51,670
arc scooping we also have not been
sticks

245
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:56,639
there's not the our protocol anymore
it's done by up ICMP 6

246
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,940
I'm types you it's called neighbor
discovery spoofing

247
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,699
ever expect same instead of this and are
request

248
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:10,490
you sense neighbor solicitation ICMP
request to the network

249
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,680
you the system which has to I'm

250
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,959
IP address you are asking for is
responding with a neighbor

251
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,670
advertisement back which has the mac
address

252
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,100
well of course anybody can also for such
a request so

253
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,230
we have a tool which is called parasite
six which that's exactly it out

254
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,690
this is on the network into every sold
solicitation request which comes

255
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,800
its moves your own Mac or retin a Mac

256
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,019
or fix Mac which is not on the net for
gas I like it

257
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:43,930
now we have to pick a two-track address
detection dos this is so something also

258
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,120
already have an ipv4

259
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,230
just that duplicate address detection is
not done by many systems

260
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:53,470
in ipv6 its mandatory

261
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:58,870
so was it what does that mean well it's
also done by name a solicitation just so

262
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,190
the system wants to use new ipv6 address

263
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,500
so it sends a message on the network was
ICMP same type never solicitation

264
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,139
request

265
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:11,519
who has decided he addressed because I
want to use it

266
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,199
sensor the network and if there's no
reply from the network the system knows

267
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,130
okay nobody's using IP address

268
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:20,990
I can use it so it is not to duplicate
on the network

269
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,339
again Houches recommend to securities
just check

270
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:27,870
is create a tool which sets always yes

271
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,850
I'm using that IP address I'm using that
IP address I'm using that IP address

272
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,889
apso denying all in your system's its IP
address connectivity

273
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:39,300
even works for existing systems but for
example some three hours

274
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,509
effetti texas' on a cute resin used
shuts down

275
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:46,180
to interface so even for existing

276
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,860
for life system already on it for you
can now the net for excess

277
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,220
even with Windows it works

278
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,050
it's totally okay if you ask questions
in between I'm fine with that

279
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,029
yes Rafi

280
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:06,650
you can also deny it repeat the question

281
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:11,789
she doesn't neighbor solicitation what i
do. just

282
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:15,049
it the one dated the mac Address

283
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:19,530
I 6 yep its every machine comes as ipv6
address

284
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,280
automatic but it's just link local
address right so

285
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,859
every she should have a unique addressed
yet but as his death has to be some

286
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,900
solicited because

287
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,530
guess address book already been used
this is why the source addresses

288
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:35,399
unspecified so there's no IP address and
the request

289
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,130
which it of course where what's the
system since the onset was

290
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,620
is to everybody so the on sir which
destroyed ascending

291
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,410
work to do and system which already had
using his address to send

292
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:50,460
everybody does address is in use but
theoretically matters

293
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,080
should be unique world should see me
ideas especially if there's somebody

294
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,840
evil

295
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,590
or if he was for example privacy option
the privacy of generates randomly

296
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:04,490
every day a new ipv6 address and then
has to check his address is already in

297
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:04,840
use

298
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,189
because more systems and more the higher
chance X

299
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,919
in 10 years as one coalition

300
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,900
on you can demand the middle with
redirects redirect already broken I

301
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,500
seems

302
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,100
in ipv4 you also have tonight I PV six

303
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,490
I'm in the good thing about the redirect
the tax I before and ipv6

304
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,600
um they work by default

305
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,650
because security redirect are always a
neighbor if its windows with Linus does

306
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,390
matter

307
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:35,710
if redirect are secure secure means it
comes from your default draw for

308
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,860
and it contains a real packet the victim
is what sending

309
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,070
then the redirect accepted by the system
and this is

310
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:46,439
really easy to follow on look up my
slights from

311
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,350
five years ago its all explained here
and there's a to redirect 6

312
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:53,980
I think for ipv6 does matter implants
are out wonderful

313
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,110
I'm 26 just more secure in that regard
to take only works

314
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,860
locally on the local om now on ipv6

315
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,650
ipv4 it works from the other end of the
world

316
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:08,299
if you know what the address of the
Deepwater otters

317
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:11,730
that we have DHCP or better bought a
conflagration because this is what

318
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,809
originally

319
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:17,149
they want to remove exercise with JCP we
are cool people

320
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,720
we do everything out of the box on the
networks autoconfiguration

321
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,650
nobody wanted to pee anymore which works
with the router advertisements

322
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,320
still do you have a router and the
router Edward Hines on the network I'm

323
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,439
here

324
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,700
I'm unknown see I'm the responsible
router for Dish Network

325
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,270
this is the IP range from which you
should choose yourself

326
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:41,210
your IP address you want to help if you
want to if you want to use internet

327
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,250
services

328
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,669
yep you to resolve the DNS so

329
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:48,730
this is done all by the router

330
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:53,370
but what happens if there's if you set
up your own Roger

331
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,049
yes a feature which which is about not a
priority and by default

332
00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:00,600
all rotor steps a priority to medium

333
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,020
if I start my own fake routing
advertisements

334
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,340
demand on the network says my priority
is high

335
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,649
I will be the default

336
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,860
so this is 50 percent of my talk from

337
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:19,270
five years ago but let me continue on
the router advertisement because tests

338
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,000
how much you can do except

339
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,720
just with that stuff yeah kick the
default route has a debt default on you

340
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,890
don't want to that the phone right to
exist anymore for the target easy

341
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:33,010
you sent your own daughter retirement so
you will be the router of the roots

342
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:36,789
so it is already in the work that's what
if you're already routing table but is

343
00:20:36,789 --> 00:20:39,289
still the default order for whatever
reason

344
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:42,799
you spoof router advertisement from the
default router

345
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,490
but with us your own lifetime because
project advertise it has a lifetime so

346
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,030
how

347
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:51,460
long this disorder active in if no new
road record highs incomes

348
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,480
then considered as roger is that now

349
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:59,679
so you spoof a route which question sets
your lifetime which means oh I'm that

350
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,450
so just to be sure you're really the
default all two of two routes you send

351
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,210
again your own router advertisement

352
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:10,100
this router is dat as long as it doesn't
send its own daughter

353
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,110
advertisement again and your default
route and the default or it doesn't

354
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:18,820
exist anymore for target

355
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,530
I'm we coming back to this point

356
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,740
because you could say okay but if you
spot the router advertisement

357
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,610
the default talkable C-dot and can react
on that

358
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:33,610
I show you later four different kind of
a trick techa

359
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:38,890
on a different protocol how I can do it
at that the router doesn't see that

360
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:43,440
can all routers which are on the network
and the the target systems will think

361
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:43,840
that

362
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,949
all internet is local is

363
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,429
in the proper collection I haven't tried
it is really works but it's in the RC

364
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:51,730
and it has to be implemented

365
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,440
otherwise in systems are see Compline on

366
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,280
that if there is no router on the
network to find

367
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:03,340
everything is local issue because I
might be right over just picks up the

368
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,750
traffic and forward through the right
direction

369
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:10,620
so it's another it's a if something
doesn't work because of product price

370
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,950
when this somehow

371
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:16,330
except by system everything can still
work

372
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,990
I'm another sing which happens if you
send out a router advertisement is

373
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,020
that all the system stop being UAL stock

374
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,220
the already are ipv4 they have to at
least six capability

375
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,679
there just waiting for our truck with
highs which showed up a I could be six

376
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:34,240
okay here and wants to offer advertisers
receive

377
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,070
they are dual spec ipv4 and ipv6 never
did use both

378
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,649
what could probably go wrong here

379
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,710
um you can port can I could be six now

380
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:49,530
so one you say and acknowledged his rock
advertise on a comp

381
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:53,840
the system config was its ipv6 address
you can scan it ipv6 address

382
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,289
by duplicate address detection you know
what the new IP addresses its choosing

383
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:02,270
and imports cannot and as I can before
it's a different IP spec and ipv6

384
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,600
you must have filter also ipv6 otherwise
turn off its rules

385
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,340
when you can port scan all ports without
if I win fire warning in between a port

386
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,639
filtering

387
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,820
it will prefer ipv6 so if it does Tues
requests under an ipv4 and ipv6

388
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,510
addresses received it must use

389
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:23,929
the ipv6 address so

390
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:27,309
how about on

391
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:32,010
trade the tunnel so you're really IQ's
you really implement ipv6 connectivity

392
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,900
and pollen all the ipv6 traffic through
you

393
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,039
and sniff everything or announced

394
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,270
a remote network address space like Pay
Pal locally on the network with the room

395
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:46,470
remote at router advertisement so if it

396
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:50,070
if a system wants to connect to pay pal
disputing think 0

397
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:53,529
that network's local cool habitats your
system

398
00:23:53,529 --> 00:23:58,770
says lots of stuff you can't you just
without replacement

399
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:03,418
um what you can also do is project which
has been flooding

400
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:07,380
actually dad was something why was
thinking I mean of course

401
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,830
if system config curious its IP address
based on the prefix a router is

402
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,178
announcing that this is a network here

403
00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:17,940
and you can have multiple IP addresses
can have 10-15 IP addresses

404
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,929
on my PC is no problem at all and it's
normal that you have 3 45 ipv6 addresses

405
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:26,100
that is how its design um

406
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,700
the next step what happens if I simulate

407
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,700
10,000 rogers & all announcing different
networks 30

408
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,740
ten different I peter is accomplished
what does happen

409
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,360
so for me let's say that hackers
security researchers mind

410
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,169
that's just the next step it's very easy
to come up with that

411
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:48,980
with that idea so what could probably go
wrong with vendors

412
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,070
ap use all the affected operating system

413
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:58,289
which when you started texting 110 100
percent CPU load 100 percent RAM usage

414
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:01,940
so they doing nothing anymore

415
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,270
ap Cisco and the Cisco PIX all Cisco US

416
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,400
Windows 2008 Windows 7's mendosa

417
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,260
westall Linux but really old maybe more

418
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,419
that's just what I tested now

419
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:19,840
how can that be you must be local on the
network

420
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,220
because that's where all to read what I
type receive so here for example at the

421
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,100
conference

422
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,890
you can just win everybody of you who is
using Windows

423
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:32,700
would not be able to do anything yeah
until turning off

424
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,720
rebooting and having same problem again

425
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,940
so what the vendors to what they fix

426
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,100
just could just fix it for the IRS

427
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,950
this is the box fix-it for the IRS I'm
in awe that is coming soon

428
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:50,700
I was told next week in two weeks this
is the book that you put up

429
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,990
and Microsoft it's not a problem

430
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,260
we implemented like its in the standard
so

431
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,990
if it's in the standard it must be okay
if our system's out

432
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:04,809
not accessible anymore 100% CPU percent
if you use

433
00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:10,460
wall is that our problem

434
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,320
up Apple is not affected by the way

435
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,700
today got that thing right Linux doesn't
that's Cisco fix it but

436
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,510
Microsoft is not a problem unbelievable

437
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,990
yeah I'm some jerk sets five years ago

438
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:29,309
because of his vast IP space injustice
of net

439
00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:33,529
and because we don't have brought costs
and stuff um it is not possible to

440
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:34,390
remote

441
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:39,159
life or ping scan on ipv6 networks

442
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:42,390
the drug was me okay I admit

443
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:47,789
up by doing some organization I came up
with some ideas some %uh very

444
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:51,730
easy to come up with um but actually I
needed some

445
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:55,159
research on that's a statistic research
how to get a

446
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:58,240
call can we identify remote systems in
ipv6

447
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,289
first weekend not scan the whole range

448
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:04,820
now if its four billion times the whole
internet it doesn't work

449
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:08,520
ap it would take even if you could send
what one hundred million packets per

450
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,470
second

451
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:13,320
it would take 10 years just for that one
topic well maybe just one or two systems

452
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,110
are there

453
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:18,279
stuff he's down a broadcast so we can do
that

454
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:21,470
what is up to you obvious what we can do

455
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:25,140
we can you search engines public
databases for example how we can

456
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,669
check the web page of a company to see

457
00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:32,130
what ipv6 Day half

458
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:36,679
we can look in the DNS so we can do it
again as brute forcing

459
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:39,480
we can see what is the main exchange
with the name server and see if they

460
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,970
have ipv6 addresses their

461
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:44,090
and we can look for common addresses

462
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:48,020
and becoming up and if you combine them
all

463
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:52,658
maybe there's a chance we will identify
some systems

464
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:57,320
so I was interested in how many systems
are to

465
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,399
if I combine these soul

466
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,980
I look into a search engine done various
ipv6 directors what's needed some

467
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,860
I'm webshop not packing but let's say
weary many population

468
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,440
I'm so I could generate 40 14006 I do

469
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,929
51 possible demands plus sub-domains

470
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:21,490
and did you test brute forcing attack

471
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:25,169
so I took everything off every domain I
found its up to man

472
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:28,440
boolfalse 3,000 possible hoskins so I
use

473
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,760
what our usual ha spends the night
before I added some I took the

474
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,100
put the one for me just by tax put got
some

475
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,140
work text files and put him also in
there so three thousand real of

476
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:43,070
on and at home 40,000 DNS entries

477
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:46,918
well the point is if you're looking for
VPN

478
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:51,169
as a host name and you're just went for
BP n what are your results

479
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:55,659
results is the results are everything is
the penultimate

480
00:28:55,659 --> 00:29:00,419
engine Internet of course because you're
just looking for bpm

481
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:04,110
so this might not be the right approach
to talk about

482
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:07,330
what are common hostage because if
you're just looking for up now we will

483
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:07,928
just see

484
00:29:07,929 --> 00:29:11,559
www but what we can do we get the

485
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:16,260
from the DNS entries these are about the
process which is good at the moment

486
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:22,710
we find the IP address but on the ipv6
addresses now we can do statistics

487
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:27,549
ASO iPhone 14456 you to get sick the
dresses

488
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:31,679
in twelve thousand nine hundred
forty-two networks

489
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,970
and 5,000 434 unique host addresses

490
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:38,909
which means unique host addresses the
host part

491
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:42,200
so if you have a c-class network the
most common

492
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,860
host party dresses dot wall now

493
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:50,909
well assets less texty for softness mean
you have

494
00:29:50,909 --> 00:29:54,750
four billion times your internet as
possible host addresses

495
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:59,159
getting down to just for 5400 values
being used

496
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:02,890
it's not a large space so to say

497
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:06,130
so is a seed distribution of host
addresses

498
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:09,240
USC terrace 1

499
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,260
common address which was used about
1,000 eight hundred times

500
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,330
in this is or suppress 1

501
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:19,740
answer and so on and so on so what you
can create is

502
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,600
addiction Neri list for a host addresses
ipv6

503
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,840
and if you look at this he will see okay
this is fair

504
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,250
things go slowly but up to here it's
very effective

505
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,740
with just a few checks you find a lot of
systems

506
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,860
missus here at about a range of 700-800

507
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:40,419
so but just checking $7,800

508
00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:43,590
700-800 ipv6 host addresses

509
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:48,320
on a subnet will find many many systems

510
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:54,590
statistically

511
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:59,909
if it's the first one of its randomly i
coming to

512
00:30:59,909 --> 00:31:04,480
on host address and I'll analysis so
when I got the

513
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,390
5,000 for 34 unique host addresses I was
doing okay

514
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:11,789
what hardy's host addresses where did it
come from

515
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:15,149
of course some come from
autoconfiguration which is based on the

516
00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:16,240
mac address

517
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,539
so the vendor ID is

518
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:23,129
let's say come to some are contoured by
hand

519
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:27,330
and others a concert by DHCP because
some people still use DHCP for

520
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,428
management reasons

521
00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:34,360
so autoconfiguration here it's based on
the mac address

522
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,049
or the privacy option or it's a fix
random because a different kinds and how

523
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:38,980
you can implement a

524
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,750
and its on many operations you can
choose

525
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:46,200
which of the three types one how um

526
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,630
if it's done by hand its I the random or
by a pattern

527
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:53,299
the pattern would be one to 34

528
00:31:53,299 --> 00:31:56,700
bought 1000 1000 2003

529
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,940
and we have tips to keep disappearing
you define the pool

530
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,760
and all the implementation I review they
give out the IP address

531
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,269
sequential which makes life easier

532
00:32:07,269 --> 00:32:10,640
so if you get got one system which is in
the DHCP

533
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,169
space address space just look below an
offer with net address space

534
00:32:15,169 --> 00:32:19,480
got it so what I don't implement its

535
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,799
in mine scanning tool of

536
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,049
sorry forgot so here operation the mac
Address

537
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:29,049
24-bit key space usually prevent your ID

538
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:32,870
which is possible to do its like a class

539
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:36,850
a networks can privacy option fix random

540
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:41,289
no way its its its true random by hand

541
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:44,779
well if there's a pattern of course once
you identify with the pattern is

542
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:48,019
piece of cake if it's done random

543
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:51,909
well that and of course the ACP again
it's easy

544
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:55,279
so I'm fermented by hand

545
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,409
the patterns identified and the DHCP

546
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:01,480
usually H CP ranges

547
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,690
and if bought a conflagration is
detected equal

548
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:08,510
what country at the home ec address
range so because if you have one server

549
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,149
by let's say

550
00:33:09,149 --> 00:33:12,940
HP or Dell you might have more service
by HP and Dell

551
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,500
so just the the loft bite three bites

552
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,740
might be different so that's that's
what's interesting tool

553
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:24,440
also searched space so if you configure
something by hand his example

554
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,440
what are people are usually doing now
123

555
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,840
the service port support 84 web for
example 5314 s over

556
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,820
or one the service port 23 two and three
and four

557
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:40,980
to have more of them or service bought
colon 123

558
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:44,240
some museum the ipv4 address yeah so

559
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,840
88 call on one call on 23

560
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,390
call on 24 so if you know the ipv4
address

561
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:54,919
you know exactly what to scan for and
some funny stuff like

562
00:33:54,919 --> 00:34:01,049
Bay that be foo and so on and so on

563
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:05,379
this are the common yet appear anxious
so if you use DHCP

564
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,450
s 6 which comes with liners or I

565
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:11,819
example configuration and stuff this is

566
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,730
what you will see they also added the
first part

567
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:19,500
each into my scanning tool and this is

568
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,820
what the distribution is like now
autoconfiguration

569
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,440
is just part which is larger pipe on

570
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,399
ipv4 addresses it's not so often random
good luck

571
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,690
is relatively rare and the heart

572
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:37,020
to guess addresses all also pretty large
but

573
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:40,699
dis large piece of the pie

574
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,119
is what we can guess which is roughly

575
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:47,369
66 percent so

576
00:34:47,369 --> 00:34:51,379
my life's going on the 12,000 where
roughly 13,000

577
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:56,299
all networks with good for them to
thought possible host addresses

578
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,540
wealth of 380,000 a life addresses

579
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:03,820
some firewall twice can't on paying
night the decision

580
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,930
San on port ATV you TP a real

581
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:10,810
UT at the end supp pick it apart 53 and
stuff

582
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:15,460
yank up more unique Austin networks um
from the population you can see

583
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:19,230
that I'm still missing some of the
possible hope I'm addresses

584
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:22,570
so as to the still pretty steep

585
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:25,640
and not arm not a platform

586
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:29,230
there's still more I can identify so I'm
pretty sure until my next

587
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:33,710
Park course this is just scrapped
because after it was someone some

588
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:37,190
speaker didn't get his visa can you talk
so I'm not really done already with the

589
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,500
research

590
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:43,400
on I'm pretty strike up to 70 75 percent

591
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,849
so you live scanning I did the same on
the

592
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:50,079
on the river stuff so every worst all
the DNS entries

593
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,400
I got the knesset entries all the live
system

594
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,680
and got 13220 s entries

595
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,328
now the unit cost him so interesting
because no I could see

596
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:04,280
okay these are you our host the host
names and units which are used

597
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,859
so i cant fetus again into my DNS good
forcing

598
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:12,569
for hostnames I didn't have been before
because I see what is really used

599
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:16,320
and then you get no ipv6 addresses you
can check does new host address is

600
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,109
coming up and so on and so on

601
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:23,069
so what you have here its roof approach
until we have all the ipv6 host names

602
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:25,210
which are usually used in all the host
addresses

603
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:30,740
of ipv6 measure Houston you get very
good be a very detailed picture of

604
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:35,670
statistically how you have to perform
your net remote networks can to find

605
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:39,400
most systems as possible so in
conclusion

606
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,710
just by the US Food forcing to fight
ninety percent of the system's

607
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:49,710
in which are in the DNS on ever rich

608
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:57,740
up

609
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,570
yet but I'm only checking for the
reverse DNS and that's where base

610
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:12,040
stuff but it's not 100 percent because
what people it put the in the DNS

611
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,550
ap out sorry another such I'm not
academic I don't care for academic stuff

612
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:19,760
I check for real work stuff and it's
good enough for me we can talk in

613
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,160
we have gone in

614
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,649
um with a lifeboat forcing I see real
systems I can see what is on the

615
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:28,460
networks

616
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,960
now so I can see if what I found here is
real life handedness

617
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,220
real life is good say 66 percent on
average

618
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:39,880
can be found and if you combine both
Washington DNS and what you can get from

619
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,210
the life system

620
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:46,070
and now it's getting really very hard to
say but it's rock in nineteen knife

621
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:49,240
90 to 95 percent on Everett's

622
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:52,410
which means on some systems you will not
find anything

623
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:56,029
and others he will be 100 percent is
just average

624
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:59,570
on the average network but we have a lot
more stuff now

625
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:02,910
attack on what the cost is a discovery
protocol howdy nine with the cost

626
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,598
traffic

627
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:07,740
um works like that the router sense
politically

628
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,849
general query messages a who wants to
listen to what the cost

629
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:13,950
and everyone wants to listen to a
monthly cost

630
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:19,440
addressed says I i'm I want to have
someone to cast the nests over traffic

631
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,010
and then the router foster other also
whenever there's skin as well because

632
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,099
traffic tends to the network

633
00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:29,180
on what you can as a hacker to you sent
done message

634
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:32,750
done message means I don't want to
listen

635
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:36,180
to the more the custom s tough anymore

636
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:40,149
is proof that s 8 and the router now
things okay he doesn't want to listen

637
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,550
anymore

638
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,070
their security in the protocol that when
that happens

639
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:49,180
the router sense again a message was is
it's really nobody wants to listen on

640
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,700
this anymore

641
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,849
and a wouldn't say a still want to
listen so

642
00:38:53,849 --> 00:38:57,480
this doesn't work um

643
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,099
what we want to be is just query router
we want to become that we want to

644
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:02,140
eliminate this one

645
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:05,420
and be the query Roger there something
the protocol because after multiple

646
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,829
routers on the network only one should
be the creamy rotor

647
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:12,300
so the decision process for Secure
Router is

648
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,680
who has the lower mathematically ipv6

649
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,049
link local address

650
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:23,070
so before school Jenna query message

651
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:27,770
or on clear images as this address which
is the lowest possible address

652
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:31,190
have never seen it configured anywhere
never ever

653
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:34,780
so you will always be the clear over
afterwards

654
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:41,010
den you spoof the done message for a

655
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:46,589
well what happens it does just 20 bucks
for a very short period of time

656
00:39:46,589 --> 00:39:49,670
because if you as its Corey rotted do
not

657
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:53,920
sent just sent a clear message from time
to time

658
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,130
um the other offer will become active
again is that with the query is gone now

659
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,760
I have to send a message

660
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,990
so still enough security the protocol

661
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:06,160
on so ima send in general analytic you

662
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,220
clearly message regulary but Inouye

663
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:14,099
did only distraught just use it and the
target doesn't see it

664
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:17,990
so how can this work and then

665
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:21,579
few nights ago I had stayed here I just
school cream in touch with

666
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:24,700
especial mac Address don't want to cuz
mac Address

667
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:29,660
what the cosmic address is specified who
can receive that message

668
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:33,000
and if you send is with you what the
cost all right to make a dress

669
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,369
only the routers will pick it up even if
the IP address

670
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:40,369
is for all the systems

671
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:45,040
and this way is cool first gen a clear
message to become the query

672
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,259
monster school done message

673
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,010
for the system and then sent the cream
is from time to time but with that

674
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:52,819
special naked

675
00:40:52,819 --> 00:40:56,300
only the router accepts it

676
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:00,369
but the target missile doesn't and that
way you come pick and pull completely

677
00:41:00,369 --> 00:41:01,290
disable the

678
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:05,230
with the cops routing into that part of
the network

679
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:09,520
but there's more um in 1998

680
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,780
kids in 1998 I found vulnerability
online us waken

681
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:18,250
see on that on the local network if
Linux host for sniffing

682
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:22,859
and guess what on Wednesday night from
the same vulnerability in ipv6

683
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:28,598
and Linux and Windows again so re
implementing on one abilities

684
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:33,010
you sent a ping to the charger and I
just want the cosmic address

685
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:36,329
if you just use any mecca dress doesn't
work it must be more to cost a dress

686
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:40,010
the system should not be listening to
but it was too sleepy time for

687
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:43,710
any suffer like that is activated on the
Windows or Unix Linux machine

688
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:49,230
if you prefer lies with the pink and you
know specific

689
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:52,690
are any side channels ipv6 another BEC

690
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:55,800
wall is the question I V six is

691
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,400
side-channel especially if that's how I
was in between

692
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,579
the problem is that with all the
extension headers file vendors contre

693
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:06,030
filter on the continent extension
headers

694
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:09,800
I talk was just about the property is
set because she is constantly design

695
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,069
changes because to come to the pit what
comes texas tender

696
00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:17,290
the conference on content and extension
headers you know a few things which are

697
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:21,859
evil known evil that that's what it
feels about everything problem through

698
00:42:21,859 --> 00:42:26,430
so you can send hold both work files
just an extension header ouch

699
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:30,430
through the final and econ prevent it

700
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:33,649
so if you have a few talk was such a
texan ipv6

701
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:37,810
it's just someone who think got a boring
talk because at

702
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:41,410
too many ways you can with ipv6 but in
the end

703
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:46,740
don't be scared with a goods Design Inc
which security infrastructure you sign

704
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,930
on ipv6

705
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:51,069
you can eliminate lots all the stuff

706
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:54,210
that not everything for Tekken wiki to
deploy at you sec

707
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:59,220
IPSec totally and completely and stuff
but im with smaller stuff you can

708
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:03,829
to fuck some secure host configuration
and eliminate some of the stuff

709
00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:08,270
um yes I V six is very complex its
intellectual challenge the more you look

710
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:10,960
into it the more you understand how
complex it is

711
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,980
and if your time if you're seeing
security search in your tired of finding

712
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:18,619
security will be some stuff nobody cares
about like guess book

713
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:22,770
PHP application for bars 0 dot one beat
up

714
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:27,589
now and you really want to find spun
ability stuff which is rather easy

715
00:43:27,589 --> 00:43:31,390
because lots of stuff but also which
have meaning

716
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:35,240
so interesting one abilities I'm 26
stuff they should go to

717
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:40,400
so be an explorer so much so many
protocols

718
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,400
100 people can study on and still find
different vulnerabilities and issues

719
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,520
so join me join researching ipv6

720
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,720
it also makes people in protocol more
secure in the end that what

721
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,980
actors to criticized so things can be
made better

722
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:59,040
so here's an example you can see in this
his late in space if you want to play

723
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,839
with i believe how to get into your home

724
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:05,460
inquiries to see how easy process is and
other you have a static town or happy

725
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,730
child to your home

726
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:10,880
despotic on Flickr local Jeffrey like a
g6 on you local network

727
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,300
on list of everything which is new

728
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,470
in I my ipv6 attack toolkit which is

729
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:20,700
lot of a lot of stuff books um

730
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,579
it's not a publicly is still because I'm
still developing lots of the stuff

731
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:28,700
so it's not complete but anybody was
tense and patches a new tools gets gets

732
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,089
full access

733
00:44:31,089 --> 00:44:34,490
also I don't want lots of people to scan
the internet now when are you too when

734
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:37,819
I'm still do my research and see what
are good addresses

735
00:44:37,819 --> 00:44:40,869
but I will do soon smaller optic

736
00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:44,660
complete stuff so this reckon on the
tool

737
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:47,960
after Christmas I will enable web sites
here

738
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,050
where you can find all information on
how secure leak on Flickr a PIX how to

739
00:44:51,050 --> 00:44:53,910
secure a Windows host to make its

740
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:58,710
to protect against ipv6 the text of how
to do remote pen test and things

741
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:03,940
um yeah and if you need any if you have
any idea to six metres you say I want an

742
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,390
external consultant help me design it or

743
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:10,069
Penn tested or PS review this file for
the first two innings drop

744
00:45:10,069 --> 00:45:14,349
well ask me thank you

745
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:18,280
we still have time for questions we have
time for questions

746
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:23,599
three minutes yes three minutes first
question of mines on this

747
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:30,440
talk on ipv6 disability of addresses
will mean we will see something like

748
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,460
I'm cricket papa's words which are
tested for ipv6 addresses

749
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:38,280
school so that probably what of my was

750
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,800
referring to that statistically looking
at that

751
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,210
will lead lots of matches but is

752
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:50,520
people choose clever ipv6 addresses are
listed on the ruse

753
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,869
scores and that's also why I'm doing
this presentation

754
00:45:54,869 --> 00:45:59,050
to make you aware don't make it too easy
if you have to put this possibility to

755
00:45:59,050 --> 00:45:59,810
make a trend

756
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:04,000
do it random I mean that's the point

757
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,520
any more questions

758
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,430
longer before you start talking I don't
ever discuss want to proceed and miss

759
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:14,480
mathematically

760
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,339
what so ever I'm nothing official guy
actually I'm or the practical

761
00:46:19,339 --> 00:46:22,569
key something different regarding a
rogue

762
00:46:22,569 --> 00:46:26,829
arsenals man's it lies from me

763
00:46:26,829 --> 00:46:30,010
this doesn't have to be some you guys
make

764
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:35,460
features someone's two regions laptop
comes to you

765
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,710
vision for natural uses

766
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:42,599
times miles place Roger your own

767
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:46,480
so this happens real large

768
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,980
altman's tens that somebody please drop

769
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:53,619
so Iran 6 trudge

770
00:46:53,619 --> 00:46:56,960
local times

771
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,900
look at different roles your chin

772
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:06,609
so numbers from before

773
00:47:06,609 --> 00:47:10,000
what's your your

774
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,560
overall comment life

775
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,750
six holes all your numbers you can

776
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,950
phone this many real life

777
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:25,710
people extras makes

778
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:30,480
numbers times percentage s have to
restructure some

779
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,910
or totality life 26

780
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:37,430
missus the point is

781
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:40,520
nobody can also discuss how many ipv6

782
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:45,259
really alive addresses the arkansas just
say I took as most networks I can

783
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:50,430
which I I personally would XQ that I
found about 50 percent

784
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:56,890
of the all internet to but it could be
eighty percent could be 20 percent

785
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:01,470
Santa concentrated on the and networks
of course all the

786
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:04,760
and transport networks and between the
rocking networks I didn't

787
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,569
candies the routing issue because you
just have to trade strategies

788
00:48:08,569 --> 00:48:12,540
appear exactly that's when my guess is
that what you found

789
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:15,690
most generous old man you have to think
it's

790
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:18,780
boxes and all those mess

791
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:22,599
deployed used whatever there in Asia

792
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:25,630
are using random addresses which

793
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:29,140
point haven't found me just so

794
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,490
when you say with your choose yo force
you get

795
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:36,369
eighty percent of hosts and thats eighty
percent

796
00:48:36,369 --> 00:48:39,880
postponed all your other tactic
scheduled between

797
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,700
anti-religious liked totally true but
then again

798
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:47,220
cool what's if in a remote pen test what
what you look for

799
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:51,480
our mineral 10+2 I would be authorized
to she's check the security of that

800
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,270
company

801
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:55,750
and I wouldn't care about do you spell
users

802
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:59,980
how which is different goal but I could
have sat at more in the beginning

803
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,450
yes you can only find stuff you're
looking for

804
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:06,780
is always a problem only if you look for

805
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:10,869
money on the floor you its more
prosperity find money on the floor

806
00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:15,520
if you buy in you mercy this which is
very venue you will notice so many

807
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,819
people more of that before he would not
have noticed

808
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:21,349
so you usually find only what you're
looking for dizzle

809
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:24,740
problem

810
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:28,720
little late SLA this position so I don't
know if you ask before

811
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:35,559
but who the room here has be six at home

812
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:38,890
in the office which is a truck

813
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:42,549
there more than I expected actually

814
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:49,180
service who has ever competed 6 world

815
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:52,379
could be way more and will be morning in
few years
