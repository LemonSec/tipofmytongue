1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:05,350
okay well good morning to the second
presentation G-seven track

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,530
on this presentation about it oslo

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:13,250
on BBC which is an open-source baseband
firmware for a more viable

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,570
and that you can use for among many
other things for security analysis

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,890
this time not so much analysis of
telephones themselves but announces

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:25,340
of actual network equipment let me just

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,320
start above I'm just giving us tonight
about myself you can check that

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,390
arms if you're interested in some later
point

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,860
let me make a general observation when

10
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,110
when from

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:47,110
you

12
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,020
you're a citizen is it a day when did it
turned it down because it was generating

13
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,660
nice so

14
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,570
okay now and the general observation is
well

15
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,050
both the 3G and he is and specifications
as well as it is VIP from those banks

16
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:11,560
are

17
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,860
and publicly available anyone can read
about anyone can learn how the system

18
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,500
works

19
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:22,159
from anyone can you know understand what
is the the possible attacks once the

20
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,259
security situation with these protocols

21
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:28,680
on and if you look at the internet
without leaving any minute wifi

22
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,190
TCPIP and so on and that

23
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,690
protocol stack release receives a lot of
scrutiny people are playing around with

24
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,710
it you know how how long has it be

25
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,009
says people have been sending Christmas
packets and thing of deaths and and and

26
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:44,360
those kinda things right it's a long
time ago

27
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,119
for people in the IT security community
and as he is and it works just as widely

28
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,550
deployed as the Internet

29
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,990
but we don't see the same level of
scrutiny

30
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:59,530
on the phone about Halfpenny and primary
reason for that is actually that there

31
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,550
is no such thing as an even at high
forties and

32
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,310
right a simple transceiver and it gives
you access to the physically a

33
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,289
but which allows you to send any
arbitrary data only actually is really

34
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,330
in the apparatus

35
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:15,660
that just kind of device just did not
exist and I'm not aware that is

36
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,280
commercially and particularly did not
exist

37
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,930
anyway that people would just go out and
buy something like that it's impossible

38
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,739
so all you could buys a phone or a
network equipment but he could not buy

39
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:29,180
something that gives you access to the
loneliness

40
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,500
and the reason for that is that the
industry involved in these products is

41
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,510
that from my present an extremely

42
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,569
does and sometimes close-minded from

43
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:43,420
there very very few opened as very few
implementation of the protocol stack

44
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,849
right and capital companies did that
initially

45
00:02:46,849 --> 00:02:50,099
and it's about a company's bottom nice
insists that poll

46
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:55,090
soul that if you look at how many TCPIP
implementations we have is Matt many

47
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,269
many many more

48
00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:01,360
then you would have a CD is important
implementations and the chipset makers

49
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,480
that produce the components that are
used both

50
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,040
in the base stations as well even more
so in the telephones

51
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,269
they don't release higher documentation

52
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:15,840
on in a way that other companies really
tiring of communication about this city

53
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,080
I'm there are very few companies that
build

54
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,970
the baseband chips that are used in
those phones on

55
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,180
the company's as an eight-day I

56
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,330
mainly you know sitting in the company's
added by an operating system

57
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,610
from somewhere else the biological
spectrum somewhere else

58
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,370
so it's not like and core at least
initially is not there

59
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:43,370
for a.m. expertise and at that stack or
the operating system

60
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,430
on and the way how the traditional
business model in that industry works is

61
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,650
if you want to buy

62
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,590
baseband processors from one of the
manufacturers you have to

63
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,600
become a customer and becoming a
customer for sell such products is

64
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,500
actually very tiresome exercise

65
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,080
am it starts with having to put up a
large amount of money on the table and

66
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,430
commenting tool

67
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,270
hundreds of thousands at least that's
already very smart ass and I typically

68
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,130
millions of

69
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,740
of units per year and in in quantities

70
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:16,199
not a component you can just go to
electronics retailer and buy

71
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,840
that's not the case soul if you look at
the website is very few family

72
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,539
information about these chipsets

73
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:25,610
available on the manufacturer's website
and always said

74
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,030
you know for selected handset
manufacturers only is not a product key

75
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,259
selling publicly

76
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:34,050
on and on the network side not many

77
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,620
companies actually will network
equipment right today

78
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,460
significantly he has only at hell loose
and Ericsson Nokia Siemens Networks Inc

79
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,080
Bali

80
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,130
a couple of other companies but this is
the

81
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,599
the company's on the market I'm and some
operators buy equipment from them but

82
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:54,330
only operators our customers so again
you cannot just go there and buy

83
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,800
equipment it's not tonight

84
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,949
you call them saying all I want this PDS
marlin sailfish sure we should

85
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:04,630
next week right you have to descend long
process is used to set up a relationship

86
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:09,069
you have to sign on to the cream and and
so on and so on and in me

87
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:12,410
if you interesting enough you can become
a custom and you can actually buy

88
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,110
equipment

89
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,800
and the minimum number of added me on

90
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,460
money you need to put on the table to
buy and minimal GSM network and is in

91
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,448
the order of

92
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:27,469
hundreds of thousands to millions of
euros and even a single component which

93
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:31,909
is not sufficient to operate a network
will cost you you intend to 40,000 euros

94
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:34,240
that's definitely not something that
will encourage

95
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,409
academic a.m. the search for everything
Paris

96
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:41,430
independent research into security
assistance

97
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,979
also on if you have any commitment you
know how to use it was a curious as you

98
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:47,808
can and

99
00:05:47,809 --> 00:05:51,169
network and you can make phone calls but
that's not really what you want to do

100
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:54,808
and on the operators operators are

101
00:05:54,809 --> 00:05:59,659
marketing and finance to go operators
today also it's not only their network

102
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:03,069
planning efforts servicing network
deployment but they also all sorts to

103
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:03,749
Billy

104
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:07,259
so the speedy only leaves marketing and
and and and finance

105
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:11,770
leftover there are exceptions I'm sorry
exaggerating here

106
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,198
but they are offering espey looks
exactly like this also

107
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,870
the staff at the operators a technical
staff I mean they mainly know the

108
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:22,129
equipment as it is shipped from this
supplier

109
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:26,629
they get some training courses from the
supplier and in all units that have a

110
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:28,259
system administrator knowledge

111
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:31,610
but they don't have the knowledge to
develop throughout the system no

112
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,029
would understand the details of the
protocols and so on

113
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:39,349
so he end up having very few people even
at the operators who know the product

114
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:41,080
called beyond

115
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,430
the user interface that supply a gives
to that

116
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,050
which i think is very dangerous and
especially since the outsourcing more

117
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,400
and more

118
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,009
any they do become complete

119
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:59,069
and I know I can see complete slave of
the manufactures

120
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:02,319
on now if you look at this entire
situation

121
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,889
I implications for security i

122
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:09,569
well we have almost no people who
understand the protocols will not work

123
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:12,509
for one of those few companies that
implement

124
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:16,509
system be a very independent research

125
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:20,199
if there is research at all is
cryptographic

126
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:23,789
from at your theoretical

127
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:27,318
or on a much higher level I'm out where
stay

128
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,610
7213 layers from what i've seen soul

129
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,089
that's that's really a a friend a
different world

130
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:39,080
and we don't have any all didn't have
any open source product implementations

131
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,909
when

132
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:43,289
we started out with all this which means
at

133
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:46,498
nobody could do any practical
experimentation right

134
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:50,159
I think the open-source implementations
that we have in the Internet world of

135
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,580
all the protocols that are

136
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,960
around on the internet are key to
enabling all the small and medium-sized

137
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,119
companies the individuals to students
the academia

138
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:02,580
to actually have some ideas implement
and test them

139
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,609
you know innovate around those protocols
but

140
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,529
in December this is restricted has been
restricted to win

141
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:13,449
a couple of the plants that the inside
industry

142
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:16,789
and that may also very well the reason
why

143
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:20,839
the security has not been improved
significantly of all that time

144
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:23,580
because you know it's just these
companies and they make a lot of money

145
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,639
on shipping their existing technology
and

146
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:29,119
you know when the tainted so

147
00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:32,190
on if you want to start at with

148
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,820
from hotel security analysis two sides
can get started and it was I don't want

149
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,800
to talk about this

150
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,279
today on we did this with open BC I
presented about this last year

151
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:45,670
used a on now on the

152
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,959
tennis on site that so what do you want
you want to telephone is under your

153
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,110
control you want to

154
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,920
receive and transmit arbitrary data on
arbitrary

155
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,709
grievances arbitrary point in time it's
from the significances

156
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,860
at you know the firmware of the systems
and

157
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,210
for must accept closed and proprietary
and let me at this point right

158
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,600
it doesn't matter whether it's on the
phone runs Android only knows more light

159
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,660
or something like that

160
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,040
this is running a different processor
and not talking about the education

161
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,520
process

162
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,750
he doesn't matter with the application
process and its open-source

163
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,910
no source god knows what and the
baseband processor in all the phones

164
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,410
have been shipped

165
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,850
on is completely proprietary and

166
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,459
and well so if you were to sell us to
write a protocol stack right you have to

167
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:36,339
specification you can just called on
stuff according to specification

168
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:40,440
but in the end user interface real radio
hardware and

169
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,339
sort of if it goes if you don't get the
documentation to do so

170
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,209
on and to to say that is in many cases

171
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:53,329
the cellphone makers the companies that
create the actual device

172
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:57,620
they do not even get that of
documentation from the chipset supplier

173
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,850
biggest success and I am loving the they
sell about

174
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,850
up on love their from various offered
their stack

175
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,579
and is a weekend and the

176
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:10,800
the the documentation that cell phone
maker yes

177
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,209
is related to loan me how you can face a
different user interface to the phone

178
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:19,240
oh maybe how they can interface is the
friend you know different RF transceiver

179
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,699
ID friend and tennis which is something
I guess electrical changes they made

180
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:23,759
that word

181
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,480
but they do not get the documentation
and how they can write their own stack

182
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,550
and running on that

183
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,329
that hard which is something that cell
phone law with the exception of

184
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:36,279
I have heard really but no no other cell
phone manufacturer he does

185
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:39,639
that kinda stuff so and

186
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:44,199
a the documentation to be he's very very
restricted and cat

187
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:48,060
very few days so there have been a
couple of times in the past it was the

188
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,620
TSM 30 project

189
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,720
part 2the you season project is

190
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,819
probably five years six years from now
and

191
00:10:55,819 --> 00:11:00,740
as yet and Mac OS which is even earlier
than that

192
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,440
which was an alternative operating
system for old Nokia

193
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,870
1990s not yet fallen said generation
called DC-three

194
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:13,440
mad OS was very very promising but then
was abandoned at some point you too I

195
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,009
think

196
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:17,889
I don't really know maybe maybe lack of
time but it people working on it

197
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:21,259
they've already members engineering and
a shared memory product quality the

198
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:22,480
baseband

199
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,259
cung ESPN is it was really really
advanced

200
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:29,360
stopped at that point now and

201
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,720
okays to bootstrap service process you
meet the specifications you gain

202
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,420
knowledge about the protocols

203
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:40,189
you obtain actually equipment you try to
get actual product of races

204
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,899
the implement the product must act in
any security of the pro

205
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:47,110
and we are ready now after the work that
we've been doing

206
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:51,589
yet finally step right so this is a
presentation that tells you we now have

207
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:52,470
the tools

208
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,579
it's up to the security community to go
out and use those tools now

209
00:11:56,579 --> 00:12:00,420
and if we look at a GSM network

210
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,930
and the classic the same design looks
like it's today's networks look

211
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,180
internally look very different but what
we're talking about

212
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,269
is the telephone year right is and

213
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:15,129
and the UN the air interface between the
base transceiver station

214
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:18,579
and a telephone this is an interface to
care for always his

215
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:22,440
sniffing right and we not talking about
generating the interface

216
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,629
from within the devil and implemented
protocol stack

217
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:29,240
and the proper perspective runs day
missile a one that

218
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,560
runs of course only until the BCS into
the antenna

219
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,579
there is a layer to Liz also terminate
you but then this is a 3d

220
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:40,050
that goes to the base station controller
or to the mall i switching center

221
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,720
depending on what you do

222
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,360
on so if you if you can manage to
implement

223
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,189
day 1&2 you can send transparent
messages to the base station controller

224
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:51,709
which controls dozens to hundreds of

225
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:57,300
of of cells or actually into the mall by
switching center which operates

226
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,459
you know and our city or of the country

227
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:05,029
depending on as i've salted billion in
Germany for example

228
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:08,560
operator has at least one embassy for
every major city

229
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,379
and this means you can transparently
send messages to that equipment

230
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:16,149
now the question is how much has
equipment have been hardened against

231
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:19,629
and now for messages and that kinda
stuff soul

232
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:23,629
you have an interface an air face that
is public this everywhere CB

233
00:13:23,629 --> 00:13:28,060
it is and he see the ability to directly
send messages deep into the core network

234
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,079
of the various operators

235
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,949
on the names of the individual
components and going to skip them thats

236
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:38,350
you know you wanna check them out at
some later point

237
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,639
on the interface that we're talking he
really is the %um interface between the

238
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,449
telephone

239
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:48,949
MS means molestation is not Microsoft
and the base transceiver stations BTS

240
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:51,970
this is the and

241
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,129
transceiver Associated on

242
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:59,350
and one thing to understand when you
talk about the sense that it is not

243
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:04,709
asymmetric network is not a peer to peer
network is not an end to end network

244
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:08,139
it's a very asymmetric very distributed
network

245
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,480
where you have different protocol stacks
in each of those interfaces

246
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,879
so the protocol stack did you will see
those sorry

247
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:20,269
products technical what's going on here

248
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:23,350
something

249
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,290
us

250
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:31,260
the product was that he was the I'm not
supposed to be touching my most that

251
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,380
productos de Pena C on the air interface
is completely different from when the

252
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,030
museum's

253
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:39,370
a visitor face again completely
different here and

254
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:43,130
could not be any different than the
interface is easy year and in front of

255
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:43,870
us XD

256
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,190
so they completely different from across
different encoding different messages in

257
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,590
different stacking and so on

258
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:53,340
so there is no one geez improbable s
individual product of Italy another

259
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:53,660
issue

260
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,750
of each other at different points in
this that on

261
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:02,470
okay the other thing that you should
remember when when you start again judy

262
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,540
is and is that

263
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,670
you do not have messages that contain a
source and destination addresses not

264
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:11,000
'it's not even if we have a source and
destination addresses

265
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,720
each and every message it's a time
division multiplex architecture

266
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,190
and if you don't notice if you don't
track trace

267
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:22,670
who has established a certain channels
then you do not know

268
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,480
after it was all the messages inside and
you don't know where they're from and

269
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,530
where they going to

270
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:30,750
said so it's like a telephone call even
if

271
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,710
signaling a potential hallway a
telephone call setup shows you you know

272
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,630
what's that

273
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:38,800
number that has been called and so on
but in the actual

274
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,810
you know voice conversation of course
you don't see any more

275
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:46,400
sending the data is receiving it because
simplicity known by the state of the

276
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,600
berries and pointing in the stack

277
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,280
is the stacking that you find on the %um
interface

278
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,290
it's a layover radial a DTS numbers

279
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:58,790
give you the the technical
specifications if you want to learn more

280
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,130
about these individually as the
specification numbers that you should be

281
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,080
looking out for

282
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,810
lay one is there a delay at unrelated be
an interesting for anything but United

283
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:08,680
service attacks

284
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,360
late to listen at the end which I also
believe is very uninteresting from

285
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,170
chronic low-level

286
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:17,590
security point of view but we actually
get into this delay three messages

287
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:20,730
and sixty-three some players today is
really the researchers

288
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,450
control yes mobility management and this
contrail

289
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,340
and then you have observe the question
is what is beautifully afford it is not

290
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,660
clear definition but there are things
that are

291
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,189
a.m. on ESPN hired a which are four for
SMS transfer

292
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,190
for US is the location services and so
on

293
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,570
and I think layer 3 into bob is really
where you you want to focus on for

294
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,950
front upper level attacks in such

295
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:51,300
on West as a number of known problems
have to use and just a very

296
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,370
recap right we have no mutual
authentication between centers on a

297
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,510
network soul

298
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,870
the telephone you never know when it's
going to relent with not

299
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,870
which leads to a road network attacks
man in the middle attacks

300
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,760
enables the hasher's on the FB
conviction algorithms

301
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,240
the engine is optional to be even worse
we have denied

302
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,579
service on on the random access channel
and be happy strange protocols by which

303
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:18,369
the network which is not authenticated
getting fired a telephone about

304
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,410
GPS partners this is sort of you know

305
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:26,620
conceptual security and and privacy and
confidentiality problems in the

306
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,750
specification

307
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,860
on there are more sleep and one of us
just

308
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:35,660
presented yesterday about to add the
easy task attacking other things

309
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,200
but and but I want to talk about no it's
not so much the conceptual problems of

310
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,830
course you can also expect experiment
with them

311
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,429
but implementation problems of course on

312
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:50,840
now in order to understand what
Wednesday it was awesome he is we have

313
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,620
to look a little bit about this baseband
processor is

314
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,630
is as typically an arm 7/1 arm 94

315
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:01,600
and in all the GSM and GPRS

316
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,110
and edge Only Fools don't implement Atul

317
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:08,430
very likely find it I'm 74 on

318
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,590
a I'm seven means there is no memory
management unit

319
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,990
disasters no you know no no memory
protection and all alone on executed

320
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:21,720
pages and so on on your eyes and
real-time operating system on that

321
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,670
I'm 74 next to the on seven you have a
digital signal processor

322
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:30,320
which is you know that cold in runs on
that and the type of these peas PDVD

323
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,230
proprietary a specific to that

324
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,920
base pensions that manufacture and
that's also where

325
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,400
in a peripheral to that these PDA 5
encryption is implemented

326
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,080
and this office acted runs on his
baseband processor is is written in this

327
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,970
MD&A

328
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,679
the language of course next Mon and
security features and I think we'll hear

329
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:49,540
more about this

330
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:54,070
later today now and basement is it
roughly looks like this is a very

331
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,710
traditional views and baseband chips
that design

332
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:00,679
yes a digital baseband processor dated
ESPN on 74

333
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:05,929
some aspirin UART SPI SPAC to be the
microcontroller site design

334
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:09,520
not very different from I mean if it
wasn't for the tease p it would be a

335
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,220
typical

336
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,990
Mike arm-based microcontrollers and even
an of baseband it's basically the

337
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:15,780
analog/digital

338
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,780
100 digital analog converter you have
and

339
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,420
transceiver mixer NBC or component that

340
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:27,010
actually down Congress to radiofrequency
into the baseband and vice versa

341
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:31,190
you know power amplifier for
transmitting it to be up to $2 Watson in

342
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,240
modern-day handsets and it s which

343
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,190
and various control lines between now
when the run

344
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,380
all softer on the baseband processors of
it around here and we'll drive all these

345
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,190
peripherals

346
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,490
over here and build implement the to be

347
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,810
sir to to receive the radio signals on

348
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:54,889
and a.m. or transmit signals and you
looking them in the protocol stack on on

349
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,390
this digital baseband processor

350
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:00,400
so what you need in order to what you
want to do

351
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,500
is we needed the total amount of control
the day one that we can

352
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,630
control in a two layer 3 that I control

353
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:11,200
now those components existed in in open
source or

354
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,270
freely available manner until this year
so

355
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,639
we need to create them and that this
project was started only

356
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,630
in January this year by the way soul

357
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,840
this different ways of how we can
address the problem we could and we

358
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,830
could build our own custom hardware but
then it goes

359
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:32,860
i've a prototyping and so on he's always
be cumbersome

360
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:37,720
so instead a this bus to work too little
ways how we could do this we will use an

361
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,040
existing base pensions that are we could
use general purpose components but we

362
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,010
did not choose to go down that way

363
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:46,450
we've already very fire inserted
designing

364
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:50,429
what kind of architecture we want and we
actually already bought from the timing

365
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:53,050
works but then decided finally

366
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:58,040
that we'd rather go for a lazy approach
and Daisy means we use existing all my

367
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,010
phones we know that I've it works

368
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,510
been all from they don't need to do any
harm to children typing

369
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:07,570
you don't need to goal to have a visions
you can benefit from the

370
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,340
from the economic scale since those
phones are manufactured large quantities

371
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,909
no custom harvesters

372
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,560
VG and a half in the end more time to
load to focus on

373
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,379
right in front of us of a rather than
doing 100 night so the search for a

374
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,570
suitable phones

375
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:26,649
we should be as cheap as possibly is
widely available as possible so most

376
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,620
people can

377
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:32,130
obtained should be all in order are
simple in order to keep the complexity

378
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,400
of this official

379
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,770
and that should be enough for the
information about the baseband chipset

380
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:40,670
so what we found is a primary target is
the Texas Instruments

381
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:46,470
at calypso chipset with digital baseband
documentation is on triple

382
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:50,320
analog baseband documentation you can
find Chinese developer web sites

383
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,360
and the source code of the propriety is
at stake

384
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,560
father ski for the exits that

385
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,280
was available on SourceForge for about
four or five years and thousands of

386
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,530
people have downloaded before it was
finally taken down

387
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:08,510
so am the source code was not used and
he did not copy any of that call in our

388
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:09,360
project

389
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,060
but however a source code analysis to
fill in the gaps in the documentation

390
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:16,710
that we have to understand better what
the heck does and how it behaves so we

391
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,000
can program it from all

392
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,130
there's another series chipsets which is
extremely popular in recent years

393
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,640
is the MediaTek mt6577 I'm

394
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,540
and Devon $9.5 million of them for use
in the first quarter of this year's in

395
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,100
massive

396
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,790
whiny those chips that are used in very
very low

397
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:39,060
low-price phones all the way is all over
Asia

398
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:42,659
and he's sort of czar second

399
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:46,520
second idea but we don't have any
support for it's an initial choice was

400
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,020
the Jack Adams

401
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,920
on the start in January we implemented
the baseband software

402
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,770
lay one's really if the Hobbit rightness

403
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:59,110
hands-on we also want to have a simple
user interface on the phone but that

404
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,820
point is not

405
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,070
not there yet soul points 12 info right
here

406
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,889
points3 is missing on the project Mimi's

407
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,750
open source mobile communications
basement if you ever wonder why did such

408
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,520
a strange name

409
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,760
and the software architecture well you
reuse existing call from open BC

410
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,240
whenever possible be run

411
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,250
as the suffering the phone s as needed
which means the only run today one in

412
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,800
the following you around 82 and 83 and
all the

413
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,140
as like application logic old on-site
the PC

414
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,120
on the PC and interface between going to
skip that

415
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,990
interfaces night you can be deployed
interested in that

416
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,190
so the for mac download be Debbie

417
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,760
developed in C++ compile using across
behind a fireman down on into the vice

418
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,280
contest drivers follow different
components in the fall including the

419
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,200
North Nash including the

420
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,230
LCD you can just be something on the
phone but of course

421
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,200
primarily all that did the same related
components in the device

422
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,400
on the suffering around the hosts calmly
and 23

423
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,590
um and uses a and it was because they
won control interface to control the Leo

424
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,860
one inside the telephone

425
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,880
but both the softer on the host PC as
well as the firm Apple's

426
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,140
entirely written france-presse it was no
code reuse that

427
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,420
from the came from anywhere else and his
balls

428
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:24,610
open source of three licensed under the
GNU GPL and the hymie support well it's

429
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:27,800
this most is the iPad apps all you very
much upset

430
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,960
and as a number of motorola Phone 7
manufactured by

431
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,070
compound communications in Taiwan on

432
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:38,070
a which is a C-one hundred 10 to 100

433
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,470
19 and is even 122 129 and so on

434
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:44,780
solo basically anything that starts with
a CE

435
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:48,320
11 12 13 14 and 15 will be supported by
a higher

436
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,760
and the most most the development
happens on the C 123 in to see when I

437
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,580
5509 5510 it's like this

438
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,919
know it's a very very small no windfall

439
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,930
a doesn't even have any USB or serial
connection just isn't your phone jack

440
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:06,090
and we actually download the software is
through the your phone jack

441
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:10,000
says that's not only in an audio
interface but also has a multiplex

442
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,030
serial port on on interestingly

443
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,320
right down on a softer on those devices
is extremely easy

444
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,189
just press the power button and after
you press the power button he tries to

445
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:24,650
negotiate with some hosts of red if
there is some most software

446
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:29,030
the boulder that already is in the phone
as ships from the from the manufacturer

447
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:32,830
download executed will call the serial I
need a jump to it

448
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:36,879
right couldn't be any easier is no
protection whatsoever it is known

449
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,100
digital rights management in all but the
graphics images nothing

450
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,430
you just the push the power button and
it will you know

451
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:47,070
happy Donegal descended on

452
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:53,460
okay from if you look at the phone PCB
you'll all the CNN covers it looks like

453
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:53,810
this

454
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:57,350
unfortunately way too much light from
here to really easy with projector is

455
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,160
projecting

456
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,580
on but yes it is an individual
components you can easily

457
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,990
and find work within the block schematic
circuit find you again the digital

458
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,050
baseband processor n of baseband RF
transceiver

459
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:13,540
on power amplifier antenna

460
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:18,600
connector and so on so this day say

461
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,940
the initially we had to take up less
than the park to be able to put you know

462
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:26,170
soldier wires onto the individual traces
and two measurements and

463
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:29,350
I get the label drive is up and running
now

464
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:33,200
what is working we have a driver's for
basically anything

465
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,790
I'm havin a one that has all the main
tasks only a1

466
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:40,290
power men's and various international
nations to

467
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:44,030
Carrie Ann Inaba lucky me we can receive

468
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,440
ferries bursts

469
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,830
and week in advance with them of course
we have on any gain control we implement

470
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:51,990
frequency hopping

471
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:58,120
we drive the encryption accelerate how I
can't imagine implementation hybrid

472
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,549
exists we havin a two-layer media-savvy
selection and so on

473
00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:06,629
is all starting from August this year
it's possible to do voice calls

474
00:27:06,629 --> 00:27:09,960
a slot on the B it does the various is

475
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,700
if somebody knows aspect on a GSM
supports various

476
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:18,940
assignment schemes it supports
authentication using its impact a day

477
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:22,710
S is a fourth floor the fr you park all
day

478
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:27,309
what we don't have his name is a massive
measurements which for security analysis

479
00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:28,158
are completely

480
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,570
unneeded be done to handle which
typically also not very interested in if

481
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:33,439
you wanted to

482
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,850
security research we don't have user
interface on the phone but all the

483
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:41,120
use interface runs the london-based and

484
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,450
runs on the PC we don't have sex which
day timeline on the GPS and of course

485
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,740
there's no type approval

486
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,389
this day on okay

487
00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:55,100
now I'm going to leave that executive
summary slide as well I mean damn

488
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,809
you can me that some other time on

489
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:02,039
one I'm going to do a demo quickly such
as when I finished the slides

490
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:06,820
on right the same industry has been
making security analysis

491
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:11,908
very very difficult which and some
people can say is a a security feature a

492
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:14,690
high-security bout by closeness and
obscurity

493
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,799
but of course what we have done with
dismal not following anyone would have

494
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,668
done ten years a fifteen years ago

495
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:25,379
with the move level on Dec 10 is nothing
new has no new development is

496
00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:30,539
not meeting nothing that has happened in
in the last 10 years that certainly made

497
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:31,539
as possible right

498
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:36,658
with something like a retro advancements
in in in this after a Dr protections on

499
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:38,110
really have made this possibly

500
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:41,889
you want to keep tracking right with the
computer is fifty years ago it would not

501
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:44,080
have been possible and feasible amount
of time

502
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,350
but these running custom call in a
telephone could happen any time

503
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:52,779
and maybe has happened anytime goal but
nobody has ever publicly talked about it

504
00:28:52,779 --> 00:28:53,500
you don't know

505
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,960
right soul okay now we can send an
arbitrary date

506
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,139
internetwork from the telephone into
into the network

507
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:05,950
and soul right now this means the basic
tools for starting to fast mobile

508
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,629
networks are available

509
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:12,119
when we don't have is a nice interface
integration with finding tools like

510
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,590
netscape you are

511
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,730
any any kind other security top tools
that allow you to send messages

512
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:23,309
handcrafted on but yeah i think is the
IP security is boring for at least 10

513
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:23,850
years

514
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:27,549
try to do something else on you look at
DSM

515
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:30,679
look at other things looking I find the
system's look at tix

516
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:34,289
look at Textron get all kinds
communication systems out there

517
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:37,480
but not the internet and not to be ID's
you know

518
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,259
people have been doing this for way too
long did

519
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:46,679
any okay solo albums and thanks to a
couple of people who've been very very

520
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:51,019
much involved in this project is the
best policy on this device type was not

521
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:54,309
use the vein is also you so this is
really a team effort

522
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:57,590
lot of teams are very dedicated working
on

523
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:02,200
from is project and you thanks for that
if you wanna read more into

524
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,679
couplings and on its trying to

525
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,289
short demonstration Sol

526
00:30:09,289 --> 00:30:16,289
I am I know the fund is too small just
give me some time

527
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:26,660
why is okay

528
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:33,660
now what I'm going to do with ongoing
with my directory

529
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,270
and starting with scalding of small

530
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:42,900
on projects arsenal.com is the open
source mall by

531
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,010
console program where I can say

532
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,740
minus MC 155 just telephone I'm going to
use

533
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,320
and saying minus and p

534
00:30:53,320 --> 00:31:00,210
that supports serial port I'm going to
use and I'm going to specify which

535
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:04,870
Matt that I went to Lowes

536
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:11,870
from blog on you

537
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:14,770
okay

538
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:17,970
now I have started a program that can
talk to the

539
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:23,080
wrong put lorena's ball soul this space
yes and I press the button it starts to

540
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,770
suck the code into the telephone

541
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:28,870
yeah doesn't always work as reliably as
I want

542
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:34,040
yeah but now it's easy is loading forty
kilobytes optical into the telephone

543
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,879
and his hello world in whatever ABC
years not executing from the basement

544
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,160
prostitutes telephone

545
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,620
you'll see later wound up being in the
you probably can be

546
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,650
small right knee display in a 10 been in
the screen

547
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:50,190
and which sets it tells us that the day
one

548
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:54,580
from has been downloaded into this the
firm in town as I said is is completely

549
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,100
available source code that just

550
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,760
confided in advance of weekend have more
exciting things in this demonstration in

551
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:01,640
which TCC

552
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:07,260
called okay now as open another window

553
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,990
I'm going to the a.m.

554
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:17,990
directory again

555
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,730
songs okay

556
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:29,049
okay I'm doing one more thing before I
am starting is

557
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:36,049
I'm going to start a news

558
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:40,179
government I'm starting a Wireshark

559
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:44,610
and stands and I'm going to listen on
the loopback device

560
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:48,679
it's very interesting right catching on
the think device and

561
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:51,740
what I'm going to do furthermore

562
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:56,010
is I'm going to

563
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,120
start the

564
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,960
no

565
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:07,960
ones mines minus

566
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:15,410
I always forget the command line
arguments

567
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,930
and it's not working okay

568
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:28,930
it's restarting just

569
00:33:50,139 --> 00:33:57,139
home

570
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:16,350
I don't know what's going on sorry for
that was working two days ago

571
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:23,130
the BCS games

572
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:30,130
and some homes

573
00:34:55,650 --> 00:35:02,650
any ideas you know

574
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,040
yes

575
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,120
I think so good

576
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:20,859
II yes that's completely true my mistake
yes

577
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:24,090
just on the phone from me it's not a
surprise that did

578
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:27,890
with the Browns I'm thanks for

579
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:34,890
somebody who's paying attention

580
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:41,440
use

581
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,880
yes

582
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,220
okay that's fine I hope this

583
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:53,220
will be working

584
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:07,940
you know

585
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:43,530
there you go okay so now I'm starting
this

586
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,589
mask and it's getting over the GSM law
now

587
00:36:46,589 --> 00:36:49,660
the projector is with bright with
projected to have any

588
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,629
any reason congress it's getting over
the frequency band is

589
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,839
identifying all the very self there is
receiving

590
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:01,660
the broadcast messages from various
elsie was not supposed to be in your

591
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:05,009
mind it's the same kind messages that
Carson has been showing are we seeing

592
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:05,960
them from the phone

593
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,700
from weeee if we look here

594
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:14,069
am in this

595
00:37:14,069 --> 00:37:18,319
as: Wireshark instance we see the real
time message is that the telephone

596
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,490
received from cells

597
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:24,569
and VCE you all kinds of messages that
are going on for example you BCS system

598
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:25,500
information

599
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,809
do with the case the neighbors and his
only

600
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:33,349
the to do in return for which today tell
us what is actually

601
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:38,579
cell is this one is the t-mobile Austria
selling its received you

602
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:42,790
on and them you know this is not just

603
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:47,650
receive only mode but to as much as we
can receive messages from the cells we

604
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:50,670
can also transmit messages begin is
damaged and so on

605
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:56,430
on I and run to take some questions and
is a more demonstrations right now

606
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:59,569
on but if you want to play with this

607
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:03,058
you can buy these phones for about 15
euros on e-bay

608
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:06,290
if you cannot find one you can contact
me I have a couple of

609
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:11,490
them in stock that cable here cost you
something like one euro50 24 euros

610
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:15,010
this is the USB to your phone connector
cable which has an

611
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:19,030
serious under inside so the entry
barriers to be with his

612
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:24,599
reveals many anytime you need to give it
some thought to try to understand GSM

613
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:28,480
he's invest something like 20 euros in
equipment okay

614
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:35,480
questions me questions no questions

615
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:48,290
there's a question

616
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:53,180
yeah I'm you interesting test suite

617
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,370
sending nice this thing

618
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:59,720
think it's networks yeah well

619
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:03,450
I mean and what in I'm not sure if
you've seen surveys presentation

620
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:07,020
yesterday he was using the very serious
offer to send his in the detachment

621
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:11,009
as right sounds all there is this a
answer

622
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:14,190
conceptual problem in GSM that if a
telephone switch

623
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:17,920
of Intel's the network I'm switched off
now at this message cannot be

624
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,270
authenticated

625
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:23,050
is not there's no no no means above
indicates message

626
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:27,500
so if you know somebody else's identity
his ins even just detaching from the

627
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,200
network by sending such a message

628
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,970
so he's using possible call me not as a
phone to make phone calls or something

629
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:36,510
but he's using this as Italy and tools
or if

630
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:39,670
transceivers thing and you can send this
message to the

631
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:43,360
base station controller which then I
actually it goes up to the embassy this

632
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,250
message goes the more messages and

633
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:50,810
and did well marked this other person is
on the telephone is no not being on the

634
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:51,390
networks

635
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,460
any incoming calls failed at that point
is ascribed

636
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:58,150
and so this is not an email for message
but is sending a bell

637
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:01,410
long as it is specified message but
sending in

638
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:04,680
from the phone that would not work that
that's not the phone that he actually

639
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,589
detaching see

640
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:08,600
detaching somebody else from the net and

641
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:13,620
I found some tests and operators where
have been invited and

642
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:18,430
I've managed to elicit within craft
custom crafted messages

643
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:22,430
I cannot say where he was but yeah I
managed to crash position controls

644
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:27,480
on I haven't really had a chance to
experiment with more messages and easy

645
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,960
it is to be /c

646
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,310
was definitely a possible and it was not
even intentionally trying to do

647
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,160
something right

648
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,420
from now crashing something is just a
night of service attack of course

649
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,880
right interesting more interesting is

650
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:45,240
trying to explore things which I believe
in the in the case of network equipment

651
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,140
is much more difficult than

652
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:50,480
in the case of telephones I mean we have
people

653
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,800
thank you I feel if I met with his and
later today I think

654
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,260
showing us how to exploit a terrible
because in a telephone we have processor

655
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,100
in operating system disorders known as
an arm Korea's nuclear israel's

656
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,900
or something but in the carry a great
equipment very very few people actually

657
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:10,500
know what the iraqi picture looks like
what kind of programming language

658
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,180
runtime is used on the system's you know
it's it's

659
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,720
nobody's almost nobody has access to
from there

660
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,330
software running on the switches and
other equipment sold I think

661
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:23,690
implementing a working exploit on the
system's

662
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:27,200
without detailed insight and knowledge
of technology love you

663
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:32,890
presley Hart is another question so what
is the

664
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:36,210
the legal status of experiments like
that

665
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:38,090
so especially

666
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:41,510
regarding protecting

667
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:45,400
operators operate inside and the other
hand

668
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,819
regarding the

669
00:41:47,819 --> 00:41:51,819
misma regulations of frequency bands

670
00:41:51,819 --> 00:41:55,239
okay networks so

671
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:59,539
on the legal situation in general

672
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:03,019
I'm only very familiar with the
europeans

673
00:42:03,019 --> 00:42:07,739
you truly situation and and the
situation is like this

674
00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:11,089
that there's a couple of criminal
offenses that could apply one of them is

675
00:42:11,089 --> 00:42:11,819
for example

676
00:42:11,819 --> 00:42:15,180
interference with public sentiment
telecommunications networks is a

677
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,149
specific offence

678
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:20,109
listed in the terminal called and is
punishable by up to five years in prison

679
00:42:20,109 --> 00:42:23,609
so interfering with public networks is
definitely something that is

680
00:42:23,609 --> 00:42:26,619
and very heightened penalty by itself

681
00:42:26,619 --> 00:42:31,380
right just interfering with the net you
happen to be even without you know

682
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:34,320
accessing any information that you
shouldn't have access to that separate

683
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,780
offense but just interfering with the
public network

684
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:40,280
and has that kind of penalty

685
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,580
and saw the kind of test and I've been
doing I've been doing united against my

686
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:48,810
own network of course which is not on
the telecommunications network or

687
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:53,350
at an operator where he actually had
permission in the battle

688
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:57,980
those things soul and if you do this on
a public network then

689
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:02,620
yeah I questioned by certainly you will
you will find a criminal offence

690
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,830
not even speaking of the Civil fences
did you commit

691
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:09,930
from be violating the terms as a result
that operate in those kind of things

692
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:13,270
modifying the firm on the device itself

693
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:18,720
I don't see any legal problems with that
their regulatory environments to look at

694
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,980
least the European Union and

695
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:26,010
I'm a nice big very violence regarding
telephones they apply for people who

696
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:30,890
23 devices into the market people who
import the devices people who sell the

697
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:31,569
devices

698
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:35,330
but and there's no law or regulation
apollo

699
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:39,680
people dread use alternative software
for devices just simply completely

700
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,609
unregulated

701
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:44,440
is currently a Paul appalled by the
European Commission on how to deal with

702
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,050
those kind of things in the future

703
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:49,870
but so far no no regulations and

704
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:54,810
regarding that solely if BSS the awesome
on the project release dates of

705
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:58,100
don't see any problem with that so it's
possible to use

706
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,580
that gates geez

707
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:05,710
of course you're yeah if you're on your
own network

708
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:12,320
certification for weapons mother is
Certification certification applies to

709
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,470
people who will ship

710
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:18,540
product into the market any you by Andy
by status online if I from the market

711
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:22,270
and you do modifications yourself and
there's no regulatory

712
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:25,830
framework surrounding that as mine is
dead

713
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:29,090
and a of course

714
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:33,200
if you run your own views and network
you will have an experimental ices of

715
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,480
some sort anyway

716
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,050
and of course you can use your telephone
even if the money fight on the phone

717
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:39,120
with your network

718
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:43,690
i'd right as long as that telephone does
not cause interference with operator

719
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:44,290
Netflix

720
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:48,290
so if you confident in the quality
doesn't interfere in it you can see that

721
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:50,700
in a spectrum analyzer is it really
transmitting

722
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,380
in the licenses in the frequency I have
to experiment a license

723
00:44:54,380 --> 00:45:00,090
I don't really see problems with that an
expression

724
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:04,660
and you can also use to ask questions
for the previous presentation right i

725
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,490
mean he didn't have enough question time
in different cars

726
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:10,850
mister here and their names weapons you
you know anybody

727
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:14,509
ones I'm yeah

728
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:19,360
well 3G and the the problem of soreness
that

729
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:23,330
the chipsets are much more so first of
all this technology is

730
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:27,450
incredibly more complex soul 3G networks

731
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:31,520
United CT SMS complex 3G networks are
much more complex

732
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,970
from a the layered tulle with GSM is
extremely simple linear to love you

733
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:41,450
WCD inmates already you know this he
isn't one specified monster these packed

734
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:43,540
including rules and and and

735
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,910
as STL specificity at higher grounds and
gardens

736
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,700
so the complexities bigger I'm not
saying it cannot be done

737
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:54,070
and way I see more of a practical
difficulty is

738
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:57,670
in a running custom columns really
baseband processors

739
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:01,360
from because they are typically much
more lockdown

740
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:05,100
and in the city jim says duty chances
are any videos and

741
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,520
most of them are not and do not come
without any cryptographic

742
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:14,009
signatures and so on but am finding a
way how you can rely heavily on another

743
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:14,820
telephones

744
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:18,800
installer from called in a 3G handset

745
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,810
some thing is is definitely a

746
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:24,840
different them 47 there are

747
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:29,390
exploits you know from his entire face
from the air interfaces on but it does

748
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:31,210
I'm only valid

749
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:35,360
against specific for members to the
specific phone and you know any updates

750
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,520
after and

751
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:40,210
polls closed again saw I whoops find
myself

752
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:43,810
difficult I mean it will be difficult
for me to motivate myself to put you

753
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:44,430
know

754
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:47,899
many many many many months into
something I don't really know

755
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,150
made okay to have a guarantee that I can
in the end run it

756
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:54,500
on rely heavily on a certain number of
devices and other people

757
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:59,130
run-ins number of devices so I'm I don't
know anyone who's working on this

758
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:05,010
and for sort of the development units
behind of smoke on the Indian open EC

759
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:07,430
for us the primary goal now is to have

760
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:11,370
3G network side to implement the network
site telephone sides

761
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:16,060
if yeah so nice to have but nobody's be

762
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:16,340
workings
