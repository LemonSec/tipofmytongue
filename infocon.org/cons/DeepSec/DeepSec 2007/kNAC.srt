1
00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:03,020
okay cast art

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,790
I R thank you very much %uh for coming
here

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,580
on my name is of ER can on the chief
technology officer

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,339
of a company called Insight ex and I'm
here to

5
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:19,670
speak about on ways to bypass network
access control solutions

6
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:23,109
I during the presentation

7
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:26,830
you have any questions just I'll raise
your hand

8
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,630
I'll be more than happy to answer to
your question

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,110
stop the presentation assalam the
question on

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,930
the idea about the this presentation is
to first and foremost

11
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,050
I introduced what's network access
control you'll see that this is

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,160
not a simple question hot talk about the
different things that

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,489
I think I should be part of network
access control and then we'll talk about

14
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:57,399
ways that we can arm utilize in order to
bypass the cork existing

15
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:02,030
network access control solutions arm

16
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,740
this is a bit about my background I'm
also the founder of the security group

17
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,770
confound them

18
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,280
there some my information about my
previous

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,270
researchers mom and so forth so

20
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,390
what is not for gets control want to
know what problem does it came to seoul

21
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,689
arm what function side we wanted to our
support

22
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,850
calm and what is it at all is that the
compliance solution as a security

23
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:29,360
solution

24
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,340
I'm mark what's actually is the problem
that time network access control aiming

25
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,000
to solve

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,820
the promise simple our enterprise land
as

27
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,189
a jungle everything with an rj-45

28
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:45,409
everything with some kind of a
conductivity

29
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:49,149
on capability weil es Salaam and so
forth

30
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:53,439
is able to be connected to the network
and got gates

31
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,990
on immediate network access think about

32
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,310
the organization think about I other
people's organization

33
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:06,350
and you'll find out that's what you need
to do is just the cord

34
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,470
and basically you get an IP address and
the wrong so basically as I said earlier

35
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,319
this is a jungle the workstations the
servers the printers the wireless access

36
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:15,870
points

37
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:21,690
the Fort Collins the switchers she IPTV
devices in the video devices everything

38
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,800
that can be connected is on our network

39
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,620
and the out and the problem is that
we're not aware but those devices are

40
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,069
actually on our network

41
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:32,620
arm so again today

42
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,190
ice we need to I'll obvious and our
stability endangered regular operation

43
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,829
if you don't have the understanding

44
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,670
that these devices are actually on our
network then all those will be in

45
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,239
jeopardy

46
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:51,239
on actually the first company who
basically identified this problem

47
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:56,989
was I Cisco Systems back in 2003 Honda
few remember

48
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:00,800
about the blast their warm them now
shortly after this is going to announce

49
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,950
an initiative

50
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,319
that will allow them to our are checked
the compliance a device when it is

51
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,599
connected to the network

52
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,170
making sure that it has the right but
just making sure

53
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,030
that it has on the virus updates on and
so forth stuff was a

54
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,450
first-world initiative in order to
actually in all network access control

55
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,519
and basically from that point on the
just as wrong

56
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,319
there are other initiatives so like
microsoft on network expert action

57
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,890
be trusted I Computing Group

58
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,500
I our T&C and so forth idea for the day

59
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:39,140
there's no standardization around
network access control you can go to

60
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:44,120
II certain website to download a nice
PDF or text document in that document is

61
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,970
going to tell you

62
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,659
what actually needs to be in a network
access control solution

63
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,409
so first and foremost we don't
understand the definition

64
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:55,239
and then we don't even understand what
are the different components to such a

65
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:56,409
system is so whole

66
00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:01,810
body in such a situation basically a lot
of definition exists

67
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,250
and now I'm la crosse mayhem actually
exist as well because

68
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,299
if I come to find them everyone's
definition has a winner

69
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,739
but this we trying for second to
understand what network access control

70
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:15,280
actually should provide

71
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,389
them first and foremost I we need to
control network access

72
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:22,590
and as such mark at least I believe

73
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,699
that this is a security solution before
it is a compliance solutions so that

74
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:28,830
actually means that

75
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,609
the time instead of %ah saying OK let's
check the device

76
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,120
that it has the proper I mark Patterson
the proper

77
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,490
on the virus updates and so forth we
need first to make sure that it actually

78
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,470
belongs to the organization

79
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,250
and then basically we need to put the
other and on top of that to make sure

80
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,710
that it's actually compliant

81
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:53,169
because I don't care if its complaint or
not if I don't understand that it exists

82
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:54,060
or if it's

83
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,000
recall operating in a row manner on my
network so again first and foremost we

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,030
need to understand

85
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,080
as the device actually belongs to the
network in its hours

86
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,758
and then we put the compliance on top of
that at the end of the day this is a

87
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,870
risk mitigation solutions

88
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,970
because we need to lower the risk that
our organization may have

89
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,620
not only from broke device us but in
most cases from those

90
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,639
but also from non-compliant and points
which might bring other

91
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:22,770
other stuff to network

92
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,780
so how do I define network access
control on a set of technologies and

93
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,199
define processors

94
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,430
which job controls access to the eye
enterprise network out now at

95
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,729
enterprise network who then allows only
authorizing compliant devices to access

96
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:38,310
the network

97
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,710
this is slightly different than the so
then the

98
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,239
I'm usual definition that you all out
but you'll hear

99
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,810
again if you have questions or if I go
to class just let me know and

100
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:56,220
I answer your questions so

101
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,100
if you look at the different components
that needs to be into

102
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,889
on a network access control solution and
we can define basically six different

103
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:06,410
components that are a must in my opinion

104
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,509
fresco from first and foremost we need
to the tactic the availability

105
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:13,759
when the presence of a new element on
that work

106
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,819
when they do understand that %ah mom

107
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:21,050
and you element has at has actually
being attached to the network

108
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,539
and that actually drives the network
access control process

109
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:27,900
without the understanding that there is
not new element on the network there's

110
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,240
no liability whatsoever to actually

111
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,350
start the process validation is the
process

112
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,840
of checking the validity and do you on

113
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,410
the device basically for authorization
routes meaning that I make sure that the

114
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,000
device actually belongs to the
organization

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,180
validity actually holds also the ability
to validate the user's identity

116
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,889
you'll see that a lot of different
solutions selects only to do user

117
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:57,419
authentication and I'll show later
whites

118
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:01,719
not such a good idea to just do user
authentication for network access

119
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,599
control

120
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:06,490
and why the our device authorization is
also a must in this I

121
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:10,539
area assessment is basically the ability
to go and assess the compliance of a

122
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:13,180
certain device to the network access
policy

123
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:18,099
of the organization usually this is only
agence windows-based devices someone can

124
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:20,210
tell me why this is not such a good idea

125
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,870
against other devices currently

126
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,319
why for example Mac OS them or

127
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:32,060
clinics are not put into assessment

128
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,210
what are are you actually at assessing
their

129
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,319
thats I that's also a problem I mean we
look at windows and we say okay we have

130
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,130
practice we have anti-virus we have some

131
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,250
environmental are matters that we look
to have

132
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,379
on Linux and Mac OS 10 this is this a
slightly different let's say that I have

133
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:53,660
and on two hours and stole my Mac here
so OK

134
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,840
what is going to detect the windows as
viruses nothing more than that

135
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,849
souls strictly off from this point on

136
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:04,060
at the at this point sorry I today

137
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,979
maybe in the future there will be also
assessment processes that are actually

138
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,750
valid on other operating systems on
under Windows enforcement in quarantine

139
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,629
is a very important piece basically the
elements that are not

140
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,849
are not compliant with the organization
policy archwood

141
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:23,039
into a special holding place called the
quarantine with their waiting or they're

142
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,710
being remediated

143
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:29,069
om and basically I A six innings to be
applied to them in order for them to

144
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:29,979
actually be

145
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:33,269
readmitted to general population of the
network om

146
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:36,969
enforcement usually uses the same
mechanisms that the quarantine users

147
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:40,050
now we'll talk about that the Alliance
because there are a lot of problems into

148
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:40,699
how you

149
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,810
put the device into quarantine and what
it is actually capable of doing once in

150
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,019
the quarantine

151
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:49,830
on the remediation side this is the
ability to fix the issue that Dom

152
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,399
I had calls the device to get into the
quarantine on there is

153
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,610
automated remediation for something sa
basically you can

154
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,320
to hear the anti virus to outgoing
update itself you can now put

155
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,430
I'm configuration parameters on the
device and so forth

156
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,560
and last is provisioned which basically
means that

157
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,140
throughout the life cycle of the element
on the network you still need to assess

158
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,470
that the profile of the device still
matters the

159
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,660
those comprar tus you put into your
assessment profile

160
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,149
and that nothing had chains so access is
still being grounded

161
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:27,880
to the I'm to the element if something
changes me to stop this I

162
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,279
this axis so basically these are the
different

163
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,750
I'll are different now on

164
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:38,279
things that need to be put into a
network access control solution this was

165
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,470
our

166
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,510
a very first introduction into who what
metal cracks control should have

167
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:50,459
on what's the definition what so the
capabilities questions

168
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:54,360
okay so either the attack sectors

169
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,980
basically the nice thing about that this
is that we can attack everything

170
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,810
like with any other technology we can
take different pieces and we can try to

171
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,920
our to see where we can actually put an
attack against

172
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,170
so first is the architecture how this
actually works

173
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,689
how the different ports interact what
are they sending each other we'll see

174
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,790
some examples for how we can now play
with that as well

175
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,920
technology huge piece of the feature or
each feature

176
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,240
can be attacked on for example the
element detection process the device

177
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,500
authorization the assessment the
quarantine also examples on how you can

178
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,839
actually buy plus

179
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,410
whites we can attack each of those on

180
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:38,199
teachers the various components can be
actually I'm at that as well

181
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,100
on the client itself the service that
they are being used in the

182
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,370
infrastructure itself

183
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,970
sign that respect you can attack them as
well so as you can

184
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:50,320
as you may see there's different things
that we can do here

185
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,040
will go over on with this presentation
over to the finish in

186
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,410
which plays a role although this is not
an attack but

187
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,760
its something of important thing to
understand

188
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,180
will broke about element detection and
we'll

189
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,610
on understand how we can actually put an
almond on the network without being

190
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,620
detected

191
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,350
and the validation state was will show
some examples for that

192
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:17,800
talk about the quarantine talk about
enforcement and assessment

193
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,279
and we get to the finish in

194
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,410
so basically on the problem is I said
earlier is first

195
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,930
first is with the definition how we can
actually the file its network access

196
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:29,829
control

197
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:34,649
is this %uh posture validation only is
this is don against all devices

198
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:38,240
and is it the security solution or
compliance solution and actually

199
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,089
mom I was set here an example

200
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:46,260
with dr. definition that their trusted
network connect

201
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,510
of the IRT angie is actually sent as you
can read in the highlighted red

202
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,050
security requirements for endpoints
connecting to the corporate network

203
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,310
collecting and point configuration data

204
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,370
policy compliance so this means that

205
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,959
instead of saying okay we first group of
actually

206
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,220
controlling the access to your network
and then we're going to assess if those

207
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,579
devices are actually compliant with

208
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:14,139
I what you would like to arm arm your
elements to inherit two

209
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:17,310
worse and okay this is only the
compliance peace

210
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,600
this is a very dangerous thing because
if you don't define

211
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,930
dissolution is a security solution and
make sure that your devices

212
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:27,079
first and foremost belongs to you and
there are no rogue devices and only then

213
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,190
perform the

214
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:32,010
compliance what you're actually implying
here that's like patch management

215
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:32,939
solutions

216
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,540
give me or I no username and password
with Administrative rights all connect

217
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,019
to my domain controller I'll get the
list of ilmn stock

218
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:44,190
log on to the domain and I'll check the
complaints against them

219
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,920
sounds really bad right why is this bad
because at the end of the day there are

220
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,839
elements which do not amount to the
domain which there are elements which

221
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,600
you are not going to other demands and
so forth

222
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,110
so this might illustrate the problem
here because wish we use the 80/20 rule

223
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,769
in security

224
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:05,180
it simply will not work so this is the
example

225
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,200
as a certain earlier the on the one of
the most important features

226
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,899
about network access control his
in-demand detection

227
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:16,160
basically on the ideas that mark is

228
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,760
being triggered by in a min detection if
I detect a new element is being attached

229
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,130
to a network

230
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:27,209
dent in that process can start but arm
as we will see most of the solutions

231
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:31,329
today simply don't understand the
contextual network information

232
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:35,339
they wait for something to happen in
order for them to detect that there's

233
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:39,940
actually and your device on the network
they don't have a detection capabilities

234
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,639
that other damn in real time at least
most of them

235
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,209
that there's a new device and therefore
there is no knowledge about the slicers

236
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:50,360
no control no difference because there's
no network access control

237
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,529
so hot what are the different methods to
do a man detection

238
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:59,519
and here there is a fast ways actually
vast I'll brawl chance to do this

239
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,180
are from listening to traffic listening
to do to be request listening to broker

240
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,880
to broadcast traffic are listening to
traffic that goes through a certain

241
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,529
monitoring point

242
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:14,389
on your knees and are listening to
traffic that go through in line device s

243
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:18,620
integrating with the switch like 802.1x

244
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:23,070
SNMP traps can someone tells me Canton
someone tell me why

245
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,610
integrating with us which is a problem

246
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:31,699
dusts off off the top of your hands

247
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:35,709
months wasn't that has the

248
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:39,190
okay the idea here is that basically you
rely

249
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,380
on something you don't provide in order
to

250
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:47,199
have access certain feature enabled so
if you go to an organization and I'm

251
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,980
sure that some of you work for

252
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,209
small organizations 10,000 people
fifteen thousand people

253
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:56,260
think about all the infrastructure that
is involved with this type of

254
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,510
organizations

255
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:01,360
so how can I actually tell who are all
of my elements on the network and

256
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,949
especially the switches

257
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:06,430
now among those who is this usually
you're not gonna buy

258
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:10,060
mom the equipment from a single vendor
gone by

259
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,980
from different vendors and along the
time you have different versions of the

260
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,180
software of

261
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,639
those switches so for some switches some
of those capabilities

262
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:23,269
you know you'll be able to enable them
all to the books for other switches

263
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:27,040
you'll either need to throw the switch
out 42 basically upgrade the

264
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,209
switch think about 10,000 people think
about 15,000 people

265
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:35,970
think about 1,000 2,000 sweetest that
you need to play with

266
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,680
it doesn't fly at the end of the day mom
there's another option to put the

267
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,170
congress of were

268
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,649
on top of the device so whenever the
client is connected to the network that

269
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:45,589
basically the

270
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:48,740
clients of who will tell the server hey
I'm here

271
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,610
but some that's another losing on
approach and we'll see what

272
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,920
mom so basically basses metal detection

273
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,930
I one of my favorites topics I actually
tom has published on

274
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:05,420
out a paper about that I am back in 2005

275
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,060
there's a lot of material there the
biggest problem here

276
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,269
is that we cannot control or those
solutions cannot control what they see

277
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:15,220
on the wider

278
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:20,070
I cannot make you send email and I
cannot make you open your browser and I

279
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,029
cannot make you do something else

280
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:26,139
in order to draw conclusions from your
traffic and of your device

281
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:29,259
now the device can also be idle on the
network

282
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:33,490
printers usually months and their
traffic throughout urs

283
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,480
they don't I'm switchers they'll have
their own management time management

284
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,360
course and you don't see them sending
traffic through this

285
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,620
the I'm arm for routers and they're all
the devices at the end to the day that

286
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,380
are being approached and I'm not

287
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,240
a fourteen other systems so basically

288
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,930
since I cannot control what I see and if
I can and cannot control the pace of the

289
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,870
discovery

290
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,170
it means that I cannot discover
everything that is on to the network

291
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:03,630
so if i connect locally to that network
non-broadcast any traffic is

292
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,099
the listener is a clear to basically oh
and I'll be detected

293
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,449
and he's the listener is a clear 3 it's
even worse because

294
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:13,600
I can do whatever I want on the local
summit and nobody will know the time

295
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,079
there

296
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:19,010
mom this is a good example to illustrate
the

297
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,939
the illustrator problem I'm usually
there are two ways of doing this

298
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:26,039
our first years of brokers listener that
is our

299
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:29,690
usually a local software installed of
one of the servers

300
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,890
and licence the workers traffic only and
another option is to insert

301
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,120
either in the line hardware or actually
put an out-of-band

302
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,549
our solution that is connected to the
switch and gets massive traffic

303
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:45,510
home as I mentioned earlier do their
three

304
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,530
person for most it's not real time
because if something is connected to the

305
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,480
network

306
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,490
we cannot make that something actually
send the traffic

307
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,070
through the router also that nonspecific
morning during point in access to the

308
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,700
local summit will be given

309
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,980
nothing can be done against it Ahmed
clear to

310
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:07,500
we can do other tricks two examples one
of them is on with Cisco Clean Access

311
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,669
this is actually taken from the IOM

312
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:14,440
or regional presentation the problem
here

313
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,700
is that the detection of the device

314
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,179
is actually being done here the stage

315
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:25,410
now you can see that from the device to
the comp to the

316
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:30,600
on actual component here the device may
connect through wireless device can

317
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,059
connect through many hopes the device
can do whatever he wants

318
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:37,918
what she wants well it's actually the
user on the device

319
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,950
so if I the user wishes to axis

320
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:45,650
anything that is not controlled by this
sauce over it can do it can do that

321
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:49,020
no problem there's nothing that actually
blokes

322
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,720
the device from doing so

323
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,559
another example is again with the with
Cisco

324
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:00,840
and this is I'm again a slide from there

325
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,970
our slide deck here concede that das on
the solution is actually

326
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:10,260
beam n roll through all the branches and
through all the data center

327
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:15,160
m'dear and the arm the presentation
basically says that he can basically

328
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,100
this and only the data center and you
don't need

329
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,470
to do anything that the branches can
someone tell me why this is not such

330
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,809
a good idea what at the end of the day

331
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:29,668
goes down lets the blaster what did go
down

332
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,950
the access not the core

333
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:36,480
because blaster so that's not a simple
room with the

334
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,940
with being capability basically can
bring down the sweetest the actor

335
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,150
switchers

336
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,169
from experience I can tell you that's

337
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:47,809
a lot of companies that had the Internet
connectivity running that was fine

338
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:52,750
because the course would survive but all
the access basic on faith

339
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:57,049
so what we want to avoid is we want to
avoid a situation in which in a certain

340
00:19:57,049 --> 00:19:57,820
branch

341
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,549
which may have an important date down or
still may have a lot of people

342
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:06,780
someone will contact will not be
identified

343
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,320
and would be able to do whatever he/she
wants

344
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,110
still in fact the in fact the elements
still day to do what I

345
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:17,309
whenever so if I concentrate my defense

346
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:20,658
only the data center day and I miss all
the branches

347
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:24,120
and not always the branches needs to go
through the headquarters for internet

348
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,409
access

349
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:29,620
so in that respect them control anything
rather than are saying that I control

350
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:35,250
just the stuff that goes through that
the sender this understood

351
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,740
another interesting example is all with
the Baucus listeners the idea of a

352
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,000
raucous listeners that

353
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,760
whatever we send broadcasted will be
heard by the workers listener

354
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,500
the problem here is that we can we can
actually are

355
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,230
teams that quite easily instead of
broadcasting the traffic

356
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,510
with for example the our prime example
here

357
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:59,700
i cant send unique us are complete
quests and not book a star

358
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,559
requests everybody in that will receive
that will be more than happy to reply to

359
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:08,418
those on request and we'll send me the
on the replies

360
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:14,190
signed up way I can actually communicate
with the router without any problem

361
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,539
receive the the routers some mac Address

362
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:21,830
and surf the internet would not call me
know so the brokers listener would not

363
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:25,340
even understand that my devices onto the
network

364
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:29,459
and will not be able to the fans the
network against what I'll do

365
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,919
this is just a simple ol simple example
for the what's worse the listener but we

366
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:34,850
will see

367
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:39,030
later on an example for the brokers
mister plus and the line device

368
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:45,299
and I'm a combo and we'll see how we can
bypass them as well

369
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:49,440
other examples some the TP mom

370
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,890
mom won the zip usually they put on the
solution put

371
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:56,520
and DTP relay server insulin before

372
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,740
and basically in France of the read all
these

373
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,030
the TP server the DTP server actually
gets the

374
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,168
the 2p requests hams I am

375
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:10,210
non revocable IP addresses and after do
not process

376
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:16,250
it basically nom allow the on request to
get to the original the TPC River

377
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:21,260
and there's a renewal for the IP address
this is another example of sentiment

378
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,890
detection because if I configure my
mission with a static IP address

379
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,900
nobody knows I'm there SNMP traps I

380
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,159
there's a trend on especially on Cisco
gear to dorm

381
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,960
turn on a trap which basically says that
tom

382
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,750
innu element guys connected due to the
fact that the new marketers is

383
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,030
registered on a certain

384
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:45,389
word this only works if you're I

385
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:48,750
sweets actually has this capability in
the software

386
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:52,120
the problem here is I mentioned earlier
is with the switches where are they in

387
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,320
the first place

388
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,590
and the second thing here is that Tom if
you don't know your infrastructure

389
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:01,370
then you have a real problem not the
real problem for doing this

390
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,850
on the second thing that I wanted to say
about this excuse me is basically to the

391
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:09,860
fact that the SNMP trap is being sent
the time to process the SNMP trap is

392
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,429
also a problem

393
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:14,549
because usually you'll have a gap that

394
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:18,730
football for some equipment will go
between thirty seconds to within two

395
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,929
minutes

396
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:24,280
before the information about the SNMP
traps will actually be processed by the

397
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,010
management

398
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:30,200
are so a management I server of that
particular solution

399
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,490
so the gap years between thirty seconds
to 2 minutes

400
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:38,460
that that element cannot can do whatever
on what everyone's on the network

401
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,559
how long how fast I did it take to

402
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:47,980
send the SQL warm how many packets then
the SQL warm had to send someone else

403
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,820
only one packet so sixties

404
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,840
30 seconds to 120 seconds that's a no go

405
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,080
because we need to block the access as
soon as a device and urs the network

406
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,350
rather than to wait for something to
trigger net

407
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:04,370
and allow it to the window of
opportunity to do whatever it wants on

408
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,539
the network

409
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:09,460
on a client software again our client
base software that cannot be installed

410
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,150
in certain operating systems

411
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:15,610
and again you're vulnerable here mom
other things that will not go into

412
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:19,830
how you defend from that enabled devices
are you didn't detect Mac

413
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:23,059
our virtualization makes huge problem
here

414
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:27,879
because basically if i I have a I have a
device with 1000 where woods and with

415
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,580
marlon elsewhere whenever

416
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:34,370
and I launch it in phnom not mode rather
than in a bridge mode

417
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:39,600
usually nobody will detect the presence
of that got reporting system

418
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,820
questions yes

419
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:51,820
I'll yet

420
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,309
mmm

421
00:24:55,309 --> 00:24:58,730
you refer to basically did to be
protection that some switches may have

422
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:03,490
the brown there's that on paper it looks
very nice the promise that if you don't

423
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,299
control

424
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:08,360
each and every switch and you filter on
each and every switch that doesn't work

425
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,409
because it's only it's only good it it
will sail

426
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:15,919
if you bring the switch that is not
consumer that way and if you don't

427
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,169
control your entire environment and the
access list that you have to introduce

428
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:22,470
on each and every switch basically will
not do that work because

429
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:27,350
your traffic will still be a roundtable
to be sent on other issue with that is

430
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,809
that

431
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:32,710
as as as your organization's internal
network goes

432
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:37,899
bigger your ability to actually control
the switches or control the relevance is

433
00:25:37,899 --> 00:25:39,620
met basically Lord

434
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:44,580
so in that respect if you want to make
sure that all the configuration actually

435
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,549
button is on day and our his where it
needs to be

436
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:51,510
you need to know the your entire
infrastructure in order to do so but

437
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,970
that's a valid defense actual

438
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,070
money nation is the

439
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:00,678
process of also rising devices are to
operate on the lam

440
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:04,330
on my identifying their identity

441
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:10,029
mom most devices and of the user's the
idea here is that we'll

442
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:14,059
ways to combat rogue devices this is
again tied with the

443
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:17,889
I element detection features and at the
end of the day this

444
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:22,419
on shows us why we must immediately
broke any rogue element that tries to

445
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:23,809
our connect to a network

446
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:26,908
the problem here is again I mention that
earlier

447
00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:30,360
not all of the on not to love the on

448
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,450
on Mac solutions will actually
authorized devices actually most of them

449
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,120
will not

450
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:40,600
arm and basically since they lack the
ability to understand the

451
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,240
contextual network information the time
gap that the certain element will have

452
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,570
to do whatever he wants on the on
network

453
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:51,080
where the user will have is it's quite
substantial

454
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:56,409
home on the other hand if %ah you look
at those solutions that Monday's on the

455
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,620
user authentication

456
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,620
and there's a problem here as well
because in the end of the day what we

457
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,520
I'm actually can do is we can bring any
talk of how the way we would like

458
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,120
use a username and password that is
violates

459
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,090
to the NOC solution and gain access to
the network with the road device

460
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:17,520
so technically speaking this is easier
stealing a user's identity

461
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,710
or for example I'm bringing my laptop
from home

462
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:24,410
multiple connect several devices

463
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:27,830
and do whatever I want on the network
because I have a username and password

464
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,669
that is valid throughout the network
access control solution

465
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:34,090
another example same slides

466
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:39,600
oMG you can read what is I am the army
no network access is blocked until

467
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,650
and the user the end-user our provides
login information

468
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,790
there's no relation whatsoever to the
endpoint

469
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:49,129
here basically you bring your device

470
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:53,340
you browse you're presented with them
I'll with a nice captive portal telling

471
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,770
you down on this agent

472
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:58,190
you down the agency put your username
and password of you go you're okay

473
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:04,980
a problem so in my opinion time to go
into the rice in the user is extremely

474
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:05,660
important

475
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:09,940
arm and it's basically creates a binding
which is needed for strong

476
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,480
authentication authorization and of
course for the thing

477
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,630
and Aiden identity is something that we
all are looking to have

478
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:22,250
are strong and story in our
organizations honor

479
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,450
quite Tom interesting example

480
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:30,470
it with dodi TP replacement service
basically a call this ID to be in a box

481
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:34,630
you get our DTP replacement server on
the way this works is

482
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,700
you request an IP address you get an
honorable

483
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,740
IP address here are red directed to some
kind of %ah and authentication portal

484
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,460
the authentication portal requires your
username and password

485
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,600
you provide your username and password

486
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,580
om the arm information has been checked
against

487
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:58,460
a user data storage and %uh user data
stewards and basically very far as an

488
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,710
author of course and the City of the
user

489
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:05,900
and there might be other check schools
are to follow in the end of the process

490
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,500
if the element is compliant and

491
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,990
Rd DTP server provides a real IP address
to the device what's the problem here

492
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:16,380
old attack I just in-store my linux
machine

493
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,090
on fear configure DHCP server and this
is a race

494
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:24,210
is my DHCP server answers first

495
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:28,410
the user will use my DHCP server and I
built my own captive portal

496
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:32,810
the same as the captive portal for the
organization yeah I provide our

497
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:37,669
as well as a user data storage and
basically St all the usernames and

498
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:38,230
passwords

499
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:43,130
so technically speaking this is %ah me
know an attack from the old days that I

500
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:43,990
can use here

501
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,340
and why is this size and much more
problematic

502
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,430
because with the users and passwords I
can do whatever I want on the domain I

503
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:54,020
can access whatever that I want to look
at the world around us

504
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,650
so this is like this for example Sep
made it uses data solutions

505
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:02,350
home we'll talk about 802.1x later

506
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:06,730
harm questions aka

507
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:10,480
okay so basically assessments

508
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,540
we talked about what it is the first
time thing that we want to do with

509
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,190
assessment

510
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:20,110
is for social identify classify the
underlying operating system that the

511
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,020
device has

512
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,420
life because we need to decide if we
want to put this device through

513
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,540
assessment or not

514
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,680
and are various ways to actually
classified device

515
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,710
our client base software active West
detection passing West detection tells

516
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,130
Chris got the portals

517
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:37,380
and some more stuff on

518
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,350
like anything in life haha not
everything is actually created equal

519
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:46,550
mom this is on an example for my on the
Cisco non-compliance

520
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:50,480
agent on the way that the agent actually
on

521
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,320
use the com on his ability to sneeze
traffic on the network was that it was

522
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,189
looking into the

523
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:03,680
user agent string and if it didn't calm
on the deal the disarmament is Windows

524
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,450
is basically let the device cool

525
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:08,880
on we all know that this is absolutely
no no no

526
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,360
and no of course there was a a patch for
this

527
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,380
comment also arm

528
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,640
it's got kinda interesting are the

529
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,430
you just read that it's calm

530
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:27,500
self-explanatory I'm basically what
Cisco said is that

531
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,470
are you can also use another feature in
the product which called nasa's camp

532
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:35,240
if you can remotely scanned the element
and get it operating system

533
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,930
going way to slides and see what this is
not gonna work

534
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,950
the assessment methods themselves

535
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:46,440
is a sitcom based client less dissolving
agents and remote from there billy scams

536
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,210
if I put an agent of course is great
from the advances points

537
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:53,870
wealth of information real time
protection the problem as

538
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,930
on the problem is not even work to
install the client

539
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:00,210
of course this is a problem with the
biggest ball is that this is a client

540
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,590
amongst many other clients and

541
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:08,720
arm I know from experience that I when
you come to a fork until company

542
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,250
I have a lot of friends who are mom in
them management

543
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,540
systems business and they saying okay I
we just need to install this client on

544
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,659
your desktop

545
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:23,370
here's the door thank you very much was
interesting but we're not interested

546
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:27,100
there's no room for another client on
the desktop periods there's so many

547
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:31,680
clients there and so many super clients
and basically it.

548
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,000
and help desk in operation will not let
you install another

549
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,460
client on the desktop it's not just the
management overhead

550
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,790
is not arm the even the amount that it
takes to implement

551
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,810
om it's the fact that

552
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:49,530
people just don't like agents in the
mornin don't want to use agents anymore

553
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:54,010
on the other hand I'm the other question
is where do I install the agent which is

554
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,610
another important question

555
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:59,110
because we don't know where to install
the agent

556
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,290
because we don't know one of the targets
so i think im

557
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:07,120
the chicken the end problem guess 22 or
the 80/20 rule you can call it whatever

558
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,300
but in the end they did a disk on sale
ha security issues

559
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:17,330
I am the one first rule that every every
consultant learns

560
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,880
is that no one can actually I'm I am

561
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,120
trust client site security there's no
such as the

562
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,300
such thing as client sites cutie

563
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:32,680
and there again some examples here I'm
sorry that this is all Cisco but

564
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,700
it's all public am and shown so first is
the

565
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,440
the agency itself and another something
which is extremely

566
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,470
are extremely important is the
communication between the NOC

567
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:47,960
agent and the server itself because if
you are able to falsify the

568
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,440
communication between the

569
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,470
agent and the server basically control
whatever

570
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:56,170
and there was a nice presentation I
think I'll

571
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:59,280
a year ago I'll call Mac attack

572
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:06,280
which basically I'm reverse engineer the
product

573
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,960
way

574
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:27,960
the we are many I user authentication

575
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:36,550
in on those cases it was I possible
possible

576
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:42,960
okay I it was possible to actually on
bypass the night framework because

577
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,990
user Tom authentication was not enable
so the

578
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:51,340
official response from Cisco as well we
we do have the ability to do a

579
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:53,330
vindication if you do have indication
you're

580
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:56,819
attack doesn't work like thats you know
not the case

581
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:01,160
mom so we'll see more not on occasions
or

582
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,430
mom be mad act in the future it's like a
on the virus

583
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:11,330
agents I am that are being targeted
today

584
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:15,200
because at the end of the day because at
the end of the day I'm

585
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,730
we know there are some viruses and once
that arm

586
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:22,670
LCS the anti virus is operating but the
right it's just the icon

587
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:26,880
his we can do any nation as well I'm

588
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,530
so that I actually brings us to the

589
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:37,530
only one agent there is up I me on

590
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:47,330
okay so there's also a trend that our
people say worse come some companies are

591
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:51,980
are say okay let's install a super agent
and will put anti-virus anti-spyware

592
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,610
personal file and he's been at him in
the future whatever you like

593
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:59,060
just tell you now $29.95 and

594
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:04,049
the problem is that everything is
located in one place so if I will be in

595
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:04,430
it

596
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:08,529
able to make this fail basically all a
few differences are useless

597
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:13,060
so arm is actually a very interesting
nom

598
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:17,270
trend was in the past two all the file
will the VPN you know traditionally were

599
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:21,960
board into a single box still no
checkpoint with analysts on single boxes

600
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,880
cope with them on

601
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,940
no different boxes but who cares it
works right we we don't mind it worse

602
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,420
everybody does with the reviews on that
one but the arm

603
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,470
super consolidation trend of though two
years ago let's put everything on the

604
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,660
same box and puts

605
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:40,080
everything on on that and the other day
it's not gonna fly because I'm you need

606
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:40,720
to use

607
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,450
especially large organizations uses
different products for different things

608
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,030
and from different vendors

609
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:49,750
so your email is getting processed by
three four different vendors your

610
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:53,490
other our corporate stuff being now
filtered by three four different

611
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:56,580
things and also you can't really put
everything on the same boxes and more

612
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:01,009
okay agent lists all this a great
approach

613
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:05,420
nah nothing to stole fast deployment our
custom checks on the fly because you

614
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,140
only need to change it on the service
I'm

615
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:11,089
the on the other hand you need the
willingness of the other party to say

616
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:11,740
okay

617
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:15,600
let's work together I'm willing to give
you the axis

618
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,670
not actually a problem because I'm not
although devices so I will give you that

619
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,100
the ability to access them

620
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,920
are Manning and the communication
between the solution and the Vice omics

621
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,680
an excellent that recurs well

622
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,899
on the zoning agent this is our this is
my r1 favorites I

623
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:36,260
everybody say no you're with his ActiveX
word JavaScript or

624
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:39,620
you know Java component does this in
those that well for some 40

625
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:43,400
to be problems local administration
rights for power user rights

626
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,580
okay we are the people and most of the
people get this

627
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,200
administration access to their machines
but there some people

628
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,550
which will never assigned administration
administrator access to their boxes

629
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:58,860
and the other one is that if I want my
browser

630
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,160
especially with the

631
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:05,859
visto or are the new Obama versions of
the suspect in stocks I need to lower

632
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:10,009
the security level my browser to level
which I called mi casa su casa basically

633
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:12,180
by open everything that you can do to me

634
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,950
in order to what is my securities what
do they do just do my security on my

635
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:16,630
browser

636
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:21,319
got you to arm you know assess what they
have and now my browser security is so

637
00:38:21,319 --> 00:38:22,799
low that they know the

638
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:26,109
the whatever you do to me I'm just my
inclined breaks

639
00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:33,109
so this doesn't work in the whole and my
favorite one is there a more

640
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,530
vulnerability scans

641
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:37,890
okay how many of you don't use personal
firewall

642
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:43,480
thank you I prove my point we can
continue arm

643
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:48,579
also there some quite interesting stuff
here what are we actually taking

644
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:53,400
okay so as far as hi mom

645
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:58,079
checking service pack if I'm taking our
signature files actually it's hard it

646
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,650
seems possible as on the vendor

647
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:04,279
but if I checked the suspects of Texas
and stuff like that go to registry

648
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:07,529
create the intruder great

649
00:39:07,529 --> 00:39:11,349
what'd works mom why is this so easy

650
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:15,510
because Microsoft does not provide any
kind of proof that

651
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:18,349
something has actually been installed
they're not going to school this

652
00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:19,089
information

653
00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:23,140
so the other day you can say oh my I
want to know that the page number

654
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,078
doesn't this was actually install your
machine

655
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:28,579
when I won't tell you exactly what we
changed with the dll's

656
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:33,079
what we're actually done so that's what
we're a little be left with

657
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,760
to this one thing the other things as I
said again it's the

658
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,160
communication channel between the young
com neck into the server

659
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,828
and here the reason I'm actually some
cool stuff that you can do

660
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:49,069
on you can do replay attacks and you can
actually do its missions wolf

661
00:39:49,069 --> 00:39:52,549
so if you're able to understand what is
being sent

662
00:39:52,549 --> 00:39:56,788
and if the protocol is not that good we
can actually understand what has been

663
00:39:56,789 --> 00:39:58,270
said between done at Cajun

664
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,380
and the server rooms than what is
actually being Nam

665
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:06,829
checked was fine I'm me happy questions
and to this point

666
00:40:06,829 --> 00:40:10,329
before I get to another interesting
topic

667
00:40:10,329 --> 00:40:14,690
okay so basically exceptions

668
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,710
if I cannot do something

669
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:21,029
and the process are some nice solutions
games lol

670
00:40:21,029 --> 00:40:24,549
onto an exceptional give you in all
three baskets like in Disneyland

671
00:40:24,549 --> 00:40:28,430
you going to him to you the free passes
a okay come back into and you just go of

672
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,890
the art thing and that's it

673
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:36,078
the problem is that if we use and
acknowledged your technology like 802.1x

674
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:42,240
will have devices that we need on that
we need them to operate in our

675
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,000
environment like our his four hundred

676
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,049
and the printers the four devices on
that country run

677
00:40:48,049 --> 00:40:51,980
anything for does not comply with
Annan's 1x what do you do

678
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,430
arm you simply go insane

679
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:58,700
home post killed ron the whatever

680
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:02,010
can be granted access to the network
using manually configure exceptions my

681
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,390
Mac or IP address

682
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:07,089
who now with your Google VoIP device

683
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:10,230
even better just send me the CB message

684
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:14,700
and don't give you access great and even
better

685
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,020
if we got him to your home the scheme us
if your Mac

686
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:21,140
you'll be great okay so

687
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,720
this is great but I don't know nothing
about the device

688
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,520
because those solutions basically don't
tell me what's the operating system for

689
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,670
devices where it is actually connected

690
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:35,039
what's the type of the elements mom is
this the same parameters that we

691
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:38,279
observed before my printer now turn into
our windows vista

692
00:41:38,279 --> 00:41:41,859
or Linux so what we do

693
00:41:41,859 --> 00:41:45,200
as we go to the printer all the printers
now has this %ah

694
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,500
capability even at home I R HP All in
One Deacon

695
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,240
go and play in the print all the
configuration you know wasting your

696
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,279
Inc thank you HB and now there's a need
right so this is the Mac it is is the

697
00:41:56,279 --> 00:41:59,670
configuration this everything other you
take the printer the cutoff line input

698
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:03,059
your device and thank you's with the
matters and get get the

699
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:06,690
axis of the printer to print just bring
to write

700
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,450
I am actually on when I did this
presentation

701
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:14,410
mom back in the US so you're go on
there's someone who came to me and said

702
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:16,700
why not putting the printer in their own
subnet

703
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,569
it's a good idea it's not a bad idea but
the problem is that you need to do all

704
00:42:20,569 --> 00:42:22,950
you for printers across the routers
that's not a good idea

705
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:27,970
just our do our on do a test to see how
much traffic is actually consumed by

706
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:32,660
printing not are not that Tom on I say
the although

707
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:36,348
believe the printers in the same some
it's not the medieval so this is the

708
00:42:36,349 --> 00:42:37,170
exceptions

709
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:40,250
harm 802.1x

710
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:43,450
is now because prong with the exceptions
because this is a username

711
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:47,140
password based particle nothing more
than that you need a software agents to

712
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,058
do the extras

713
00:42:48,059 --> 00:42:51,339
where you need a software agent in order
to do the use and ask for stuff

714
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:55,828
mom it's difficult to manage not
everything is

715
00:42:55,829 --> 00:42:59,470
is on actually supporting a time to 1x
from the client side in front a

716
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:00,450
networking side

717
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:03,630
there's a huge cost for this how many no

718
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:08,329
how many implementations worldwide
802.1x is doing on the land side

719
00:43:08,329 --> 00:43:11,660
nearly nothing because it's really hard

720
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,000
actually do and roll 802.1x into the
wire side

721
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,520
on the wireless side great on the wire
side

722
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:23,210
some gonna fly I'm going to their with
the money

723
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:26,599
mom so basically after you've rested
your money at 802.1x

724
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:30,430
on a wire side you now need to
understand you want to enable that so we

725
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:33,890
need to profile of your devices that
actually operates on the network

726
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:38,470
and you need to decide who cannot do
802.1x and surprise surprise

727
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:42,710
30-40 percent for network cannot do been
on to next

728
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:46,910
okay we just invested all the money we
just invest a lot of our mentor into law

729
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,160
in just a moment to stroke a

730
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,190
and use the problem okay questions

731
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:56,609
I'm going are still five minutes from
the

732
00:43:56,609 --> 00:44:00,569
from a coffee or from whatever on others
go through

733
00:44:00,569 --> 00:44:04,190
quentin fast it's actually a and I some

734
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:08,279
nice idea so basically im arm

735
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:13,319
quarantine is the place and when I mean
the place it is the place

736
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:17,210
why because all the bad boys many girls
for

737
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:22,160
no been politically correct here being
put into the corn team

738
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,339
I am basically I didn't comply with
something

739
00:44:25,339 --> 00:44:30,430
I need to remedy this the user and I
mean put in a temporary holding place

740
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:33,848
the access is granted only to the
remediation sever but

741
00:44:33,849 --> 00:44:37,960
mom thing that we need to understand the
soft targets of the entire organization

742
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,420
are now being put into one place in the
quarantine

743
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:45,150
Serrano ways to do quarantine using
access-list

744
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:49,980
are using a dedicated some at are
dedicated feel and private freelance

745
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,109
purse which word

746
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:54,980
manipulating architects entries and some
others

747
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:59,049
some Indiana the name one of my favorite
one is the

748
00:44:59,049 --> 00:45:03,980
com public now public wanting the public
won't be basically means

749
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,980
doubt be allows communication between

750
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:10,140
all the quarantine devices so

751
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:16,509
home this is what I i called the South
infecting the lamp

752
00:45:16,509 --> 00:45:20,849
up with all my devices into one place my
get into that the Honda

753
00:45:20,849 --> 00:45:24,089
Dark One team holding place and Miami's

754
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:28,549
to infect you will easy right because
those orders of targets I have access

755
00:45:28,549 --> 00:45:32,930
soul what are we doing here also if you
like to attack the soft targets

756
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:37,450
not a virus or on fewer hacker or
someone with malicious intense

757
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:40,990
and you want to try to abuse something
which is a zero-day

758
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:44,569
and you know that you can abuse it this
is the place for you to be

759
00:45:44,569 --> 00:45:48,270
because then you can inject whatever you
want into the device a on the rise

760
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:49,869
working

761
00:45:49,869 --> 00:45:54,450
11 I'm great aspire is working as well
who everyone in the high single draw the

762
00:45:54,450 --> 00:46:00,440
vice even if the device pastor past
whatever checks your Mac Konami had

763
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,710
home I learned on the things I'm only on
TV Land

764
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:07,940
arm the idea of dynamically assigning

765
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:11,009
are are beyond ID's to the board's

766
00:46:11,009 --> 00:46:14,270
if you don't know the way this works is
there's a new element

767
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:18,180
which automatically has been assigned to
the quarantine the line there are

768
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:21,390
chance that are being done and only then
it's been

769
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:24,470
are basically i picking out the corn TV
Land

770
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:27,910
the problem here is that if you're in a
really control environment like

771
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:31,368
finance institutes bank whatever mom be
or

772
00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:34,460
change control people who are all these
people really like you because we'll

773
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:37,589
never have the ability to actually
deploy this because there's no warning

774
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:38,750
whatsoever

775
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:43,309
not be are real and I'm ID's are gonna
change for for the airports

776
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:47,309
dynamical nothing is not going to happen
I'm also

777
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:50,349
on if you remember I talked about
relying on the infrastructure to provide

778
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:53,059
with the capability which is basic

779
00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:56,079
for network access control this is a
good example

780
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,299
if I don't have this widget that allows
me to do this

781
00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:03,809
I can provide with it so what I'm going
on by a solution from a nap vendor as

782
00:47:03,809 --> 00:47:07,470
and then I need to go to our
infrastructure vendor and buy a the

783
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:08,380
switchers

784
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:13,240
and I need to see that they both play in
the same area personal gonna fly because

785
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:17,910
the amount of money that you need to
invest into making your infrastructure

786
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:21,808
actually capable of working with this is
a lot of money as well as

787
00:47:21,809 --> 00:47:25,049
the fact that this is on only appear
board for

788
00:47:25,049 --> 00:47:28,440
device policy Hobbs

789
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:33,470
you all know them on minutes which I'm
the US you go to CompUSA 4:30 box you

790
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:37,279
get a five port 10/100/1000 dealings
which

791
00:47:37,279 --> 00:47:41,359
transport really cool we have like
trillions of dollars at work

792
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,920
everyone wants one so whenever I go to
the US and bringing one thing new one

793
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,660
okay

794
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:49,109
but if you're at your place of work
you'll find non manage the

795
00:47:49,109 --> 00:47:53,828
switchers the switches that you bought
five six seven eight years ago and now

796
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:57,400
been pushed to the axis sometimes it
happens because not all of us can buy

797
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,099
all the switches all together

798
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:02,619
and they're on managed so the actor's
house and then for therefore you can't

799
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:03,750
do

800
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:08,400
you do this on against them mother and
then that the one last thing I would

801
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,569
like to mention is the read/write access

802
00:48:10,569 --> 00:48:14,220
you need to the switches in order to do
those dangers

803
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,009
and again go to your networking people
there will be more than happy to provide

804
00:48:17,009 --> 00:48:18,619
you with that

805
00:48:18,619 --> 00:48:22,190
arm the private corn team who is the
solution in my opinion for that

806
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:25,619
basically putting the element into
private the cyano

807
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:28,720
that prevents are prevents others

808
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,970
from communicating with it and prevents
his communication

809
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:35,309
with 12 other Quintino comments this can
do

810
00:48:35,309 --> 00:48:39,150
this can be actually beam are done in
private be lanced where to base metals

811
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,700
and other things

812
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,839
a good example why there are three basic
point in his bed

813
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,299
on the line hardware doesn't die

814
00:48:49,299 --> 00:48:53,220
actually do a lot if I just blocks the
access to other parts of the network are

815
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:56,109
basically on not allow this is loud

816
00:48:56,109 --> 00:49:00,989
I can not tried to harm market that is
the vices use it as an axis proxy to

817
00:49:00,989 --> 00:49:02,630
other parts of the network

818
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:06,190
on the other ways to a play with his
attacks

819
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:09,779
also when is the quarantine enabled nom

820
00:49:09,779 --> 00:49:13,319
only when an elm and no man should be
assessed after the SS model

821
00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:16,569
assessment or immediately and then the
answer is immediately

822
00:49:16,569 --> 00:49:20,270
because we don't know the device we
don't know what this device holds

823
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:23,210
we don't know what's running on the
device and we don't know if the user is

824
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,630
authenticated devices authorize

825
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:29,299
not actually happening here so if you
are assessing an import export all

826
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,450
solution

827
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:34,509
then look for this device needs to be
quarantine immediately

828
00:49:34,509 --> 00:49:37,799
so the risks that may be arm

829
00:49:37,799 --> 00:49:42,079
put by this device to the organization
will be minimized

830
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,079
arm on their foresman science

831
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,670
basically home moms gone go through this
fast

832
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:53,160
on there are various ways to do I force
mentally 3 there too

833
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,618
and the switch level arm

834
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:59,650
usually those which level it's only
purport per device

835
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:03,099
I can see the various on ways to do this
here

836
00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:06,910
arm the one example in with time

837
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:10,210
wanted to speak about was the worthless
listener Neil and Alaskan waters

838
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:12,319
actually a solution that use a snack

839
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,720
so basically you have a broker's
listener on a local network enemy mine

840
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,009
device that are worse is an IPS on their
three

841
00:50:19,009 --> 00:50:24,230
mom the problem is that you need to
completely retarded doctor network

842
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:28,279
on the line devices are going to failure
on if you want to have redundancy to X

843
00:50:28,279 --> 00:50:30,210
2.2 X they all cost

844
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:33,930
and again you don't get to identify the
device

845
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:38,160
so the device not only that the device
is not identified

846
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,200
I love that you can actually bypass the
local our listener

847
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,970
on this critical solution do not to even
provide with device auto relation I do

848
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:48,049
not provide user authentication

849
00:50:48,049 --> 00:50:52,369
to simply put if you just manipulates
duopoly question don't broadcast

850
00:50:52,369 --> 00:50:54,170
anything to the network

851
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:57,650
you're happy to our to basically connect
to the network because

852
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:00,890
the u9 device X axe as an IPS

853
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:05,779
only it's not actually integrated with
the I'll with the most business news so

854
00:51:05,779 --> 00:51:07,960
it doesn't actually block access

855
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,380
from those I P others as it sees a
player 3 that weren't actually

856
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:14,970
authorized by the local Baucus listener

857
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:19,819
arm

858
00:51:19,819 --> 00:51:22,869
resources questions still does

859
00:51:22,869 --> 00:51:28,400
two minutes late questions

860
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,660
once twice okay so

861
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:33,770
thank you for having me mendota
conference
