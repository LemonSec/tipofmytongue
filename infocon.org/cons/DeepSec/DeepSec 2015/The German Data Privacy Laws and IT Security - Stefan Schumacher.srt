1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,089
and I'm one of the regular speakers here
keep psyche and enforceable like to

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:11,950
introduce myself I started to work with
computers in 1987 with this beautiful

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:17,160
East German small computer with 1.7 and
a doctor Dr meaning all the computer

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,189
programs are stored on this was a
triumph I'm also one of the editors of

5
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,810
the this year's steep section
proceedings called the deep-sea

6
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,359
chronicles vol 1 together with money I
produced the book I was the guy

7
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,489
responsible for all the technical stuff
so the PDF file for printing service was

8
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,480
produced by me and you can get the book
at the reception desk and we hope to

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,699
produce much more are many more

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,129
proceedings for the future upcoming
conferences

11
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:51,099
my research goes into social engineering
and security awareness I talked two day

12
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,520
workshop about social engineering that's
one or more affected by it but he also

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,960
do research in the field of psychology
of security meaning we do try to develop

14
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,530
tactics security and cryptography we do

15
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,110
qualitative research about the
construction of security individuals how

16
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:14,850
do people create that concept of
security was not affected by the snow

17
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:21,600
and leagues and other stuff and programs
and Germany will travel government

18
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,070
authorities and officers about I T
security in very small enterprises

19
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:31,658
meaning we talk about business at the
don't even have I T stuff they don't

20
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:36,799
even have system administrators and how
are they supposed to do I T security and

21
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,310
that's where our data privacy laws come
into play

22
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,280
historically the debate about data
privacy and data processing started in

23
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,240
the nineteen fifties 1960's when
computers became powerful and affordable

24
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,089
governments wanted to collect and
analyze data they wanted to do something

25
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,399
United States John F Kennedy started a
program which spun off huge debate about

26
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,550
data information and knowledge as being

27
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,429
a massive power especially in Germany
and West Germany the population was not

28
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:12,450
happy with this development and the
scientific and political debate begun

29
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:18,060
which led to later to data privacy laws
the first data privacy law worldwide was

30
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,430
introduced on the German federal state
of Hesse in 1917 and was made into a

31
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:28,070
federal law and West Germany in 1977 a
debate about our privacy did not exist

32
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,459
in east germany because we had slightly
different problems with privacy

33
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:38,490
monitoring in 1981 every West German
federal state had the data privacy law

34
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:44,770
installed and introduced the data
privacy laws are based on the concept of

35
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,520
so-called information or
self-determination developed in the

36
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:56,590
German discussion about data and privacy
and want to sign the site this taxed in

37
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,560
the context of modern data processing
the protection of the individual against

38
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,040
unlimited collection storage use and
disclosure of his or her personal data

39
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,040
is encompassed by the general personal
rights of the German constitution this

40
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,870
basic right warrants in this respect the
capacity of the individual to determine

41
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,620
in principle the disclosure and use of
his or her personal data limitations to

42
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,810
this information as South determination
not only in case of overriding public

43
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:32,430
interest that means we have the the
concept that I can say what what has

44
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,190
access to my dad taught about my life my
personal information my name I address

45
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:42,890
my agenda my sex my health sciences and
everything else and it's not only the

46
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,059
right but it's a ride according to the
German constitution which means it can't

47
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:53,290
be canceled and is protected by
constitutional rights so to sum it up

48
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,160
what does it mean administration on
federal offices of government offices

49
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,410
and companies are not allowed to gather
data about costs or what about me

50
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,200
administration and companies are not
allowed to process data about me and

51
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,569
they are not allowed to share data with
others

52
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:14,950
around me unless they are legally
allowed to a law is saying they are not

53
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,728
to do so for example when i buy
something at an online shop in

54
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:24,008
mail-order retailer of a legally allowed
to process my address to send me an

55
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:32,449
invoice the package agreed to it and
we're certain limitations they cannot

56
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:37,650
forcefully to underwrite an agreement
that they are now to process my daughter

57
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,929
for example when I want to buy stuff
they are not allowed to force me to

58
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,639
allow them to use my daughter for
marketing that has to be an active in

59
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:52,849
the right to not give the allowance to
process model for marketing purposes

60
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,500
the main concept of data protection we
have in germany as defined by the laws

61
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:06,830
is that data processing data gathering
is provided with a reservation

62
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,960
authorization which means it is
forbidden unless it is allowed by law or

63
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,099
by the person affected we also use the
concert of dollars a reduction and other

64
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:21,199
economy if you don't need the doctor if
you don't you don't you are not allowed

65
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,830
to gather able to process it

66
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:29,770
point is the so-called necessity if the
dog is not necessary to fulfill your

67
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,609
task you're not allowed to gather it for
some but you're not allowed to ask me

68
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,610
for my birthday if you just want to send
me an invoice because for sending an

69
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:44,830
invoice you don't need you don't have to
know the date of mothers day before step

70
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:49,080
four point is this appropriation which
means tough times only allowed to be

71
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,639
processed for the proposed that was
collected so even if a company for

72
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:59,680
example a mail-order company knows my
address and banking done they are only

73
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,490
allowed to use it for sending me the
invoice or semi the package they are not

74
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:09,229
allowed to use these proposals for Tamil
they are not allowed to some marketing

75
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:10,700
letter advertisements

76
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,550
other stuff or check or do background
checks based on my address on the

77
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:20,450
incumbent is there a lot of possible to
assume

78
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,990
assumptions about my income based on my
address because out on part in town

79
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,040
which are cheap which are more expensive
part in town but people with high paying

80
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,720
job lips and people places where people
who are jobless and based on this

81
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,870
address he could make such an assumption
which they are legally not allowed to do

82
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:46,030
so there is a quote from Thomas hops was
sad and Covenants with all the sport

83
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,719
about wars and other no strings to
secure a man at all which means there

84
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:56,790
has to be someone with a small board who
is unable to supervise and therefore we

85
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:01,750
have several supervisors and Germany the
first and highest ranking is the federal

86
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,240
data protection officer who is
responsible for all the federal agency

87
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:11,790
so every government agency from the
German federal government has to be

88
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,730
supervised by him or her every from
religion and state also has a known data

89
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:20,730
protection officer who's responsible for
the agencies of the federal state for

90
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:25,440
example the state the police of the
state and federal police but they also

91
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,330
the supervisors of companies have their
headquarters in this federal state so if

92
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,359
you had very very uncivilized
responsible for you if you had to

93
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,360
produce a bill in the buildin supervises
responsible for you

94
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:45,320
companies also have to have an internal
data protection officer depending on the

95
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,280
number of employees and what type of
data plan there's legal limitations very

96
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,859
small companies usually don't have to
have one unless they are processing very

97
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,740
very sensitive data like doctor was a
medical information or something

98
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:09,880
hospitals physicians and other
professionals the supervisor can also

99
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:15,850
shut down and confiscate the UT System
of a company that does not obeying the

100
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:20,290
Data Protection or so if there's a data
leakage or break in this they can simply

101
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:24,570
go there and get all the I T shut down
and take them with them to exert extra

102
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:31,219
money and this usually is actually like
a death penalty for companies offer most

103
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,920
companies today if the ideas as
confiscated the current workers

104
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:41,728
supervisors can give up monetary
penalties usually limited to 50,000

105
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:47,230
jewel in Germany but it's quite
interesting and many executives and

106
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,590
board members from companies don't know
is that the company can get this money

107
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,550
back from the board members of the board
of the executives so if a penalty is

108
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:01,339
given to accompany the management board
of directors of the company can be

109
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:09,430
forced to pay it from the private income
they don't only supervised companies but

110
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,140
they also offer help for example if you
have a problem with you I T and you're

111
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,800
not sure if there is a problem is not a
privacy or security you can contact them

112
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,329
in a trans and asked him to help they
are willing and happy to help companies

113
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:27,030
many companies only see them at the guy
who comes to punish but they also are

114
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:36,220
there to help you there was some years
ago we had to pay an amount of 1.46

115
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:42,060
million viewers as a penalty for
breaching the data privacy law it

116
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:47,719
amounts to 1.56 million 1.46 million
Europe across several companies are

117
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:54,600
broken down regionally and some of them
hired private investigators to look for

118
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:00,740
stuffed in in stores and they also money
towards the people working there which

119
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:07,990
they installed cameras in the changing
rooms and toilets and huge penalty by

120
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:16,900
officers of the responsive fertile
country of federal state companies will

121
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:22,910
have to happen in company data privacy
officer have to have one who checks the

122
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:28,770
data privacy measures of the company
responsible to check all privacy and

123
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:34,079
also the iraqi security measures which
with regard to data privacy the data

124
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,270
privacy officer in a company has to
report directly to the board and the

125
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:45,510
executive depending on the legal form of
the company's share holder company or

126
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:51,530
other form but interesting DEP Data
Privacy Officer has no power to direct

127
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:56,170
you can only give his report to the
board and the board has to take the

128
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:04,800
actions this also means our Privacy
Officer is not reliable or is not

129
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:09,509
responsible for that he could just
another problem that's always the

130
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:15,809
problem of the day of the Board or the
executive managers c-level executives to

131
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:20,040
protect the data privacy officer he
cannot be fired a very severe reasons

132
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,769
like he stole money from the company
other stuff happens he cannot be fired

133
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:32,509
for being a doctor Privacy Officer thats
to protect because they usually company

134
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:36,670
to do very unpopular stuff stuff that
costs money but in the story of the

135
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:40,389
people working there or they assume that
it in the same and other things

136
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:45,540
according to the law the data privacy
officer has to be reliable and skilled

137
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,459
that's all that the law says one can
debate what reliable and skilled means

138
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:54,128
in this context means he has to
understand I T

139
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:59,800
security he has to understand laws which
can get very very complicated I'm

140
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,160
working as an external companies and
we're coming looking for hospital and a

141
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,579
special lost to hospitals because it
very very sensitive data the legalese

142
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:13,120
and these documents can get really
really hard to understand it you have to

143
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,679
be become have a lawyer on your own you
also have to understand dat and you have

144
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:22,319
to understand what kind of doctor on so
you have to know what all the physicians

145
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:29,719
physicians talk about ninety systems
most companies usually use an external

146
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,279
consultant because their companies or
people who offer these services they are

147
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:35,920
trained in it they know what to do

148
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,689
bigger companies usually have lawyers MT
security experts working together and it

149
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:47,730
also is usually cheaper because the
Internet Data Privacy Officer has to be

150
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:53,120
powerful usually three to five years and
that means you cannot file this employee

151
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,129
if you use an internal data privacy
officer he's protected for these three

152
00:12:57,129 --> 00:13:01,779
to four years and that is something many
companies don't want to rely on external

153
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:10,779
one of them as one of the things the
data privacy law wants to do companies

154
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:17,079
directory of procedures it's a directory
as a paper which is required as personal

155
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:21,920
data which usually affects every company
is no company that does not have

156
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,179
personal data and be just the banking
account information of their own

157
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:30,488
employees it's personal data and
therefore they do need a data privacy

158
00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:37,559
officer and director of procedures this
directory is a list of all procedures

159
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:42,689
that process personal data write down
every process of a procedure that

160
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:48,889
excesses that exercise personal data for
example this happens usually in the

161
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:52,790
application process my people who
employee who apply for a job in your

162
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,629
company usually Sandton personal data
replication let it and they have to be

163
00:13:56,629 --> 00:14:02,170
protected access to these let us not
everyone in the company has to have

164
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:05,229
access to these letters only those who
are directly involved in the hiring

165
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:11,459
process personal records of your
employees can be private if your company

166
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:15,790
members are allowed to use either
personally for personal proposes

167
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:21,209
private and is also protected that means
you cannot directly access the email

168
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:29,399
accounts another topic are disciplinary
warning letters they have to have they

169
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:33,619
have to be stored in the file but not
everyone has to know about them not

170
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:39,420
everyone has the right to access them
directly procedures is usually crowded

171
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,649
into parts the first part of the
so-called public part which has to be

172
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:48,629
handed out to anyone who wants one so if
you have company and your processing

173
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:53,879
private data anyone can ask anyone can
ask you

174
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:07,859
anyone can ask you to get this directory
and all these processes and procedures

175
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:14,680
which are written down there the second
part of the directory is the so-called

176
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,899
internal part and this is an internal
products quite interesting because Jesus

177
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:24,000
used to describe the security measures
and is only meant to be seen by

178
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,110
companies to find his security people
and by the local supervisor so if the

179
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:34,700
supervisor office comes to accompany the
usually demand to see the internal part

180
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,700
of the director of procedures

181
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:50,449
this is the point where I T security
dieter comes into place every thing

182
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:55,339
every procedure you described in this in
this directory about ninety securities

183
00:15:55,339 --> 00:16:00,329
only meant for internal purposes for the
company or for the supervisor stuff

184
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:08,560
director of procedures fair to describe
the process of data processing involved

185
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:15,279
stuff who has access to the data which
usually means you have executives you

186
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,100
have the system administrator you have
the person who directly accessible data

187
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:24,399
sampled accountants have access to the
banking account of the employees the

188
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,110
source where the personal data comes
from the object of data processing why

189
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:34,010
do you have to start off in your data
bases in your fire why do you need to

190
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:38,660
start you have to justify that you are
allowed to have to start either by law

191
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:44,110
or by written permission but those who
also taught on and then you have to give

192
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:48,699
a list of people or organizations that
received this personal data if there's

193
00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:55,910
someone next on the company that
received some people might for example

194
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:03,860
be typical case for federal cortex
officers they usually do the taxes for

195
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,890
companies and they get the start and
they are allowed to because tax officers

196
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:08,760
also have to

197
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,199
have very high standards of data
protection and they usually have them so

198
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:18,870
that from you want to keep those
officers of the government's because

199
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:21,869
they have to calculate the taxes for the
employees

200
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:27,230
this is demanded by law therefore you
are allowed to have to start on give it

201
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:34,580
to these texts officers and federal tax
officers the main Christians are the

202
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,270
main proposals the diet director of
procedures to answer these questions

203
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:46,270
what does the company where does it come
from how did we get that data is it

204
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:53,280
legally or illegally gathered auto
correct every person has the right to

205
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,860
demand that incorrect answer be
corrected at once

206
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:04,719
who attended illegal incorrect data
who's the culprit where and how fast is

207
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,100
it into Alley externally external
consultants and lost external companies

208
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,310
and such

209
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:14,510
who has access to the data which can be
quite a complicated question to answer

210
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:19,040
and are there any external companies
involved if so I'll be in the European

211
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:27,940
Union in other states like the USB data
privacy laws Legal you are not allowed

212
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:33,960
to give time to send out our two
companies situated in countries with the

213
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,690
data privacy laws are the standard ones
and some of you might have heard the

214
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:41,280
European Union

215
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:50,080
court said that the safe harbor treaty
with the USA is not legally binding

216
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,510
anymore which means that we are not
allowed to send private data and the

217
00:18:54,510 --> 00:19:02,430
data protection standards the most
interesting part in the internal

218
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:09,140
director of procedures technical
organizational measures or tom is

219
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,730
required in them to another person and
it's a quiet not to be published its not

220
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:17,270
given out as just there for your company
for the head of the companies for the

221
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:22,379
system administrators aunty security
staff and of course for supervisors if

222
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,640
they want to see yet because this is my
paycheck if you're not as highly

223
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:31,040
protected the first part only tell them
what happened whether it is in this part

224
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:36,500
you have to show them how you protect
the start off by encryption by storing

225
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,290
the finals in a vault or something else
so it is found to describe all the

226
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:46,820
technical and organizational measures to
secure data but unfortunately it uses a

227
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,470
very different terminology when we use a
ninety security we have established

228
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:56,060
terms and I D security those are not
used in this part because it was mostly

229
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:01,120
developed by government officials and
oil so it's a lot of times in there and

230
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:08,229
sometimes complicated could have stuck
with German terms the standards we use a

231
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,230
naughty security we have a lot of
standards in this field

232
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:22,060
different there is a list given by the
law which kind of measures have to check

233
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:26,540
and this time described in this document
and these are the physical access

234
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:31,800
control of the server rooms locked if
the officers are locked if there are

235
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:38,270
special safety or security doors or
gateways document files and tape are

236
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:42,670
locked away or stay are stored on the
desks another one as access control

237
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:49,420
which means you lose stuff like that
uses with passwords controlled affairs

238
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:57,900
and effect on to identification with
your keys are is a consult then you have

239
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,280
to speak about the user access control
role-based access control typically

240
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,770
these things like access control lists
groups are different groups for some of

241
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:12,810
the accountants are in one computer
access to all the marketing team usually

242
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:19,879
you're also required to give categories
four-dot IVF different after you have to

243
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,960
give the category for these downtown
after explaining who has access to it

244
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,890
was allowed to access it you have to
give information about 20 disclosure or

245
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,630
transfer control for example if you have
stored

246
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:38,379
Bangalore of although some wells you
have to describe how they are checked

247
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:44,110
old are secured for troubled by
encryption they are stored in a safe and

248
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:48,379
secure so that can't be accessed by the
person looking at the bank

249
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:54,500
the next point is quite interesting if
the input control basically the question

250
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,410
who is the daughter and who is
responsible for mistakes put in wrong

251
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:03,980
data and the single input control
produces lock file which is very

252
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:10,140
sensitive data so by setting up a locked
file which locks interests are you

253
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:15,770
produce another process which creates a
personal data which has two kept private

254
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:20,260
and it actually means that for this
input control LOC you have to have

255
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:24,330
another input controller and so on so
you end up in a pretty interesting

256
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:33,240
situation this is also very problematic
because technically you could look every

257
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:42,570
key on a keyboard which would allow you
to supervise you could check if they

258
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:48,360
type fast enough they make brakes if
they are not working this is very very

259
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,219
sensitive data actually a conflict with
the idea of data privacy and data

260
00:22:53,220 --> 00:23:00,280
protection so companies usually you set
up a list of people who are now to

261
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,220
access an input on time keep this list
technical measures are very very

262
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,730
complicated so actually from a technical
point of view could use keyloggers but

263
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:15,600
these would be against the law and other
things Commission control if you give up

264
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,480
downtown processes to for example the
tax office you have to legally require

265
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,130
them to follow the German data privacy
lobbyists and they have to obey orders

266
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:32,210
so basically guarantee you in inviting
the pain will obey to the towns of

267
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,279
privacy laws and they will not

268
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:41,559
the next step is availability control
which means you have backups you may

269
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:45,629
have friended and systems of standby
systems ups and so on which is basically

270
00:23:45,629 --> 00:23:52,009
just a part of fighting security and the
next to last stop the signal gatien

271
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:56,479
control which means data collected four
different proposals has to be stored and

272
00:23:56,479 --> 00:24:01,960
processed segregated you're not allowed
to mix up your current clients and

273
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,960
potential clients in a database you
can't tell who is who put his hand on a

274
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,580
newsletter to your client's you have to
have a data base for your clients which

275
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:16,428
is segregated from those who only
potential client's interests because you

276
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:22,409
have to tell at every time if someone
has a client or not some potential

277
00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:25,679
client becomes a client you can put him
into the next stop on to the other

278
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,019
database but you're not allowed to make
stand because every time I have to be

279
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:35,309
able to tell if some battle belongs to a
client or potential client which can get

280
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:39,589
also pretty complicated and several
smaller companies because many of them

281
00:24:39,589 --> 00:24:43,379
put all the data in adult local into
Word and Excel files and you have

282
00:24:43,379 --> 00:24:51,529
absolutely no separation now let's talk
about security data privacy and data

283
00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:56,529
security are not the same when we speak
about data security all data privacy we

284
00:24:56,529 --> 00:25:02,549
speak about more than just I T security
they do not cover the same fields but

285
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:08,549
they are interconnected cause data
privacy requires I T security if you

286
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:12,450
want to protect private da da by
encrypting you have to speak about

287
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:16,589
something like new PGE or setting up a
private key infrastructure or something

288
00:25:16,589 --> 00:25:21,889
else that is something we discussing Rd
securities so it is security is required

289
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:28,119
if you wanted to data privacy there we
go to the last part of my talk to small

290
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:32,809
and medium-sized enterprises which are
quite interesting because big companies

291
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:36,658
usually have a naughty department and
they also have often have I T security

292
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:37,650
people working

293
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:43,720
have dedicated security officers I T
system administrators who do security

294
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:50,360
but we work with small very small and
medium sized enterprises which often do

295
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,050
not even have a system administrator so
if there is no wonder I T system

296
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:58,540
administration there's also no one who
doesn't security speaking about

297
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,770
companies who have network setup they
don't even know how the network has been

298
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:05,800
set up some external consultant has done
ten years before they are still running

299
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:12,200
on the Windows Server 2003 on a petrol
from 2006 that's what we saw two weeks

300
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:18,570
ago the kind of customer so it's still
living there is a formal definition of

301
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:23,590
what is a small or medium sized
enterprises you typically done by these

302
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:28,899
three criteria of the staff headcount
has to be less than 250 employees the

303
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:33,110
turnover has to be fifty million and the
balance sheet total has to be less than

304
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:38,850
43 million sixty percent of the German
walk for Workforce work in small and

305
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:42,699
medium-sized enterprises many people
think that most of germans workforce

306
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,350
humans or football

307
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:49,409
companies but most of all work force
works for small and medium sized

308
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:53,610
enterprises in my home state of
saxony-anhalt which is in former East

309
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:57,219
Germany all the big companies have been
killed off in the process of

310
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:02,500
reunification and about ninety percent
of our companies only have less than 10

311
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:09,809
employees so we have an economy which is
very very very small very very small

312
00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:13,690
companies so we don't have much big
companies and we have the problem of

313
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:18,159
talking to these very very small
companies employees and you can imagine

314
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:44,419
how many companies 10 or so there is a
security existing there is no such thing

315
00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:49,850
as security matters and these companies
even with all the snow and papers and

316
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:57,379
debates about Obama's assault on such it
is non-existent data privacy can be used

317
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:01,299
as a lever to get small medium
enterprises to do something about his

318
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:06,220
security and that's what we do it could
be a model for 490 security law there is

319
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:11,210
currently a debate going on about 90
security law and germany which only

320
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:14,630
targets huge companies and critical
infrastructure nothing about

321
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:19,539
responsibility of manufacturers do
nothing about small companies and such

322
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:26,350
and I hope that we might change this at
least the problem we face of the small

323
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:30,219
enterprises are not interested in ninety
security they are often not oh well

324
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:35,429
they're all denied his security they
often say I'm not gonna talk to him and

325
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:41,880
see the soil why should someone target
us they don't know what's going on

326
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:46,090
overwhelmed by RT security and sometimes
even by I T

327
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:49,990
there's a lack of skilled labor in very
small

328
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:56,210
companies can't pay much money I T
security expert and working for them I

329
00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:00,240
think that the money we take the day is
sometimes too high for small companies

330
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,320
there is no strategy about a team we
cannot motivate them to do something

331
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:12,639
completely ignoring the topic that
interests of the usual give up pretty

332
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,340
fast

333
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,250
the consequences of security incidents
are too far away for them unfortunately

334
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,520
they cannot imagine what might have
happened what might happen to them

335
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:27,429
security incidents what they typically
same did some question as we did

336
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:30,740
interviews with more than two prizes and
they typically say we are not important

337
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:36,970
like we are exploring other big
companies no one wants to target us no

338
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:41,230
one will it take us to an important for
this we haven't been attacked in the

339
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:48,390
last 30 years we had no security
incidents although they don't even know

340
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:53,270
that they might have had incidents they
don't even know how I have been part of

341
00:29:53,270 --> 00:30:01,100
the last ten years we don't know what to
do what they say very small companies we

342
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:05,459
don't know what to do I T security is
too complex for us which is true from

343
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,790
their point of view they are not a
security expert we are not even I T

344
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:13,490
persons so the topic is a very very
complex for them and it's overwhelming

345
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:19,010
for them they don't know anything about
botnet script kiddies make us flawed and

346
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:23,960
how easy it is to attack that setting up
Colleen oximeters blood is so easy that

347
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:33,410
a lot of Patek's basically done in this
fashion shots W which is a German

348
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:38,790
website by Deutsche Telekom muchos
incidentally at the telecom network and

349
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:43,740
its accessible online and it shows
security incidents currently happening

350
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:49,990
network of the Deutsche Telekom the
largest largest size P and we also use

351
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:55,310
other websites like from Kaspersky you
all from north which also shows a nice

352
00:30:55,310 --> 00:31:00,389
graphical way that there is something
happening they are seeing impacts

353
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:05,870
impressed by the graphics easier to show
them some bugs flying around them locked

354
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:11,530
files we also show them transform our
own honey pot network set up a small

355
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:20,060
network with cable locks SSH and some
companies we were shocked to see that

356
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:24,730
they got attacked someone scan their IP
address range and someone to take these

357
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:29,270
coupon we also show them how easy it is
to crack a password

358
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,900
we show them how easy it is to set up a
leading locksmith exploratory and

359
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:39,870
targeted attack and basically a training
for teachers and we told those teachers

360
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:46,820
basically a fuel pupil is able to
install a pirate computer game into

361
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:51,450
upgrading graphics card he is able to
set up comedy natak your computer that's

362
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:56,460
basically the situation we currently
have shown them security incidents that

363
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:01,350
happened in Germany we have reports
given out by the police by Secret

364
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:06,790
Service about incidents that happened
also in our small federal state that is

365
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:10,760
not the industrial powers of Germany and
they usually shocked to see that even

366
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,080
the Russian or Chinese secret services
are working there are technical

367
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:20,270
universities or research labs and others
other companies and then they get afraid

368
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:27,670
frightened and then they give up that's
unfortunate that what happens they are

369
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:33,140
shocked and the state last one or two
hours and then we have lunch or dinner

370
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:38,290
and then they'd get usually fatalistic
there's nothing we can do anyways it's

371
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,950
too expensive we don't know what to do

372
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,250
let's ignore the topic

373
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:48,740
don't ask us if we don't know what to do
its frightened easily ignored all these

374
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,960
the paternalistic approach usually when
they've founded the company in the early

375
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,520
nineties after the wall came down and
they say build up this company and I

376
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:08,050
wanted politicians tell me what to do so
they completely ignore all the legal

377
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:13,970
approaches 20 security countermeasures
we have to face I have to find all we

378
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:17,730
have to offer training suited for very
small enterprises there are several

379
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:21,890
trainings available in German in Germany
done for example by the bees either

380
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:29,130
Drummond information security office
government agency by Broadcom couple

381
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:33,220
fight EU companies they offer trainings
but they are not suited for very small

382
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:37,020
and they are we have to find training
for people who don't even have a

383
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,620
nineteen have to have a standards and
procedures for them

384
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:45,320
the BBC's Germany offers a low priority
security but it's too big for those

385
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,830
small companies of course this catalog
has to cover almost every possible

386
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:56,360
situation becomes too complex too big I
think its 4,000 pages at all no one in

387
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,780
these companies have the time to read
and glanced through to find the people

388
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:05,970
topics that are interesting for them
personally I personally developed 25

389
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:11,790
pages guideline for very very small
companies which has been printed was

390
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:15,550
currently in print your business needs a
project by the German

391
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:21,170
Ministry of Economy these these products
up fifteen years ago to bring your

392
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:25,909
business into small companies and they
have access to very small companies and

393
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:34,259
they did all the layout and printed and
distributed to their customers and we

394
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:39,700
also use the data privacy law s 11:40
security to bring in ninety security

395
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:45,089
into small companies because if they
don't want to do under security we have

396
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:49,180
to force them and there is no law was
not the standard other thing that can

397
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:54,399
force companies to do on his security
the data privacy only existing law that

398
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,300
controls an enterprising business
accompany you to do a security at least

399
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:02,470
at a basic level and having a security
leaders a basic level is much better

400
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:06,040
than having taught his security at all
it's not the perfect solution but it's

401
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:11,220
about to get and we have to live with it
they are forced to create the directory

402
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:15,640
of procedure they often don't know what
processes are having such a directory of

403
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,190
procedures is also good for the
management because if you do management

404
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:23,340
management based on scientific method
for tell what you learn in Business

405
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:29,980
Management Studies you need the list of
procedures to know what's going on so

406
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:38,090
sometimes they they are just managing by
this time ago but he's feeling and

407
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:43,360
emotions and they are not doing
organized and the director of procedures

408
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:47,900
includes a technical organization and
measures which also leads to analyze

409
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:52,180
procedures and forced them to sing about
his security they have to have to have a

410
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:57,700
checklist that checklist produced by by
other companies by by the piece on

411
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,509
another

412
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:04,960
officers checklists they they can use to
create their own list of procedures

413
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,110
procedure the technical matters and we
just have to follow them they are pretty

414
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,270
pretty easy to follow

415
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:15,910
it's not it's not a huge and complicated
topic for small companies because they

416
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:21,740
don't have huge and complicated
procedures because they are and that's

417
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:25,540
the only way we can get on his security
into these companies and businesses to

418
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:30,660
process it is really hard to motivate
people to do on his security on the

419
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,910
college's studies education science and
psychology i do research about

420
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:39,500
insecurity psychology substitute
security deducts of security security

421
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,710
winners I mean just very very hard to
motivate people to do something about it

422
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,680
he security it's also hard to motivate
people to do something about data

423
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,940
privacy they are not interested in even
with the Snowdon papers and as a needs

424
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:59,380
and what else even in east germany we
had an all-seeing government agency

425
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:08,770
monitoring each and every one of the
guys from a psychological point of view

426
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:13,380
we would have to find the demands
demands regarding 20 security without

427
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:19,040
regard without the need of some things
you are motivated to do something to do

428
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,910
something when there is demand that has
to be fulfilled

429
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:26,420
unfortunately it's very very hard to
find these demands but what marketing

430
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:31,710
online research is about companies put a
lot of money into these fields I was out

431
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:37,560
getting correct answers that utilizes
once we have found the demands we should

432
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,600
show them how to fulfill them that's how
we motivate people to do something

433
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,598
until I do security becomes a team and
we cannot motivate them to fulfill the

434
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:51,230
demand about it security of course as a
psychologist intrinsic motivation is

435
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:55,339
much better than extrinsic and intrinsic
motivation means people are interested

436
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:59,078
in ninety security doing something about
ideas secure data privacy because we

437
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:03,960
want to do it from the internal system
extrinsic motivation means we have to

438
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:09,720
have to punish them or we have to give
them we want but if you do so the only

439
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,348
do something if we punish them so we
have to constantly being behind them

440
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:19,990
with a whip or with money and punish or
reward them doesn't work for them time

441
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:29,779
because of a time and therefore the
motivation motivation so my question is

442
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:34,890
how do we get them to 20 security
without forcing them by law using the

443
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:40,690
data privacy laws 11 or do other stuff
and that's a question I wanted to

444
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:43,890
discuss time constrains

445
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:48,069
