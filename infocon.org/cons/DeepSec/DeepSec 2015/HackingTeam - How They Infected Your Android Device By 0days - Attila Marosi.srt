1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,460
yet so my name is such an impression and
drug for us so far slobs versatile I

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,700
would like to say thank you for the
organizers this is my third time in the

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,750
SEC so that the coins you don't like
this conference so much and I'm very

4
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:26,448
happy to be here again so the
presentation will be about attacking

5
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:34,829
team and they are on the right stuff
what kind of things they used to invent

6
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:44,020
some very divisive rhetoric persons so
on the agenda first just a couple of

7
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:50,260
things about hacking team I think there
is no need to begin to reduce about this

8
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:56,420
company and this phenomenon because they
are very popular and the things that

9
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:04,250
happened we do the company code was so
much fun for their idea security guys

10
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:12,979
than the league what happened with the
company event you exploit our it's very

11
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:14,960
good how they deliver

12
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:23,048
exploit there will be some time after
then there will be a couple things about

13
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:34,189
how they flow under their other because
they separated companies and the guys

14
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:41,508
wanted to have this company and their
product known this phenomenon and stuff

15
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:46,009
many years but they didn't we

16
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:52,860
point and threw them away at all so they
had to be had to get all the things

17
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,689
about it so they have very good
techniques to flew under their other so

18
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:05,189
it's interesting to discuss so first of
all hockey team so the company provides

19
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:06,300
law enforcement

20
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:13,970
products so products for law enforcement
agencies on the their flagship wars the

21
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:19,380
remote control system which was
implemented all the interesting

22
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:27,609
operation system devices so they are
able to monitoring the most of the

23
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:39,310
gadgets we used to deliver them over and
they removed exploits as well as they

24
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:53,380
used agents locally to to install the
software human activities they bias

25
00:02:53,380 --> 00:03:01,790
would keep you to stay and be control
over the device after real installer or

26
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:09,899
that acting and I think so they they had
this technology as well and what was the

27
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,610
the best point of them because they are
law enforcement or because they have

28
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:22,420
support in law enforcement agencies they
have the ability to inject and Sunday

29
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:29,179
are exploiting I S B side so most of the
hackers doesn't have disabilities so

30
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,350
they do not control the ISP science or
they need something gas but if you are

31
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:43,320
in in that sign you can deliver your ass
parade much and you can have other

32
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:55,280
technologies like nothing stuff they get
the animal internet stand because they

33
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:04,459
sold sold their product in two companies
to countries which use this product

34
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:12,959
against journalism protesters so not
traditional criminals so they they

35
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,959
attacked and I think that was the reason
they were hacked by activists so that

36
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:31,799
was the starting of the story when the
company official Twitter page post there

37
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:42,380
was a tweet on Twitter that we really is
all our staff and after these couple of

38
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:50,090
months coming to just bubbling about the
stuff was released in this huge amount

39
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:58,190
done they do it for 400 government so so
it's cool

40
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,190
discussions and everything they have

41
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,660
was released and it blew leads provide
so much

42
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:16,280
Nations Security Company two to discuss
so after there is many patch and many

43
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:28,390
how to fix released because they are
summarized there were 60 days which was

44
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,550
released

45
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:40,960
in this is done later all there was told
the company said that they are much must

46
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:48,930
breaches data are still protected but
maybe just a message or or something to

47
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:57,170
keep their customers close in the
dominated their release pressure is

48
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:05,400
documentation so now we have all the
information about the things they use I

49
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:14,599
think just about the release and the
stuff they that's now I think the entry

50
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:22,040
point for criminals if they would like
to produce which is very tough and be

51
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:28,940
very that could be very difficult they
just see covert ease the source cool

52
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:39,330
this documentation so it's very good
knowledge they summarize so we can

53
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:47,000
expect that criminals will learn about
this and they used these matters these

54
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,890
technologies and the source code which
was released so 44 other various writers

55
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:02,030
or something evil guys it's a very good
condition so it's very good for second

56
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:07,539
in the guys to analyze it and to get
more knowledge about the company like

57
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:13,870
this and it's a very good intentions for
criminals to get him techniques to get

58
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:19,130
about to have to be very good in this
Dec

59
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:31,960
what is very interesting by according to
emails how they buy 0 days there is a

60
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:42,270
very good article about it how they both
20 days they used in their product I

61
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:50,140
think it's worse to read because it's a
great great area it's there is no much

62
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:57,740
knowledge about 20 days are sold in how
you get by what happened in these days

63
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:05,240
so it's it's it's something which is the
rarest all I think it's her story so the

64
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:14,000
infrastructure was very very simple how
they controlled it evens there which is

65
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
implemented all the interesting plus
firms

66
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,909
the infection part was interesting

67
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:27,910
boris did I think they had many ways to
in fact and installed the agent on on

68
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:34,290
the device day they would like to some
adding stuff is implemented for all the

69
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:40,309
platforms so da 6580 keys and all the
all the answers

70
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:50,730
adding stuff was able to splitting
species executables and put the age and

71
00:08:50,730 --> 00:09:00,210
in the executable and repair again so
its impact on the fly so you didn't

72
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:04,900
limit the ISP proxies so when you click
on for example

73
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:13,939
hormone there to get the newest version
of it and it wasn't signed by digitally

74
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:19,540
a very average you put something to do
today

75
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:27,360
eckstein on the fly and you get
magnified worries sorry the file

76
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:36,290
the top commander to install so it's
it's make it very easy to configure your

77
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:45,259
machine so under control binaries very
fancy control panel for agents to come

78
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:52,050
on down there to receive the collecting
evidence from the from the Hollywood

79
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:58,699
they delivered acts because they don't
you in fact over they have target

80
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:08,508
persons they have to shoot very very
accurate so not not breaking the link

81
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:16,139
which spreading the explained they have
two shot mostly they just one shot

82
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:26,490
exploits the sanded and check it or not
and if it's didn't birdie try some

83
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:37,939
different way or something so it was a
bunch of experts traditionally the

84
00:10:37,939 --> 00:10:41,230
techniques they use was very simple just

85
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:49,949
Beach be fine which handled the request
and they combine it with any fire which

86
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,240
was able to to

87
00:10:52,240 --> 00:11:00,600
too many things which is described here
then through point was always was always

88
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:09,800
after we d so simple URL something like
these that was the ideal the infection

89
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:17,410
that stands to point and that the other
side of that but it's all it's wrong

90
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:26,310
generated so when you request this URL
PHP side seeking for static or dynamic

91
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:32,599
part of it and so the request if you
call this morning the other part of the

92
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:40,570
experts get five minutes to be request
so that was only only way you can reach

93
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:44,860
that point if you try something
different way or you just get the half

94
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:50,070
of it or something you won't be able to
get the whole at speeds again so the

95
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:59,130
best way to get all that speed in the
right way to have not very low and make

96
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:06,570
the only seen that way soon meets make
makes much difficult to analyze that

97
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:18,240
process they feel their requests and
process see where he's and he's fine so

98
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,440
as you can see there is only two reads
this exploit this can be called just two

99
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:30,790
times that's tax provisions so it's a
very short time when you can't call it

100
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:38,250
only two times this is the only time
which can collate and if its lead the

101
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,610
other part of the speech get five
minutes to serve and

102
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,260
that could be could be delivered

103
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:55,800
other ways already read you something
something has actually from we

104
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:09,609
disclosure so that age and they they are
you know devices developed a costume

105
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:19,200
shoes rules to keep for their
application so they wouldn't name was a

106
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:27,190
real captain union with DTS and it has
it was very rich fool and was very easy

107
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:32,620
to manage the device with the root
access and it was difficult to detect

108
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:39,110
that your phone is already rooted so
normal route that action

109
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:47,370
application will be able to detect that
so it was a blur to modify the

110
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,970
permissions of the apt keys the
interesting part of this application

111
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:58,110
they they used the media services demand
they who entered the media service

112
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:04,050
system to get all the audio input and
all from the from the harder part of it

113
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:15,569
so it doesn't matter that you used Skype
or or wider or something interesting

114
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:25,570
they they got the source important all
people so it was very easy to 22

115
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:31,370
monitoring discussion in a room for
example because the microwave was also

116
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:40,170
intercepted all type of course and
traditional evidence-gathering features

117
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:48,140
clipboard monitoring locations ranking
and they are all the databases of

118
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,290
dangerous thing

119
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:58,089
communication applications so they get
all the information from from that part

120
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:12,329
so the DDF route to was very very easy
to use it has some parameters they just

121
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:18,899
called for example kuz weeks and then
the common they would like to execute is

122
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:28,290
rude or get to prove he's gone or add an
application as administrator application

123
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:41,839
or modify see for content in in fines
regardless you have we have root access

124
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:49,389
so it's it's make it much easier to to
use the route power on on the device

125
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:09,869
exploits looks like in this classroom be
used and actually against that view that

126
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:19,869
you he's not now but previously was part
of the operation systems or parts of

127
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:32,730
them on the right system there have
their own 40 until 24 the three in this

128
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:42,419
time on the raid was equipped with a bad
kid and then three or more in that black

129
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:51,100
kid and they join disarray morning burst
to create and get called execution on on

130
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:58,449
the device so it's a very sophisticated
experience they actually says for a

131
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:04,428
stage five stage to be and accord
execution and then they don't stop

132
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,180
little bit complicated but they were
lucky because one of their weaknesses

133
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:22,250
voice you should mention leaks or the
again they were able to buy the seller

134
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:28,630
and then they three others to do manage
to call the execution for look on

135
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:37,520
exploration and to get root access the
used known explains so there is a few

136
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:46,620
things in that part but because endroit
do I very very rarely updated and

137
00:17:46,620 --> 00:18:05,300
changed on many devices so that the
straight days and they combines together

138
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:12,649
to to get the code execution so
information was used to to bypass the

139
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:24,330
air seller memory to to get that core
point of the memory and abroad to ride

140
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:31,710
the pale in the right place if you check
it as you can see it all belongs to

141
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:38,480
crawl so it's not down the right stuff
it's a core chrome just

142
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,100
chrome back Keith O sport into

143
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:49,690
on the rain and that was that was the
chance for them to use these days so

144
00:18:49,690 --> 00:19:02,380
these are not under a tornado with these
things so these graph is this September

145
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:12,010
saw all of them still more than 75% of
day used the lines are vulnerable

146
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:20,860
against these do you explain and as you
can see and 40 on the end of 43

147
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:32,110
that fuel industry there so these are
all the rage so that's that's the

148
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,100
problem

149
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:42,830
the latest Android has has been view we
did the friend and gene and its

150
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:52,399
delivered a pkg it could be very
frequently updated so could be not too

151
00:19:52,400 --> 00:20:00,760
serious problem in the future than
previously because if its components

152
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:14,410
memorable experience against you can
obtain the whole on droid edged

153
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:31,710
so much difficult that's the problem
with the Android devices so this is the

154
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:41,080
device day they focused on with their
explains low-keyed to root and premium

155
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:48,570
to elude so that means they are you
there and look at the root means that

156
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:57,580
the three experts working on these
devices the company focused on this

157
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:08,450
these devices but it's gonna be very
many more but they haven't some some

158
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:22,560
devices called the largest part of
devices so how do you explain first HTML

159
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,889
it was able to check that the
information

160
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:39,120
league league he's there or not if the
device not just pointing something else

161
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:51,530
something discreet yes he's three hours
in line coach to manage the whole act

162
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:59,810
whole exploitation according to the
emails it seems to be they both this

163
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:09,550
framework from them and they've changed
a spot in the finals so so this this

164
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:17,110
framework it's very hot in that it's a
framework you can change the change that

165
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:21,209
he would like to change the
vulnerabilities you would like to use

166
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:28,070
for for some purpose but for for
managing DAX bullets you have a very

167
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:34,590
comfortable family to to use it so it's
very unprofessional

168
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:42,690
when they prepared a memory for
expectation the use the memory you read

169
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:50,890
weaknesses to to get the right
information and to prepare and

170
00:22:51,779 --> 00:23:01,999
to create a mall foreign and that crafty
XML to use it with tea and triggered the

171
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:08,690
buffer overflow exploit the stamps they
check baghdad they are in the right

172
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:13,779
position they have all the information
and everything's booked in a way they

173
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:21,070
wanted otherwise they just ermini did
the things too not not disclosure more

174
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:27,710
part of the of the expert so when they
reached is part of a jacket ok

175
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,239
everything seems to be nice

176
00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:38,509
download out their part of that and when
the mall who was the first day alone the

177
00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:45,509
shared library they right into the
memory and when they prepared the final

178
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:52,239
stages they just call it with the right
parameters and the diet the library is

179
00:23:52,239 --> 00:23:59,999
done as part of their order explains
which was very stupid the day they call

180
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:03,509
explained it actually I don't know why

181
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:09,599
and so there was an expert that that's
the route experience to gain root access

182
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:15,389
and they're installing of which is a
scout agent it's it's just an

183
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:20,709
application to check the device collect
information about the devices sent back

184
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:27,849
home to to give you information from
today gender they infect the right for

185
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:30,860
more in that they do

186
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:40,780
this battled so they they not installed
the food we act we on

187
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:46,180
device that the first ever deja sin
discount to get more information about

188
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:52,390
the DUI's they just heat and when they
they confirmed that ok we are now in RI

189
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:59,370
devised they opted for a more polar for
stuff so the eastern areas justice cult

190
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:14,159
agent yesterday actually it is is is the
streets and a kiss this dropped the

191
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,980
media into the system being too

192
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:24,510
to provide the ability for the county
agent to get more access so if you had

193
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:31,230
knowledge about just called the DDF be
derived from any application can use it

194
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:40,550
with root access to get through taxes or
something so in stage four they that's

195
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:45,879
the last step when they prepared
everything they Kobe Bryant everything

196
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:53,860
they just end this value back to do
Sarah memory value and check that

197
00:25:53,860 --> 00:26:01,080
everything scoring and the bad and the
restrooms voice their IDs key to decrypt

198
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:15,050
these 25 I don't want to provide
something and you to decorate the 25 so

199
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:24,669
let the first would be an email I just
sent you managed to do is click on it

200
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:37,930
but attacking them also realize then 44
target person it's not so they can they

201
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:44,950
can stand that crafty email and SMS his
death it would be nice to me that that's

202
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:53,890
an extremely each diet so they used I S
B and other techniques to to install

203
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,890
there

204
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:04,850
their application using this so i would
like to them with this version when I

205
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:14,230
use my it's not the life I live by using
VPN just imagine 855 which could be so

206
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:22,350
maybe I'm an ISP or I just providing
free and the very flattering 35 fans to

207
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:29,110
join or just using the deep set for July
5 and hijack your connection so there

208
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:35,939
are many ways to get the flowing at
Sheraton that and then just use the

209
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:46,240
proxy to selecting the HTTP request I
know which web kid version he's worried

210
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:55,539
about so I do not touch any of the Nazi
Temple HTTP request so we have a right

211
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:58,870
natural connection but when we get a
ride

212
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:04,479
request with their own content I just
inject an iframe and and the application

213
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:25,190
will be used to explain but that's my
little bit slow and I have us

214
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:47,830
there was so I just the open sign so
it's working correctly and if you check

215
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:53,220
in on Sat Banda because these agents
this

216
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:59,870
yeah it's a new era of them because the
chrome if you installed or chrome or use

217
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:11,260
the latest version which is in fact the
DCX boy 24 2003 or chrome and this has

218
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:21,050
its own web home that kids this
application is not worried but what if I

219
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:33,530
use an application which use and used
the weapons I would like to think so

220
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:40,420
underrated applications very often use
rap because it's a very bold their food

221
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:50,020
to display content you just put it on
display and provide some HDMI port it's

222
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:56,440
very easy to manage much easier than
than create on droid layouts and button

223
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:03,060
it's complicated just put the web UN
provide web page and everything should

224
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,070
be fine

225
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:12,659
so these application installed more than
200 million devices so that the popular

226
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:18,000
one but doesn't matter because the
deputies used very frequently if I click

227
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:26,800
them click on the images we are
recognized this request was good for us

228
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:34,879
because the operation system provides
about kit and this budget is limited so

229
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,820
I can inject an iframe and if you check
points

230
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:46,780
as you can see the locks here we go

231
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:55,280
discrete that that the corrupted excel
that's the model which downloads the

232
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:02,310
other board and as you can see the key
was correct for us and this is the

233
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:06,100
expert and the installer so the pails

234
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:13,879
download at speeds through text late and
the installer these stories mine my test

235
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:21,090
applications or not it's a very damning
application created my own voice studio

236
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:28,990
or actually so it's not a picture of
stuff it has many sleeves and things so

237
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:42,530
it makes times to to get the new
application on on on our device so I

238
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:47,730
just don't you and where we are seeing
that is correct

239
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:58,280
yeah holidays under the rather because
all the source code released we know

240
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:09,149
that they are all starting date in their
own including stage so they just they

241
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:14,940
just obfuscating everything before the
bill and then they build it and they

242
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:23,430
package and then they used commercial 22
protected so they use Moodle add-ons to

243
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,670
make it much much pain

244
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:29,159
who's who to get today

245
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:37,210
that called back so it was very very
tough 222 reverse-engineered listings

246
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:44,919
demanding as I mentioned that the two
man the scenes together which makes

247
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:51,590
their application less suspicious
because you just download something that

248
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:59,439
needs to lead to provide new application
just just affect something and there's I

249
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:05,499
mentioned that the discount elite
soldier different version and different

250
00:33:05,499 --> 00:33:13,059
feature their original application note
no disclosure order all the things that

251
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:18,279
they use so they increase the level when
they know that their key we are in the

252
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:24,169
right position that the device infected
there is no application on the device

253
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:31,899
which is at least eat which could call
is a liar or something we haven't

254
00:33:31,899 --> 00:33:38,609
handled or something so they protect
their stuff and for example if a broad

255
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:42,428
small or something running on your
system they just go back ok it's too

256
00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:50,159
risky maybe next time maybe something
would be nice but not risking the food

257
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,159
court because

258
00:33:54,250 --> 00:34:06,190
the product so for example the trooper
has viruses on the Wii that actions we

259
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:14,990
we we any queries to get the information
and either able to form figured that

260
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:24,229
these these agent although to run on on
your time machine or not only can so

261
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:41,560
that was the chance to have that means
they used the trap for Kumon

262
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:51,159
that they proved very good value in 44
and then they go to sleep which is which

263
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:58,790
was scooped by cool I mean it and then
they call it it's cool to crash and that

264
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:05,070
because she just stopped and the
remorseless empty if the region that bar

265
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:13,980
that means that there's no doubt so they
can continue their execution for

266
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,620
underage

267
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:22,430
use these techniques to gather
information about the late there are for

268
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:34,460
example so I'm leaders has changed or
for example the CBO fine and not exist

269
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:46,779
tourists so we can they can check which
divides the air and for me in the

270
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:55,240
morning there I think they had dedicated
Gloucester dedicated Williams 44

271
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:02,959
separating hantavirus further and they
always morning terrorizing their

272
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,670
application against Golden onto viruses
and checking and Papa teamed up with

273
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:14,790
haitian that maybe it's cause alert or
not they have the food environment and

274
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:19,599
for example you can you can use of the
box and if you are there will be more

275
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,030
various it's a very powerful stuff
because if you would like to develop

276
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:31,560
something like this time consulting but
now I've ramon has this too has this

277
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:42,190
knowledge so I think it's increasing the
level than 3.0 dream team there so it

278
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:49,069
was a quick process 44 announced that
the as you can see to worry because the

279
00:36:49,069 --> 00:36:58,569
most of the no worries there and they
have an agent and they just buffeting

280
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:06,060
they our age and that ok cool that the
emails from that number that and maybe

281
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:16,790
EADS Coast something reach give an hour
or more feet maybe it will be silent or

282
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:25,410
just start a kilo and just realizing
that is there another time so it's a

283
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:36,529
very poor barefoot too if you like to
buy something I think they they do their

284
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:47,780
job but they have a very sore or
something solid air their stuff never

285
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:54,520
really is engineered fooling day
combined to protecting solutions you

286
00:37:54,520 --> 00:38:00,500
know right away and they have very if
you can breathe for example is the board

287
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:08,810
or or other big families they they
threatening very few people are so that

288
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:16,620
could be protection that not spreading
your mom we're just pointing to to your

289
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:27,120
target so I this also protect their
their product but I think it was

290
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:35,049
designed and and the the techniques very
slippery as you know

291
00:38:35,050 --> 00:39:05,880
hijacking I can you start this varies so
yeah this could be used to to start

292
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:13,320
something on a device which is I think
much scary that you don't have to

293
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:18,340
deliver a route thanks be to install
something if there is an application for

294
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:24,860
example protector and you can you can
gain code execution in an email the

295
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:30,040
password protected because they have you
when you can hijack an unencrypted good

296
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:35,910
traffic you can elude application and
you can get the value we don't pulling

297
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:43,359
the pool under 8 device and you get the
precious stuff from them and just led to

298
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,650
do my assignment no one knows that you
own the device these things because he

299
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:53,770
just a memory when you kill that the
cason everything's have begun so it's

300
00:39:53,770 --> 00:40:01,900
very scare scary and for example this is
the most popular phosphor protector

301
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:13,300
application yet deeper and for example
if you use the keeper in a way like

302
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:23,170
playing DS and you have I think like
these and HTTP and there is no ass and

303
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:31,200
you you can use the keeper to display
the page and you will be able to hijack

304
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,560
this connection is well and you can

305
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,759
here and you can you can execute

306
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:45,470
thats but you know you know name and the
context of the keeper so you can do the

307
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:56,709
application so this expertise freely
available can be using without any

308
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:04,870
investment so it's very cheap just set
up a free wi-fi and if you have a chance

309
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:14,589
just do that because it doesn't check
location and you can tell I together a

310
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:22,120
value it's very difficult to to get
information on volunteering and the most

311
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:29,620
of the Droid do not have the chance to
get that because the application are

312
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:35,180
separated so you do not know that that
application was bombed or not if you

313
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:43,029
don't want to touch the other part of
the forum for all under a deal that far

314
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,730
but it's the mornin certified personnel
to be vice
