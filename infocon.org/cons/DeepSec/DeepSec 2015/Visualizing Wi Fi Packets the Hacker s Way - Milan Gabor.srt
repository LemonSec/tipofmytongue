1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,089
welcome back after lunch break hope you
enjoyed it and had introduced millions

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:12,380
now who is telling us how to visualize
wifi packets take away

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,340
ok

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:27,920
hi everybody I hope you're fine after
lunch so what mood for sleep or not or

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:40,070
if you're still life so alive that's ok
let's start with my actually i'm for the

6
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:47,110
second time now it seems like last year
was also speaking last year this year I

7
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,899
got the proper I got I had a problem why
because I got accepted to the two

8
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,550
conferences were running at the same
time so deep second death camp so I have

9
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:03,269
to decide which one to go so I send one
of my guys to do tonight joins and I'm

10
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,860
really glad to be there be glad to be
here again so I'm Certified Ethical

11
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:14,020
Hacker does mean something and decide
that I really like to play the drums

12
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:22,000
this anybody's trying drunk already ok
23 great you have any idea why the

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,049
drawings and by fire by really good
together why

14
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:36,490
also you can go in places where normally
you cannot go you know you can fly over

15
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:42,280
the company's you can fly over to let
see charts here

16
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:47,399
French you know you yesterday to be seen
so you can make really good pictures and

17
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,500
even Steve device high packets Richard
Jones for more than a mile away so

18
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,969
nobody sees you so I just a short
reminder about last year and last year

19
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:02,298
we hear be playing with a mobile
application so it still up there on

20
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:07,240
helping somebody wants to use it so
that's what's last year and this year

21
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:18,209
we're playing the device I pack so but
before we start let's make some deal I

22
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:24,260
will be playing with WiFi beckons so if
anybody has a problem with it please

23
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,149
turn off your wifi not

24
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:37,590
by this means also that have so much fun
so if you if you want to have fun just

25
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,819
leave your wifi on and I was sorry I
guess you all know this kind of really

26
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:50,280
popular tool and you're going to see
what's actually capable capable of the

27
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:58,159
agreement these terms is it fine but the
problem is you know you are but what

28
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:03,500
they probably by fire the guys in the
next room they didn't agree but we will

29
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:12,299
see their bankers and also from the gas
from from from the hotel so what's going

30
00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:19,019
to talk about it today I tried to put
this into cecal sentence so we gonna be

31
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,870
inserting into elasticsearch Extech

32
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:29,609
sexually battered values so values from
the dumping divide by Beckett and we're

33
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:38,230
going to surge little bit we gonna try
to look for threats batters tried to US

34
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:45,780
three veterans maybe see who is drinking
tea with somebody please we will try to

35
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,409
get some phones and we look at
definitely some crazy ideas at the end

36
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:55,108
so this is for your general so where is
the problem so

37
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:22,630
coming out of your phone have you met
him how you met your wireless packet

38
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:28,640
when was the last time you checked
what's actually your phones tablets and

39
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:37,099
even PCs notebooks are sending out when
was the last time anyone what did you

40
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:51,880
see whether it's sending he really
really nice topic gonna see and if you

41
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,890
do some magic with it you can't really
good results out of it so I actually

42
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:04,229
want to be together try you're familiar
with that right which are correct entry

43
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:14,540
to all those who never saw this kind of
scary get crazy a question to ask the

44
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:20,060
security conference right what we gonna
try to put this kind of day don't this

45
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:26,380
so you gonna see really quick try to see
what's actually happening in the year at

46
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:34,280
that moment in the presence of your
dealing with the Big Data why with this

47
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,900
you can go fix some some fields in Utah
if you're just grabbing them into I

48
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,969
don't know it's a mile or some other
format CSV then you don't have any

49
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,070
history you don't see when the phone was
on when it was all for it was moving

50
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:55,730
away from you getting closer what kind
of package so you don't see this so

51
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:01,680
that's why you need some storage and
searching over the big date and we found

52
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,920
really good solution that's called

53
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:14,440
to go through it but if you have a large
amount of data and you know you don't

54
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,130
know what to look for and you don't know
how to extract it or you don't know how

55
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:25,070
to use it it's useless right so if you
have like 10 terabytes of data and you

56
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:31,030
don't know how what to do with it is it
useful or useless useless that's really

57
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:37,369
going to create some really nice let's
let's grab that you can do it also on

58
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,290
Monday when you get back to work

59
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:43,800
get back to your research labs or get
back home so that is my goal for today

60
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:50,240
but before that lets just jump into
reality what kind of the stuff we have

61
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,570
this one BC so we have to I got my if I
go to my colleagues so this is what I

62
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:03,680
see at the moment regarding the wifi
wifi Packers OIC the access points I see

63
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,620
the probes I see the client is connected
to wear what kind of encryption Rd using

64
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:21,450
what kind of channels this is what we
get from there is one tool actually from

65
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:26,510
that you probably know how much are
drunk something like that I don't know

66
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:32,000
if it's right pronunciation it's a tool
that you can actually get to cap put it

67
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:42,090
into its better or something like that
it's actually interesting but it's not

68
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:48,039
so much fun to play with it we tried it
but it didn't work for us so we tried

69
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,760
another way so it's actually was a
challenge for us and everything started

70
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:58,440
this year when we organize capture the
flag for besides in Uganda for the first

71
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,980
time this year and we had problems since
we were organizer to capture the flag we

72
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,940
didn't know what actually taxes are
doing capture deflect service so we will

73
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,380
play start playing with it

74
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:16,540
help so we put all the logs we try to
see you are actually did they already

75
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:21,270
correct the machine or the discussing
the passwords and we saw that we can use

76
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:27,669
the stack also different ways just put a
large amount of WiFi packets and see

77
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:34,409
what will come out and this can do
without writing a single line of cold

78
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:37,409
how many programmers are here

79
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:46,780
ok would be nice to have a tool that you
don't need to program something great

80
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:53,280
right you're developing a system in
order both ok so we don't write a single

81
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,420
line of code you will see that it is
it's possible but where do we start so

82
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:07,550
any guesses where do we start what we
need what they talkin anything else

83
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:20,439
but mostly we can do to fix it hard for
me to start right so what kind of hard

84
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:29,420
but we definitely need the wireless card
for captured packets you can buy this

85
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:35,360
really really expensive court which cost
around 40 something like that you know

86
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,380
with this you can do really really good

87
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:45,430
back to capture but it's not one card
for if you want to be really successful

88
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,209
you need more more cards

89
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:54,470
why because if you use one card you
gonna be just hoping to Charles you

90
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:00,100
won't see any package so if you like
three or four maybe fight wireless cards

91
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,700
then you'll cover almost all the
spectrum and you get even better D

92
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:13,870
definitely USB cable lets a polar and
the big screen to see but because if you

93
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:19,000
use coupon out if you're tried to do in
this resolution did I gonna be torturing

94
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,670
myself in like 15 minutes and you have a
problem because you did you see that the

95
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,479
grass and everything is kind of small
typing so you need a big screen for at

96
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,890
least two screens secure so what's
regarding the softer you need your

97
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,439
favorite operating system

98
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:44,060
lot of people are on Mac Linux is also
fine to use Windows but you need to keep

99
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:51,079
in mind that some of the components will
get you some challenges especially if

100
00:10:51,080 --> 00:11:03,920
you require hardware component ok so
hard would it be to fix so we first need

101
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,219
an environment where to put on these
data and the second is the daytime so if

102
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:18,510
we start building blocks for Environment
definitely who's using government i dont

103
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,620
josh is using it

104
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,339
for his honey part because we have been
witnessing yesterday it's a great tool

105
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:39,110
can you ok what do you think about the
hell yes yes call stack for those who

106
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:44,640
doesn't know what it's actually this
kind of course you can build on which

107
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,569
lies between so you can do like people
are really crazy stuff not just any

108
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:59,660
parts also analyzes IBM Systems what
else network operations centers they

109
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:06,949
have built on this but mainly what kind
of three components you have you have

110
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:12,920
block stash we have your log shippers
lost a server or here have lock lock

111
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,729
step forward there then you have a
certain point you have lost their server

112
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:21,210
which does all the kind of magic you
have the storage so extra storage with

113
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:27,060
plastic surgeon then you have to ponder
as a good for for that so not stay she's

114
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:34,079
doing really great stuff with parsing
collecting what if I trust building and

115
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,279
it's really easy for example this is the
conflagration and I'm using for

116
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:45,060
analyzing this so it's like roughly 25
30 lines coat configuration file for the

117
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:51,339
last eight starts easy I'm really logs
I'm actually doing some kind of

118
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:57,200
transformation with some data and I'm
writing to the elasticsearch there's

119
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,580
also called lockstitch for murder
because you don't want to run look

120
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:06,730
stylish each instance but you need to
honor for collector or what you might

121
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,220
run into some kind of

122
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:18,990
challenge especially if you're using
caress group I because they go about the

123
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:28,770
elastic searches searching elasticsearch
swing by cost you see that there are 16

124
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:35,860
instances of elasticsearch open to the
whole internet without any notification

125
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:53,690
if you can find some interesting data in
this yes yes I tried one you know but so

126
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:59,620
you get the treatment title also put
electrotherapy therapy massage therapy

127
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:06,520
taping Kong and if I screenshot also
here you will get the actually real

128
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:15,230
persons having sessions with their
doctors so it's either patient here

129
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:21,020
Beijing name also the doctor was taking
this can be found on the letter search

130
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:26,760
they'd build the politics which is not a
problem the Mongo huge one so we have

131
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:32,910
some issues we have some other issues
with elstak first told you it's actually

132
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:38,260
if you can figure from the scratch there
is no security so you can buy it now but

133
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,360
you have to pay of course there's a
problem if you want to have like

134
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,780
monitoring tours Siem system built on it
with the 13th

135
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,690
have to buy it I under constant
development in there are some big

136
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:56,180
changes between three and four and still
some of functionalities that i'm gonna

137
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:02,300
talk is still so the second thing so we
had their environment so we build

138
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:10,319
environment the second thing its data so
if we go back if we go back here you see

139
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:17,560
can we put this data into elasticsearch
expected to be working well you think

140
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,810
yes or no

141
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:31,579
really well if you're talking about
electric should speak about some strange

142
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:36,910
data format like Jason then with this
but we have a problem with this is not

143
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:44,350
the Jason so doesn't speak any Jason
doesn't spit out any G's we tried a lot

144
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:51,230
of things you know to parcel out put
parse CSV files and nothing and then we

145
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,570
tried changed code that's why is really
open source is good so we got the source

146
00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:01,130
code in which change it what if I and we
are still thinking to contribute back to

147
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:06,920
the main branch so you got a JSON output
of a cricket she so we did two changes

148
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:13,910
mainly first I don't know why did change
with two versions this is one parameter

149
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:20,579
it says number of probes crops are
process actually packets that your

150
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,990
phones or something called and asked for
the wireless networks around you

151
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:28,750
this is an original sources said to tell
so it's really long you gonna see the

152
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:37,520
most of the phones sending even 50 50 50
or even 100 and 50 probes so that was

153
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,390
the first change the second change we
actually rode the functionality dump

154
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:48,000
truck dump Jason so we're getting this
kind of data out of work can we put this

155
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:56,850
into outstanding what do you think this
one looks much better it is Jason should

156
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:08,390
be so we got we got environment we got
the data and then we should start some

157
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:16,860
right but starting it's always it's
always the hardest thing to do now it's

158
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:21,260
time to time so you like to the most
honest he was actually has been

159
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:24,709
collected last 15 minutes of my time

160
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:34,689
are you ready for the moment of truth to
see where you have been you have I don't

161
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:45,870
know had lunch last week maybe you're
hanging together on the wifi wifi WiFi

162
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:58,260
networks let's let's start so when you
start with a boner you get something

163
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:04,400
like this you know so you have your
input so this is kind of Jason style

164
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:11,230
which is parsed and you see this one

165
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:51,070
yesterday

166
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,950
life if you don't

167
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:18,120
point six billion and 1.6 million of
analyzed data already inside and this is

168
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,439
the day to day has been analyzed for
last 15 minutes so we see how the

169
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:35,570
packets are still rising up so this is
actually but if you have like 36,000

170
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:44,350
packets 36,000 records now offers really
good stuff so you can do like this this

171
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:50,100
this data you can have this so let's
let's try to explain a little bit you

172
00:19:50,100 --> 00:20:07,010
see in the back right let's make it
bigger tried this ok so let's create I

173
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:11,170
created already some kind of data points
so you see the 55 of the strongest

174
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:17,960
signal so what does this mean so this
means that I see which one

175
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:23,940
access points are really close to me
power to see that there are falling down

176
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:30,950
so you see the conference and BBC of who
we are so we're catching also though

177
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:36,350
mourners access points around maybe from
your phones made from from wrongs

178
00:20:39,390 --> 00:21:02,020
open my cart

179
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:16,039
169 unique BSSID and 300 climbs 300
phones or tablets notebooks are on me

180
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:24,740
since last couple then that's gone let's
see what kind of vendors around us so

181
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,990
you see the truest Wireless is leading
because the hotel is using to Rutgers

182
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:35,120
wi-fi access points so far the guys from
Spain you know if you try what is right

183
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,149
to play golf course maybe management
access point for this eve really really

184
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:44,539
quick really quick then you have a
netgear you have reuter board for

185
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:51,299
tonight against this is probably some
hot spots mobile access points from

186
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:58,940
users and then see also what kind of the
types of deference to see happen still

187
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:06,409
in or not but it it's interesting
because if you calculate also Apple

188
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:18,490
against the other Apple is losing that
there are some interference answer then

189
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:25,000
comes the real interesting point we know
that there are apples and other devices

190
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,820
but here next graph we see the top
probes

191
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:44,300
actually sent out by your phone if we
try to because it's really low

192
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:49,980
resolution but let's try to find
somebody recognize his phone so you see

193
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:58,720
that this one has been connected to
Danielle televised real and Melky public

194
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,100
life but this one has been connected to
my clothes soon

195
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:12,879
side whatever they call and so I know
that that guy has been to legalize I

196
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:19,230
don't know him I don't know what kind of
business but I know he has been too has

197
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:26,260
been too like a lot like Lexi let's see
if we can try to find what kind of the

198
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:31,920
phone was he using so we just filter on
his station mecca D and it says that it

199
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:38,170
was so I already know what kind of phone
so if I go round is like and eliminate

200
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:44,810
you already saw ok so he has been to the
legal and ok he's using a solid phone

201
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:54,330
and I guess probably with some more
props that actually could be quite I

202
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:59,810
could do something like this I was
playing over and before because I didn't

203
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:04,700
know what kind of package would you get
I saw that somebody around here has been

204
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:12,860
using iron sell or beginning out
ourselves if we tried to map this we try

205
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:20,439
to make this is actually this guy was
moving around here on some time and he

206
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,460
has been really close to me this day

207
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:31,790
so this is the missing functionality
that we are still missing from cabana

208
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:37,600
because you cannot do connected so if I
want to see that show me who was on that

209
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:44,020
and connected with this kind of two that
I can get the location this is still the

210
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:47,639
missing functionality in the missing
piece but we are working on it so I

211
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,630
guess next couple of months hopefully we
will also have this kind of solution but

212
00:24:52,630 --> 00:25:10,270
let's try to see if somebody else's
house public also likes rituals metal oh

213
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,620
ok so they're hackers

214
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,060
monster like this anybody knows who's
fault is that

215
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:30,590
recognizing self so it's a lot of things
that you can learn from this package in

216
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:35,649
visualizing seat quick so if you would
call with our cricketing and you're

217
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:43,810
currently notes and pics consult you
wouldn't think that maybe if you have

218
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:49,240
like I like an eagle than you would see
that but otherwise no then the next

219
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:55,300
thing is let's see if we tried if we can
manage to get who is actually hanging

220
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:03,690
together with whom so next draft our
next date we see that we try to group

221
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:11,170
together the phones are becoming out the
same by fire hot wi-fi access points

222
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:17,380
that they have been connected ok forever
since gas there are a lot of people

223
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,700
staying in this hotel deep cycle so deep
said ok presenters deuces

224
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:28,489
natural for us but then idea change
society Carter Hall will impose cool I

225
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:34,220
Angeles park or Belkin or dealing maybe
some kind of inequities you see that for

226
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:40,700
example which which one you see that
there have been two people at least one

227
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,730
person with two devices that they have
been together sometimes connected

228
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:51,559
sometimes some some years maybe months
maybe days baby hours before in that

229
00:26:51,559 --> 00:27:00,059
same old same a society we can also see
who is grouping together with him so

230
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:07,320
it's an office really easy so we want to
see who was on Olympus together I try I

231
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:13,659
have now two different phones this one
is one for this one the other phone I

232
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:19,690
could do them the girl with client
access points played go deep deep down

233
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:29,740
without touching any called doing the
program and then you have kind of like

234
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:36,450
points and the client street so this is
actually refreshing refreshing to roll

235
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:46,130
what kind of the date is coming in three
seeded you have wifi access point that

236
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:52,160
it's open here and then its own channel
one and you have the power of the wifi

237
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:57,480
so you know it's it's closer it's very
far away and manufacturer of

238
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:03,309
transporting the same with a client with
a client it's also you can see you can

239
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:08,740
come back it's so if you're living all
to see who's actually really really

240
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:13,920
active on the net with not doing
anything to say that this one sec to

241
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:20,970
who's actually because you know it was
quite active so it's a lot of you can

242
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:26,440
also do this kind of you see the packet
you see the client's invite fire so you

243
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:35,250
see how this one you know when we
started to see that I'm getting more and

244
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:40,330
more packets or is he that keeps the
moment for legislature it's like

245
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:46,899
nineteen different devices on Adam
Schreck wifi carry even more interesting

246
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:53,160
than anybody's guess what this kind of
representation of the data just wifi

247
00:28:53,160 --> 00:29:03,370
dangerous but let's see who is who is
connected to deep sector so we have a

248
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:10,080
deep sec to so we see that too has to
physical access points because it has to

249
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,460
PSS idea so this is the first back ready
for deep said this is the second

250
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,910
mega-deal 40%

251
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:27,860
BSSID and these are to make addresses of
the phone so I know that this phone with

252
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:36,178
this MAC address produced by by by HDAC
it's actually connected to the deep

253
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:43,620
sector on this one has access point and
this can do for every every day today we

254
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:48,219
see so if you wanna just filter out for
the deep sector then we get all the data

255
00:29:48,220 --> 00:30:07,080
only for the sick too and we can do also
some other interesting stuff it's one

256
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:22,980
density so you can also do if your
system in with this you can see which

257
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,890
kind of channels are very very occupied
see the channel one eyewitness said my

258
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:35,740
wifi on channel 16 or 11 this kind of
the wifi or even even less occupied and

259
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:49,460
it's really easy to build this kind of
this kind of this kind of grass so I

260
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:56,030
still have some but actually they are
problems if you're building this

261
00:30:56,030 --> 00:31:02,220
definitely there are some kind of
problems one problem is but it's not

262
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:13,330
only the elasticsearch problem but also
problem of entire community job

263
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:32,050
how much your stack has given to the
Latics search 66 somebody has more now

264
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:50,129
my couch or not the problem because
because you can run it on the whole

265
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:55,980
attack and I was shredded also I have
been running it now for the last 15

266
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:01,570
minutes my Raspberry Pi that's actually
actually city here I don't know if you

267
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:05,790
can see it so it's Raspberry Pi
stipulate and its power bank so its

268
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:15,399
power it on and I have connected to my
to my computer and it's running running

269
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:28,850
late so this is coming so this is coming
from my from my Raspberry Pi if you try

270
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:35,389
to connect my gonna see that it's really
under its really

271
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:26,899
but you have you know you just bring
your pipe Walker on the conference you

272
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,050
don't have to bring your computer you
don't have to bring your antenna be

273
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:35,659
content but it takes quite some time but
here is also a reply

274
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:42,430
can be used as a as a sensor so you just
run there wherever dumped on it and it

275
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:47,980
sends all the day to the Jewish state
somewhere else take with 32 gigs of RAM

276
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:55,750
which will do all the rest of the world
but you see we got us seats only problem

277
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:02,200
is that I had some problems with the
time not connected to the Internet

278
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:12,540
timestamps are quite are not quite
accurate but you can you can still use

279
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:17,290
it so it's gonna in sometimes can also
show going to show the

280
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:23,710
the same dash parts actually running on
my Raspberry Pi so quickly table region

281
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:27,230
or if you're going somewhere in the
mission or you're just trying to see

282
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:34,449
what's around clients or targets or
maybe even what kind of the phones are

283
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:43,770
your neighbors using their wifi locator
using Apple's this is going to take so

284
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:54,520
little time for and there are definitely
different kind of usage for this kind of

285
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:01,420
sacrifice fly by five packets definitely
we can use it for penetration testing or

286
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:08,330
security audit we can use it as a team
so you see what's actually going on

287
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:13,700
around your WiFi networks or you can do
it with your crap you know if you know

288
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:19,319
that you have only twenty twenty
employees connecting to the wifi and

289
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:26,220
suddenly you get like 50 times on your
wi-fi network definitely for

290
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:36,689
intelligence gathering if you're taking
this large amount of my package you can

291
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:43,640
really track down people where they're
moving we have been playing if we could

292
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:49,740
see that actually person is moving
around the room so because of the power

293
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:57,959
transmitting but this was not quite
successful the other ideas are tracking

294
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,950
the storm stalled for once or maybe some
kind of traffic records of open networks

295
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:09,230
willing to huge database I know we have
been playing just monitoring the probe

296
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:15,200
standing out from the people driving
through driving on the roads

297
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:22,720
beside or corporate building and
millions of records different kind of

298
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:31,089
thing so it can be really can be really
interesting I still sweating so it's

299
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:34,089
gonna finish

300
00:36:39,010 --> 00:37:13,579
other crazy idea which public so if you
wanna get up we already published page

301
00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:21,369
for the latest version of G so if you
wanna play with a cracked so to dump all

302
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:27,670
the JSON output just get it it's not
very it's not worried

303
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:40,880
actually if you have problems just send
me e-mail see before I still

304
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:42,350
I did it this this week with the latest
version of plastic search took me like

305
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:48,410
on the Raspberry Pi took me like three
hours if you have a virtual machine I

306
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:53,379
I'm running I'm running out stuck in
perfectly runs also sorry just

307
00:38:53,380 --> 00:39:00,150
downloaded the packages and there are no
problems at all just stop it but be

308
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:06,640
careful because if you can eat lot of
friends put it in to startup scripts

309
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:16,410
then you have a problem when needed but
let's say three days but for the first

310
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:22,540
time because you will get into some kind
of issues like one day for whole setup

311
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,750
of every so willing their crack patches
billing

312
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:37,649
elstak connected together and running
the show I can sure also supports so if

313
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,190
you need it so you don't have to build
your own your own maybe maybe we should

314
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:50,640
put it helps if you're just with me and
I will try to help you it's it's it's

315
00:39:50,640 --> 00:40:05,460
not a problem you experience any
troubles in using just want now that's

316
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:11,970
actually did scanning done by one car
this morning I V running with four

317
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:20,709
counts of different channels I get much
bigger good but it's also fun but I

318
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:29,400
prefer also because it has more power
and you can get on with normal or

319
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:40,440
internal but it will do with any cars
that supported by then

320
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,829
questions thank you
