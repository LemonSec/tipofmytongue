1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,589
so hello and welcome to our presentation
of today thank you for a nice

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:11,820
introduction so we will percent based
smartphones and what girls do actually

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,490
with this kind of smartphones so let me
first introduced ourselves many Mr bass

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,288
ever go see your information systems
audit our security company called

5
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,039
Congress 2nd weekend I do most of the
time penetration testing any kind of

6
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,419
security audit and consulting in this
area and I was at the same kind of OT

7
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:41,760
research project during work time of
some spare time and I like to play with

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,500
software defined radio think it's a very
exciting new technology and new

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:53,039
opportunities arise in the research
field there I'm also based home

10
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,620
automation system that's why I chose to
do some research and 63 with me as my

11
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:11,130
colleague Florian so he is also a second
Vienna the same department and retain

12
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:17,570
his archaeologists delivered the
traditional way of it

13
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:25,430
whatever what do we want to cover now
first I want to give you a short

14
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:34,830
introduction which areas it used not
only for small items today I will resent

15
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:40,350
you my journey I made during the sixty
research this means but first I looked

16
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,990
into the standard discovered a lot of
security measures in there then took a

17
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:51,720
little deeper dive and it got worse and
then I tested some devices we brought

18
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:59,908
them today and implementations really
really ugly and really mess tent we plan

19
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:07,970
to do a live demonstration but we have a
backup because it's a little bit so what

20
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:14,870
it's all about and small towns I built
my place

21
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:22,549
system and you simply because it's one
of the most popular smartphone protocols

22
00:02:22,549 --> 00:02:26,609
at the moment and it's also wireless so
I don't need any cables a lot of mental

23
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:30,720
support sick be there are a lot of
certified products out there and it's

24
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,670
open so I can't really look at the
recent that there is no fee for getting

25
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,750
the specification so sick with a
wireless standards especially designed

26
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:49,480
for low-cost low-power devices it's
based on a Tripoli 802 1534 so actually

27
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,980
residing on the network and application
layer so therefore less physical America

28
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,108
which is covered in the ad released and
there is implementing network and

29
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:06,200
application layer that is a two-way this
means messages get acknowledged and is

30
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:13,988
considered as very reliable option in
this field so it is not only used for

31
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:19,670
adams is also used in remote control
healthcare retail services smart energy

32
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:24,119
but I want to especially mention about
energy is different than

33
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,780
smart homes in this area people who
created the smart energy profile put the

34
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:39,180
little more effort and thinking about
security what s interesting so it's also

35
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,019
on the rise

36
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:47,819
nasa launched a rocket beginning of this
year and it also contains sixty sensors

37
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:53,849
for measuring temperature pressure and
so the parachute is actually controlled

38
00:03:53,849 --> 00:04:00,429
using ZigBee devices this means I don't
only theoretical topic so it gets really

39
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:08,909
used as an industry high-cost
applications developed by the Alliance

40
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:14,510
this is just some logos from the
homepages either really the big players

41
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:21,399
are important in sick so it's also very
popular and therefore companies behind

42
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:28,729
it will drive the evolution of the kind
of stuff so why it is important so why I

43
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:35,639
don't want to talk about especially
sickly and and wireless modems so it is

44
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:42,160
expected that till 2020 the amount of
devices devices will rise to 26 billion

45
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:49,630
and it is so the garden a prediction but
over 500 smart devices per household

46
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:59,740
should be there in 2022 yeah but even if
its 150 its huge amount and it's so you

47
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,610
need to have wireless communication
would be an option in my opinion because

48
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:16,900
it's also the CEO really interesting
announcement beginning of this year said

49
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:24,198
every something device will be part of
the OT to 2019 so the development will

50
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,330
be Sunday race

51
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:37,590
are set to another example of how sick
he is used in the real world this year

52
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:44,419
some guys in Austin and you s really
important interesting project so the

53
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:51,870
best grown sick be scanning device so
the drama slaying of Austin and scanning

54
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:58,270
for 60 devices a range of 100 metres I
think so you can look it up and think

55
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,198
it's very interesting you can see in the
life we're very directed rawness what

56
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:10,000
devices are out there this is a summary
of the project statistics they detected

57
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,729
in the first runs it was twenty minutes
led they detect that this amount of

58
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:25,128
devices this means it's 1500 runabout so
twenty minutes that's huge amount of my

59
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:30,789
opinion and you also see there it's not
only one vendor this is a list of what

60
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:35,729
was meant as the sound producing the
secure devices so it's a very diverse

61
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:41,770
field but you can see for example
Phillips has a higher amount that's

62
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:42,960
appealing to you

63
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:52,628
system also Sony or control for the very
common smoking devices are a popular

64
00:06:52,629 --> 00:07:00,900
there that's also a picture of the map
to see a really a lot of sixty artists

65
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:09,830
so why do we need security in this field
so for me home admission includes home

66
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,279
home has for me I privacy requirements
the home admissions a huge source of

67
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:19,839
personal estate and there is a higher
interest in it not only by some random

68
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:25,590
external attackers were brought to the
US the quote from the former CIA

69
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:30,440
director David Petraeus items of
interest bg-locate identify monitor and

70
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,890
remotely controlled through radio
technologies technology such as radio

71
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,320
frequency identification centimeter
extending better service energy

72
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,400
harvesters are connected to the next
generation Internet so the next

73
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:50,810
generation in the internet and this
relation is so that's exactly what is so

74
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:58,270
there is an interest in it so now the
good when you look for in a take a first

75
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:03,240
look at the at the standard would find
some really nice security measures to

76
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,700
talk about it you think so they're
playing symmetric encryption using a S&C

77
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:13,750
same boat with the 103 did it keep their
back to greater protection up to 128 bit

78
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:19,650
and they also introduced replay
protection for bathroom counter which is

79
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:28,669
actually for the purpose of the devices
its ok so think about it does put a very

80
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:34,270
nice statement in the recommendation in
the specification so every one of the

81
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:39,579
security features should be developed
and tested by security experts but it's

82
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:48,450
been really learn later on there are not
too much security experts out there so

83
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,920
what else interesting

84
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:57,939
security system provides that seven
different security layers levels this

85
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:04,440
means you can apply a lot of combination
about what kind of I want to provide how

86
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:11,570
long what kind of key key length so it
out seven different levels but you can

87
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:18,270
only play one security network which
means that your lowest security capable

88
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,520
device was determined the network
security level of network means for

89
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,760
example a light switch

90
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:30,860
switchers out there using simply don't
even have battery this means they press

91
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,620
the energy for sending the radio
commands just by pressing the button so

92
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:44,260
to turn mechanical energy into the radio
commander the security is just based on

93
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:50,819
symmetric encryption so the keys are
really important for that they have two

94
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:56,670
different kind of case on network level
and the tricky and application-level the

95
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:01,900
college link is this means it's a device
to device key so many compromise the

96
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:07,890
network level in theory you were just
able to to listen to some also encrypted

97
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:16,280
communication then but we we will see
but also from the standard so they

98
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,060
really highlighted that it's very
important and only real and that the

99
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:26,609
secrecy of securitization secure
installation secure processing and also

100
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:33,790
secure storage of the keys today to show
you then security and processing of the

101
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:40,360
keys and other things election so
because security researcher caused

102
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,730
rivers good speed he yeah took a couple
of sixty devices and extracted the key

103
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:51,020
material out there just not very
surprising because as mentioned the

104
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,130
beginning its low-cost low-power devices
so they're not temporary assistant at

105
00:10:55,130 --> 00:11:02,630
all you can just grab the keys but for
this unit is Alexis so he's a really

106
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:07,680
important in the secrecy of case but how
did it get to your device so the

107
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,739
standard specifies three different ways
and means you can reinstall it at the

108
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:17,530
factory you can do it out of energy
transfer of defender recommended so this

109
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:22,230
means you are using wireless
communications so don't exchange to keep

110
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:29,680
Wireless do it may be using a cable or a
key in there are many options of doing

111
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,689
this and key establishment but just so
you need a supreme cities because

112
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,840
master keys so in the end my opinion
there are two options european starlet

113
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:49,380
are you doing a key transport our
devices I know we tested and it took to

114
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:54,580
really a lot of people in this field
just doing an in-band key transport so

115
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:04,880
rates gets bad aside from the security
measures provided on an application

116
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:11,240
profiles so application profiles define
how secure devices communicate to each

117
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,970
other so they enable them to agree and
message formats what processing has to

118
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:26,620
be done after receiving certain action
so they enable them to be comfortable

119
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:33,360
and durable interoperability so what is
very important their startup attributes

120
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:40,920
its so this means every device has some
kind of default configuration when it

121
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,589
start up and these data attributes a
very interesting for example for home

122
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:51,430
automation profile took two or two 2
most security relevant start-up

123
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:57,310
attributes the first one is the four
Trustin telling this means in the past

124
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:03,020
exchange to keep without encryption in
plain text so some research a totem that

125
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:09,380
this is not the best way so implemented
cryptically exchange but they also

126
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:14,850
defined at the photo G-forty my sister
don't know each other which is okay for

127
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:23,690
for some reasons but the nation with the
second attribute that different linkage

128
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:30,720
I'm so they require you to support this
kind of encryption as a fall break so it

129
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,420
means everything

130
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:38,420
device which is certified has to support
a key exchange using than publicly known

131
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,689
key so my first thoughts were ok

132
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,830
maybe I can jam some kind of
communication to trigger the devices to

133
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:52,270
a BBQ exchange but it turns out you
don't need to do this because all of the

134
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:56,780
devices just using this far back because
they've been agreed method of changing

135
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:01,069
kids why should the potential additional
effort and their complaint to the

136
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:09,320
standards very frustrating from security
perspective there for example another

137
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:15,760
application profile is alleged link
profile Phillips using this prefer using

138
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,880
a different approach of security

139
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:25,680
obscurity when we name it they agreed
that they will use a secret key not

140
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,479
publicly known likened the use a secret
key for encrypting this vector network

141
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:41,290
key so these key is only deliver to
certain manufacturers sign contracts and

142
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,469
they will really keep keep it secret

143
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:52,710
this doesn't work history told us so if
you look it up on google you would find

144
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:59,130
some postbag I called my a-six had the
honor to to meet him in person and it's

145
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:03,870
really funny because it's a constant
chase he puts post on the internet and

146
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:09,050
then they get deleted because the secure
lenses wants to keep the kids safe or

147
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:15,329
secret deletes all the time his messages
so it's a constant battle posting it

148
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:23,130
deleting it in addition to that the
letting profile also specifies the

149
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,500
linkages means a lot to improve devices
competent route to home automation

150
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:33,070
devices they also support the default
key people trust and the linky and

151
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:43,520
security line and third very interesting
attribute called network or fresh which

152
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,720
means to not check the frame counter

153
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,830
counters for replay protection so there
is a high chance that

154
00:15:51,180 --> 00:16:00,099
ladling certified products will never be
to replay so three pointed out the home

155
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:04,990
of the mission profile requires you to
support an old encryption key as far

156
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:10,700
back which means practically the same
security level is doing a plane tix King

157
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:16,630
change and the superb letting profile
uses a secret but known for protecting

158
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:19,170
these kids changes so they are
vulnerable

159
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:27,280
the next step we took a look that
real-world implementations and tried to

160
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:33,670
to validate our research and look how
it's really implemented in the real

161
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:41,689
world and they are really just only rely
on the 24 bucks so during the research

162
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:50,320
and implementations came across a secure
open-source takes the bus and there is

163
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,140
an interesting service in their
specification is talking about the

164
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:02,689
request a service device can call the
central figure out what is the network

165
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:09,210
key so to call it because key I don't
get it why you need to buy you would

166
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:12,760
need such kind of service because when
you just when you have planned network

167
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,690
encryption the device will only accept
encrypted messages this means you need

168
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:27,170
to know the network key to create a
village commander so and if you are not

169
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:34,130
using an encrypted network is no keys so
I don't get it why you should do that

170
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:40,600
kind of service and I'm not the only one
that doesn't get it because I looked

171
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:46,340
them up in some kind of comments that
have been opposed to state that he

172
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,270
doesn't know what to do when receiving
this command to dissent that the current

173
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,139
network he shoulda sent the previous
network key to the city

174
00:17:53,140 --> 00:18:00,580
encrypted or not unencrypted it's not
clear so the specification is yeah

175
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:07,439
very blurry and this point so what the
significance or steak is doing and it is

176
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:13,289
and security transfer service center in
plain text doesn't also doesn't really

177
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:19,940
make sense victory first comment also
really interesting as application keys

178
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:26,000
are not implemented this means that the
security level it's only based on the

179
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,690
network key and there are no device to
device is possible using this version of

180
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:38,590
the sequence or sick so a lot of
different products like that all up if

181
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:45,899
there is a popular smart home system
smart things which are you sit home and

182
00:18:45,899 --> 00:18:54,428
some light bulbs for better visibility
Phillips you and so the results were

183
00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:59,740
very interesting because they all use
just the default wrestling foreign

184
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:04,679
exchange and they don't support linky so
don't support encryption application

185
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:09,529
level so that means when you get the
network key you get you compromise the

186
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:14,019
whole network there are no secret
security configuration possibilities

187
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:18,159
this means I can't change the network is
this means if it's compromised you have

188
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:25,279
to throw that in there is also an
accumulation of played just 14 months

189
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:43,450
now there is no key rotation so it makes
it very hard reset the device so

190
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:49,769
compromised you can throw it away and
leopards are so they don't require

191
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:53,740
physical interaction for preparing so
they're constantly looking for the best

192
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:59,429
appear is also very very nasty because
for example your neighbor as it develops

193
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:04,010
the review system you can just steal his
life boats and switch on

194
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:15,060
allowed to offer not just in the bedroom
would be very funny because they they

195
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:20,990
they are aware of this problem and put a
little bit around in there so when you

196
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:26,370
start for example at the Phillips you
system a search for Phillips 22 China

197
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:31,169
the truth commission paula is very
limited because otherwise you will

198
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:36,320
always get ya the lebanese from your
neighbor and still is constantly so you

199
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,510
have to be very very close to appear
unknown LED bulbs to a system which

200
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:48,250
means they're really great running yeah
you need a popular connection for this

201
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:56,360
so you going up there and Philip Sousa
stemming and connect the devices so this

202
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:02,070
means under first look ok there is
something wrong in the design so this

203
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,330
shouldn't be this way to should be
another way of doing this

204
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:15,730
ok then the funny part we developed also
a tool for for security testing so call

205
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:24,430
it sixty 60 and we wanted to build a
tool for for enabling security auditors

206
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:29,980
testing security implementation and also
we had in mind such kind of put to

207
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:36,250
enable developers to do a quick check
the security critical implementations

208
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,290
mistake this means that just like an
automated vulnerability scanner for

209
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:50,550
reusing the recipe software-defined
radio cuz it's very powerful device and

210
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:56,120
we are still using the rest very happy
with extension Port Harcourt raspy

211
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:05,110
communication we will get to this level
using the software layer we have the

212
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:11,679
tools based on AP radio Killa Cali on
top of that we will now be known

213
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,570
functions mean we implement

214
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:18,200
encryption because corruption was not
available or is not integrated into

215
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,800
Libya and i notice all modern sick
limitations are using encrypted

216
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:29,889
communication so at the moment we are
providing some kind of really nice

217
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,590
feature so we supporting group the
communication we can do command

218
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,790
injection

219
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:40,399
skin constantly for this week key
transport and take the keys and storage

220
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,180
device they also some nice features like
a recent victory commands we can reset

221
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:53,750
the lead pipes can try and trying to
network and can do it all in an

222
00:22:53,750 --> 00:23:03,340
automated way so why are we using two
devices has two different ways of

223
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:11,199
communicating from coordinated device
which means the college direct indirect

224
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:19,820
so we struggled a long time because in
theory it should work but we didn't get

225
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:30,360
what was the problem doesn't work so the
real world powers the power supply which

226
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,959
means to figure out their receivers on
other times you can send every full-time

227
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:42,460
messages there that's called a direct
transfer just ended a two-day you can

228
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:50,110
acknowledge and indeed ok received very
good but it hurts but it for low-power

229
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:55,399
devices this means for example the door
lock we have just been a republic and to

230
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,480
save battery power

231
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,030
the receivers off most of the time just
wakes up every five seconds and checks

232
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:09,050
at the route that is there are available
for me this means they're so it later

233
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:13,000
requests and waits for an acknowledged
and in their knowledge there is a flex

234
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,850
spending for this device or not so if
you get an acknowledged there is no data

235
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,679
to sleep

236
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:29,480
and you can't send data so the problem
is it's a very small temperaments Syria

237
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,360
that eight Melissa against you have to
send

238
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:41,429
acknowledged and yeah since we are I am
NOT the best programa treated me your

239
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:45,370
subpoena implementation is too slow so
it's tense at times too slow

240
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:48,840
kaczynski's goes from radio signal

241
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:56,070
mutilation to sea level and to pace and
I do some work on the picket and then it

242
00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:03,540
goes again paid to see that it's good
sent using the recipe and there are much

243
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:07,110
faster so it doesn't automatically
acknowledging so we are using the

244
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:12,169
raspberry for doing acknowledging and
sending them the day 22 or doing the

245
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:20,510
indirect to direct it later transferred
using we're doing on the recipe so now

246
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,379
it gets interesting we're doing them we
try to do

247
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:29,900
key extraction this means we know the
public exchanges insecure most vendors

248
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:36,450
implement only for big solution and the
same security level is spending change

249
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:41,790
so first I want to show you a video
about just the simple sniffing of the

250
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:50,790
scant so that's left is to set up so we
have a daughter smarting system to your

251
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:55,960
spirits perry the secretary is running

252
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:08,740
and the Middle that's the smart things
mobile application so I put searching

253
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:16,420
for new devices the door lock into
training mode to see the left there is

254
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:26,730
some output devices could try and we
will see this later on in a more

255
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:30,440
detailed way but just to show you we are
able to extract the key

256
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:39,050
this kind of devices just to the normal
traditional peering so we took this went

257
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:43,040
to the defenders and also to signal and
said ok this might be a problem because

258
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:48,730
everybody is required to just do this
kind of stuff and nobody tells them

259
00:26:48,730 --> 00:27:00,610
ok first initial make sure nobody is
closed around you and but the said

260
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:05,399
that's absolutely no problem because the
time frame is very very limited that's

261
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,900
true that the temperament is limited you
have to get the red tickets but there

262
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:19,740
are some ways you can exchange for
example you can't AM radio communication

263
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:26,160
every 2 p.m. do so strange to do well as
devices connection just to reappear

264
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:34,470
Reuters key part doesn't work anymore to
repair so just simply communication and

265
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:41,540
wait for the users to report device this
is an option but not the best so we

266
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:45,899
looked at another way to trigger the key
transport and sniff it and we found one

267
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,900
so

268
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,100
we need

269
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:09,650
the display from the laptop

270
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:44,130
so on the left of his 26 between running
the relay output device human-readable

271
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:53,820
size of texts that's the typical problem

272
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,340
yeah

273
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:54,350
the problem is constantly sniffing for
for the best communication and makes a

274
00:29:54,350 --> 00:30:00,418
list of devices are out there and since
we didn't take any communication between

275
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:06,169
the dollar and there are only found one
device the router so we had to shoot

276
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:12,220
sort of communication that also the
doggies source list

277
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:57,830
display because the File menu comes here

278
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,560
yeah

279
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:23,250
maybe we can do it later on in more
controlled way so what we have seen that

280
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:29,930
there is a special command it's called
reach I'm so if a device is able to to

281
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:36,520
reach and the network using a not
secured request called creature in

282
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:44,160
security line so that's actually a shock
output so this is the return requests to

283
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,410
get the region response what's
interesting is the rich and respect

284
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:53,200
respect request is that the security
level is set to force this means there

285
00:31:53,200 --> 00:32:00,450
is no unit no secret I can just extract
the necessary for sending this request

286
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,860
specific the radio so that means you
just need the address of the target

287
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:10,939
system and an address of what system
you're trying to fake so we see the

288
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:15,820
security level their response and what
you get is you to get the key transport

289
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:25,260
actually in the CNN Wire shock so what
key is used for for encrypting this

290
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:34,740
message and it's a different resettling
key and the next one is still active

291
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:42,050
network er signet ring is using so we
can trigger the ski response just very

292
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:47,080
easy so they also can't say anymore it's
just a limited to time frame I can

293
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:52,939
triggered whenever I want to be funny so
we need no physical exercise for this we

294
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,630
don't know any

295
00:32:54,630 --> 00:33:00,580
we don't need any knowledge of secret
key and usability overruled secret

296
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,550
security in this field and we fully
compromised system because doesn't play

297
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:13,690
application-level keys so mixed up with
them being back on

298
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:25,889
seems that let me first played every
doing so what we now do is open the door

299
00:33:25,889 --> 00:33:33,299
lock using the same setup again the
midstream you see the smartphone app the

300
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:39,668
green sign there is the state's the door
is locked to see the boat is at the door

301
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:50,639
so beginning it just a bit closer to
using the smart from EPS so you see its

302
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:55,769
all wrenched it unlocked you can bet
that a lot it again using this month for

303
00:33:55,769 --> 00:33:56,669
them

304
00:33:56,669 --> 00:34:04,769
application green so closed again then
using use out to to to inject the

305
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:14,389
command to see now it's back up again
the device again what's very interesting

306
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:21,480
is the smartphone or on the cloud based
application you won't notice this kind

307
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,719
of change because it's not recognized
you can under 61111 is not monitored or

308
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:37,348
can do whatever you want you won't
notice it so I think we report the life

309
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:46,089
partner in the end of time so what is
the outcome of this at first glance the

310
00:34:46,089 --> 00:34:52,219
security level is sufficient so you
first look at the door in sync ok the

311
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:56,098
Securities pretty solid but when you
take your shift to shift your

312
00:34:56,099 --> 00:35:01,369
perspective you find some weak points
how to easily entering compromise the

313
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:05,990
system so that means the security
measures provided a good series but some

314
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:08,990
requirements for end users

315
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:16,930
the security list the liberal
drastically so this means members only

316
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:21,370
absolute implement only the absolute
minimum to be complained to the

317
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:25,720
specification they need to have
complained system to sell it on the

318
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:29,669
market so it's a bit of a market share
up there because the episode 6 meters

319
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,700
see we're releasing

320
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:40,930
released a threat there really a lot of
various well as protocols out there and

321
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:49,020
they battle for the battle for market so
what I want to take you out of the

322
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:54,730
session so the implementation of
security measures is crucial and

323
00:35:54,730 --> 00:36:01,200
complaint is not securities so that's
the first point we should learn

324
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:06,410
should learn from history and don't make
the same mistakes again and again like

325
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:10,740
security by obscurity is a known be
compressed practice so don't rely on

326
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:22,529
that and there is a real decide
disappear P so we can also do with $300

327
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:28,170
dollar also very surprising physical
assessment to

328
00:36:34,050 --> 00:37:00,340
so I think we try this

329
00:37:46,010 --> 00:38:00,710
very pretty descending to face so take
that sort of serious 0 it's always

330
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:10,420
different address for your center rota
and this is $1 so what we now want to do

331
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:24,570
is triggered returned first so we have
to select but this display so we're

332
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:32,460
trying to to fake a return from the
Dollar Tree Road so but the source the

333
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,460
daughter in this destination that ya
know

334
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,640
ok

335
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:52,540
and then we just sent the security and
we have to get it so we make a couple of

336
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,540
data requests

337
00:39:09,609 --> 00:39:14,660
so we also need to buy a shock

338
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:45,730
we didn't return requests and we get to
return response from the router and then

339
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:49,120
we are doing an additional day to
request to just 22 to collect the

340
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,120
messages and then we also get the
transport

341
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:54,310
so now we have to want to trigger
command from the figure out that the key

342
00:40:54,310 --> 00:41:01,890
to the door so we need to select
different source selector rather source

343
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:16,110
so then lock

344
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:36,510
destination expand its programming
mistake so it's all relative to 22

345
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:52,440
resource and since the sources only one
destination it's zero can see you

346
00:41:52,440 --> 00:42:02,330
injected using the right countess is
there is a replay protection so we need

347
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:05,330
to put a little more offsetting it

348
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,790
ok

349
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:32,710
maybe there is there is really a problem
because precious so I think we chose the

350
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:40,020
ok so but on display

351
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:48,040
we are minutes so we can do it so can
thank you for your attention

352
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:54,879
anybody's interested we can show you
more relaxed with them later on if

353
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,330
you're interested also the features of
the table and how to handle it so it's

354
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:22,750
on get up you can download it it's free
for for everyone and questions so where

355
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:25,750
do you live in Austra

356
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:33,470
yeah yeah

357
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:42,529
questions yeah but it's just applied to
the door in private they used I don't

358
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:47,380
use this stuff so I also recommend
everybody think about what is your

359
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:51,210
application stuff

360
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:56,349
elected playing around but don't use it
for four critical systems like door

361
00:43:56,349 --> 00:44:03,520
locks or whatever it's critical to you
thanks for a presentation from has a

362
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:08,450
media apart from hiring your company
what would you suggest she does now

363
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:13,230
that's a good question

364
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:23,810
communication with the PLO Lance they're
releasing this year a new standard

365
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:24,690
version

366
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:35,080
the tried to to fix some of these
vulnerabilities try to do to get rid of

367
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:41,520
for example the insecurity so that's one
of the most critical stuff because there

368
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:47,750
is no real need for for this command so
do the user would have to do an AMA

369
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:55,220
rejoin procedure which is quite common
nowadays to to do this or so for example

370
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:59,680
whether others also using a sticker of
initial password on it and you have to

371
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,368
enter it in the system you can also
deliver for example to secure lock

372
00:45:03,369 --> 00:45:08,910
sticker on it for it then there is a
unique different key to enter in Europe

373
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:14,960
secure outta this difficulty in you can
exchange using this one time talking

374
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,300
yeah you're active network key so they
are very fit and they're trying to

375
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:25,750
increase the security level but deborah
amos the sort products to to customers

376
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:34,420
and how to update the old wood products
and also the new standard is somehow

377
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:42,280
backwards compatible so this means
that's an interesting point but the

378
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:47,130
reason why we talk in detail about today
about insecure region is we're

379
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:54,609
discussions now for a long time and its
most of the time you get some marketing

380
00:45:54,609 --> 00:46:01,589
responses and not really not really what
they want to do because they're they're

381
00:46:01,589 --> 00:46:06,299
not sure how to what the what is the
best way to handle it and I just want to

382
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:12,940
mention you can build secure networks
but they are not certified then you

383
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:22,339
won't get the security certified
signatory this is full version 12 so I

384
00:46:22,339 --> 00:46:27,049
wasn't there became profiles a different
we looked at home automation profiling

385
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:30,670
alleging profile because they're the
most popular ones the smart energy

386
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:35,960
profile for example is is very very
different so they're using search for

387
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,720
securing keeps changing the kind of
stuff so the security level is much

388
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,140
higher

389
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:54,379
one last question thank you thank you

390
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,780
the elaborate
