00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,020
you are fuel but you are selected
audience interested in cryptography

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:08,090
Welle Welle Welle Cup

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:15,330
kindly remember I'm neither native
speaker nor ingrained in anglo-saxon

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:25,960
culture so before taking in solid please
ask me if I really meant it I start with

5
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:33,790
Russian old Russian probe the German
speakers know this as ontology scoot

6
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:40,670
scoot control it's better but actually
that's not what it says it says will I

7
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:48,820
get married 5 and if X recently in a
contract and said he can't hear anything

8
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:54,079
about trust anymore you want to talk
about confidence and I it real with him

9
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,590
that I don't want to hear any more about
trust because that is completely

10
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:07,549
misleading consider one department of
develop us giving software to another

11
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:14,340
department and asking whether do you
trust us that's completely irrelevant we

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:22,360
are you should be talking about the
Alliance and reliability reliance means

13
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:29,369
I rely on somebody or something and I
realized that it has specific features

14
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:37,250
that it's doing things in a specific way
and to rely the reliability have to be

15
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:46,789
proving that is to be very fight so that
should give a general note for this old

16
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:56,200
talk or perspective to look at it I
started with I T berry berry in 1979 in

17
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,399
school experiment then I continued at
the University of cuts were doing

18
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:11,870
studies research at the European
Institute of systems security since 1993

19
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,480
I'm self employed

20
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:24,700
security consultant and you'll see some
talks I have given yeah so how did I

21
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:35,149
come to this topic I'm talking about
when I started ITT wass something really

22
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:47,870
new but it was not widespread when I
started the official position was no

23
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,500
more than five thousand computer
scientists will be needed on the whole

24
00:02:52,500 --> 00:03:00,870
world so boy don't study computer
science you will be unemployed when one

25
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:06,109
thing we definitely definitely learned
from come from conferences like this is

26
00:03:06,109 --> 00:03:17,260
we will NEVER unemployed so I often did
experiments intellectual partners with

27
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:23,880
my team and one was concerned with the
surroundings i helped

28
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,139
hometown is too young and that is
situated between my friend wants and

29
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:37,090
that is a very lonely a populated area
so it's always problematic for a few

30
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:45,180
minutes to get public transport the
obvious idea is hitchhiking but he tried

31
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,690
and was not so good an idea that time
because there have been several

32
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:57,310
incidents that the question is is it
possible with the school in new toy to

33
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,519
billet the support for security tracking

34
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:13,920
that would have been the design
objectives traveled should be an

35
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,919
enormous if possible

36
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:23,510
normally trip not possible to track
people but on the other hand we need

37
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:29,389
some kind of crime prevention
prosecution that is we need registration

38
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:43,190
if a driver and a passenger bond for a
transport and if a person goes missing

39
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:53,270
this tracks should be opened to support
police work further things would of

40
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:59,680
course be to match travel opportunities
and wishes and the idea was to integrate

41
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:07,430
all this in the public transport system
pointed out that was in the time before

42
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:16,030
public key crypto before mobile phones I
had a solution but I won't show your it

43
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:23,830
would have worked but nowadays everybody
would love about this so one more

44
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:34,150
example I took part in writing the
school administration of the federal

45
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:41,299
state I lived in it was mostly developed
by pupils interests interesting limp I

46
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:51,280
came into the team because I had to
school computer and its security for

47
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,380
this project so there's a challenge how
do you prevent anybody later on

48
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:08,900
impeaching the graduation diploma of the
pupil us because they are part of the

49
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,679
project

50
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:20,479
the solution actually was very simple
our headmaster when we are trying to

51
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:28,840
deploy mas stated publicly that he had
calculated all the Diploma of the party

52
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:37,940
participations by plant on paper he did
it not because he did not trust us he

53
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:44,680
did it to prevent impeachment of the
credit and that is interesting because

54
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,440
we see from this simple example that
they are much more security dimensions

55
00:06:50,440 --> 00:07:02,050
then only CIA confidentiality integrity
availability we need in real life we

56
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,490
need

57
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:11,690
electorate security that is not some
party is the trusted one believed us we

58
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:20,240
are the good ones but each party has
interests to the event and we need much

59
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,199
more security dimensions then the
classic ads read we need the proof of

60
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:34,979
correctness we need auditor portability
of verifiability we need separation of

61
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:45,770
duties we need non-repudiation and what
is often overlooked we need proof of

62
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:53,620
coalition versus what is a question of
human interface design then we need

63
00:07:53,620 --> 00:08:03,409
privacy and that has various dimensions
I don't want to does too deep into this

64
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:14,190
the original example what I wanted two
percent on which letter to the abstract

65
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:20,060
of multi multi billion on trusting
parties

66
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,770
accomplishment because it's from a
customer's name made up a new example

67
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:31,099
fictitious example well actually it's
more about reliance and reliability I do

68
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,570
this in the form of a software social
science fiction that is the hard science

69
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:41,740
should be the trip to the correct me if
I do anything wrong in the truck traffic

70
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:51,490
aspects and I'm use only things which
are quarter of a century around the soft

71
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:58,130
outer shell is a fictional society team
with various personas and they are

72
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:06,950
stances and I asked suspension of
disbelief for the society is it's normal

73
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:13,420
for science fiction that should give us
a sufficiently complex and vivid example

74
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:24,370
and the example will be in
telecommunication retention and the

75
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:34,110
question if you could do this in a way
which balances the privacy and the

76
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:41,470
possibility to do police investigations
so that our trip to classic instruments

77
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:52,410
I mostly a wipe Boyd family house and we
have private and public I think I can

78
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,589
sake we have

79
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:08,400
encrypted content you know that is
typically would be and hybrid encryption

80
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:19,270
we have content first signed and sealed
content first encrypted sense you you

81
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:26,870
may wonder why do I want the bird
signature well I think 62 signed

82
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:33,120
something is a misnomer because signing
is an act of will listen we're asked

83
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:41,760
ceiling is an act of proving our
tendency of origin and content if a CEO

84
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,030
should count as an act of religion is a
completely different discussion in a

85
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:57,560
completely different dimension in
advance so 400 of yes yeah so just

86
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,609
sealing a question for example or
speculation does not make it a

87
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:08,180
legalistic act it truths this question
all the speculation comes from me and

88
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:19,239
the content has not changed and
occasionally need to use symmetric keys

89
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:26,470
you see this is a symmetric key that's
obvious and we also can have more

90
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:33,940
complex constructs for example that is a
content which is encrypted for the keys

91
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:40,290
of Ellis and pop and it is carrying a
sealed but the seal is detached it's on

92
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:45,579
the content is see it but the seal is on
the outside you will see why I need this

93
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:55,840
later ok so that is our fictitious
society constitutional democracy

94
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:02,350
politically active and we have
investigated of science

95
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:09,650
authorities in examining magistrate the
Privacy Commissioner and of course

96
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,600
telecommunication service

97
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:22,560
riders so that your perhaps understand
better the Society of Tropical motto for

98
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,560
this society would be in a Damascus

99
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:45,009
police state and not wise that is a
stance of that society we investigated

100
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:51,240
instigated authorities have an
obligation crime prevention and

101
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,120
prosecution that brings them in the
position of conflicting interests

102
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:04,399
because they can do the one only when
touching on fundamental civil rights

103
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:13,680
they have intentions during an
investigation they have to keep

104
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:24,349
technical secrecy they want to earn and
keep public confidence they want that is

105
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:31,019
predictable and they want to be able to
exonerate themselves from for a

106
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,120
performance

107
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:41,579
allegations they simply wants to be
protected against relegation you are

108
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:50,870
using your you are abusing your power
fall off in about a similar is examining

109
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:58,399
magistrate he has the obligation in the
end to decide within the legal framework

110
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:08,240
where the breach of civil rights is in
order and he has very similar interests

111
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:18,089
and intentions like the investigated in
instigating service then we have our

112
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:21,089
Privacy Commissioner

113
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:32,949
he is an independent instance of control
provided by the state and he verifies if

114
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:42,150
what examining magistrate decided is
really within the scope of law in our

115
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:49,360
society has a further role he owns a
private key which he has to destroy in

116
00:14:49,360 --> 00:15:00,530
specific cases to stop all further
decoding of telecommunication later than

117
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:06,270
we have to telecommunication provide us
with the obvious thing and essentially

118
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:13,220
don't want to be involved because they
have business to do but of course I want

119
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:19,480
to avoid allegations to of giving data
directly to the investigators what in

120
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:34,280
turn means that they want to delete data
as fast as possible so as we are to map

121
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:40,829
social political decisions we need a
very very flexible framework and a lot

122
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:51,180
of questions should be answered but we
leave this out for lack of time so the

123
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:59,650
first thing we have to decide is what is
to be disclosed to the investigation

124
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:07,780
services the initially the general data
structure we have is we have a handle

125
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:14,980
and opaque protected data and the sender
is information freely available to the

126
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:22,350
investigators and the handle is true
even though it that it's not perceived

127
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:28,130
to empower fundamental rights then we
have picked a time

128
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:34,159
this is a day to pertaining to
fundamental rights and this is only

129
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:39,409
accessible we r procedure we have still
to define but it will be trip to enforce

130
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:49,319
have circulation of you team and will
allow for review and control so it's a

131
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:55,639
subset of the communication data is
linked to give you an example but would

132
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:02,969
be inappropriate if we had the calling
idea as prices start and end time as one

133
00:17:02,969 --> 00:17:10,639
handler in another data that record I D
was present presses stopped want start

134
00:17:10,638 --> 00:17:14,388
time and end time then of course it
would be easy to call it

135
00:17:14,388 --> 00:17:22,458
timestamps and to map these two handed
and say well this was a communication so

136
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:29,669
we need some kind of dilution of
precision to protect against this in

137
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:37,740
Dufferin influence and extrapolation
attacks so for example we could use

138
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,389
calling i dnt looted start time in a
diluted duration

139
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:49,999
idea and diluted start time and duration
or for your location

140
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:58,070
handed people jewels diluted locations
so what should this be for example it

141
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:05,740
eluded start time could be brought to
some time interval and this time

142
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:12,340
intervals put depend on time of day so
for example in the middle of the day it

143
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:17,970
might be around 22 minutes and in the
night it might be around 22 quarter of

144
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:24,720
hours just to ensure that always enough
data sets within each time friend that

145
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,759
no automatic correlation is possible

146
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:33,909
similar things we can do with the
duration and of course we are not bound

147
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:40,550
to do it with the minute we can fit into
any time duration

148
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:48,800
interpret a similar approach could be
used for the locations of for example it

149
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,070
could be here

150
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:58,120
base stations sell proceeded to kill
coordination rounded example minute

151
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,020
whatever we actually could change it
depending on the population density in

152
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:09,370
that area again to guarantee that they
aren't enough blankets so that no

153
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:18,320
automatic inference this possible so
what is our meanest take protected data

154
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,169
while this game

155
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:26,400
decision to make should it be completely
anonymous or should it be sought animus

156
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:37,180
if we make it to sidon numbers then they
investigated services can do some kind

157
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:45,820
of pre investigation so for example they
have the calling idea and they have apps

158
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,870
Origanum for the call it

159
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:55,739
idea now they can match up and for
example select items which are often

160
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:04,160
called and weed out those only called
once or they can select items in a

161
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:12,840
specific time slot and look who else for
example the question is if we want to

162
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:22,060
allow this at this completely visible to
the investigators was out any

163
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:28,100
interference so it's a question how to
sculpt

164
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:36,450
there are many ways to cope so I don't
know we could for example and make some

165
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:44,660
specific context or Peck contact area
another dimension we could vary eight is

166
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,590
the durability of so we can change them

167
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,000
endeavors

168
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,900
we can say Sydenham lips romance for six
months or days whatever it's a decision

169
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:03,020
a political decision of society what it
thinks is an adequate balance between

170
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:13,030
protection of the privacy and enabling
investigations one more thing I don't

171
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,170
believe that

172
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:24,160
telecommunication analysis of data
retention try provides much prevention

173
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:31,980
but of course it helps later to analyze
the structure and then to get at other

174
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:41,690
people may be preparing a second search
attack or to analyze the structure of

175
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:50,570
the organizations are things like that
but normally a tribal happen and lead

176
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:57,679
you to a starting point of investigation
and it's very simple to do this

177
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:09,180
committee here is an example we havin a
nonce for the interval of time and

178
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:16,480
specific for the telecommunication
provider including the conversation and

179
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:25,160
we get subsided by encrypting with the
key to the north of sorts tribal

180
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,150
individual nonstop as we will see later
why

181
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:44,650
so you have a rough idea how this items
we can choose who will see absolute on

182
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:52,060
them so perhaps so I'm not visible to
the investigating services but only to

183
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:57,070
the examining magistrate or they see
different kind of toys

184
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:13,490
yeah we have a lot of Mary abbots where
we can tailor the system to what we

185
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:18,300
perceive about this society perceives as
a balance between privacy and

186
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:27,419
investigation capabilities it has each
choice has its advantages and

187
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,840
disadvantages

188
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:35,199
I think that's light speaks for itself

189
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,850
the important point is that the
framework to test it accommodates the

190
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:44,689
whole continuum that's not a question of
black and white

191
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,260
there are no I

192
00:23:53,860 --> 00:24:02,219
so I choose one kind of slow you will
see that many others would be possible

193
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:08,700
and we make a fundamental decision the
examining magistrate is a gatekeeper of

194
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:14,960
the broad process this process will not
start if the examining magistrate gives

195
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:22,210
not is OK and then the record straight

196
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:28,799
enjoy a free civil ngos representing the
society and the Federal Privacy

197
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:36,918
Commissioner and in the end we see some
valuations what could be done in terms

198
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:49,450
of decision moderates let's start so the
investigative authorities have free

199
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:57,470
access to data sets of this form a
handler and some baked tater signed by

200
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,690
the telecommunication provider

201
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:04,770
well you know may I ask where has to end
on them and I know me too

202
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:10,230
done quite simply that deployed on him
to knowledge and you have an unknown

203
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:19,040
anonymity so they can select the
relevant records by Handel eventually

204
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:25,540
they can narrow down this election's
pipes and disclosure requests and that

205
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:36,570
is a disclosure within this request is a
selection of all the data sets they want

206
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:46,070
to disclose and a lot of other
information which is needed to head to

207
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:56,139
process the examining magistrate now day
trips each of the state asset and here

208
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:01,299
he has his own point of view he might
see information for example

209
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:09,570
more significant i dont terms but also
relevant information about cola

210
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:16,879
awkwardly for example that is a medical
doctor or that is a priest which pertain

211
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:22,090
to the decision by law he has to make
but the individual investigators don't

212
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:29,330
have access to this information if the
examining magistrate is not giving it

213
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:39,059
out of course and he gets three more
opaque data assets now according law he

214
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:49,450
selects the data set records for
disclosure and packs the disclosure

215
00:26:49,450 --> 00:27:00,799
decision and this disclosures decision
museum is accessible post to the Privacy

216
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:12,470
Commissioner and tuzla civil delegate or
NGOs and with in this disclosure

217
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:19,929
decision you to see a decision audit
records which is encrypted to the key of

218
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:30,809
the magistrate and has a detached and
that would be will be important later ok

219
00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:39,168
he forwards the decision to the other
parties the Privacy Commissioner the

220
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:51,619
group's verifies and then decrypt each
state should be disclosed here again get

221
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:57,590
independent information about the record
a gain for example that is a medical

222
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:09,249
doctor or medical office to be concise
and perhaps he also have pseudonyms the

223
00:28:09,249 --> 00:28:12,249
point of this is that

224
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:26,210
maybe investigative services can
formulate a kind of narrowing down

225
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:31,919
requests in let's say a square lol
something like this which would allow

226
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:40,929
the Commission to automatically narrow
down the selection by the he has few of

227
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:43,929
and only he has few of

228
00:28:52,110 --> 00:29:03,969
of privacy commissioner and ultimate he
maybe get a grip macoute area from the

229
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:13,830
investigators he barry fleiss's decision
development in force and depending on

230
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:19,230
the infamous for example he triggers
specific watch lists so for example if

231
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:25,809
information of a medical office has to
be disclosed of journalists then this

232
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:37,110
case will later definitely investigated
besides all the random sample yeah he

233
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:42,240
will do random sample tracks but if
journalists is involved for example he

234
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,440
will definitely check and he has watch
lists for this said he might notify

235
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:53,130
specific institutions and things like
this and he also if he detects that for

236
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:58,400
example a specific request is not
validate he has the power to request

237
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:06,770
that the telecommunication provider
bombs though the upside on them

238
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:16,020
changes if he sees their requests for
subscribers which are not allowed

239
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:21,929
he will always be a subscriber and
deployed on him changes though this

240
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:33,100
cannot be further trekked then he can
extract the crease of the proofs record

241
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:42,699
and send troops for the magistrate and
seal it and of course he can provide

242
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:50,740
statistical reports for statistics so

243
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:59,289
the point is that all parties involved
so far I want by law they have not much

244
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:05,970
freedom to react to circumstances the
examining magistrate has some freedom

245
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:13,230
but of course he has a purpose to enable
the investigation so we need some party

246
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:19,610
which is able to react to circumstances
the question is when that are already

247
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:25,750
legates of civil society they do
essentially a similar thing to the

248
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:32,820
Privacy Commissioner they have again
decision 11 in France and they have

249
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,168
individual

250
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:40,380
we have a look at what a cute

251
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:46,210
additionally later for the moment they
are acting very similar to the Privacy

252
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:52,980
Commissioner uniform and automated to
speed up the investigations but they

253
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:59,980
have only reporting criteria and on time
spent a report that they can immediately

254
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:06,830
raised a hand for example if you have
some whatever gate scandal and suddenly

255
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:14,240
a lot of journalists data should be
disclosed then there came a public

256
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,590
discussion

257
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:28,070
ok now the examining magistrate has the
two case they are explored now he can

258
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:34,939
open up the check out the pic status at
and there he find all the connection

259
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:41,840
location subscriber data signed by the
telecommunications provider this

260
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,730
forwarded to the investigators and they
in return

261
00:32:47,789 --> 00:32:53,700
clear innocent bystanders though that
they are subscriber nonsense could be

262
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,899
bumped

263
00:32:56,899 --> 00:32:59,899
then the examining magistrate

264
00:33:00,749 --> 00:33:07,710
checks if the same subscriber is locked
by another investigation if not he is

265
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:19,999
pumping so that is the investigation
face any questions to the investigation

266
00:33:19,999 --> 00:33:34,509
ok then we come to the verification face
after an investigation is closed after

267
00:33:34,509 --> 00:33:41,849
some period of time the civil society or
the Privacy Commissioner can request

268
00:33:41,849 --> 00:33:54,389
audit of disclosure and now we see the
function of this self encrypted to

269
00:33:54,389 --> 00:33:59,718
social audit we caught it has to be
decrypted by the examining magistrate

270
00:33:59,719 --> 00:34:10,559
and the detached seal keeps him honest
because it proves what he is this

271
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:16,789
cryptic decrypting now is actually the
content is actually but was given with

272
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:25,559
disclosure decision so this can be very
fight the complete procedure Kendall

273
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:31,099
refute if there are any disco Pence's
they will be published and officials

274
00:34:31,099 --> 00:34:38,579
impeached if they acted against the law
when that is done it will be very

275
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:45,960
surprised if the subscriber nonsense
about one already bombed and if not the

276
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:55,059
bumping reaps organization is initiated
so

277
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:03,680
everything can be done but it's not
written it's always open for public

278
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:12,569
vilification after some time now we have
the complete process any questions to

279
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:23,350
the process because now we make things a
little bit more complicated ok so what

280
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:29,089
is if the delegates' of civil society
would have more power for example the

281
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:35,700
freedom to discredit nya disclosure of
course there's a really tricky thing now

282
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,879
because they will hamper investigations
of those not something they do easily

283
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:51,880
but again consider our whatever gets
candid scenario the delegates' for

284
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:58,760
example could say well we will not agree
light handed to this disclosure requests

285
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:05,060
only if we can delegate one or two
people into the investigation was

286
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:10,410
supervising powers of course this which
these people would have been sworn to

287
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:17,540
secrecy yeah and the investigators for
example have to Troy's from route region

288
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:23,910
they are coming out the delegates will
represent choice let's say 12 people and

289
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:28,950
the investigators which was to from
which they assume they have nothing to

290
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:40,669
do with the investigation they won't
guarantee that their suspicions that is

291
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:46,780
that the investigation is related to
whatever gate is wrong and they want

292
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:52,620
this in form of a small guarantee which
could be sued in the courts if problem

293
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:59,560
though they are a lot of possibilities
we could also imagine that the

294
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:04,690
delegates' elected for privacy
manifestos though delegate

295
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:12,780
says that is my stance on disclosure I
have a manifesto and perhaps he has an

296
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:22,390
algorithmic defined manifesto for the
speed of decision and he gets a voting

297
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:29,940
base rate according to the voting
percentages he got for his manifesto on

298
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:35,599
it a native would be that we not only
have been examining magistrate but

299
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:43,650
examining jewell's assesses that depends
in which legal framework thinking again

300
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:50,060
these are sworn to secrecy but they
would be part of and half the point of

301
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,640
view of the examining magistrate

302
00:37:52,640 --> 00:38:00,859
much more information to make their
decision now for something like this to

303
00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:09,910
work you would need some kind of chrome
decision that is a number and number two

304
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:15,690
you out of the end delegates have to
agree with a disclosure and they are

305
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:22,619
mechanisms for this not my intention
secret sharing schemes are very simple

306
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:32,940
approach for example 423 cleric is what
I have sketched you have outer shell for

307
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:39,089
one of the participants and the
International for the other two and then

308
00:38:39,089 --> 00:38:46,259
you can control that only went to search
three the energy is accessible they are

309
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:52,849
much more elaborated schemes from MIA
for example is a perfect secrecy that is

310
00:38:52,849 --> 00:39:00,060
if the threshold is not matter there is
no information whatsoever about to keep

311
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:06,029
this place lately which is parking with
high populations which leaks information

312
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:14,329
that is which each delegate agreeing to
disclosure the search page

313
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:15,620
space for the key

314
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:26,390
becomes smaller and actually that could
be a desirable construction we will see

315
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:40,220
later because in real birds in our boys
accustomed to 201 decisions black and

316
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:48,270
white no shades of grey but in the real
world

317
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:56,310
decisions are normally made in shades of
gray and much more than 50 and the

318
00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:02,920
question is can be modeled that
especially can be modeled what typically

319
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,950
happens in in real life that you showed
reluctance

320
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:26,279
any tendency to the other party to
change behavior we take random bits we

321
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:33,330
have a key derivation function where
View Drive to our key we use a

322
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:41,150
deliberate amount of stretching then we
calculate an error-correcting code for

323
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:48,750
our random bits and distribute the error
correcting code bits to our parties

324
00:40:48,750 --> 00:41:02,790
depending on the about voting power in
trip it with the party's key now the

325
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:11,440
first delegate will not disclose his key
part well actually each delegate can

326
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:19,230
decide and it makes for very very
different mathematical consequences if

327
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:25,260
he discloses nothing at all part of his
or his complete trail and if he

328
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,410
disclosed as part of this year he can't
decide if

329
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:36,430
he discloses with which bit positions he
didn't disclose or not and that leads to

330
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:46,109
interesting things as long as early as
long as long as you have more than

331
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:53,140
chlorine bits you have efficient key
recovery if you have less than current

332
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:58,089
beats at if you will have lesson cleric
beats tonight then you have efficient

333
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:06,360
key recovery if you have more than one
beats tonight plus some margin then you

334
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:12,880
have so-called holding that is who have
a small number of put it possible that

335
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:21,480
any dates and the more it's beyond
floral are denied the more exponentially

336
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:28,860
time of the key becomes to the degree
that its computational not feasible

337
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:36,020
anymore and with this approach I think
we would have traded denial which allows

338
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:47,170
all the normal political instruments 22
convenes to convince the investigator us

339
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:52,530
to behave in the way society ones thank
you for your attention
