1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,339
happy to introduce tension was talking
about hornet base thanks for the

2
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:08,650
introduction

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,849
hello everyone and changes from Carnegie
Mellon University so they're going to

4
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:18,990
present for night has begun arriving at
the network layer so this is a grunt

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:27,150
work with my colleague sonia is only
Deborah Harry and my collaborator George

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:35,500
Dennis so to start with is so I think
you have seen enough evidence about

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:42,300
domestic and international mass Aviles
today government is investing a lot of

8
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:50,559
resources trying to conduct this massive
Fellows Program however a lot of users

9
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,680
who care about their own images and as a
countermeasure so more and more users

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:05,510
begin to adopt that first such as tall
as well P so Victoria's example the

11
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:11,890
triggering the right shows the average
number of daily users between January

12
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:19,680
2015 and marshals on 15 because see that
number about two minutes so even though

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:28,330
that number is pretty huge given but
given the total amount of population

14
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:38,798
that coverage free dowload so why is
that and how can we improve while the

15
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,729
reasons could be that action suit or is
simply slower compared to connection

16
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:52,179
with out on Iranian protection first to
this store is constructed as overlay

17
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,490
network so a link between two
neighboring nodes can traverse the

18
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:04,179
entire internet and this a lot of
propagation latency second so on your

19
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,960
water is today your day operated by

20
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:15,090
host which are operated by volunteers
and there's reports your lower than 100

21
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:21,620
megabits per second so if you
comparative commodity on your waters of

22
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:32,780
really bad guys P so this is pretty
small report so in this work we proposed

23
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:39,150
to on your warnings came into the
network layer for harris reporting lower

24
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:49,010
latency a reason is that future network
of whitewater's can provide on iraqi

25
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:56,340
probabilities for example for each flow
between the source and destination will

26
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,450
assume that the autonomous systems on
the past can negotiate a key with the

27
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:10,299
source and then this is key to any
encrypt or decrypt data so compared to

28
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:16,970
today's tour on the overlay network
which usually use long and exact passed

29
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:23,380
on Iran incredible natural leader will
be able to use shorter pass and more

30
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:33,090
direct past season compared to the post
which has limited throughput waters can

31
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,090
provide much higher

32
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:46,570
so there are already existing proposals
that proposed to implement that works at

33
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:53,650
the network layer so among them are live
and go to the offer price reports there

34
00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:00,270
are eyewitness in the paper showing that
speed is faster however to this date

35
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:08,710
about 40 the offer because beakers
security guarantees for example when the

36
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:16,200
package troopers network in Latin dole
to change so this allows easy man

37
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:24,500
matching matching based on Pinterest
second so this Pakistan is to propose

38
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,430
leaking information about the past for
example how many nodes between the

39
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:37,080
source and destination or knows a
Reuters position on the past source and

40
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:48,830
destination so if we put out this scheme
in scope and if we put security access

41
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,169
and throughput

42
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:58,990
taxes so today's tour square P provide
higher security the lower throughput

43
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:08,780
11th Auto they provide higher support
weaker security guarantee so our goal is

44
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:15,239
to achieve the best post players so we
want better and better security

45
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:24,600
guarantees however like designing a
natural player Iranian protocol is not

46
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:31,390
directly a top to this story is why is
that so will serve that parties and

47
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:38,430
suffers from scalability I don't have a
clear interest or design each underwater

48
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,210
you keep state for certain that
travelers in that war

49
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:49,400
over the state may include on your keys
the information to find that hopes for

50
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:58,388
pointers and flax so how much is that
stage if we letters water actually was

51
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:01,389
this protocol so we simulator

52
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:10,280
assimilate amount of state aided by
using traffic twisted from kada kada

53
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:19,919
backwater so calculate the amount of
state required to store by each water so

54
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,409
you in fact so far waterways hundred
gigabits per second

55
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:35,080
Eternals demands wrong 20 gigabytes
state to be stored so the Orwell the

56
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:43,479
current small high-speed memory onto
this waters so relaxed lies I will

57
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:48,590
present hornet it is a scalable high
speed on Iran protocol at the network

58
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:54,960
layer so horny is capable of achieving
high support that is comparable to

59
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:02,198
today's packing waters and to
sustainability problem over for stage

60
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:11,289
and funny and he's probably equivalent
to an idea on Iranian protocol defined

61
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:14,780
by the research community

62
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:21,989
elaborate more ok so here is your
beloved how to achieve center Nnanna

63
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:31,560
MITI hornet so the communication there
are two phases each session sacrifice

64
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:38,770
and their transmission face liked or
each setup fees or water

65
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:43,960
negotiates a symmetric key with the
source using the Helmand key exchange

66
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:51,650
protocol to reduce delays reduced
compared to tours telescopic way of

67
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:57,640
negotiating peace only uses to set up
packets to traverse ever knows the

68
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:07,190
single largest time later so the rotor
and then your keys set up in the

69
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:14,290
previous face to support fast packet
processing ok so

70
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:23,880
scarab scalability hornet leverages
state of loading technique in general in

71
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:33,520
the surface instead of storing the
state's locally each water packets and

72
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,699
the stores will you click the state from
all those

73
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:43,960
packet transmission place each water

74
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,410
estate to process the data for example
down increase is in the state in order

75
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:57,800
to encrypt or decrypt the key is
required so in this case the source in

76
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:08,109
bad state and you know what you get from
the packet header and then uses data

77
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:17,880
processed the packet so however the
technique is easier said than done there

78
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,970
are two major challenges when putting
state into package

79
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:27,970
first so the secrecy and integrity of
the state has to be protected for

80
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:40,110
example if we don't act secrecy rosary
who cast on encryption or decryption

81
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:47,290
performed by the note so we saw the
state is protected by a single run

82
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,879
implementation

83
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:56,920
local secret while USP of water so the
secret why you ask me is really shared

84
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:03,550
among all the circus travelers in that
water so it's not a personal estate and

85
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:11,660
since this secret by USP local only
known that water so the state is only

86
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:22,329
accessible by that water so so when we
consider the state from all those put

87
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:28,489
together they form past we also need to
protect the information of that pass for

88
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:38,300
example 1102 so you can look at it and
decide harmony knows I between a source

89
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:45,339
and destinations or you can 10 percent
better so 11 don't you know like

90
00:10:45,339 --> 00:10:51,800
traditional so hard this information
pass information and leaking this

91
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:59,849
passage formation at least to the
anonymization techniques so in order to

92
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:06,459
protect the sparse information we
propose to the disclosures in the setup

93
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:10,268
faced Hornet use iface payload and

94
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:19,649
special faced Hornet uses anonymous
letter so let me explain this to

95
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:25,160
destruction the Fallen slice so both of
these two destroyers equipped to the

96
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:31,399
structure they were tasked to contain
the phone assignments and their

97
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:37,810
functions are complementary remember the
source when you talk like four segments

98
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:44,489
in the surface that is done by the
office payload and in your face each

99
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:50,769
data packet containing the state for
each node so that is done by anonymous

100
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:59,540
harder to give you a flavour of how this
to the US Russia work so let me first

101
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:05,589
use of a scale operation as example
recalled that each note 34 assessments

102
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:12,209
in a package during the setup this
operation used here is called at the

103
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:15,619
facts here

104
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:24,620
00 Aaron's payload by using a defense
operation so the import a fast payload

105
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:35,649
is fewer Hispanic first and then no 02
you at prepend is a 40 and had after a

106
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:44,540
spell after that is cut to appropriate
size and finally the resulting as

107
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:51,540
payload encrypted and america is
prepended again at the beginning so I

108
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,649
would like to point out about operations
here first

109
00:12:55,649 --> 00:13:02,779
at a fast processing happened at the
heart of the data structure so therefore

110
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:07,689
performing the operation do not require
on leaked information about those

111
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,680
positions

112
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:17,189
us second most important and output of a
fast payload are of the same size there

113
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,190
for processing this headers

114
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:27,550
processor distance runners information
about never knows between the source and

115
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:42,000
destination so then how his header
operation work here have you used a fast

116
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,839
as an example if a parent note

117
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:54,510
real estate from the packet header so
gimme 10 would like to retrieve state

118
00:13:54,510 --> 00:14:02,550
from dinner package so you can see the
process is very symmetric to the office

119
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:12,939
in fact is the reverse of it so no 0
first 1000 from the hard from the

120
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:20,650
beginning of the packet header and then
it will decrypt 40 first inning keys are

121
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:25,860
fighting back tracks so the header is
really not modified and they will pat

122
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:33,339
harder to the right size and then
decrypt to description of the header so

123
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:40,250
again like if you think about is talk of
Asians so it still holds here therefore

124
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:46,290
both neither of this operation can
League Pass information to 100 percent

125
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:55,870
orders Rahul just monitored the link ok
so

126
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:02,829
up to now so I have to show you how the
narrative structures for offloading

127
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:09,439
offloading state works so now together
let's look at how the process actually

128
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:16,500
works in the subways and in the data
transmission face so in the surface

129
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:23,920
relies on another probably secure on
Iranian protocol close things so things

130
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:31,990
have started to set up a session state
including the keeps however we cannot

131
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:38,199
use strings for the entire process that
is because processing Springs package

132
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:44,040
requires diffie-hellman key operation
which is very slow and cannot support

133
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:51,920
high throughput so each things packet
contains us things harder which allows

134
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,849
the package coastal network and
negotiate peace with each hop and also

135
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,819
ask things payload which allows the
source

136
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:11,089
confidential data to the station however
took like four segments each setup

137
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:17,850
package also have a scaled which is the
source components in the in the figure

138
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:29,509
so at the beginning of the setup is hers
Sun header and footer for us and the

139
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:35,300
reply harder for the backward pass the
source used sense things harder to send

140
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:42,109
the first packet to the station and then
place the reply harder things payload so

141
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:49,579
that nation current roommate and family
issues of a spot in the first half

142
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:56,258
packets as the first half against rivers
network generates is known for its

143
00:16:56,259 --> 00:17:03,340
segments inserted into a skilled and you
reach the station now that's nation

144
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:11,190
can create a second suspicious package
or price hits package this is done by

145
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:17,880
trade reply header from the first and
put in the springs had a second package

146
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:24,110
retrieved all the 42nd season started in
the first packet and put it as a pillow

147
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:37,320
for the source content and then a second
package when jewish tourists can see the

148
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:46,460
package contains all of our assignments
for every note on the past so now you'll

149
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:53,290
be able to obtain orders for 40 seconds
from the reply package so that is the

150
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:59,920
end of the staff is now entered the
transmission fees

151
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:11,389
transmitter face so there is no more
research each data package contains none

152
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:18,080
of cider which led endowed with state
and Allen payload which which has data

153
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,590
and which is the equivalent encrypted
and decrypted at the beginning of the

154
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,840
transition phase

155
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:34,800
source creates $220 headers once for
each other which can be used to send

156
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,560
data from source to destination and the
backward header which can be used to

157
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:47,120
send data back to source however at this
time point source has these matters that

158
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,080
issue does not yet have the back of her
to send a pic expect so

159
00:18:53,730 --> 00:19:01,570
to allow that the source in the first
package you sent this letter as close to

160
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:11,340
a destination so that's the Asian tennis
can begin to switch data packets oK so

161
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:20,659
that's roughly how much worse it so now
let's see how receiver anonymity works

162
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:26,950
based on the Sun anonymity protocol like
20 other networks

163
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:35,240
hornet relies on running point to
provide receiver anonymity is running

164
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:42,720
point could be host which are operated
by one here or is he that is willing to

165
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,170
support service for its customer

166
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:54,580
12 points you keep personal estate that
maps the incoming packet from a survey

167
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:57,580
to its potential destination

168
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:10,389
required to keep no perfect estate in
case I P water operate as a as a runner

169
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:17,920
point so the key here is to allow
message header this means that an

170
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:25,780
insider from the center to the right
point and carry another point to the

171
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:31,300
station so the figure below shows how it
works so you order for this nation to

172
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:40,320
set up a hidden service first point and
criticized his run this results two

173
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,080
things

174
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,549
forward and writer and a background
color within 10 points and that's nation

175
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:53,970
now that's nation com publish this
information to a website for example and

176
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:59,110
source which one to use this hidden
service kind of true that information

177
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:06,230
know which one and then set up another
session between the source and the

178
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:11,929
runaway points ok so now the source
cowardice and traffic between source and

179
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:19,570
run points so and what we do we allowed
their packets and from the source 210

180
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:28,139
points also contains traders from the
running want to their destination now

181
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:33,500
the source and destination can
communicate because when they're running

182
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:40,940
points got the package can retrieve a
pattern for the second half so that's

183
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:47,029
why that's how the package will traverse
rule ok similarly the destination can

184
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:58,409
use the same trick to send a package
back to source so as a general

185
00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:06,130
description about how that works with
voting technique and now less see some

186
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:14,429
security analysis of the protocol so
according to termination or on Iran

187
00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:20,289
particle idea on your employer if you
see from work if and only if it

188
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:26,960
satisfies both properties days are
defining the original paper as more

189
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:35,299
formal to just briefly describe these
properties they are correctness meaning

190
00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:40,399
the protocol ice-cold correctly
according to specification integrity

191
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:44,750
meaning that was freakin out for or
modify our packet

192
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:52,950
rap resistance meaning all three can out
and wrapped package and grab a nose

193
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:59,400
operation and funny security meaning all
those three cannot match up for practice

194
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:07,480
of a note from 23 improper conduct and
not just by being partners so I dream

195
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:16,310
about time we prove that so you can look
into our tax technical report and

196
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:25,550
finally I want to point out that door is
not protecting against traffic analysis

197
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:33,100
attacks or confirmation tax so is still
vulnerable to this traffic analysis and

198
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:47,350
confirmation text so we implemented
voters support of data plan and support

199
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:52,310
our testbed contains a softer Rodgers
connected with the package manager

200
00:23:52,310 --> 00:24:00,790
through 12 to keep is being so much
money so we can test 123 seconds report

201
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:10,260
and under salt water reuse have CPU
based on course for socket and it has

202
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:16,240
also 64 gigabytes of memory so what I
want to test is whether this task that

203
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:26,880
support like panel's report high now for
to his bank robbers ok so first I don't

204
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:35,480
show the results of the transmission
throughput per second

205
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:43,570
with top horse and two Corp report this
is comparable to acknowledge voters who

206
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:52,470
put and and one of the reasons why this
first affording is that today

207
00:24:52,470 --> 00:25:00,330
community PU technique like yes I really
allows high speed data encryption or

208
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:06,820
decryption of Hackett another reason is
that the Tribune estate from package

209
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:17,639
itself removed the government to compete
for the share state this increase so we

210
00:25:17,639 --> 00:25:22,639
also tested good fortune of Hornet which
is the natural food it's ruining the

211
00:25:22,639 --> 00:25:29,649
headers the overnight has a larger
headers because it also contains all the

212
00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:39,389
state is still she's 74 to 85% of course
boot with compare of ipv4 with 124 base

213
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:48,758
so this weather is 742 85% depends on
like how long how many hopes to the

214
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:52,240
source and destination so for different
configurations

215
00:25:52,830 --> 00:26:02,259
management so although post results and
those results are only like trauma or

216
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:08,919
preliminary implementations so they have
demonstrated that is viable for

217
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:19,440
high-speed waters next and setup package
so the figure in the left shows the

218
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,460
latency of resizing identification with
different colors sizes are we have

219
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:32,440
tested and compared to his other works
so figure access access is the payload

220
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,860
size and why this is the latency lower
is better we can see that processing

221
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,860
hornet there are so wrong

222
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:46,790
20,000 22,000 cycles with different
pillow size

223
00:26:46,790 --> 00:27:01,850
so that's roughly 175 microseconds and
given today's publication and set up

224
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:09,840
practice remember process and set up a
kiss require common kitchen so it's

225
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,870
slower table on the right shows the
latency of processing center packets and

226
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:24,139
is roughly wrong to two hundred and 50
microseconds per package even though

227
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:33,290
this number is much larger a 10% there
is only one that once for each session

228
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:49,250
so distance itself is also works with
today's applications so to sum up this

229
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:56,720
top so I have presented hornet
high-speed on iraqi protocol and so

230
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:03,590
there are totally messages in the form
of question answers first can only one

231
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:10,399
problem I support and a natural leader
yes in this work we have demonstrated

232
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:15,910
that it is viable for on Iran protocol
to achieve high school food which is

233
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:23,680
comparable to a backbone routers second
requirement for keeping personal estate

234
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:31,820
waters in order to achieve scalability
need to buy order yes we have designed a

235
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:38,179
product that requires no procession
state water and then we have proof that

236
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:58,960
this protocol is secure under the
current framework so talk thanks great

237
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,480
thank you very much
