1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,159
alright thanks for the introduction

2
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:09,219
a satire will today talk a little bit
about measuring network so basically

3
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:15,280
what you can measure what you can see
inside the network so my caucus divided

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,210
into two parts so every first give you a
short introduction and and go a little

5
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:30,260
bit into detail and to them measuring
steps so who am I so quite common to

6
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,380
introduce ourselves on my name is
inscribed steel base in germany to

7
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,719
tighten security they are basically
penetration testing and other kinds of

8
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:46,070
security besides that I'm data
protection officer so germany as you

9
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:53,070
might know quite restricted a production
loss and diet companies to do travel

10
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,790
good data protection inside a complacent
I also two electrodes at a local

11
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:04,679
university and deterrence think so and
if you like to contact me i'm i'm for

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,380
Twitter handle call cuba I also like new
social tool which is the same and you

13
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:18,780
cannot separate meals and yeah the first
question to your review has heard about

14
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,619
before heads up

15
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:29,170
ok so maybe the better question is who
has never heard of tour ok just was what

16
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:35,979
I was expecting basically so it was
quite well known inside the community is

17
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:40,500
so you might know the tourists that the
software and the protocol for protecting

18
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:48,340
the privacy and anonymity of its users
it's also towards a network of relays of

19
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:55,250
preachers territorial authorities etc
and it's also think we are come into

20
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,660
play so you might have heard of the
organization called also posted net and

21
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:07,280
I always in this organization I also
runs some relay some bridges etc so I'm

22
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,209
when when it comes to time basically you
somewhere in the middle east and west of

23
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:21,989
there are lots of other organizations
which which the organization and right

24
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:29,569
now there are like 40 sup bro checks of
all kinds so too has grown quite large

25
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:36,829
in the last few years so I just go
through to our hotel works slides I hope

26
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:43,349
you have seen it before but I will need
some details later on that's why I

27
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:49,849
decided to show you those lights again
so you see here on the left hand side

28
00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:56,060
Ellis who wants to be connected to our
network so and as a first step a list or

29
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,220
client goes to a directory authority
called Dave

30
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,880
left and download a list of all those of
us select

31
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:13,350
32 and connect studios also make it
makes connections the first one and

32
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:18,500
after that it goes like a telescoping
and extensive connection as a contender

33
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:27,500
dessert and the tickets GOP-controlled
multiple links and after some minutes

34
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:34,489
connections Rangers and Dallas will
choose another and so that's the basic

35
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:42,810
functionality I hope everyone has a lot
of it so if not just so and when when we

36
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,120
talk about or that the most useful
facing thing I would say is that I

37
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,700
brought upon you as you can see here you
can download it at all

38
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:56,750
website includes patched and rebranded
version of Mozilla Firefox the torpor

39
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,000
software itself to a party and no script
and then tries to to protect you so

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,230
basically when it goes to the net part
there are some of the project some of

41
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:12,190
the forties are called former San
Francisco message or instant messaging

42
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:20,180
client with which was published recently
also there is another instant messaging

43
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:27,960
plan country country ricochet so to
torment XMPP protocol and and other

44
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,289
protocols for instance you can use it
was several protocols while ricocheted

45
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:37,870
uses this so-called hidden services for
instant messaging so it has another

46
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:43,910
approach so when you use some of my
phone does all brought was your folks

47
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:49,180
for Android on your browser for iPhone
you can use it there or if you want to

48
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:57,570
share files you can use on lunch hour
and also opens in service and you get

49
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:03,210
some quite invisible ural send it to the
other party download the software

50
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,599
is closed again so it's also in terror
as I said quite a lot of sub-projects

51
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:18,110
just wanted to mention some of them into
my mind reduction so and besides the

52
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:24,889
part of anonymity to also works in the
area of censorship resistance so

53
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:31,160
tourists quite lots of funding to
develop censorship resistance to soft

54
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,449
ideas that software works in countries
with quite a recent trip so you can go

55
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:41,900
to China to Iran to several other
countries and you still talk software

56
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:47,090
del and their approaches are called
precious approaches disturb the basic

57
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:53,690
idea and on top of the so-called
pluggable transports which obvious cates

58
00:05:53,690 --> 00:06:00,330
the traffic so that the sensor isn't
able to decide that you do some things

59
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:05,190
he doesn't basically so and especially
in China stops for a thing which is here

60
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:11,210
on the right hand side looks quite
reliably also scrambled and other

61
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:16,609
pro-choice book also good countries that
it was my my short introduction into

62
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:22,039
tour as I expected most of you have
already heard about the software and I

63
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:28,150
will go a little bit more into detail
what it means to measure the network so

64
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:36,719
I do quite often talks about alright
peach people about or talk about it and

65
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:42,389
I often hear sometimes so some people
want to know how many you sourced

66
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:50,860
doesn't talk will come from and also one
of the most asked questions are still

67
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:57,560
the middle one year whilst also flew
some some questions which come from the

68
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,560
use of site but since 2013

69
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:07,400
questionable how many really sassy and
Iran how many relays and intelligence

70
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,690
agencies and also there are some some
other kind of question so and this

71
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,719
question needs

72
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:22,300
demanded answers to answer those
questions you need to measure the

73
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:27,890
networking needs to two measurements
here and and that's why everything

74
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:36,490
becomes ideas when it comes to measuring
are quite quite old alike like seven

75
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,360
years older so but the main thing a
smile on inside your phone anonymity

76
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,480
that work and where are you

77
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,340
how will you two measurements without
hurting the anonymity of the user's this

78
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:55,690
feels like a contradiction and I
provided a small example to show you

79
00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:01,300
what I was thinking about what what they
do here to protect you

80
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,800
so the idea here is to answer one of the
questions we are to the user come from

81
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:16,300
so basically you want to know what
countries to use come from and you want

82
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,380
to measure those data without hurting
the anonymity of the single user so

83
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:27,010
first of all you need to get an idea
where you can extract those dates and

84
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:32,838
basically there are two points make an
expected 800 the first one is the entry

85
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:38,880
is no difference not a network so this
one here so and since several years to

86
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:50,620
design has changed a little bit so this
flight here showed you talking action

87
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:58,480
and when I switch to the next slide here
you saw that also hear the entry no

88
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:05,370
changes this is an old or older slight
right now so that the first noted note

89
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,080
here on the left hand side

90
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:14,320
stays the same for quite a while because
this is done to prevent on ethics and so

91
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,730
I switched to the so called the signs
when you connect to

92
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:26,720
2 2012 the first know it stays the same
for several weeks and then it will

93
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:35,540
change and of course the first note the
real IP address of Ellis because well it

94
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,699
needs to connect to the first notices
real IP address so what you can do

95
00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:46,329
basically is just ask the garden with
the entry note to the store in some way

96
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:54,489
the IP address and then analyzed the
state also just the idea is to ask the

97
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,230
direction

98
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:03,300
thority so there's no one here to look
which claimed him differently downloaded

99
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:12,750
the list of of Solace so this directory
authority will also see the decline of

100
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:20,120
the two points where we can go someday
top so I said your clients get their

101
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,440
network view from the authorities you
need to somehow recognize that what

102
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,160
lines but in the current designers also
so that you can set up your tour relate

103
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:37,230
to be a directory millboro so it means
you're really also ministers directory

104
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:48,399
information declined of go back to this
light doesn't go every time today but it

105
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,230
can also go to this note for instance
and ask for directory information and

106
00:10:53,230 --> 00:11:00,089
also to this note can handle it over to
Ellis and give it to them so there are

107
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:04,860
some possibilities to hand over
directory information and all all those

108
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:11,240
notes have the ideas and as I said and
we know it's the country roads or

109
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:17,769
bridges and culverts see by design the
client's IP as well as a piece of other

110
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:21,550
relays and and and we know it can also
be like

111
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:31,579
middle note for us so if you want to ask
you have to decide if it's a known well

112
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:36,989
known to relay or if it's not yet known
really happened in the last then it must

113
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:44,519
be so and also approached bridges like
the entry into a date on it would only

114
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:52,430
seek lines a piece will never see a
psychiatrist so you can collect it at

115
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:58,630
some points so it you know you we have
identified the collection points so and

116
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:04,740
then I'm quite more important question
is how to do it right so how to collect

117
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:12,630
those data without hurting the anonymity
of the user so the most obvious way over

118
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:16,810
there with her tonight in flavor it's a
tool to measure man would be the

119
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:22,459
following just collect IP address at the
directory authority or it's a mental

120
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:26,449
note send it to some Central's over
under center also analyze all the data

121
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:35,040
and puts out a nice cross but I think we
can ask you we can sit here for the next

122
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,490
hour and think about all kinds of
attacks because this approach is so

123
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,949
vulnerable I think every one of you will
find something that takes and we can

124
00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:51,889
basically the anonymous that's not right
right way to do it so we need to think

125
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:55,759
about so basically what you see on the
right hand side

126
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:01,470
this is the craft of directly connecting
use force since 2011 so over the last

127
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:09,019
four years and you see here first ever
something below 1 million users per day

128
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:22,110
and then we saw a huge trouble which
happened some bland and certain numbers

129
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:27,899
down and it was like in the middle of
2013 and menacing about snowden

130
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:33,649
revelation david also the middle of 2013
and you might come to the conclusion

131
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:38,809
that this was because of the snow snow
revelation but that's not rude it was

132
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:46,120
not because of snow tonight but because
some Ukrainian guy set up for tonight

133
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:53,110
and we wanted to use it all went on our
communication so basically what you see

134
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,790
is what you see here

135
00:13:54,790 --> 00:14:04,360
numbers from like below 1 million to
more than five million of net and so

136
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:12,709
after some time here is what it was was
clear they deactivated the client and to

137
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:19,300
like here at this point there are more
less more real user numbers I can buy

138
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:23,800
microsoft tell us that they are there
are also some some

139
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,990
some clients clients out there so it's
not really after the real number of what

140
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:39,290
the amount of us are inside so another
approach another idea would be to just

141
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:45,399
to collect the IP and instantly that you
locate the IP address because the only

142
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:50,450
thing you want to know hearings examples
where to stay the whole user come from

143
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,890
so you don't need the actual IP address
but you don't you will only need a

144
00:14:54,890 --> 00:15:00,949
location only need to the country where
the SYP comes from and so you can

145
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:06,360
basically do this just look at the APR
medical education and like since 2008 or

146
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:14,310
2009 tour comes to you I P did appear so
it can do it on the side of the in this

147
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:25,920
case of mind so this would be fine so
you can immediately but you have to ask

148
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,390
yourself what happens when there are
duplicate IP addresses so how do I find

149
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:37,410
out to placate IP addresses so there is
a necessity to store somewhere the IP

150
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:43,449
addresses to remove applications you can
do it around and after some time just

151
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,680
write this location data on today

152
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:53,020
hot right that's basic idea so but then
the next question arises what happens

153
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:59,680
when there are countries misuses so you
see here across their entire directly

154
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,540
connecting users from Vatican City so
the Pope and his staff also obviously

155
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:10,390
also used or so and there are like five
to 10

156
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:21,579
2020 lion testify flying the 10 line 259
so you saw between like nearly 5 22 10

157
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:24,579
use or still use or saw from from the
vatican city

158
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:33,750
and yeah when you have countries with
few users and push this information

159
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:39,460
quite often select 100 for instance one
spill small amount of hours it would be

160
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:49,280
quite easy and Michael Katsidis states
all goes back to see maybe tour at this

161
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:55,900
point and also you need to have some
some controversial so on counter measure

162
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:05,329
in this case is to collect all the days
are over 100 125 for us and collected

163
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:12,369
then and also there is right up your
skate the number of users because they

164
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:22,199
love it so that you don't see that you
had only one single user given point in

165
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:29,320
time so then the minimum amount you
usually see so that goal is to

166
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:37,929
appreciate it a little bit and face of
the article so in the end you can do

167
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:42,620
that for instance this nice seeing here
on so some guys from the University of

168
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:51,879
Oxford that this nice graphic here so
they showed the amount of daily to use

169
00:17:51,880 --> 00:18:02,470
us and you see here to USA Canada France
Spain Italy Germany this one is Austria

170
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:10,600
Switzerland Czech Republic yes I R on
which is also quite huge part Russia

171
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:20,270
Ukraine etc etc so you see here are some
nice graphic who is using this is one of

172
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,279
the results of this

173
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:25,729
ideas so I

174
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:31,509
overtime at work out some of the
principles while collecting statistics

175
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:37,599
there are some legal requirement so in
in several states we have lost data

176
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,879
protection laws and we have to make sure
that we don't fall under any kind of

177
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:47,718
wiretapping law because that would be
quite bad and also we have to make sure

178
00:18:47,719 --> 00:18:49,110
that

179
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:55,860
don't fall under protection saying so so
we have to take care about several legal

180
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,360
requirements of course the privacy of
the users is quite important for us we

181
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,629
have to take out that we don't
accidentally unanimous and any use of

182
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:12,370
and also when it comes to university
research it's quite often the case that

183
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:20,178
you need the approval of the
institutional review board so they are

184
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:26,150
you doing some research and I want to do
it in a responsible way you go to the

185
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:32,290
IRB guys and they look what you're doing
and approve it or don't approve it in

186
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:37,280
psychology and medicine it's quite
commented with in computer science it's

187
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,668
not really that comment but at least an
email from the USS side I think it's

188
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:48,049
getting more and more common and in the
end so you can have like a research

189
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:51,110
which is every year

190
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:58,830
legal requirement richest approved but
you also have to think about what he

191
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:05,500
thinks about this and maybe the use of
hands not so good that you collecting

192
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,960
every kind of the so what we try to do
is to a public high publicize what they

193
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,260
are doing so that everyone who wants to
know it also can do it and have a like

194
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,000
content and is not surprised at all

195
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,890
also collected measures some something
so that's that's some some principles

196
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:31,140
one comes to to collecting think so and
as I said there are different rules when

197
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:36,799
it comes to tour so every kind of rule
ask different questions so there are

198
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:41,168
some bitch just don't know tutorials are
using it and they want to know also

199
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:45,700
sings that for instance operate off the
directory authority or relay operator

200
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,440
and the

201
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:58,920
measurement which is inside or developed
several tools to give answers and one of

202
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:11,380
the important portal is that all metrics
portal so when you go to metric starts

203
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,270
to protect dot org

204
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:21,740
you get here to this society here you
find all kinds of possibilities to look

205
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:29,320
for a stroll later so you can find here
at the number of relays and purchase

206
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:38,909
inside the network or European number of
directly connecting users so this is the

207
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:43,360
first one this is the number of relays
the purchase of the inside the network

208
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,909
is quite easy to find out just need to
pass this directory authoritative and

209
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:54,610
you see that era like more than 6,000
relays currently inside the network and

210
00:21:54,610 --> 00:22:04,899
some 3,000 reaches inside that it's
quite easy to the other thing is the

211
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:10,530
number of directly connecting users as I
said the same thing where my example

212
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:15,960
started so currently estimation is that
there are more than two million users

213
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,950
worldwide today and if you say well I
want to know about Austrian your source

214
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:28,370
I can also ask for Austrian useless and
see what you get from austria are 50,000

215
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:34,800
at the moment and that a taco spec 2
2011 so you can also change year-to-date

216
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,960
2011 and see how it is

217
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:45,960
number of users developed over several
years so there is also data from before

218
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:53,029
from before 2011 but the iris before had
some mistake in it and it did wrong way

219
00:22:53,029 --> 00:23:00,370
that's why are you only find it on
starting from 2011 center metrics you

220
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:05,908
find all kinds of nine states are here
just if you have time to browse around I

221
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:12,679
don't want sure everything support let's
say I meant to hurt first growth and one

222
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:16,309
of the important questions the misuse
this kind of you lost and I really

223
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:20,918
connected to talk so that's that's
that's one of the first questions at him

224
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:27,490
and there's also a website your call to
check da tutto project a torque this

225
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:33,320
plus the page which was shown by the top
also some some time ago right now you

226
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,029
see another kind of pitch so when you
open the door prizes for the first time

227
00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:48,169
you see this page it's my job and so
it's a small clique one so welcome this

228
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:55,630
process does your story and when you
click here on tour check the network

229
00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:02,570
settings then it's caused this check I
dot dot org page and shows you that you

230
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:09,080
are connected with tour and if you're
not connected you see basically here the

231
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:15,639
screen below and behind that there is a
software called 30 and a cialis

232
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:22,690
library with me Maskell and this library
basically looks at the directory date

233
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:28,490
and then looks at the IP which is
connected to the check site and say

234
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:32,480
you're connected you're not connected
and it also tries to find out if you're

235
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:41,500
always restore and then onto a process
and also shows here wanting to enter

236
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:51,620
into future should be a library doorbell
rewrite of tortilla shell which just

237
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,750
basically the same sort of this story in
excellent or Bell running in the

238
00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:02,020
background and the thing which you see
aesthetic to protect our site and as I

239
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:08,790
said what the user quite often asks why
is it a try to your store and then

240
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:16,960
decide whether or not to go too fast to
use and at some points the developer

241
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:24,480
said well we need to find out how we can
make to hostile and will also you need a

242
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,670
tall and what they are doing since
several years right now they just write

243
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:37,510
down what the 58 file and also play for
you by pile and Marshall the time how

244
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:41,490
long it takes to download this file so
you see here across starting also in

245
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:50,820
2011 going to November 2015 and you see
that the time which it took to download

246
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,799
it so the system time in

247
00:25:53,799 --> 00:26:02,009
seconds mothers between 2nd so here in
2011 it took like 50 to 150 seconds to

248
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:07,759
download the file and then all the time
but now we are down to 10 to 20 seconds

249
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:14,799
45 me by trial and here at this is a 50
rebate requests which falls somewhere

250
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:20,320
between three and five seconds and it's
also don't want it so this this

251
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,759
measurement helped develop our store to
find products inside networks improved

252
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:28,710
algorithms and to make it worse and you
can see all the time it really improved

253
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:35,399
so it is getting fast all but of course
it's still may be a bit slower than

254
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:43,809
normal processing so this is not really
but in the end it helps to get a faster

255
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:51,580
connection and I thought they really
operate on so I would say an integral

256
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:56,580
part of it or not work because they run
all the real estate around bridges etc

257
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:03,049
and of course such really operate the
has all kinds of questions so the first

258
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:10,899
questions then when someone decides to
be a network of relay operator is where

259
00:27:10,899 --> 00:27:16,488
should I put my really so whilst most
obvious question is maybe in the country

260
00:27:16,489 --> 00:27:22,450
so if I am an Austrian citizen there
might be a good idea to open relay in

261
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:28,239
Australia or Germany on any other
countries but what you see here is the

262
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:33,499
so-called public rafts and this is the
distribution of a country that can also

263
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:43,289
try to show you it's your life so it
needs some time so it at the time

264
00:27:43,289 --> 00:27:47,239
metrics page you find this network
public crafts so if for instance you can

265
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:54,119
say I want to the exits and should be
grouped by country so it click here on

266
00:27:54,119 --> 00:28:04,090
this link and wait for some time and
those public roads pop up so that's the

267
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:09,428
thing which I also had an isolated here
on this site you can now go to these

268
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:16,350
bubbles and see whether this year this
is switzerland united states this large

269
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:21,939
one hears France for instance Germany
Romania at all so frances

270
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:29,149
case because you provide on France
called OVH and several people have two

271
00:28:29,149 --> 00:28:37,449
relays running late and that's why the
public from france is another legs quite

272
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:45,570
a large had also try to find the same
thing for Austria but there is no public

273
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:52,490
foster because Austria only has a
handful of relays so you put 10 so then

274
00:28:52,490 --> 00:29:00,909
this this public rafts same here are
also can help to say okay maybe not so

275
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:06,909
good idea to have my really in France
but maybe somewhere which may be having

276
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:14,060
offer right now and so you can set up a
solitaire and was also quite nicest else

277
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:20,909
might not make cannot read it that's a
site called kompas.com project polka dot

278
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:26,850
org and here you can have like a list
like seeing off the distribution of

279
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:31,990
tolerance in the country oil can also
selected what we r is for instance

280
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:37,410
albeit some muscle things and so this
should be hopeful for really operated to

281
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:44,760
decide in which country into put because
the goal is to happen like a diverse so

282
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:53,110
you may be sought in the beginning hero
through science but also use some of

283
00:29:53,110 --> 00:30:00,010
that they'd all from from the tour
project and this is not redeemed at all

284
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:06,540
but those data is from end of October
this year and you see here there are

285
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:11,550
lots lots of traffic here inside Europe
so you see the large France publicized

286
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:18,250
comment bubble see some tropical back in
France to United States but lots of

287
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:24,180
traffic is here and it's might be a good
idea to have some notes and other

288
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:31,470
countries to distributed network but
after some time if you set up your relay

289
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:40,600
and it works and you might want to check
if this is really useful right now if it

290
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:47,649
helps the user and this is what you can
see here so there are two sides called

291
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:52,080
Atlas and club can reach it at last
ought to protect the talk and close to

292
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,899
talk more and enter the name of your
relay or some identification of your

293
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:01,190
relay and it shows you some some
information so I just chose one Austrian

294
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:10,210
relay Europe and across 13 months you
can see Europe this really was started

295
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:18,440
at the end of October and then it just
collect some traffic beginning it was

296
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,240
quite low and then getting higher and
higher right now this really is at

297
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:30,310
around 4 megabits per second on on
traffic and what you can see the second

298
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:37,520
graph is the so-called exit probability
so when I really started to set up as

299
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:44,620
but thought it was off to consider it as
an exit doesn't use it as an exit but

300
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:50,340
only use it here relate so you see here
the yellow line as the middle relay

301
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:56,199
probability and red light a cigar
probability is a probability that will

302
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,260
get across to the first notice
intellectual and after some time so

303
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:06,360
after nearly a month just know it ain't
so much trust problem from the top

304
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:15,510
protocol and say that it was an exercise
changed an extremely so and gave it

305
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:23,560
except mobility and now it can be used
and so the lifetime of such a relay

306
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:31,178
system was described in a blog post so
if you want to know more about lifetime

307
00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:35,300
of such a relay just go to block the
talk rhetoric and you find a description

308
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:41,370
what to do with such a relay over
sometime so it needs to build some trust

309
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:49,770
at the beginning and so on and so and
now they operate on her running exit

310
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:56,120
relay and it can be used for any kind of
traffic of course and to offer was for

311
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:01,770
exit really operate us that they can get
a nice future not this one this is quite

312
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:06,350
old but you can get a partition walls
until after some time

313
00:33:06,909 --> 00:33:15,099
this does not a measurement program
called west which looks for all existing

314
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:19,609
relays and at some point when you're
eligible to get a t-shirt to get the

315
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:24,918
mail from the special software or else
you will you now can get free t-shirt

316
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:31,210
from top project thank you for running
the relay please write mail to the

317
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:40,570
address and then you get it is also this
is also part of the measurement seems

318
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:44,399
the store was a program and currently
there's another software in development

319
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,859
cult horror story which probably will
take over this functionality because

320
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:53,210
tourists from my point of view quite
simple software but nobody really it

321
00:33:53,210 --> 00:34:02,570
maintains it anymore and so to drop it
but currently it also runs and also if

322
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:08,038
you're running a relay and especially
inexplicably at some point some law

323
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:12,700
enforcement agency you might come to
your house all to your office or send

324
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:17,029
you a nice letter or whatever and say
well I saw you to Tibet's

325
00:34:17,029 --> 00:34:24,649
240 you did some some strange things and
you said no I didn't but I run it orally

326
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:31,710
maybe some other random dated at prove
it and what you can do here but also

327
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:38,359
tour helps is you can go to another
website is also part of the scenes

328
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:45,759
accelerate all this website tells you if
a given IP at the given time

329
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:54,990
really so just as it was a tour buses I
but your STD accelerate our side you

330
00:34:54,989 --> 00:35:02,779
just enter some IP address haven't
prepared anything and date

331
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:15,760
and say please look if this was really
ok so here in this case it sells well

332
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:25,740
there haven't found anything I just wish
it somewhere thx alright maybe a fight

333
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:39,809
so I can just copy this address here
inside and see if this was extremely

334
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:49,369
satisfied but it was also not really so
go back to 2015 and say something

335
00:35:49,369 --> 00:35:59,119
earlier studies 13th of November just
wait a moment just looks for an entry

336
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:07,420
and right now this IP address as we have
also really and now we should get

337
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:15,369
another answer he also now you see y
Toro has found something and here at

338
00:36:15,369 --> 00:36:22,049
this page you can see well the 12th of
November we thought it was a really the

339
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:28,459
name or sticky guest or two and so on
and so on so it gives you some

340
00:36:28,459 --> 00:36:35,640
information and so basically the police
can go to the site and and questioned if

341
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,859
if this IP address was horribly at a
given time and as far as I know for

342
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:46,400
instance the FBI does use it quite a lot
to find out if I P was totally on

343
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:53,900
another role inside a network of the
directory authorities so the guys who

344
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,610
are on the

345
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:03,390
listings of altura ladies and they need
to take care of the network itself so we

346
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:08,879
need to find out if there are some bad
guys so what they are doing they try to

347
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,430
find out of the cycle attacks

348
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:16,160
there are some really swing some
injection of JavaScript or to some other

349
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:22,569
kind of stuff and they are also software
written called cypress and this

350
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:27,490
constantly runs in the background test
several religious and if it finds some

351
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:33,279
real average czechs some strange things
it sent a message to the rectory

352
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:40,120
authorities and then they might decide
to block this really is also there are

353
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:46,790
some misconfigured and also some kind of
malicious relays and software called

354
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:54,200
exit map which runs on in the background
of tests and so try to find out if there

355
00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:01,419
are some malicious relays and then so
you can run although its software on

356
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:06,450
your only this link them on my flights
here you can find them also get a

357
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:13,080
proposal and try to find out if you can
find some malicious rely on your own and

358
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:19,580
if you I wouldn't bet acting really at
some point but I what recommended that

359
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:26,080
you contact the project so there is a
real mailing list call Beth relays sent

360
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:32,790
a mail Dell said well I haven't but
really it's something like that and it

361
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,790
does listen that bad thing

362
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:43,880
operators will try to find out if it
does really bad things and if this thing

363
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:50,610
so they plot this really and nobody will
use it in their connection so it does

364
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:58,070
also be page which explains a little bit
more how that feels really so there are

365
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:03,220
four tries to find out Metrolist and
keep the network healthy and clean

366
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,100
basically

367
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:17,490
metrics is quite lots of data available
so here is the toy collectible site and

368
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:25,709
if you are interested in discovering
some things on statistics on things you

369
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:30,910
can go to this debt collector side and
you find all kinds of the which was

370
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:36,839
collected over time from the 2005 all
related descriptors you find others like

371
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:42,780
kind of things back to several years and
court can do several things and also if

372
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:49,020
you're a partisan person has like a
recall to them and you can use to stem

373
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:54,930
library to work with the strip those
hearings and do all kinds of stuff which

374
00:39:54,930 --> 00:40:01,379
you like so does collect the side quite
quite quite usable and so did the

375
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,060
metrics to Mitch's inside the project
that's quite a lot of development

376
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:10,310
restored measure of several things and
and well to provide you with some some

377
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:16,100
more insides of network so basically if
you want to know anything just go to the

378
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:22,509
store metric sites to this one here you
find answers and well if you don't find

379
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:30,450
the right email to talk project and
asking we will try to give you so i hope

380
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:34,240
i give you insight into the measurement

381
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:50,380
tasks and if you have any questions
please ask people questions regarding

382
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,380
the pretty graphs

383
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:27,010
well i i dont no solution but what you
can do basically is go to the collector

384
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:33,940
site and download the script doesn't
have a controversial also downloads and

385
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,910
you can

386
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:39,629
description and then write your own
program which works on this date are

387
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,180
basically

388
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:48,069
then you have to build your own I don't
know if I misunderstand you probably

389
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:57,259
vote for example recognize my final worn
on the block is AP but I would like to

390
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:05,950
look with it all really before I block
it totally are automatically the

391
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:17,779
background somewhere that there are also
some people out there which do this then

392
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,789
eat out coated UK

393
00:42:19,789 --> 00:42:24,829
just the same hehe officer or some kind
of slippery but you can in certain

394
00:42:24,829 --> 00:42:30,450
applications basically or if you are on
or if you use CloudFlare for instance

395
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:35,480
they also try to find out of the torch
relay and the US military things and

396
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:40,130
rocks you or did it actually don't
really preoccupied Thursday show you and

397
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:46,520
capture and you have to solve to capture
and then go to the page so they are

398
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:55,200
prepared to look it up so I think it was
10 and coda to keep the tool that

399
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,439
compares eyepiece against the current
consensus files need somebody already

400
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,839
wrote that the army would be there was a
question

401
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:20,839
in real time you've probably read about
it is the headquarters of the end they

402
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:27,910
say its cold Ronan and it its target is
to produce every hour in the National

403
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:34,140
Security Operations Centre it all next
move map and to get such metrics as they

404
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:34,859
can

405
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:40,848
their famous I think the famous for
everyone here talks things paper that

406
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:47,040
they did with our friends from GCHQ in
Yorkshire shows how desperate they were

407
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,330
to find ways to deal on my eyes but that
paper was three years ago they're still

408
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:58,869
working on it that concerns very clear
what I'm wondering is in the cyber

409
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:07,140
defense context if you are if you are
setting any goal to protect anonymity of

410
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:13,410
the user base as if that is a core goal
and i dont no question and the second

411
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:18,950
thing is if you have awareness is you
will that the dark side of the light

412
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:23,419
side however you see it out there
running the same metrics to try and

413
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:30,300
attack the anonymity base are you trying
to shadow what they're doing to spot

414
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:34,400
weaknesses and flows and if so how do
you approach using the tools you told us

415
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,830
about so it won't question hopefully
it's comprehensible ok so it was more

416
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:42,490
common than a question

417
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:49,080
it's a question about are you do you
have a policy goal to protect anonymity

418
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:54,470
and are you taking on in the fact aside
the defense will actively using your

419
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:59,689
metrics to see what their metrics are
seeing in order to modify routing or

420
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:06,080
other instructions within the network to
serious questions ok so the first thing

421
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:20,080
that their policy questions I know here
at some point I have to my slides here

422
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:28,480
it is so this is the basic idea I
thought tries to look after legal

423
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:36,080
requirements that they don't fall under
the protection they must also look when

424
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:46,500
they collecting data that they don't
accidentally some some way and so they

425
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,530
try to do it

426
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:52,720
look at from from this perspective and
all the data which are collected which

427
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:58,868
showed you the office lights so it is a
collection of standard directory

428
00:45:58,869 --> 00:46:05,510
authority and incidentally is allocated
for instance so so if there are some who

429
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:11,510
has attracted directory authorities
social but when they are able to attack

430
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:17,680
this kind of so they have such a huge
amount of data that was metrics data is

431
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,990
basically not interesting anymore for
them so so

432
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:26,770
that's why the territorial authorities
are run by persons who have high

433
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:36,700
proficiency in nineteen security systems
and try to predict that we don't really

434
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:41,140
know what it's doing at the moment they
are singing so so there are some guys

435
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:47,290
inside the door who try to find out what
Tennessee thinking about and then try to

436
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:53,970
build defenses against it but we don't
actually have an idea what he's doing so

437
00:46:53,970 --> 00:47:04,100
maybe that the only way I can separate
but some people are trying to sing about

438
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:09,180
possible attacks possible witnesses in
declined and then try to find some

439
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:10,500
ethics against it

440
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:20,390
thank you for the producer of something
insights on the Symmetrix thanks for

441
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:20,629
listening
