1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
okay thanks for the introduction so my
name is to end this is a joy to work

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,110
with my colleagues are then it's groups
are questioned my car antioxidant and

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,700
actually is a paper which was published
in the summer workshop of offensive

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:22,680
technologies so I am security researcher
actually at the University of Bochum and

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,990
cherish for network and data security
which hosted by a precise thing and we

6
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,860
are doing research on what services
single sign-on systems applied

7
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,739
cryptography which is something else
orkut occurrences we are doing probable

8
00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:41,449
security and attacks and defenses and
they are part of the heart of the city

9
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:46,190
of authority security and therefore the
topics like anybody security crypto

10
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,349
another and so on and they are also
doing penetration tests and security

11
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:56,030
policy and so on and workshops ok so
today I'm going to present your hours

12
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,620
and work on how to break its encryption
so first I'm going to present you what

13
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,970
is the web services and XML security
because I'm going to explain how to

14
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,798
apply the attacks on its market share in
the area of services then I'm going to

15
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,030
present you some basic background on
prepping and attacks on XML encryption

16
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:22,659
these attacks are a bit older but they
are looking for understanding the basic

17
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:27,880
problems automatically adapting its
encryption attacks then I will give you

18
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,548
an example of a concrete attack on this
matter again Christians and then I will

19
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:38,909
discuss controversial problems maybe it
gets a bit boring so but don't go away

20
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,810
because at the end I will show you had a
lot of our doubles attacker tool which

21
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:50,360
allows you to the correct examples
psychotics ok so let's start with Web

22
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:56,649
services so what is a web service in
this case we are so busy web services or

23
00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:04,060
so but service is standard which allows
you to execute remote procedure calls so

24
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,370
exactly

25
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:11,320
imagine we have a server which generate
some prime numbers and we have a small

26
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,230
client wants to grab some numbers to he
wants to execute the function get brand

27
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,619
under Sarah so what he does he sends a
function called to the to the server and

28
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,040
dysfunction Co has to be wrapped in some
message that just so he drops it into

29
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,400
the overall body get prime and sends it
to the server the server generate some

30
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:39,620
prime and declined again trapped into
the envelope body and crime is the basic

31
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:46,430
idea behind remote procedure calls and
be hard web services so this was a very

32
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:51,760
very simple scenario but we have many
complicated scenarios like where you

33
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,269
have some brokers so for example imagine
we have a client wants to communicate

34
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:01,350
over his broker and he wants to have
some insurance reservation or flight

35
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:06,560
reservation and he wants to pay two hits
on his parents and his parents and he

36
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,420
does everything or is broken so this is
a complicated scenario this can be also

37
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,970
achieved using so business services
automatically so what is the problem so

38
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:20,080
what happens if we now want to use
security many of the human resources

39
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,050
would tell me ok we can use SSL TLS to
secure these connections what is the

40
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:33,459
problem of a cell pls so if we apply
assault Els on this scenario then only

41
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:36,870
the connections between the client and
broker and between broker bank is

42
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,950
secured so does it need so if this
client generated message and sent it or

43
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:47,890
the Broker to the bank or insurance
company than the message is secured only

44
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:53,059
during the transport this means the
broker can see the data may be there are

45
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,390
some confidential credit card numbers or
something like this and we don't want to

46
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:03,290
reveal the stator so what do we need we
need some things what's called message

47
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:09,000
low-security so we need to apply some
kind of log message directly send it or

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,420
the buyer so that the brokerage

49
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:17,839
scripted counter modified and at the end
on a bank or insurance company interpret

50
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:23,609
the stator ok this is this can be
achieved using XML security so external

51
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:32,660
security describes methods for applying
cryptographic algorithms to XML and it

52
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:39,180
basically consists of two standards and
XML encryption

53
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,590
signature protects out intensity and
integrity of the data encryption

54
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:50,000
protects the confidentiality so it is
very flexible it allows us to secure

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,350
document or specific elements or element
contents or more elements at once a week

56
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:06,410
in Dec or silenced by the elements and
so many of researchers I'm talking to

57
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:11,500
are asking varsity use so it is not that
used in the browsers or in these

58
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:17,620
technologies which are visible to us but
it is used in the back end of large

59
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:22,000
industry companies for for something in
the banking standards or single sign-on

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,860
systems and so on and so on so it is
quite frequently used ok so what is the

61
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:36,910
problem of external security show
signature on the first problem is what

62
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:41,410
can we do it so first what is extremist
signatures Alexander signature allows us

63
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:46,610
to secure the message that out
interstate integrity of the message so

64
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:52,479
how can we do this so imagine we have
designed the structure with a header and

65
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:59,080
we have to give this function invocation
call monitor instances what we do is we

66
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,200
first create maybe sometimes time to
ensure the message is always fresh and

67
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,380
then we create a signature and the
reference

68
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,200
first the body element and at times
turned around and using this URI Ore Ida

69
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:18,700
best reference and then we compute at
Aegis four You or this coming months and

70
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,670
compute a signature

71
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:26,490
the small signing for so this way we
achieve that using this URI referencing

72
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:34,150
these two elements are security yeah
what can go wrong so there's a problem

73
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:41,460
it is very simple to describe so imagine
we have we have an article if so poor

74
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:50,030
get in position of this message and what
he can do so we have decided body

75
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:55,359
element and 40 does he creates a vapor
element somewhere in the header he moves

76
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:03,240
Georgia now body element the original
structure to this paper element and this

77
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,500
ensures that the URI now references or
signature references references this

78
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:17,430
labor and there is no place for the next
body element so he can now modify the

79
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:23,860
body element and include arbitrary
function of raping and was actually

80
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,610
already described in 2005 by two
independent groups by Michael Gerson

81
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,790
all-star and part of our so it's very
simple looks to be very simple so what

82
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:42,100
is the problem so why dusty attic work
asked so this is very simple so the most

83
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:47,150
of the cases the web service
verification and business logic working

84
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,450
to step so there is the first
verification logic which contains

85
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,770
signature validation and cryptographic
functionality this is very very

86
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:01,169
complicated so muslim developer supply
some cryptographic library in the second

87
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:04,990
step there's the application logic which
Justin Walker functionality this is done

88
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:10,380
by developer on his own so what it does
on the end of the verification logic

89
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:16,650
goes to the envelope our security
signature or from signing for final URI

90
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:22,750
body and validated ok everything's
correct everything started the

91
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:25,900
application logic now goes to the
envelope body and

92
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:32,960
execute the function in the body element
is the problem you could mean destroy

93
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,780
this problem is very simple to overcome
and to deploy some controversial but

94
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:44,120
there are many attacks in recent years
sort of a published so recent one is

95
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,770
maybe ok so there's there was a problem
in its most natural thing in a Muslim

96
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:56,780
interfaces so there we showed in 2011
wallpaper or clouds are belong to us

97
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:02,449
that the attacker can involve arbitrary
functionality on the Amazon Cloud so

98
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:09,050
there was a possibility like the client
involved so invocation calls using

99
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:15,069
science old messages and for some perot
start new instances on the cloud and so

100
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,240
on and so on and it was possible to
executive director of raping so what's

101
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,420
the attacker could do he could eavesdrop
the message modified send it to the

102
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,510
crowd control of maybe start new
instances get new create new instances

103
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:35,319
get public private case from the server
and so on and so on so he could get the

104
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:42,330
wall cloud of the customer ok so this
was in 2011 last year my colleagues

105
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:47,000
published a nice study on some of these
attacks so there's a single sign-on

106
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,840
protocol which allows you to lock in on
a specific services and my colleagues

107
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:59,540
analyzed software-as-a-service
applications 22 software applications

108
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:06,180
they analyzed for example attacks maybe
you're familiar with external attacks

109
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:11,579
they are analyzed the trader at ten out
of twenty two providers for libel to

110
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:17,340
these attacks and they also analyzed
attacks and one-half of the exam this

111
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:22,670
software as a service providers to pull
over to the side tax so it was possible

112
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:28,510
to login as an arbitrary users at this
provider's so if you work with some are

113
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,170
encouraged to read this paper

114
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:35,709
ok so let's start with the attacks on
excellent reaction I will just give you

115
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:43,859
a basic its place and the scenario and
then I will go to the concrete

116
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:52,389
description of a specific attack ok so
in most cases we use hybrid encryption

117
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:58,510
him encryption what does it mean so
imagine away from this envelope and body

118
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:03,689
element and we now want to encrypt the
content of the body because there's some

119
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:08,600
consider insulator so what they can do
we create further encrypted key element

120
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:16,810
and the encrypted data and then
encrypted key element we use some public

121
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:22,479
key encryption algorithm to to encrypt
some symmetric key yeah so first we will

122
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:31,060
use our assay maybe to encrypt some
symmetry he and encrypted data use some

123
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:40,989
symmetry key Alberta to encrypted data
for example you are maybe that is OK and

124
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:45,899
then we find these two elements using
something france is how it is done in

125
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:54,420
the problem is in 2012 published attacks
on Christian on the a symmetric parts

126
00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:03,219
using so-called black and it was on this
encrypted key and 10 in 2011 the

127
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:11,540
published attacks on the symmetric power
and how to decrypt the data directly in

128
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:17,300
the music which was created and both of
the attacks are adaptive chosen

129
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,120
ciphertext attacks what does it mean so
what is adaptive chosen ciphertext

130
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,209
attack also image in with a client and a
sorrow and the clients and some

131
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:30,209
confidential data some ciphertext

132
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:34,470
dusty attic work or both of the attacks

133
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:40,880
and we have an attacker who suffered
text or maybe finds herself or text of

134
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,400
confidential data he uses the Web
Services an Oracle sense some modifies

135
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,730
the ciphertext sensitive to the Oracle
and the Oracle server responds with

136
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:55,790
valid or invalid and he repeated several
times with different modified size four

137
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:02,800
tix and at the end of the message it is
the basic scenario behind adaptive

138
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,510
chosen ciphertext attacks and it's
already mentioned be described attacks

139
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:13,360
on the US the automatic part using black
and white hearse attack on the symmetric

140
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:21,210
part and symmetric case we could the
crypt one plain text by using 14 virus

141
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:27,480
to the server using 14 orkut and in the
US Amateur Cup party about 400,000

142
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:37,480
carries a few millions of trades but we
could pick up the ball game yet so in

143
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:44,050
the next few slides I will show you how
to do basic idea behind this attack on

144
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:49,060
the symmetric encryption so how does it
work will be a bit mask but don't worry

145
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:59,180
it's ok ok so we started so it's already
mentioned this adaptive chosen

146
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:07,170
ciphertext attack so conservatives and
the article sensible ciphertext to do to

147
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:12,930
the webservice modifies them and at the
end he can decrypt so maybe ask now

148
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:18,770
several questions so in the next few as
light as what is about cyberattacks and

149
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:23,780
divided can use of observances
ciphertext will deteriorate and how to

150
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:32,500
use it to decrypt ciphertext ok so
pantex quality so it is a text-based

151
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:40,340
data format so this means that every
before we can execute some business

152
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,019
logic or ever get some data we have all
always

153
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:49,939
do something similar parsing you know it
and the characters that are included in

154
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:55,118
the XML are usually encoded using some
standard they are usually included in

155
00:14:55,119 --> 00:15:02,049
ASCII probably everybody else you
probably heard about us ki uski is a

156
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:09,149
standard which consists of hundred
twenty eight characters or symbols and

157
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:15,730
this this table contains some specific
symbols of 400 character is the

158
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:24,569
character but then we have some specific
symbols like 07 Isabella character and

159
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:30,069
then we have some specific symbols like
escape this on the left column you don't

160
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:33,368
have to understand all see everything
but we obviously are some specific

161
00:15:33,369 --> 00:15:38,589
symbols on the left these symbols are
not possible

162
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:53,049
ok so ok so what we need to know for the
next few slight what do you need to

163
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:57,619
remember is that these power in the left
column are not possible to say they are

164
00:15:57,619 --> 00:16:03,309
not type a character that we have here
also some specific characters like I'm

165
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:11,679
percent or less purchases is also not
possible or Taipei characters and then

166
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,990
we have here some specific characters
like horizontal top-line feet or current

167
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:20,429
return this our type the characters also
we have here are some specific

168
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:28,709
characters from the ultimate ok this in
the next few minutes will consider the

169
00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:32,099
development its contents on the type II
characters as possible

170
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:37,459
liking the use of web services for
plaintiffs allegations so imagine we

171
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:44,649
have about service except some some some
cyber attacks what does it need to do so

172
00:16:44,649 --> 00:16:49,389
it's perfect in this three steps so
first it needs to decrypt the content

173
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:56,230
than the content has to be passed and
under some business logic evaluation and

174
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,920
there's a problem every time this should
be it should happen so there's always

175
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:07,069
this XML parsing and if a party fails so
if there's a invalid plaintext decrypted

176
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:11,619
then we get a passenger or maybe the
server responds with some fault message

177
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:15,698
also if we sent an invalid character
from the escalator which is decrypted

178
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:23,750
when the server responds with a fault so
to give you a basic idea behind us just

179
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:31,230
considered asking table and consider how
the data is the code it so imagine where

180
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:41,190
5328 characters and always in côte
ASCII characters in one by so by

181
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:46,480
consists of eight bits so the
first-order 0 bit is always here because

182
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,830
we have only hundred twenty eight
characters that fits and to show us in

183
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:55,830
which kilometer yes

184
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:08,780
327 in which roe V are exactly if it
included a nice pattern of type A&B

185
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:15,740
characters as we could see it so this is
an invalid and now for a short time I

186
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,620
will describe later rights as possible

187
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:23,610
suppose we can flip arbitrary plant
experts and we can use it for and we can

188
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:29,719
use this planting solitary so let me
give you an example so we have a

189
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:38,130
ciphertext which contains some cipher
encrypted like head and we want to

190
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,960
decorate or determined which one

191
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,130
two of the first character so we want to
want to find out which one and two of

192
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:51,970
the character be so we do not know as an
article that there is a big included but

193
00:18:51,970 --> 00:19:00,279
we want to decrypt it so we are here on
this position so in this column this

194
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:07,149
protocol and now I can ask you so what
happens if the other car now can flip a

195
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:10,149
bit and he flipped but to what happens

196
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:27,010
yeah so if it were to move to the right
as we flip between if it slips one we

197
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:33,260
jump to this column bateau to again
which I'm to this comment and rate every

198
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:38,550
Sunday so far ciphertext to the server
and once he responds with an invalid

199
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:44,970
message of the full message because yeah
because there is an invalid character so

200
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:50,620
at the end we know so if you flip it one
then we jumped here so we know the

201
00:19:50,620 --> 00:20:00,530
original column was this one so this was
the basic idea behind this attack it

202
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:06,420
further we can proceed with further also
we can we can go we can flip some bits

203
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,500
in Abbott Street 27

204
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:18,280
we can go there and pick up the wall
light expert now quite a bit flipping

205
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:24,770
possibilities because of a sec from work
training mode of operation so imagine we

206
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:29,879
have several training mode of operation
so we have an initialization vector is

207
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,570
how the caption birds and the ciphertext
block the Celtics blog post to the

208
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:38,550
instruction and the initiation factor
goes directly to the bookstore function

209
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:44,270
so if you flip a bit in the
initialization back talk this goes

210
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:49,710
directly to exert function and the trip
or sold within the plaintext this is why

211
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:57,200
we can flip between plaintiffs this was
actually misusing several attacks like

212
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:04,250
getting iraq attacks maybe you're
familiar with 1000 encryption schemes ok

213
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:10,940
so the improved the attacks a bit using
this character tables and so on and so

214
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,220
on

215
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:16,930
you will see the performance in the life
tomorrow but what exactly so you can see

216
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,460
with the

217
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:25,649
with a number of the encrypted blocks or
by the number of circuits just goes up

218
00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:32,479
early and we need about 40 forest
products night ok so this quiet

219
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,000
performance so we need to apply some
contractors and is what the analyzing

220
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,380
the recent research so how can we apply
controversial and what are the problems

221
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:48,860
in the current applications so the basic
idea behind applying to protect the

222
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:55,379
integrity and authenticity of the
ciphertext yeah but it's not that easy

223
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:02,630
as I present it in the first slides so
what are the problems forties of the

224
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,409
first province signature prepping

225
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:10,840
imagine we have 450 an encrypted data
here and encrypted key and this

226
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:17,980
encrypted data should be protected using
a signature what can I do we can just

227
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:25,299
move the signed data here and the
signature is still Baloch and

228
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:31,289
second-place arbitrary encrypted data to
the body element it gets the country you

229
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:38,620
get an Oracle is the problem the first
problem the second problem so this case

230
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:43,029
the signature validation always works
and there is a description of

231
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:48,870
functionality which which can also work
or if there's an invalid character

232
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:53,270
December sponsored event then there's a
problem called extreme encryption

233
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:57,600
wrapping so imagine we have again this
function what the attacker can do can

234
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:05,399
just define additional encrypted later
Sypher later today tournament and the

235
00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:10,549
server not only produces this or decades
this body element but also in addition

236
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:17,450
this one this for example destruction
our consideration by AP lit operate so

237
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:21,980
different additional element the
signature is validated because ok the

238
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:26,700
body has the same this body element also
gets the curtain the business logic it's

239
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,269
executed but here maybe there is a
problem with the ticket

240
00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:37,159
ok so now there's a question how to
analyze this automatically so we saw

241
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:43,139
there are different problems like you
have to adapt chosen ciphertext attack

242
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:47,449
on a symmetric encryption scheme on the
symmetric encryption scheme we can

243
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,330
combine it with natural prepping attacks
with shelling attacks with certain

244
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:57,149
tumors so how can the analyzed them
automatically and this is why we created

245
00:23:57,149 --> 00:24:02,758
a tool or a new plug-in for out w that
occur so W soccer is automatic

246
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:08,950
penetration test tool for web services
if you want to download it or play with

247
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:18,409
it its sources are available to top it
supports many attacks and there's also a

248
00:24:18,409 --> 00:24:24,690
new plug-in for example encryption so
the basic approach behind attacking

249
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:37,129
security so what what security
mechanisms other options and so on

250
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:43,208
can be attacking can be removed
protections if it is there at the end we

251
00:24:43,209 --> 00:24:47,509
have to apply the attack so we have
these three phases

252
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:57,639
so the president is the detection phase
so imagine we just received external

253
00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:04,258
security message that then we have to
face and beer so imagine we have

254
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:11,570
received an encrypted element and now we
have to identify the exam out security

255
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:18,019
mechanisms this is faith we have maybe
this message this message consists of

256
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:22,549
encrypted key is something that rhymes
and so on and we not need to know what

257
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:28,279
is protected so in this case we know
that encrypted key to the debate

258
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:35,750
arguments or if your signature body
alignment and behavior sometimes them

259
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:41,970
some additional times to me so this is
what we need to analyze first then this

260
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:48,799
analysis is going to the knowledge we
proceed to the next face to the Everett

261
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:56,658
phase so we need to somehow execute the
attacks and if the message is expired we

262
00:25:56,659 --> 00:25:59,980
need to execute signature wrapping up
talk to to make it yeah

263
00:26:00,509 --> 00:26:05,019
to make their carpeting again to to make
the web services except the message so

264
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:14,470
maybe we can execute some so so maybe we
can execute some examples of natural

265
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:51,590
repin either I present it already some
so we need to do this then if this works

266
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,590
so if we can overcome the exam

267
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:59,540
the time spent using some natural
ripping we can proceed to to the

268
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:05,740
scientists created element so what we
need to know if there is no signature

269
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,830
already encrypted 11th we can proceed to
the first if there is a signature the

270
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:18,179
encrypted element we can again Executive
Summit hoping or if this works we can go

271
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:22,470
further or if this does not work then
became executives immigration prepping

272
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:30,730
for several steps at the end if we could
overcome this protections we can

273
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:36,190
identify cancer electricity or chrome
and map them to develop more in politics

274
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,840
has to be done

275
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:44,209
ok so what we need to do so we have some
chosen ciphertext some exemptions

276
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:48,820
hypertext we sent them to the server and
the server response which some may be

277
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:53,790
some victories maybe some invalid
messages what we do not know what's

278
00:27:53,790 --> 00:28:00,960
valid or invalid ciphertext so we need
to make them to or invalid and construct

279
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,810
our Oracle ok so this depends on the
implementations because there are

280
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:11,179
different servers different application
firewalls which is different approaches

281
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:21,240
stories ok and if we could identify the
aircraft mechanics acute attack and

282
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:28,860
decrypt the message so we analyzed five
service and application firewalls so we

283
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:36,149
analyzed Apache access to a party seeks
actually made that up around Microsoft

284
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:42,630
Microsoft Windows VoIP services
implementation and we found out the

285
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:48,440
automatic rifle case applicable to avert
a successful acts like a tight and the

286
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,980
symmetry axis applied

287
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:57,809
as applicable to opportunistic access to
explain and also I dot different

288
00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:01,490
contributions which are applicable about
have to really take care how to apply

289
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:11,440
them ok so later so some problems with
them and how this worked now I will

290
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,440
present you the WS optical frame

291
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:51,760
which accepts messages on this part of
the local host and we can see the

292
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:58,080
traders a WSDL description language of
the web service this is not what we need

293
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:06,830
to tell the care about what we now
assume we have its top soap message so

294
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:13,129
you can see here now there's a bit
complicated but there is a signature

295
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:22,070
this friends is some elements using the
reference element and we can see that

296
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:27,899
there is encrypted key and also at times
terms so the message is protected times

297
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:32,580
to decide it is protected and we have
also signature over the body element

298
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:37,909
Florida Gators it's very complicated
executive how can they do this

299
00:30:48,220 --> 00:31:24,309
now we know that we stop this message so
we take the original solved message to

300
00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:36,408
each dropped and replaced it for the
initialization 2 W's attacker send it to

301
00:31:36,409 --> 00:31:46,929
the Sarah I dunno if you can see this
but there is the message this expired so

302
00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:53,330
we have time to protection that's not
good maybe they can overcome this

303
00:31:53,330 --> 00:32:11,590
service attacks

304
00:32:34,960 --> 00:33:45,110
ok so now and at the end even to
configure historical so we want to set

305
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:50,178
what if I saw your text to the server
and web survey responses have met them

306
00:33:50,179 --> 00:34:01,880
to the valid or invalid these are behind
and at the end we receive two messages

307
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:14,480
and so there is a message which contains
some but the exception may be so on this

308
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,599
probably an invalid message so we set is
an invalid and there we get a message

309
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:23,940
which contains some are validly
encrypted cipher text so maybe this

310
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:30,050
about it so we say this will develop
messages will be invalid message and

311
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:35,980
this is what we need to do so we're just
starting attic

312
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:42,010
in the attack

313
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:51,750
can see how it proceeds so you can see
how the bites the democrats are sent to

314
00:34:51,750 --> 00:35:00,569
the server and every like 14 carries we
can decrypt about is how it works and at

315
00:35:00,569 --> 00:35:41,000
the end the separatist not that long so
about 200,000 and also if you want to

316
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,540
play also

317
00:36:33,220 --> 00:37:16,250
first and then we use symmetric
encryption a CBC deciphered later ok to

318
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:22,670
be found 20 bucks an hour to success but
the message processing so first there

319
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:26,490
was a signature protection which you can
enforce using specific parameter

320
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:35,129
required sign a capital offense to to
this and forced the data was every time

321
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:40,230
very far the signature was always
horrified or decrypt data before it was

322
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:46,359
accepted but what they could do we could
apply to this this is the first backing

323
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:52,730
up at you see that this was how we could
apply this the attacks on the subject of

324
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:59,800
operation there is also a problem in a
symmetric part so if if the automatic

325
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,410
ciphertext

326
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:06,720
invalid invalidated than a terrorist no
symmetric encryption possible so this

327
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:16,470
could lead to a specific site so
different message so how can you

328
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:23,140
protected you can if it gets it if the
description is correct the person with

329
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:28,279
the KKK otherwise we just ran generate
random hundred twenty eight bits maybe

330
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:34,710
for a sec yet so far the ACB signature
during a bit and then we proceeded with

331
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,420
the description but what's the opposite
sex

332
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:47,920
it was it generated 228 but instead of
2010 was a different message generated

333
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:55,710
we could also apply this is black and
products on the key part so this was an

334
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:59,540
invalid controversial to develop are not
new about the controversial but applied

335
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:05,950
it differently I don't want to blame but
i just wanted to point out that this is

336
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:09,848
really complicated to get it correctly

337
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:15,260
ok so if you want to play with its a go
to get help others out the blaze

338
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,430
attacker if you want to play with some
of the services I encourage you to use

339
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:26,078
our texts too because it is vulnerable
to most of the attacks that provide so

340
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:34,170
nice and if you want to have some
examples on configuration of access to

341
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:37,210
and how to get it running go to our blog
post

342
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:47,200
ok so if you want to use some
controversial please do not use a sec or

343
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,078
because he has 1152 are insecure

344
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:57,900
option but updated to a sec I'm not all
of the service support it but so if you

345
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:03,270
can then use area say or AP or ASTM if
you have to use a GCM

346
00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:10,040
because he is 1.5 ensure that you can
first validating signature over the

347
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:17,329
ciphertext and that the attacker cannot
modify the ciphertext an Oracle so first

348
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:21,710
I beamed a top our you can select a
specific elements which are going to

349
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,710
decorate with accept it and you can sign
them

350
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:33,019
everytime ensure that only specific
elements are okay so it's somehow I was

351
00:40:33,019 --> 00:40:39,629
very complex especially security because
it combines some XML standards external

352
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:43,859
security standards comes to graphic
mechanisms and so on and so on so if you

353
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:49,690
want to use if you want to apply
encryption or eczema signature

354
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:56,538
police UW's article for evaluation
purposes if you're a researcher maybe

355
00:40:56,539 --> 00:41:01,009
take a look at different standards
because these attacks are applicable

356
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:06,420
also to maximal Jason that encryption
and so on all Rep reply behind maybe so

357
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:11,380
take a look at it if you're a developer
was deployed to secure systems is

358
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:16,319
considered it applies secure standard
like AG si amor series ok

359
00:41:32,020 --> 00:42:02,990
implementation

360
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:46,549
able to because every way

361
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:48,930
the problem
