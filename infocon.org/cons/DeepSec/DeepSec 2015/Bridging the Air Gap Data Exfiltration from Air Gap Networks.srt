1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,470
hi everybody in my name is extremely
risky I'm a PhD student and ben-gurion

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:11,309
university also a project manager at the
cybersecurity research center there in

3
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:17,180
the university and manage a project for
the Israeli Ministry of Science today

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,330
the primary author of the content of the
stalker was not able to make it because

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,479
I do the birth of a daughter so as a
co-author I'll be filling in for him

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,949
talk about like to speak to you about
today is that bridging a gap networks

7
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:37,329
and I like to go very different methods
of bridging a gap that works and most of

8
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:41,149
the methods that will show it to you
today were developed in our

9
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:46,140
cybersecurity labs and published in
order to bring awareness to this issue

10
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:54,620
so what is an area network so the
typical approach to securing a network

11
00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:01,379
is that we put some sort of firewall
between our corporation or sensitive

12
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,548
network and the rest of the Internet and
the air temp approaches a security

13
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:10,479
measure where approaches that if we have
some sort of physical disconnect between

14
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,580
our network and the rest of the world

15
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,570
their network is pretty much secure
there was no way for the attack to

16
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,508
transmit information into the network
and transmit information out the network

17
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:26,979
so this business with the attack model
really looks like you have the attacker

18
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:29,920
somewhere in the internet per se you
have an air gap and your hair cap

19
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,900
network some examples of networks and
maybe aerCap what's a military defense

20
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,490
systems financial system such as stock
exchange industrial controls katha

21
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,710
critical infrastructure power plants
refineries traffic control and the list

22
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,679
goes on but as we know that

23
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:56,079
the approach of getting a network is not
a foolproof approach and we see many

24
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:02,990
different malware infected these air gap
so what's the adversarial attack model

25
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,408
for infecting an air gap network so
first day usually is some sort of

26
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,830
initial infection either a malicious
received insider plugs in some sort of

27
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,920
effective media USB or plug his phone to
charge whatever it may be

28
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,950
or there's an attack on the supply chain
where the chips or motherboards go into

29
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,730
the air Cup network before they even
reach the network are infected with some

30
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:31,040
sort of malware so we know that it's
possible to do some sort of the attacker

31
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,989
to infected a network and the real
question is what does he do afterwards

32
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:41,810
so some examples of the actions that
matter within a haircut network might do

33
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,000
is steal sensitive data manipulate the
control systems delete records the

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,010
update some sort of security measure
videos

35
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:56,500
self-destruct either cause a lot of
havoc or just erases own tracks so once

36
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,549
we know that the attacker can get some
sort of presence within the narrow gap

37
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:05,310
network the question is how can he send
commands to the affected computers and

38
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,450
receive information afterwards and the
reasons why we would want or the attack

39
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,429
would want some sort of inbound or
outbound channels as follows four

40
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,820
channels into the air gap network the
tactic could send commands which gives

41
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,950
them flexibility on the attack or most
importantly went to a perpetrate some

42
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:30,530
sort of details have been needed update
now we're standing new modules fixes are

43
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,660
changing Christian keys and still on for
Albert channels you could possibly

44
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:43,450
receives passwords or whole whole
documents and reports on the progress of

45
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:48,380
the infiltration where the Mallory has
gotten what assets as asset access to

46
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,590
and so on

47
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,319
so that brings us all the way to the
main subject of land like to speak to

48
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,649
you today as the three different ways of
bridging the Erica we have thermal

49
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:05,200
channels radio channels and acoustic
channels the thermal channels and radio

50
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,200
channels were developed in our laps and
published bring awareness and the

51
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:17,180
channels we have time to get to that the
previous subject published by other

52
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:24,229
researchers which I will cover briefly
so start with thermal channels the first

53
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:32,330
ideas will call H better so we know that
modern PCs have thermal sensors inside

54
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:36,990
them to determine what temperature the
CPU is the cases and so on and so forth

55
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:43,510
and these temp sensors can be used to
determine that governmental temperature

56
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,250
around the computer so really what we're
thinking of here's what with we can

57
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,580
change the temperature around the
computer that we can effectively by

58
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,409
raising a lower than lowering the
temperature we can send information to

59
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,880
these computers so the big question is
well how do we change the temperature

60
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,460
around the computer so when I ways to
one way to do this is to the HVAC system

61
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:10,200
HVAC system is the heating ventilation
air conditioning system most built large

62
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:16,610
buildings it is a centralized system to
handle all the lighting power most

63
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:22,870
importantly heating and cooling of the
building so just do a quick search using

64
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:29,830
the showdown I search engine we we look
for an example HVAC system called the

65
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:35,190
trading day ago racks platform and we
found that about 36,000 different web

66
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:42,729
portals completely exposed without 269
which are protected by HTTPS and a lot

67
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:47,280
of these web portals are to these HVAC
system to large corporations and

68
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,989
industries so just goes to show that
these HVAC systems have vulnerabilities

69
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,030
and this mean connection to the attack
and can get to this

70
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,350
to the HVAC system is through these web
portals which are used by the personnel

71
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:08,360
to manage these texts to remotely so it
just me or some kind of James Bond see

72
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,770
but here's an example from an article in
2013 where researchers hacked building

73
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:19,020
control system at Google Australia
office and just found the the portal

74
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,979
they did a very simple password attack
and they got access database in which

75
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,890
give him a floor plans to give them
access to change the temperature in

76
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:32,219
different rooms which is of course most
interesting to us so here in here as a

77
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,330
tack model we have the attacker
somewhere in the internet has access to

78
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,460
the air conditioning system is able to
manipulate the temperature in the tower

79
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,130
building kind of look up broadcast
system to any possible infected

80
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:49,380
computers there to send them information
that was clearly an inbound channel and

81
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,740
as we would report it was interesting to
attack because he could cause an attack

82
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,070
to happen when he wants it to or you can
possibly change different properties

83
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:05,670
within the Mel Gibson updates so how do
we do this very basic protocol to send

84
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:11,440
information the air conditioner that's a
lower the temperature sender 0 raise the

85
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,930
temperature cent 21 and the receiver
also again a very simple the modulating

86
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:22,500
protocol if the current trend of the
temperature in there was going out then

87
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,960
assumes it's one it's going down to 20
and it's more or less during the same

88
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,890
within some sort of threshold that it
seems to suppress same as the previous a

89
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:36,610
bit received and we put this all into a
training process where we first the

90
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,930
transmitter to send information to any
prisoners we first put a preamble to say

91
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:46,330
that this news content whether it is a
mistake or perhaps some sort of noise

92
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:52,859
and also of course to synchronize on
that its sequence an opcode buckle

93
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,540
kabila I want to perform

94
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,160
from the attack now the lead a certain
file a parity bit just for a bit of

95
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,880
integrity check and a payload if
necessary a quick overview of the high

96
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,750
level protocol so I first book will only
happen real soon that the attack will

97
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,260
only do this kind of attack and during
the evening wear this juror personnel

98
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,849
around to notice the changes in
temperature generally we found only in

99
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:25,440
just a few degrees difference is enough
to send the signal over if during the

100
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,570
evening the malware see it receives a
preamble it will investigate the frame

101
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:37,020
integrity checking the parity been also
correlating the code to the payload it

102
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,090
makes sense if that passes then they
would collaborate with peers other

103
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:45,650
malware is in the network which has
access to and they could by majority

104
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,030
vote count determined well I got this
and it sounds correct let's compare

105
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:54,670
notes and see if we all got the same
message and of course if they'll give us

106
00:08:54,670 --> 00:09:02,360
a message accepted and perpetrate the
the action and of course there's also

107
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:08,060
some sort of process of self-destructive
if the power hasn't received the command

108
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,510
in a very long time it was just two
races tracks perhaps it got moved to a

109
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,100
location is too far from their
conditional can't receive any signals

110
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,400
just kind of backup so they get these
are the things I'm just pointing out

111
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,540
here so this thing keeping I have an
idea but it is possible to look for it

112
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,520
in the experimental results we've got
about 40 bits per hour to very small

113
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,910
office scenario we didn't fully tested
all sorts of different scenarios

114
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,360
different kinds of HVAC systems was a
very simple test to show the feasibility

115
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,860
of the main question I think we could
ask you is what about the entire

116
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,300
internal interference with somebody
starts using the computer the CPU starts

117
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,349
getting hotter and could affect the
thermal sensors in the motherboard so we

118
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:53,320
just a quick analysis we did different
different kinds of actions of the pure

119
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,250
video playing web browsing and word
processing the bottom there you see the

120
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,440
CPU usage yellow line there is the

121
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:05,770
CPU thermal measurements and the gray
line is the thermal sensor located on

122
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,520
the motherboard and you can see there
that's the best sensor to really look at

123
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,390
to get an idea of what the environment
the sensing and it's hardly affected by

124
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:18,270
the whatever the computers doing doing
really intensive work there but becoming

125
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:21,689
ideas that we're looking at their common
desktop that that's close to some sort

126
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:27,030
of asset so can catch measures for HVAC
we could the disabled or better

127
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:32,079
securities web portals to the HVAC
system modern environmental temperature

128
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,170
changes and malware signatures anything
I propose to you looking at these kind

129
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:44,420
of thermal sensors that might seem a
suspicious so over to the next step of

130
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:51,540
thermal way of bridging a gap we call
this one bit so we know that the

131
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:58,770
received signals as well so this is a
very useful properties since we can now

132
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:03,329
only have a computer sends signals but
also receive and then you have happened

133
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,490
to have two computers next to each other
we can make a bidirectional half duplex

134
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:12,010
channel sending information into the
network and receive information from the

135
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:16,420
network and what kind of cases with this
evil many times you have least computing

136
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,729
spaces we're loading your machines are
kind of piled on top of each other

137
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:26,820
belonging to different corporations and
as these can be used to bridge there and

138
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:33,450
also found that can be achieved within
virtual machines so here again a few of

139
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:40,480
the attack model and looking a bit
closer we performing our tests we found

140
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,690
of course you know the amount of heat
that comes out of a large load on the

141
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:51,050
CPU or GPU it is not quite as hot of
course when it reaches the other

142
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,349
computer but it's it's another using
different smoothing techniques are

143
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:59,420
moving average filter is very basic ways
of getting rid of the noise we were able

144
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:05,209
to pick up these signals it was just a
few different setups that we use

145
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:15,839
experiments and just outside of here
different kinds of products tested so we

146
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,889
tried the differential number turned 20
is very similar to the first protocol I

147
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:26,389
mentioned with H backer we just we have
some very large load on the CPU to send

148
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:31,929
that one to me do nothing as in 20 and
time signaling which is where we

149
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:36,600
basically take off frame timeframe and
we split up into 16 for example 16 slots

150
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:44,459
and represent the hexadecimal maybe and
we said thing at the right time to kind

151
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:53,329
of indicate the value that we want to
repeat that over and over again so in

152
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:54,699
terms of results

153
00:12:54,699 --> 00:13:01,209
the time and exceedingly we got about
7.5 bits per hour is pretty slow but

154
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:04,969
again once you have a long-term
situation to computers in next to each

155
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,749
other for a very long time it's feasible
to consider sending the small pieces of

156
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:13,269
information passwords or maybe

157
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:25,279
commands to start intact and spirit
countermeasures we could force a better

158
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:31,699
zoning policies it comes to air gap
networks not have a gap network machines

159
00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:35,998
near any computer machine that may be
connected to a public network

160
00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:40,179
strengthen the air conditioning to
weaken the signal between the two

161
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:43,839
signatures and again environmentalists
in C

162
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:56,439
so we have a computer on the left is
supposedly connect to the internet

163
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:02,170
computer on the right is connected to a
network not connected to anything and

164
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:07,219
you can see so well but there is a
camera next to the bottom corner and

165
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:11,600
will be sending bits of information to
tell it you know to perpetrate attack

166
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,290
now I'm our receives it perpetrates
attack with that little toys in the

167
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,290
corner and it fires missiles

168
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:33,939
videos actually played about think it
sixteen times speed is not super fast

169
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,940
but again it's enough to send
information

170
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:48,650
move over to the second type of way
bridging the air gap that's radio

171
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:57,680
channels of course I'd say likely to be
used and more dangerous Bristol start

172
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,900
with air hopper so many workplaces have
this policy of bring-your-own-device

173
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:09,290
which means large corporations spliced
with a smartphone

174
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:15,060
considered secure they'll say bring your
own smartphone to wear and that brings a

175
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:20,089
lot of concerns but our case we know
that smartphones can be used to detect

176
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:24,330
receive all sorts of different kinds of
radio signals and if we can get

177
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:28,550
computers to emit radio signals and we
have a fantastic way of sending

178
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:34,490
information from computers to any nearby
smartphone so it looks like this

179
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:40,670
some user comes within range of a
spirited bidding signal in our case on

180
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:48,390
FM radio modulations since every single
smartphone or on almost everything has a

181
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:55,860
has been much upset if I could receive
and modulated FM signals were able to

182
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:02,310
receive FM modulated signals and of
course pass along to the attacker so the

183
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:06,329
big question is how do we turn a
computer into an FM broadcasting system

184
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:13,030
so just a quick aside about current
owners work so attendants are made radio

185
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:16,720
waves by oscillating current through
their terminals and radio waves are

186
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,530
characterized by their frequency how
fast and the amplitude how large that

187
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:28,410
are so based on the previous works

188
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:36,149
we don't find this this idea but its
previous works that is possible to send

189
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:41,160
to the monitor different kinds of images
and due to the size shape and the

190
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,769
pressure of the images were able to use
the display cable capers been shown here

191
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:56,369
but the display cable to emit radio
waves and it was there that we published

192
00:16:56,369 --> 00:17:02,660
we found a way of specifically embedding
it on FM channels and of course using

193
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:07,398
the regulars smartphone to pick up so
signals and pass along the information

194
00:17:07,398 --> 00:17:14,829
that we do that because again FM is an
analog modulation so to send this type

195
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:21,079
of a set of bits will set the tone over
that channel higher tones higher values

196
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:28,010
and just really just a mapping between
tones and PC when hasn't text or it

197
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:35,590
looks at the binary the mapping to the
tone and then of course that causes the

198
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:42,129
display to show the right image in the
corner in a very small location and sent

199
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:48,240
the cause of the radio signals to be
emitted from the cable and the reverse

200
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,049
process of course from the smartphone
smartphone looks at the right to

201
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:54,049
broadcasting channel and the modulated

202
00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:01,510
our experimental results we found some
smartphones have built in antenna some

203
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:06,169
don't and the ones that don't you plug
in headphones accident and so with

204
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:10,419
without intent I get about 20 meters

205
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:15,390
range with an antenna plugged into the
phone you get so you can get up to

206
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:19,860
between eight to 20 metres or so that
means he can come to work but their

207
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,600
phone on the table not perhaps they know
or don't know that their phone is

208
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,409
infected and be receiving information
from a computer nearby or possibly in a

209
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:31,620
different room types of data rates not
so crazy fast much better than the

210
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,070
thermal channels we can send about it
when kilobytes in a minute and how to

211
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:42,179
make it by 11 hours so the kind of
information interested in a drink from

212
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,650
the air gap network but again a process
of day and they have been this phone and

213
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:49,990
it's a lot of information orbit so
simple to keylogging is a very physical

214
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:58,070
countermeasures against Rick zoning we
can do perhaps insulation better on the

215
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:03,960
cables cables we cover them with
something sort of resistant material may

216
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,140
get this problem altogether jami who
perhaps he met some sort of noise on the

217
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:13,370
right frequency bands and again
signatures look for some sort of strange

218
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:18,489
behaviour as to do with graphics really
do manipulations take a look at another

219
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,490
level

220
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:30,740
so Peter on the side there is running
has now we're running and the phone

221
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:35,370
right next to it is not connected to
internet both devices are connected to

222
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:41,030
the Internet in this case and the device
also has a sort of listening malware

223
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:49,559
Sorry Sorry listening power and we're
gonna use it now to community receives

224
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:53,379
messages from the keylogger that's on
the computer to the right

225
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,790
types in the message top secret and
starts appearing immediately on the

226
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:17,240
smartphone right next to it and if you
submit that the small little pigs were

227
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,160
forced the towns that were being sent
through responding to the characters and

228
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,400
just to demonstrate that could receive
from other rooms here's another

229
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,400
smartphone that was just down the
hallway receive the exact same message

230
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:47,120
last radio type better that we develop
their laps to bridge their get Jess

231
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:57,860
membership published not too long ago
okay so feature phones are footing said

232
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:03,469
don't have wi-fi or Bluetooth
capabilities like those old Nokia is it

233
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:08,690
that we have had a couple years back and
these feature phones are allowed to be

234
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:15,210
brought into restricted zones are still
in the policy change since we publish

235
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:19,000
this book but it still was a few months
ago at least still the policies of these

236
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,610
large corporations to be allowed people
were entering restricted to bring

237
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:29,090
feature focus on smartphones feature
thoughts and still have within the

238
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:34,370
course the chipset in order to receive
GSM or other technology sickness and

239
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:42,409
what we found is that we can exploit the
CPU memory bus standard computer to emit

240
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:48,400
radio waves exactly on the band's a
cellular phones and it's just a moment

241
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,660
so here's the attack model again anybody
brings in a feature phone or smartphone

242
00:21:54,660 --> 00:22:01,000
within range of computer broadcasting on
the single can receive thats all trade

243
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,440
information and passed along to the
attacker so let's talk about how the

244
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:13,980
transmitter works so I first observation
was that we transfer caused a large

245
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:20,130
transfer between the CPU and memory
there's a buildup of the country on the

246
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:26,110
configuration and we talked about in 10
of the oscillations release a radio

247
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:30,350
waves and the opposition to basically
show show as well

248
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,110
clock speed of the motherboard
determines the oscillations and I just

249
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:39,600
happened to be 800 megahertz which quite
fortunately was to our surprise on the

250
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,620
band's sale

251
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:46,260
technologies what you see at the bottom
is a plot the blue blue line shows the

252
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,830
regular noise floor could possibly other
cellular phones communicating or other

253
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:56,149
computers in the room causing and the
red line shows the added energy that

254
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:02,410
that is received across the spectrum
when we causes large transfer between

255
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:06,020
the CPU and memory has put it is
important to point out here is not just

256
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:10,720
any transfer you have to actually
bypassed the cash in order to get this

257
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:18,070
large buildup and then the emission will
happen so we affect not just that yes

258
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:25,070
GSM as the title Jess many imply that we
tested specifically just as we can see

259
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,490
here that the all these different bands
so all the different technologies

260
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:34,710
receive the signal quite well so how do
we said that bit so to send a zero we

261
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:40,970
can do nothing for 30 seconds to send
the one we caused a large transfer for

262
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:46,940
once again we put this in the frame
every several bits every 12 bits we put

263
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,300
a preamble in front of it for a few
reasons one synchronization again cuz we

264
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,580
talk about wireless communication
receiver can move away from the

265
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:01,590
transmitters we have to adjust
thresholds and so on and some

266
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:05,030
interesting properties about the
transmitter that now where that's on the

267
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:05,780
computer

268
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,780
first of all lands of four killed by
memory footprint

269
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:14,120
route for admin privileges are required
for this to happen and no baby I is are

270
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:22,030
used to catch it also we know that we
tested it on Intel AMD architectures be

271
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:25,700
assumed that all six other architectures
as well and it works on Windows as well

272
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:31,150
as Linux so receiving this thing no

273
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:38,090
for a phone to to get from the phone to
get access to the raw signals you would

274
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:43,620
actually have to modify the firmware of
the baseband chipset and all those kind

275
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,840
of this

276
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,510
capabilities of the average person
because you basically need access to

277
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:54,590
close source code it would seem this
doesn't really tutor highly motivated

278
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:57,600
threats so we assume this is still
considered a threat but in order to

279
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:04,939
prove our point is an old old order
feature phone the Motorola she went to

280
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:11,000
three and using open-source baseband
software and/or to show the quality of

281
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,840
the possibilities of setting a receiving
transmissions we also used to refer to

282
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,408
find a radio show

283
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:26,450
corner to see how really fire the signal
reaches and receiving the receiver was

284
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:30,740
just look at the best frequency on the
least oscillations look for payload as

285
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:35,490
look for sales sorry the the preamble to
seize the preamble will extract the

286
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:43,929
payload so experimental results so with
the old nine year old phone we got about

287
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:47,870
20 metres distance in terms of range
that somebody who comes up with their

288
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:51,279
phone or in this case imma come into the
restricted area

289
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:58,539
meter maid with feature phone if the
feature phone where you know it was a

290
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:03,059
little more capable or had the
capabilities of the user to get far

291
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:07,908
better distances as we see what the USR
Peter able to pick up the signal about

292
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:12,779
40 metres away and even further and few
other interesting things we noticed that

293
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:19,549
more channels more memory channels
increased the output of the channel of

294
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:24,720
the signal and orientation of the case
respective receiver has an effect but

295
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,649
doesn't know the facts not to detriment
along the signal quality in terms of

296
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:32,928
data rates with the old the phone we are
able to get within a few minutes and

297
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:37,590
some quite interesting data and with the
USR people were able to get to within a

298
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:41,289
few seconds quite a bit of that of you
can send almost anything

299
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,830
countermeasures interference shielding
against stricter zoning better policy is

300
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:51,830
bringing devices networks

301
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:16,570
computer presumably air gap and we have
the old Motorola C 123 phone was no

302
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:24,860
connectivity in it and it's just sitting
there sniffing looking at the GSM bands

303
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:31,689
and trying to look for the keylogger on
the computer over here you receive the

304
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:38,370
signals and causes the transfers across
the memory bus and ready to send signals

305
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,550
to the Motorola phone then it's a little
hard to see on the screen here but the

306
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,510
same thing that was typing on the
computer is now appearing on the

307
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:52,590
Motorola screen that's it were your
channels now just for the sake of

308
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:59,389
completeness of all mention also
channels this message was a work that

309
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:06,040
was published by Michael hotspot and
Michael go ahead and the general idea is

310
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:11,350
that what we can transmit information to
a speaker lee also sonic signals

311
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:15,780
ultrasonic meeting can't be heard by the
human here and there will be any

312
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:20,420
microphone in the area whether a part of
a laptop or smartphone has also been

313
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:27,140
rumored as the way that hurt as bad BIOS
the way information has been hopping

314
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:34,230
between different computers there so
they attack model is basically mesh

315
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:38,090
network we're all sorts of devices
infected with malware speak to one

316
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:42,560
another through ultrasonic
communications and they'll make hops to

317
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,480
one another in their personal
information to one happens to be

318
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,920
connected to internet and then pass
along quite easily to the attacker and

319
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:58,910
this of course is about China's wells
and countermeasures we could perhaps in

320
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:05,290
these very sensitive areas a bit of
noise when it affect anybody dogs and we

321
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:11,330
can also prove you know trying to better
strict zoning policies but with the

322
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:14,850
Maori like this is very very tricky you
don't know who exactly been affected his

323
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,969
passing on information

324
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:26,770
long takes up the signal had a very
sticky situation is so in conclusion we

325
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:31,360
were doing three types of channels that
can bridge the gaps remind you again in

326
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,990
the simpson here is that the eric has
already been infected by is some sort of

327
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:44,160
insider where the media or supply chain
attack and takeaways I guess our air gap

328
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,930
thing does not provide a guarantee
disconnect and awareness of these

329
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:53,160
different kinds of bridges through these
different kinds of channels can help us

330
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,750
a hard in this area networks and that's
it thank you very much

331
00:30:49,030 --> 00:31:04,790
actually the only paper here that I from
the course they could challenge I was

332
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:10,500
not directly involved with I do believe
that they were able to do it without it

333
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,650
the user do not notice I would suggest
you know if you'd be interested in

334
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:19,380
looking deeper into how they did it you
what kind of images in the way to do it

335
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:24,130
you can take a look at the paper was
published there but I do believe that

336
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:28,310
they accomplished thus to without too
much interference and even if there was

337
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:33,149
interference to the User notice some
sort of strange you know things going on

338
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:33,710
there

339
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:39,340
this could also be done perhaps you know
when screen is off looking at the screen

340
00:31:54,230 --> 00:32:06,210
the Raspberry Pi where there exists FM
radio application that makes use of a

341
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:12,520
variably also laid on the board of
course you should not be able to use it

342
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:18,650
with other licensed but these days it's
really difficult to get involved so are

343
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:22,470
you aware of other work in this area

344
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:34,880
talk about ways to exploit electronics
to get there are some some works talk

345
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:41,580
about i mean specifically to display
cable again mentioned this we weren't

346
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,860
the first to come up with this idea of
using noticing that there is a missions

347
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:51,850
from the display cable but in terms of
using the electronics and computer

348
00:32:51,850 --> 00:33:00,049
itself to emit a signal over as clearly
as we did with the seller technologies

349
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:05,090
I'm not presently aware but perhaps
there are other published works on this

350
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:16,059
method but during our research we didn't
see anything in that specific questions

351
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:35,080
the temperature as an acoustic channel
or maybe it's from a chance to

352
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:42,159
manipulate the defense speed so you can
generate more heat so so the channel was

353
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,300
not from our laps

354
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:50,450
mention here that we didn't do but in
terms of fans before the thermal

355
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:54,850
channels yes we did notice of course
that has a great impact in terms of the

356
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:59,439
exhaust brought up in the system brought
into the machine we didn't try playing

357
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,920
necessarily directly with the fan speeds
though of course that has an effect I

358
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:10,460
think I didn't have the picture here but
when you have caused a very large load

359
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:15,629
on the CPU the he picks up very quickly
and the moment that you stop that load

360
00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:20,770
it has a very steep drop in terms of
environmental temperature and the reason

361
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:23,989
is because of the way that the
convection heating works it's very

362
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:29,029
efficient than getting rid of that heat
when there's no need to so when it's an

363
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:35,570
excess so I would say that the fan speed
in terms of thermal channels always

364
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:39,080
wanted on the highest in order to get
that heat going to the other computer

365
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:45,190
and which case you probably wouldn't
want to play around with the speed so

366
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:48,190
much as far as we see things

367
00:34:50,699 --> 00:35:01,569
you could for example profile from noah
takes too low temperatures which would

368
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:09,609
significantly change the behavior or you
could use printers and the noise made ya

369
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:16,500
so the the idea of a meeting sounding
because a lot of laptops or smartphones

370
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,450
have come with both speakers and
microphones in terms of acoustic

371
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:24,720
channels yeah I mean become quite easy
mesh network but once you look at

372
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,230
started looking at other devices in
trying to exploit the noises it's a

373
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:33,510
little harder to make a deterministic
channel thirty misleading making noises

374
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:41,099
but it is definitely sees a boy was so
thanks for the talk I liked it alot im

375
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:43,240
just wondering cuz I'm not in that field

376
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,069
have you tried to experiment with the
connected cars and the cars now because

377
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:53,740
almost all cars will need a smartphone
somehow or at least 23 in the car and

378
00:35:53,740 --> 00:36:00,470
almost always be connected to some
clouds so is there some future work or

379
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:05,430
curing to work well in are working on
that problem we have a wide range of

380
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:08,868
different research topics that we take
care of not just their captain networks

381
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:14,160
also smartphone security contextual
smartphone security authentication and

382
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,089
one of the projects that we've taken
also is smart card connected car

383
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:23,619
security is not that I'm presently
involved with

384
00:36:25,509 --> 00:36:28,969
it could be some of course implications
here

385
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:38,380
terms of bridging between those two
systems we have further questions thank

386
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,099
you very much for the talk was very
interesting
