1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,670
I still for too long last night

2
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:13,769
ok good morning everyone welcome to the
second day of the second number nine

3
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:19,869
know the first presentation that will
hopefully wake you up is from Johnny

4
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:26,420
Dodds and have been penetrated yet it's
more about the relationship between us

5
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,340
to take you guys to penetrate systems
and our client's what we think what they

6
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:36,519
think and why things don't work out
which seats in each other so easily

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:48,129
enjoy so good morning everybody doing
what I'm so sorry early knowledge of

8
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:52,730
people into rooms I hope that people
will join us we we start on my name is

9
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:57,800
Johnny Johnny Deutsche I'm from the USS
for Israel it depends how you look at it

10
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,199
you'll see that in the second and I'm
here to talk about something which is

11
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:06,899
not necessarily technical but everybody
that is has been around in this field

12
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,619
knows what I'm talking about and you
know help clear up some things so we'll

13
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:17,360
start with the basic intros of whim I
why am I talking about this will start

14
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,580
talking about penetration testing you
know the times that we normally see the

15
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:26,950
types that we have in this world will
talk about one of the main things is

16
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,229
that how do we proceed a problem and how
does the client receives the problem a

17
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:36,908
lot of the times we see that there is
just a mistranslation between us and the

18
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:41,170
client it's not because we're bad is
good or something like that is just like

19
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,189
no two people saying different problems
and then we'll go and talk about the

20
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:51,298
challenges you know that we have and the
decline has tried to understand why is

21
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,619
it that we see the problem in a
different way and then we'll talk about

22
00:01:54,619 --> 00:02:01,219
client interactions that's the funny bit
these are the real I mean girls that I

23
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:05,070
believe that I have not been doing this
for 10 years and I think that i've seen

24
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,389
these situations that

25
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:12,090
you as a professional row provider could
automatically tough to decline and say

26
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,400
hey you know let's start with these
things once we get the conversation

27
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,790
going with these things things done two
runs movie so bad about me I used to be

28
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,420
a captain and Israeli intelligence
forces doing summer where warfare Cyber

29
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:34,420
Intelligence over seven years have
passed and I was deputy see so the fans

30
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:41,690
a lot of my stuff but you know it's all
in the past I i went into civil life

31
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:45,350
with earnest NE on earnest young
acquired an Israeli startup called

32
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:50,109
tactics hacking tactics we were able to
company doing penetration testing on

33
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,739
application level testing and we were
assimilated into Ernst and Young

34
00:02:54,739 --> 00:03:02,330
consulting business I have recently
moved to Ernst and Young's Center in dus

35
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:08,370
I reside in Houston Texas that's where
we have all our consulting business for

36
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:14,930
I T security in speaking about security
in a lot of different conferences for a

37
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,380
long time so yeah let's begin

38
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:23,160
so what has been testing you know it's
kind of funny I think that even even

39
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,810
though starting with this funny quote is
funny but you know when people say pen

40
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,579
testing people think on a different
things of course we're not actually

41
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:38,070
testing pens granted but then again you
might have clients thinking okay let me

42
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,730
know what are these guys doing suggested
trying to clear up what is interesting

43
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:48,530
that's what we're going to talk about
today so why am I really having this

44
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:54,900
talk because most security conferences
are geared towards technical things well

45
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,940
that's because we don't really have a
relationship conferences when it comes

46
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,530
to the security world so we have to pull
it into a technical top and tried to

47
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,290
explain the problems that we have in
this specific and complex relationship

48
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,130
that we have with our service providers
we our clients with client service

49
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,750
providers depending on how you define
yourself

50
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,310
you might run into this situation the
problem being is that not everybody sees

51
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,250
a problem the same way and it's not
really a problem as we'll talk about it

52
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:29,160
more of a challenge you know not
everything is the way it looks so I hope

53
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,000
that I can help you understand why am I
saying the things I'm saying or why are

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,680
you saying the things that you are
saying to your client or service

55
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:45,040
provider is providing you to service it
will be interesting so let's start with

56
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:52,510
the most basic definition what is
included when we say 10 testing so not

57
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:59,020
to misrepresent put the good the bad and
the ugly because I liked the movie but

58
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,250
because in a way it is a funny way to
group the various types of pen testing

59
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:09,850
the we have so not saying that one is
good one is better one is ugly let's

60
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:16,280
start with the other let's talk about
compliance testing so and a pen testers

61
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:23,830
worst day he wakes up and he has a PCI
pen test there's no problem with PCI

62
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:29,900
there is but there isn't a specific
problem with PCI rather the fact that

63
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:37,820
when Penn testers do a PCI compliance
towards testing there are geared towards

64
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:44,360
finding specific findings the client
isn't always you know is interested in

65
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,570
finding everything or it's not that he's
not interested its not the work that

66
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,120
you're supposed to do

67
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,640
you're supposed to find very specific
findings that correlate to the checklist

68
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,810
that is supporting the client in that
specific assessment some very vague but

69
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,350
that's exactly how to paint this room
feels so dependence true which is you

70
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:08,270
know if your app industry know you were
free finger you want to save the world

71
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,890
in your own way you want to find the bad
stuff to make things bad and fix them or

72
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,590
help people understand why are they like
that and help them fix it when you start

73
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,869
with compliance testing his start fixing
someone's specific problem

74
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,710
1.2

75
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:28,750
specifically a section with any problem
so you don't really get to fix your own

76
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,380
stuff so a lot of the problems that
we're having when it comes to compliance

77
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:38,440
testing is due to the fact that ten
testers those three fingers to really

78
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,950
like compliance testing as they like to
fix stuff there is compliance is

79
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:50,020
Mourinho being regulated and it's been
compliance with compliant with something

80
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,780
something that we know painters are not
exactly big on as we're kind of

81
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:01,520
different than we have in a way of bed
thing we have to focus testing so you

82
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,400
could say it's bad you could say it's
not but everything left to its own is

83
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,620
kind of bad as when you don't really see
the broad picture and we did you just

84
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,650
see one specific thing that could result
in a bad thing so that group is the

85
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,590
focus testing it's that time of day that
somebody tells you I want you to test a

86
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:26,760
specific subsection of a specific
application and you know that you'll

87
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,090
find a lot of stuff and an application
and it might actually go when you know

88
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:36,450
resigned in a bigger program but you
don't really see the big picture you see

89
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:42,500
a specific subprogram with a giant
complex system and you always say yeah

90
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,390
but a real attackers really care about
this specific software he cares about

91
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:53,070
the broad issue the broad system so you
might have a very frustrated Pentastar

92
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:58,670
saying hey declined as tell me just look
straight like a horse do not look right

93
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,410
click click there's nothing there's no
other applications to the right no other

94
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,460
applications of the left is going
charging that one where you know where

95
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:12,239
investors don't really made of the same
materials of not looking through right

96
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,090
or to the left you hire us to look to
rate them look to the left just telling

97
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,190
us to go forward

98
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:22,880
not exactly the best use of our time but
we'll talk about it but that's the type

99
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,540
of testing that we're talking about go
and find a specific problem with a

100
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,690
specific device with embedded testing
you're not looking at the whole

101
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,690
environment you don't know specifically
what goes on with the environment

102
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:37,580
go look at an infrastructure sometimes
infrastructure is an environment some

103
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,500
time to tell you some infrastructure it
really depends the good as the hybrid

104
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:48,780
system and hybrid testing goes to real
attack scenarios what will the attacker

105
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:54,760
be able to do in a red team kind of
environment you know he's your client is

106
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,740
his target no matter how he needs to get
in and it doesn't like the client

107
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:04,860
doesn't really care and you don't really
care as a pen tester I mean you do care

108
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,920
about how you'll get in but you don't
really care about what are the means

109
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,300
that you will use to get into that
specific environment I don't look at

110
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,469
this as the good because it's only
answer depends tester and you're

111
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,180
actually using him for what he's good
for but it's good for you because you

112
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,729
get to see what a real world attack her
face with problem which challenge which

113
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:31,430
is your network where your organization
would have done so sometimes over

114
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:37,390
managing discounted prices is bad so
letting the attackers have to run added

115
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,660
is a good thing

116
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,829
same goes for social engineering which
we you know we tend to say when it comes

117
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,150
to spear phishing attacks sorry and
things of that sort

118
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:53,900
similarly real-world tests like we have
nowadays process controls are specific

119
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,030
subgroup that I like to put into hybrid
testing because there's no real thing

120
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:02,880
that gives call process control it is
one giant system that we test the whole

121
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,320
system again

122
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,560
methodology according to how you do it
but you are supposed to check the entire

123
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:15,790
environment where it resigns physically
cyber unwise and everything around it is

124
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:21,849
around it so in a way I have grouped
everything that we call pen testing some

125
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,680
would say that there are other
categories to be added here but you know

126
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:33,479
this is a very general generalization of
what we cope interesting one specific

127
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,610
thing that I always like to say people
look at a lot of different things and

128
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:45,060
say okay it's roughly the same I have
one finger I want you to to leave this

129
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:50,300
room with its that there is one major
difference in the world of pen testing

130
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:56,469
and that is application security it's
not now boasting or anything but I've

131
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:02,410
seen a lot of stuff there are a lot of
good infrastructure investors it is a

132
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:07,139
commoditized world and I'm not saying
it's simple but it's it's something that

133
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:08,230
you learn more

134
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:13,970
with more ease application security is
hard it's hard because not all

135
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:19,199
applications are born equal whereas
infrastructures they are kind of warning

136
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:24,130
they are a subset of giant companies
that have just put you know their

137
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:29,500
devices on the organization and you have
structured it so recommendations that

138
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:35,120
will most likely provide me and any
other company in the world would most

139
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,120
likely be very similar application
security on the other hand is completely

140
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,170
different

141
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:45,689
it's up to the developer to develop the
application now I mean to the art of

142
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:52,079
dismantling this giant thing break it
and understand why it broke and once I

143
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,099
understood why it broke I need to
understand how to fix it

144
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:00,800
just think of a process that is just
almost sometimes insurmountable how do

145
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,099
you do that how do you have a person
which is not mostly a developer because

146
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,490
and this result tend to be developers
they have some understanding development

147
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,779
but they're not developers are supposed
to understand how to reverse it how to

148
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:18,389
break it and then how to fix it would
have prevented them because sometimes

149
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:21,120
you just get into somewhere and you
don't really know what happened

150
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,279
your injury in the system but you have
no idea what happened in the back and

151
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:29,380
you know a lot of fun of blind
injections that you supposedly know what

152
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,370
you've done but you're not a hundred
percent sure so please keep that in mind

153
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:38,449
will you know if your service consumer
service provider always think of

154
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:41,540
application security just a bit
different

155
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:51,540
Lee ok now we'll talk about why is there
such a difference between us and the

156
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:57,279
client so you know he's funny pictures
where you see what do I think I do what

157
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,899
the white parents think I do what my
friends think that is that that is the

158
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:05,980
equivalent in a way so when do we
normally want to get called

159
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:11,430
attendance round or a manager group of
competitors when would I like to be

160
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:16,930
called versus when do I really get
called ok so wanted to share the first

161
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:21,800
things that we normally get called off
of one US plant has a specific

162
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,819
application and he wants us to test
specifically that application that or a

163
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:32,969
five or ten or twenty of specific
applications of a specific group whereas

164
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:40,310
we normally want to be a strategic
decision we want to go with you guys all

165
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:46,099
the time that we test these kinds of
applications subgroups language wise

166
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,060
whatever you decide you make your own
decision or not involved in that

167
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,750
decision but don't call me because you
just want a pen testing company is just

168
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,829
not good practice and we'll talk about
it and in a few minutes why isn't it

169
00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:00,829
really good practice to do these kind of
things

170
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:08,870
post breach something happened and you
need to do something then testing is

171
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:15,130
usually something it's not that we don't
like it we understand the reality but

172
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:19,699
you know what he wants to get called
after somebody somebody missed something

173
00:14:19,699 --> 00:14:25,389
and then you're supposed to clean
something that actually cleaning so we

174
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:29,709
don't like it we get called we
understand it but it's something to do

175
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:32,810
need to think about as well am I saying
to stop this no

176
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:37,380
keep calling us but under standards
probably trying trying to do something

177
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:42,550
beforehand will help you better you know
seeing it before is something that is

178
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:51,900
well known and something that is very
very specific aus cyber sorry the board

179
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:58,029
has started talking about cyber so the
SEC has a lot of regulations out a lot

180
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:05,960
to that have stirred a lot of debates
we've been boards of companies so board

181
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,270
members don't really you know they're
not exactly technical people but they

182
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:13,420
want to understand what is it that we're
doing about cyber

183
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,930
we're not exactly sure about cyber but
we know we need to do something about it

184
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:21,430
then testing is one of the things that
we probably would like to do something

185
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,989
about it because if you'll start to
explain the SDLC process to a board

186
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:32,070
member it is just impossible but if you
say we have hackers that are working for

187
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:36,620
us and return to penetrate or break our
systems you don't need to have a

188
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,339
computer science degree you understand
that so it's a it's a good thing as a

189
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:46,710
board member you can understand that we
like it you know just like calling a

190
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:51,620
normal chef which is specifically a
pastry chef you just call him a chef

191
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:57,270
yeah we do cyber that's that's true
nobody likes the fact that you're

192
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:04,329
calling us for this specific reason but
table come it's ok you're trying to do

193
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:09,250
something new or when I say do something
new you're trying to go into the cloud

194
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,720
or you just basically found out that
your whole companies in the cloud and

195
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,690
you just want us to understand what
exactly is the clown can we break the

196
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:23,180
cloud and can we get it over to you
again not bad but it's just not a

197
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,829
strategic decision it's not that you
have decided to its probably you found

198
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:34,850
out that you have done so we also want
to get in we want to get in when you

199
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,170
know the process that is behind the
problem

200
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:42,279
you understand the business will talk
about what is understanding the business

201
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:47,470
what are the risks that you're actually
facing and what is it that you really

202
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:52,220
want to test surprisingly some snow and
you know that's the way the world works

203
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:57,639
now so we look when we look at the
challenge we have a much simpler

204
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:03,040
challenge as apprentice we just cared
that we have the right people with the

205
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:09,819
right skill set that the timing fits the
budget ok we have the right testers at

206
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:14,760
the right time with the right skills and
red budget from the client very simple

207
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:20,750
in a way very very simple because it has
a lot more challenges so you know I'm

208
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,179
not saying the whole problem is with us
or with the client

209
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:30,690
equal and that brian has no business to
business concerns he's not really mostly

210
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:34,610
responsible for the things we're testing
and we are aware of that so when you

211
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,820
think you're coming into a company
you're saying hey bring me all your

212
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:44,629
stuff that client does not really know
or not always knows what is all the

213
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:49,679
stuff that you're asking its not under
his responsibility he has his own

214
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,669
leadership that needs to be able to tell
him what to do and then what he

215
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:58,820
understands what he needs to do and he
needs to balance these things we

216
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,389
normally don't have that challenge we're
just told

217
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:06,169
going help serve this point we sometimes
we have extra challenges but you know

218
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:10,940
not that much and then of course there's
the timing you remember the fact that

219
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,540
it's not his own application it's not
his own infrastructure it someone else

220
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,510
he needs to coordinate so we understand
that sometimes these people are very

221
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:24,809
technical people and they become
miniature project managers which they

222
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:30,129
don't really like which nobody really
likes so it's a challenge on their own

223
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:35,250
moreover they need to balance the need
to we really need to use them that much

224
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,429
it's a cost benefit kind of thing

225
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:39,250
ok

226
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:47,170
that's what needs to manage that just as
much knowledge move on to what I call

227
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:52,720
client interactions so the reason why a
one on one of the things that got me

228
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,950
thinking about this is that anyone we
have workshops to understand the

229
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,910
client's so I was thinking you know
let's talk with 10 testers one or two

230
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:06,440
challenges as Penn testers and that's
not it has nothing to do with why it's

231
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,290
just everybody is that is in in the
business can understand that they said

232
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:16,860
let's mark up a few interactions that we
know that it's a bad projector we know

233
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:24,870
that decline has or we have let's try to
analyze them so the first thing black

234
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:31,429
boxing you so as you know you know you
can either black or white box

235
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:40,120
apprenticed not knowing knowing
something knowing everything ideally or

236
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,439
ideally for every client when you offer
him up the options he says yes let's go

237
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,990
with black box or I want to know how
attackers will approach this which is

238
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,060
which is right

239
00:19:54,060 --> 00:20:00,510
ok but then I don't exactly have the
budget for it so let's try and put a

240
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:09,170
black box approach you know kind of a
grey box budget so have a lot of

241
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:14,170
problems with it cuz you're saying okay
but we really need to be able to spend

242
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:20,170
more time on the reconnaissance cards we
don't really know what is it that you

243
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:24,420
want us to get you know we don't really
know the infrastructure we don't know a

244
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:31,370
lot we don't know anything at all never
mainframe main thing is that black

245
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:36,929
boxing works in very specific manners
and one might what do I mean you

246
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:42,200
remember when I said that we can get
called for DA one office that one

247
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,030
application we're testing well

248
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:52,070
it's very hard to do but punk scene on a
single application you don't really know

249
00:20:52,070 --> 00:21:00,070
what is it that you're specifically
testing ok that's why rent team is a

250
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:04,810
great way to do a black box is in red
team you don't know a lot about your

251
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:09,540
organization ok you just told hey this
is me

252
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:14,870
client name going get the stuff that's
ok we can work black box but if you're

253
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,429
saying hey this is me

254
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:22,050
client name I have a specific
application under my ASAP model that I

255
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:26,440
want you to attack specifically I will
not tell you anything about it go and

256
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,380
attack that one that's kinda heart that
I wouldn't say hard but it does not fit

257
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:37,120
reality because the real attacker does
not really say I've known you for many

258
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,919
years from the media I know you have an
assay system I want to go into this

259
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:47,900
specific models and I don't want to know
anything else it's doesn't work like

260
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,880
that

261
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:55,130
attackers don't really do that that's a
time when we talk about great boxing we

262
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,700
have the challenge you have the
challenge

263
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:03,070
probably fuel reveal more it is you know
the middle ground in which we will meet

264
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:08,730
its not a one answer fits all I'm not
saying that everything needs to be gray

265
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:14,000
box but it's it's it's kind of our
mistake as an industry along the time

266
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,710
that we don't always customize the
options to the right environment because

267
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,750
you know we start to have a discussion
of the client new talent hey how do you

268
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:29,220
want to go at it and he says what do you
mean and you know nobody wants to have a

269
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,800
silent conversation and you say you want
a black marks are trademarks or a white

270
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,490
box because that's your script that
you're used to say that sounds really

271
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:44,550
good and then you go with the flow but
you have to justice just as we

272
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:49,060
understand that client understands that
will will understand that as we go along

273
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,940
again not one to rule them all but

274
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,940
we have to find a middle ground here

275
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:03,899
second what do we test its like dat I
think it's the second or even the first

276
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:09,210
thing that we do it and the development
environment is a good development

277
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:15,360
environment where we normally doing that
or or down you know once you say ok

278
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,179
let's get a production environment then
declines as well

279
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:22,230
carefully my brick by brick see no I
don't really have a responsibility over

280
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:27,870
who's but you're asking us to tested so
it's our responsibility so we don't

281
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:35,250
really know so we get a lot of you know
we can test you can test the production

282
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:38,650
so that you can put you can test
development but in real production

283
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:42,120
environment it's kind of different

284
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:47,889
hey look it's kind of different then it
would be a kind of different attack in

285
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:53,850
the real world and what will all report
say you know we want to test just that

286
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:58,310
or do you want us to terrestrial
environment and I wouldn't say that

287
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:04,770
there is a good answer or a one answer
is again an interaction between human

288
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:08,400
beings there's never you know no one
answer and every company is very

289
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,060
different but I would say that if you
have a staging environment which is

290
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,940
normally the environment where you roll
outdoor stuff before it goes into

291
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:23,770
production that's a good environment to
start with not a lot of company have

292
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:28,120
staged a lot of companies have staging
environments so you still have to make

293
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:35,639
that specific wise decision was forcibly
environment do you want to test but

294
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,970
please be cognizant of the fact that you
need to think of this before you even

295
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:46,460
talk to a pen tester before you start to
talk to us to realize we will you be

296
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:52,660
testing this because and Penn tests
things break we break stuff that's what

297
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:57,350
you're paying us for please be aware of
that just think about it you know even

298
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:02,428
ten minutes before you give us a call
you'll have that answer instead of just

299
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:10,820
coming up with it during our call and
everything I want you guys to tested for

300
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:16,668
big question mark what exactly is it
that you're wanting us to test so can

301
00:25:16,669 --> 00:25:21,090
you give us like this and are you can
you guys give us the scenario that you

302
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:26,240
guys want to attack your declined please
tell us what is it that you want us to

303
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,779
do i mean we will attack but attack is
very broad let's talk about the

304
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:35,809
processes what is the specific process
that you want us to find or to

305
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:38,340
manipulate things of that sort

306
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:46,879
clients would specifically know what to
tell you so you have to be very specific

307
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:52,649
on how exactly you got the findings that
you got where you think it's something

308
00:25:52,649 --> 00:25:57,739
that a client will be very much aware of
and we'll know you know what is the

309
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:03,259
specific issue but sometimes you just
don't think about it because you think

310
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:08,169
of an application as an application and
not as an application that i truly

311
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:12,769
supports a process you know we tend to
be technical people we just think of

312
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:17,570
what is the infrastructure that is lying
on what is a specific development

313
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:22,809
language that was written on who who
develops did you know who's the team to

314
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:24,519
support things of that sort

315
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:31,490
wherever we don't really think of the
business 'cause what is it doing like if

316
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:36,230
an attacker would want to do something
what would it look like cause I'm not

317
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,830
talking about the possibilities here
we're talking about the logical the

318
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:44,610
logical flaw that will make that one
ability something great that will make

319
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:52,889
it and turn it into an actual risk or a
threat to the company so maybe because

320
00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:57,969
you know I come from a company does a
lot of risk management we tend to

321
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:03,460
sometimes were operational risks guys so
if you don't know who are the

322
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:09,570
operational risk within your company
they're not you know the most

323
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:12,230
interesting people most likely find

324
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:18,870
but they are Penta stirs and fought but
they never no danger of they've never

325
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:22,949
heard of the fact that there is the
thing called dentist thing so what do I

326
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:27,929
mean so you have people within companies
that try to understand what are the

327
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:34,110
business processes that each and every
main process and your company supports

328
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:39,049
they would go on map the supply chain
who are you reliant on what are the

329
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:43,160
processes that are built within that
suppose supply chain how do you support

330
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,830
it they would go into your business
applications you know your bank they

331
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:52,918
would go in and map out the every
processes that human being to the teller

332
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:58,900
you know works on and supports what they
don't a lot of times do they don't go

333
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,340
into the application specifically but
sometimes they mentioned the

334
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,299
applications so you could see with
Hannah banking environment of financial

335
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:11,799
environment these specific operational
risk guys describing a specific

336
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:18,080
application and what usages or misuse
the jurors would the employee or a

337
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,000
client of the company make you so and
what will the risk will be there will be

338
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,030
in a result of that this usage so it is
a very good practice just to take these

339
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:36,210
specific these specific people have a
sit down and explain to them about the

340
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:41,669
process that you're specifically
performing and just say hey you know I'm

341
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:48,460
testing this app I want you to tell me
what can go wrong with this app and they

342
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:53,780
would just tell you you know you can do
this this this and that take this data

343
00:28:53,780 --> 00:29:00,870
go to pen tester I want you to simulate
these following scenarios when you have

344
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:06,399
that you really need to have a pen
tester was an apprentice Rigo ok now I

345
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,120
understand what is it that I need to
break it how do I need to break it

346
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,309
exactly because just finding an exercise
is not exactly you know what what he

347
00:29:14,309 --> 00:29:15,330
gets up to

348
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:19,178
he wants to he wants to be able to break
the system in a way that you know the

349
00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:20,280
client will understand

350
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:24,450
that it's really broken look at the
business process flows under needs to

351
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:31,580
start with these people which leads me
to you to our last interaction which is

352
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:39,429
I want you guys to find it all
everything is very very very broad

353
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:46,490
statement what is everything you want us
to find who can do what the French

354
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:51,280
actors you want us to find something
that you could have found in an

355
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:57,639
automated tools as well or what is the
track that you do you want to do so

356
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:04,500
first of all like I said separate the
logical flaws from the actual

357
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,920
vulnerabilities for a logical flaw they
have still not invented the software

358
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,810
that could find it you need an actual
human being to understand there is logic

359
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:19,129
behind this specific process and I can
break it by doing this for a

360
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:26,000
vulnerability to find a Nexus S you can
use a tool as Penn testers or as well

361
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,370
where to well-informed Penn testers we
will not be afraid of those tools I am

362
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:36,620
Not Afraid from today that the four
defies of this world would replace us

363
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:42,679
okay because everybody using automation
needs to know how to use automation

364
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:49,960
automation does and what it doesn't do
human beings will always a way be able

365
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:55,490
to fill down what doesn't it do so as
clients don't be afraid of using it

366
00:30:56,050 --> 00:31:00,930
don't think of it as something that is
misuse of our time and spent astor's

367
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:05,040
don't think that once client will start
get you know start to do this things

368
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:10,970
you're a professional will disappear it
will never be the case or not the least

369
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:18,150
the next three years before Fred
assessment please understand who can do

370
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,350
what

371
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,149
ok

372
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:25,650
it's not a friend telogen stock I can do
I can give intelligence talks as an ex

373
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:30,740
intelligence officer but please be
cognizant of who can fret new

374
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:37,660
application level attacks have very very
few sorry very many levels that you just

375
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:42,500
need to classify and who is irrelevant
threat to you could come specifically

376
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:47,360
within the framework of the code that
your developers are developing or can be

377
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,879
just you know the most superficial
application vulnerability or even in

378
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,250
infrastructure of one ability kind of
assessment so please be aware of who's

379
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:02,650
attacking you and dental depends esters
you know we're afraid of a nation state

380
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:08,350
so you'll see the Pentastar in a
paranoid ok what is a nation state

381
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:11,350
capability and he'll start reversing
everything in your environment

382
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:18,960
last thing that's have three minute SQL
injections coming from a specific

383
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:25,260
application that is by a specific team
you have a training problem here so take

384
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,879
that information

385
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,880
translate what we give you our report
into metrics whatever metrics that you

386
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,880
can its training its quality of
development take it and built it into

387
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,160
something better something bigger

388
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:45,220
that's the only stuff that I have the
main issues that I always see coming up

389
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:51,560
from ten tests and thats these are the I
think words of wisdom that I could help

390
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:58,669
you with so that if you have any
questions I'd love to have to answer

391
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:01,670
them

392
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:15,700
it seems that sometimes business and not
on the same page do you think it's a

393
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,630
kind of a lack of knowledge on business
understanding I T security in whatever

394
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:25,480
or is it like to testers to business and
cannot talk in a language that they

395
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,110
understand what actually about I think
it's a it's a very healthy or unhealthy

396
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:35,860
mix of both you have Pentastar is that
think that they're above the business we

397
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,969
can break everything there for a weekend

398
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:42,410
you know we know everything but you know
it's it's a very juvenile way of thought

399
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:47,090
you know because if you're from your own
business you know the business best soap

400
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:52,209
industry can tell you that Nexus S is a
persistent one and it's you know finding

401
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:58,010
a persistent one like the worst kind of
thing but you was a business no hey this

402
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:02,520
is not even in my client facing kind of
web page is not part of my business

403
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:07,100
process it's very bad as a vulnerability
but it's not that bad for business

404
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,790
so as the

405
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:14,389
if you're coming from from like the
client-side you need to make that

406
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:20,089
consideration because 10 testers job in
a way is to be the most dramatic person

407
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:26,730
I found this most amazing thing you need
to be the one leveling out and saying

408
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:31,370
okay why you think it's the most amazing
thing so it's not the bomb is now but

409
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:44,139
you know just to be able to bring us
down to realities problem with my

410
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:47,139
client's forensics

411
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:55,569
not so much a bit late but raised in
forensics they want to know who is the

412
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:58,030
guy who didn't

413
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:06,140
locked the computer when you make social
engineering or did who is a guy who

414
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,098
forgot

415
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:18,009
bad mood for who is a guy who didn't
want to fire him I want but I don't want

416
00:35:18,009 --> 00:35:20,880
approved guy

417
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:27,650
be fired just because the day I was here
didn't like his computer maybe just need

418
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:30,610
training and not

419
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:40,890
fire so what about ethics what is your
opinion on this second question when I

420
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:50,400
go back to clients after after audits
they make so we will put this project we

421
00:35:50,400 --> 00:36:00,270
will do these actions we six months
after you come back and nothing is did

422
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:08,130
you saw in companies you your testing
same vulnerabilities years and years

423
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:17,000
after her first in each of his number in
our report one of the things that we

424
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,260
have that a lot of times just repeat
themselves as strategic recommendations

425
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:28,180
the strategic recommendations do not
normally specifically you know mean that

426
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:32,950
there were written specifically for you
but they're good practice training is

427
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:38,160
always a strategic strategic
recommendations so when you tell

428
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:43,149
companies hey guys we just need to train
your people don't fire ok just train

429
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:47,840
them to be better that's why that's when
we have the situation with you know we

430
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,770
we need to tailgate our way in I don't
think that you know nowadays clients

431
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:57,310
don't even ask who is the one that you
tailgate or a don't even go to the CCTV

432
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:00,650
and say hey you followed is the fire
this guy

433
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:06,100
hey you social engineered this guy we
had we had an assessment of social

434
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:12,890
engineering assessment that we were
hired by the CEO it was a spear phishing

435
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:19,490
attack and we launched twenty five
different emails and the CEO fell

436
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:20,220
through

437
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:28,049
spear phishing campaign itself and it
was like a bonus program so who doesn't

438
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:32,339
like you know it might be spearfishing
but then I will not get my bonus come on

439
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:40,190
so and he obviously did not leave his
job so people are I think that the

440
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:44,460
mentality of firing people because they
have done these kind of things is is

441
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:52,619
going away because we know that at least
in the you s going away the only person

442
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:57,079
that might get fired sometimes is the
the season

443
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:02,180
French security officer something really
happen and I think that's why you know

444
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:05,629
we're going towards a culture where
you're the chief so because you're in a

445
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:11,670
chief you go when something happened but
the other people they just remain that's

446
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:14,670
what the second one was

447
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:27,610
repeat yeah yeah yeah yeah so we see
that as well we see that when third

448
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:31,500
parties are involved sometimes lines you
know they know that there's a problem

449
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,320
but they're not the ones that have the
ability to fix them

450
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:41,390
the world is moving towards contractual
agreements that say that we are allowed

451
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:46,790
to test your your systems and if we find
something you are responsible for fixing

452
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:51,470
it if not we will not be able to work
with us and things of that sort it's

453
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,540
changing

454
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:58,110
don't have that smaller clients ok we'll
still have these problems and we will

455
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:01,110
still see these issues coming up again

456
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:11,200
any other questions thank you guys
