1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
dog is about fifty years of web
application firewall I suppose everyone

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:16,779
knows about five or so but this is also
what we already know about wife has over

3
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:24,519
2,000 words I think no need to explain
these pictures so look at the expression

4
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:33,140
it's a million dollar expressions
basically so this is what we already

5
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:40,969
know about the Barracuda they are
150,000 customers around the world

6
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:51,149
including Department of Justice yes army
all automotive giant so they have this

7
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,520
$150,000 50,000 organization is
basically a link you can go there and

8
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,210
you can look at the list of their
customers to all the big names are the

9
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:10,030
according to Gartner Magic their place
Barracuda here among the challenges

10
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:16,070
category the leader they consider it
simple and here we have adequate that is

11
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:24,649
continuously challenging Imperva so some
facts about Parkwood about rough or in

12
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:33,369
this particular case para cuidar so from
August to 24th of me almost 10 months

13
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:40,229
they have seven updates of their attack
definitions defied attack definitions

14
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:45,039
that are stopping the text in particular
cross-site scripting and they have

15
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,299
nothing related to cross site scripting
so during these tenements the updates

16
00:01:50,299 --> 00:02:00,390
but have nothing there was safe from
that and meanwhile I joined it's our own

17
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:11,510
company for and if you remember the
dates from August 24th of me

18
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:19,879
10 months seven abuse went from Sharon
cross-site scripting I join in March two

19
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:28,649
months from academia for me industries
and you experience so from 25th me to to

20
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,140
date they are five objects of the attack
definitions related to capacity

21
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:42,328
scripting and there is a real patch also
has been announced just last week so in

22
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:48,709
six months five updates and 100 patch I
know now I work for Hyundai and Kia it's

23
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:53,940
not easy to make an update I am telling
you the secret is not easy to object

24
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:59,670
hunting in a big organization so how to
identify para cuidar for example if you

25
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,388
are testing some website in how you will
see that the site is using Barracuda

26
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:10,840
this message the specified URL if you
see this message

27
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,099
believe they are using barcode

28
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:19,310
the problem is that no one has the time
to change this default message or defied

29
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:25,060
Arab each everyone is using it
interesting thing is that by itself on

30
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:32,210
their own website is using this message
so and we are also using this message so

31
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:38,000
has it in regular expressions for me to
provide books I have the regular

32
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,860
expressions in front of me so they have
specials and they are categorized into

33
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:49,670
21 called they call it a cross-site
scripting strict five regular expression

34
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:55,119
and when they going to cross any
scripting simple and 13 will now

35
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,799
previous total was eleven five months
ago the quarter was 11 in this category

36
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:05,560
but now 13 they have added two new
regular expressions I will not expose

37
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,550
these internal regular expressions sorry
I know the regular expressions but I

38
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:14,350
promised them that I will not expose it
but no problem I will tell them I will

39
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:19,399
talk in terms of metadata if you
remember this initial slide amazing

40
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:27,310
slide just read any of the point they
move on tax service at 2:24 a.m. and

41
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,310
spoke for eighty minutes but they don't
know what you're talking about

42
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,590
it's simply sit so let the fun begin

43
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:44,429
I tested all these regular expressions
one-by-one and found weaknesses and this

44
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:50,360
is this research last was running since
last six months I'm working with them so

45
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:57,510
that at least we can raise the bar for
the DECA I call it bypasses particle

46
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:08,800
called it functional deficiencies so
let's start with even had lobbyists

47
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,800
shades of Barracuda

48
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:26,630
initially when you were going to use an
even-handed but they have for regular

49
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:31,969
expressions they call it even preference
on reference miscellaneous 21 so

50
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,480
six months ago this sign was not there

51
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:43,370
updated updated of getting all this even
update because of me so and what's the

52
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:50,360
current situation so this is how a
stock's if you look at the date on 19th

53
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,840
April I do to the spektr details on
dogle this was the first bypass of water

54
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,390
because this on Google even handler was
not part of the list so it's a she will

55
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:09,860
find miss the next bypasses basically
I'm using even had looked all on search

56
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,900
again on the same day a six-month are
going to do this about the sector to

57
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:20,250
these both bypasses barracuda and then I
found a list of missing handlers is easy

58
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:27,630
to find this list of this because what I
can see they have the most comprehensive

59
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:33,690
list in order to find what is missing I
have to read the specs I have to read

60
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:37,820
articles here and there and then I came
up with this list so these are the 10700

61
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:43,900
were missing a debt I but the next thing
that you guys will be thinking about

62
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:52,109
using hardcoded list of you come on and
you are using a hot political

63
00:06:53,420 --> 00:07:02,880
almost how you will keep track of all
these new even impossible but i couldnt

64
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:12,030
reply because of logging and tracking
using disheartened even heard is my

65
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,469
suggested them please

66
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:24,440
genetic we are you only looking at on
let's start with the phone and the good

67
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,910
thing is that the listen and they have
added a new regular expression is called

68
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:37,680
on even references miscellaneous generic
now this is in place it's looks at porn

69
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,330
and then static so

70
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:52,349
bypasses if let's see if they have an
honor in the list can you still buy

71
00:07:52,349 --> 00:08:36,390
posit yes but only for the next thing I
got was culprit they the regular

72
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:42,338
expression thinks that if they even then
there will be definitely is equal to and

73
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:47,820
then they have a dot in the regulation
and administration dot means every

74
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:54,480
character except new line this is where
the bypass comes for the browser is OK

75
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:12,180
is equal to the next line bypasses
basically Barracuda lets you want black

76
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,180
businesses of park with us

77
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:57,380
that they're treating matter in a
different way I don't know the reason

78
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,490
why they're treating matter then they
will be space and then they will be

79
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:09,320
discovered at evaluation or content to
this is where the bypass comes they are

80
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,199
doing is special treatment matter in
this special treatment of metal loops to

81
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:22,380
bypass that if I will use / or its
before I will use I D or I can use any

82
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:30,439
space alternate characters they all will
bypass the regular expression so they

83
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:37,040
have a recollection opening and closing
tax and Barbuda calls them opening and

84
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:46,010
closing ischemic attack the purpose to
stop arbitrary action I have it looks

85
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:55,399
like that is just there will be a taboo
in the tag name will have at most ten

86
00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:57,480
directors

87
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:05,120
assumption ideas assuming that the tag
name will be 10 characters ok what about

88
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,790
Matt

89
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:17,370
script it has 13 characters bypasses now
they change it and now they're looking

90
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,920
at 32 characters if you will find
something that has a length of period

91
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,979
integrated you can bypass it next thing
there are you human

92
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,810
alphabetic like that

93
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:45,490
oil spills that starts with like percent
multi-line comment

94
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:54,690
all day passes direction now they have
added support for it also also closing

95
00:11:54,690 --> 00:12:00,320
estimate that it does use that are
attractive will properly closed angle

96
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:08,690
bracket this greater than sign but what
about half BlueStacks like that there is

97
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:15,910
no time closing time for the brothers
perfectly bypassed the regular

98
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:20,810
expressions now everything is fixed but
I'm telling you it has been fixed up

99
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:35,420
dedicated expression they call it even
better you're a scheme and because of

100
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:41,099
media sorry has been updated three times
and this is a very good journey of this

101
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:53,500
initial version I reported a bypass the
add more complexity when I rebooted and

102
00:12:53,500 --> 00:13:01,650
other bypassed the complexity and then
now the settle down very simple was it

103
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,530
means that adding complexity simply does
not work

104
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:10,140
simple version may work so these are the
different factors that was able to

105
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:17,180
bypass the body at that time now they
are you doing good musical right now I'm

106
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,550
using the online version slides are
already online so they are available I

107
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,439
will tell you the link next

108
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:32,380
when I was passing by passing this that
are you are right I am using this html5

109
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,700
character references like and Colin
Barracuda realizes ok I am going to use

110
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:46,530
another references and then they have
added this new re 11:00 an alternate to

111
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:50,850
they have added a new re a few million
Chara France's here you can see

112
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:57,410
everything new line call and they have
added on a regular expression is not

113
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:02,730
doing good but in combination with other
regular expression actually what I seen

114
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:08,010
the vile we are using we are also using
barcode up our B&B properties are behind

115
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:14,450
bars in real life you're not using all
these regular expressions normally have

116
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:19,300
to create an exception in the world
because of the false-positive sometime

117
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:26,819
developer limousine fixing it you said
ok we have at least one but then things

118
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:31,320
are not working for me then we create an
exception exception means that the party

119
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:37,480
is a part of life but you're not using
it so that's why I'm saying that this

120
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:44,440
regulation is doing good but in
combination with all other parties style

121
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:50,140
based bypasses of Barracuda dedicated
regular expressions they call it taxes

122
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:55,760
title and URL references that tries to
stop she suspicious JavaScript execution

123
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:02,540
this regular expression they call it
exercise diet eBook has been updated

124
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:08,599
twice at the end of day I will show you
know it's getting better insecurity but

125
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:16,520
right now it's causing very false
positive with a gun but just to give an

126
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:22,990
idea previously they were looking at the
world expression strange they were

127
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:29,230
expression was a part of style attribute
that ok well we'll stop it now they're

128
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,240
not looking at the expression anymore

129
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,880
these are some of the bypasses for
example they were looking at expression

130
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:42,850
I used escaping back / this sounds
perfectly okay it works here are used

131
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,230
they were expecting this parent pieces
after the word expression I used

132
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:54,000
escaping form of parents in the next
case they were here I use the decimal

133
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,440
included form so these are all the
variations that were able to bypass the

134
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,240
regular expressions so the county state
right now as I'm docking speaker instead

135
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,660
of the regular expression

136
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:17,000
style color their body will capture it
as a malicious thing so they defeated

137
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,839
twice to stop JavaScript but now it's
causing a lot of false positive this

138
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:29,660
harmless pillow is captured as a
malicious right now they have another

139
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:35,060
regular expression that tries to stop
JavaScript execution if someone will use

140
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:41,010
backgroung URL or background type the
URL he will use some evil URL so they

141
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:50,380
have a hardwood URL instead of having
what I used if you will see here

142
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:57,920
background colin is turned off and I am
using the backs less 72 for our index

143
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,360
less 64 bit simply bypasses the regular
expression and the recent firmware past

144
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,990
it has been announced just a week ago I
haven't tested it yet but I heard from

145
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:13,809
them that it fixes this issue so

146
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:21,648
bypassing bob is cool but what about if
you will bypass waffle on the respective

147
00:17:21,648 --> 00:17:29,209
vendor's website operators and providing
a wife isn't it would be awesome if I

148
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:37,620
will be passed on their own website easy
the first then I have to bypass the

149
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:52,508
regular expression so he's a bypass on
the main login Barracuda double style is

150
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:56,289
good with all an expression because they
were looking parent is after the word

151
00:17:56,289 --> 00:18:02,690
expression I use the escape form of
small pieces and this bypasses Barracuda

152
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:11,059
mean website the website is looking so
they fix it because of the reason now

153
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:15,980
developer is basically including style
this was an injection in the middle

154
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,490
attribute

155
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:22,360
parties including this double court also
and at the same time they have updated

156
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:28,719
their aggression out his capture but it
works at that time but I'm not stopping

157
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:36,279
here first bypassing the regular
expression then bypassing the definition

158
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:39,950
of their website but they have an admin
interface also we are using the admin

159
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,860
interface ok how is it possible that
they read more in recent days work

160
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:49,619
success in the Admin buffets at one
point they asked us to change the

161
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:55,539
background color they allow us okay
let's give us another URL if you want to

162
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:59,899
see the admin interface having a funny
background picture somewhere you can

163
00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:01,739
change it by this option

164
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,440
ok let's do it but at the time the
problem was that they were not allowing

165
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:13,789
Javascript or they were forcing me to
use an HTTP or HTTPS URL ok let's use

166
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:19,980
this issue but after the question mark I
use W to 44 them it's ok we have an

167
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,220
issue with what

168
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:27,210
courts will break their context and then
almost over will simply works and this

169
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:32,260
is a story access on every page of
particular interest every page has

170
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:40,049
simply browsing it in this occurs
because of this background image so this

171
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:44,280
election here you see for them they
treated at rest here and then because

172
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,620
they were using double court is a court
break the connection then almost over

173
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:53,959
simply works so they can pay for the
regarding marquai's that please if

174
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,500
someone or if someone you know is using
Barracuda please make sure that right

175
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:03,750
are you should use this version 1.1 I am
Telling You this is not easy for the not

176
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:09,549
easy to update and the former better
also very difficult because attack

177
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:15,418
definition does not require a reboot
from their patch requires a reboot if in

178
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:23,240
a big organization something that
requires a reboot forget about it it's

179
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:31,500
not possible but if you think you are
good you have your own library of course

180
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,330
I skipping Barracuda gives you stretched
hostility to use your own regular

181
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:42,010
expression you can customize it is
something good they're offering it next

182
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:50,460
article has a big fish and other one
consequence they call it cloud proxy for

183
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:56,299
details given the time I will refer to
my doc someone's spin the signs are

184
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:59,379
there but I would like to summarize it

185
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:08,470
security is a cloud-based wife and this
is very good for small businesses they

186
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,620
think that something is better than
nothing

187
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:16,449
ok let's at least it will provide some
protection and if you look at the rate

188
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:23,650
its just $9 parliament you have a
production costs only $9

189
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:39,470
these are costs $10 $15 $10 cheaper
better to go for it and the good thing

190
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:40,350
about security

191
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:47,350
this is a very popular use maybe you saw
it here and there I participated in the

192
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:54,350
context of one vendor learned everything
he will million and all I go to fucking

193
00:21:54,350 --> 00:22:01,230
issue but know this sounds this is not
true in case of security goes for

194
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:08,149
everybody passed for me it was an
exercise it was an exercise so I am

195
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:18,418
playing cat and mouse with them i bypass
the fixed by possible so the bypass is

196
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:23,289
simply actually this is not rocket
science and just the only thing is to

197
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:27,740
apply the knowledge in a systematic way
you have to find a battery which tags

198
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:35,809
along and which battle in the tag on
that particular in this case as to that

199
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:41,090
ideas are you heading an almost over if
you will use almost over some other

200
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:46,570
things it was working at the time but in
this case it works so here you see they

201
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,299
were I realized that they were using

202
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:55,830
they were basically looking at it would
prompt for proof of concept to hear use

203
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,879
the Unicode encoding form of P

204
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:05,119
bypasses it they are action to hear
other number 3 2009 bypasses like in

205
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:12,199
this case I use their coding forum here
I use tactical gear use escaping here in

206
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,409
order to fool their production as a part
of attribute values greater than so that

207
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:22,129
their production will hear that is
closing but nothing so here I use it

208
00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:27,219
sort of functional use again this story
on most alert its apparent is used

209
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:34,109
tactic so there are a lot of innovations
in this tremendous start then I used

210
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:45,149
input box from VBScript and then a lot
of fun was there and mouse and mouse

211
00:23:45,149 --> 00:23:50,439
move but as I told you for me it was a
paid exercise I was continuously

212
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,669
bypassing them I was reporting them they
were fixing it and

213
00:23:54,509 --> 00:24:01,269
I get from this guy denial said he's the
founder of he replied to me I should

214
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:09,129
know you're almost shoes were patched we
are safe now I said ok we have a

215
00:24:09,129 --> 00:24:15,139
contender readable attribute which means
that now all keyword even will start

216
00:24:15,139 --> 00:24:24,448
working to help you see on keypress for
me some money they're giving money so

217
00:24:24,449 --> 00:24:27,889
and then he said

218
00:24:27,889 --> 00:24:37,629
are blocked your shyness finish okay
let's see something you have a drag on

219
00:24:37,629 --> 00:24:57,359
Jack start on black cat and mouse game
board I made a list of web application

220
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:08,039
filed one at least it should stop script
I just read the script and my goal at

221
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:14,039
that time was to run the script
JavaScript in so many ways but let's go

222
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:20,829
for a script that I tried to irradiation
script access denied script spare source

223
00:25:20,829 --> 00:25:22,339
access tonight

224
00:25:22,339 --> 00:25:29,418
escaped / access denied they were doing
good these regions are blocked but there

225
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:32,419
must be a way I like Prison Break

226
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:42,069
answer they were blocking / but the URL
including former / is percentage to have

227
00:25:42,069 --> 00:25:45,069
it was working and here

228
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:55,939
script source proof of concept alert on
any free domain it was working in their

229
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:03,180
own website so somebody buses including
here what I'm doing

230
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:11,440
they were blocking JavaScript keyword
what I did I use the decimal including

231
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:18,480
former be happy to hear it becomes and
number assignment 16 and because it's a

232
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:26,080
good parameter and becomes the 623 for
the browser it's ok need bypasses it in

233
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,030
a similar way

234
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:38,690
pollen acts including form of colon also
works but this is interesting because I

235
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:46,780
was playing with them I realized that is
not allowing me seven characters after

236
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:52,840
any any one hundred names like on
mouseover after that no they have some

237
00:26:52,840 --> 00:27:04,280
checking their implementation if they
found 1234567 they captured by the alert

238
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:13,260
when has characters can function has 10
characters from the developers are

239
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:27,310
taking at least eight characters
characters and save some money this week

240
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:35,610
I like you are very helpful

241
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:51,830
will be done in like a family but actors
directors three is good for and then

242
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:57,550
name it that limit is 17 bypass

243
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:09,600
what I'm doing here on load is going to
URL is good I i and soon I realized that

244
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:18,350
you don't need name it can be any
alphabet can we can we be it can we see

245
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:29,129
it can really count characters URL 345
they have a check on seven so we have

246
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:39,570
five but next hurdle they were blocking
I think I did all the things I feel good

247
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:43,320
I feel it was good fair enough we have
an all five directors of asking the

248
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:51,178
question but I same tagalog but here we
go with the style the same thing can be

249
00:28:51,179 --> 00:29:00,190
achieved with style and more money for
me at this point so after all these

250
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:05,450
bypasses after playing all this
cat-and-mouse game after fixing

251
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:14,880
everything this payload is still a very
simple be lord this was the first floor

252
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:23,190
that I show you in case you used the
tactic of any attribute right now it's

253
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:32,559
basically so I found this court and I
really like the second always willing to

254
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:39,000
take advantage of an opportunity because
in both cases I join industry industry

255
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,590
give me an opportunity to use Barracuda
let's live it offered me money if you

256
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:49,970
will bypass it will give you money
that's available opportunity don't miss

257
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:56,179
the opportunity to the conclusion would
be you can use while always keeping mine

258
00:29:56,179 --> 00:30:00,620
which would not be the only protection
please fix all your bugs in the

259
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:05,330
application because I am working with
the developers now it is this is the

260
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:09,560
mindset of the developer I'm telling
honestly developer told me I should

261
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:18,190
sometimes we have a half of us I said
please fix it in the application so

262
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:34,470
special thanks goes to her because often
security team they have two separate

263
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:42,590
teams often separated security team is
separate and thanks to you from my side

264
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,590
thanks

265
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:57,909
any question if you have it

266
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:12,990
comment and a question I think the last
thing you set up a su closely I think

267
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:16,880
they are doing good work in like finding
that put our abilities but they always

268
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,679
write in their blog post something like
ok if you have all the publication

269
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,730
pliable you don't need to worry
everything's fine I think that's really

270
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:30,299
a dangerous thing that this web
application firewalls give people the

271
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:37,289
feeling that this is solving your
problem and you don't have to patch I W
