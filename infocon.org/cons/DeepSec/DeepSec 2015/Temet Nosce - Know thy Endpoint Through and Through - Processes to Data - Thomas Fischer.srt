1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,769
good afternoon everybody went to Thomas
I currently working as a researcher for

2
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,980
a company called digital Guardian I've
had 25 plus years and this domain I used

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,630
to be an IR spent a number of years and
I oppositions for large corporations are

4
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,259
also some of you might know me is like
Carly one of the directors for sure

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:34,630
besides London so I've been on a horse
for a number of years over 10 of why we

6
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:40,070
stopped doing endpoint security yes we
have antivirus yes we have tools to do

7
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:45,960
post forensics but we're not really
doing endpoint security we're not trying

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,820
to the Indian Point and gather
intelligence was a lot of intelligence

9
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,280
to the gathering that if you're in the
right place so I'm trying to reenable

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,140
that as a defense mechanism more than
just a post attack mechanism or post

11
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:08,080
attack think one of the things that I've
been working on this is gonna be a

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,030
little bit of exploration what we're
working on is protecting vital havior so

13
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,960
we're moving completely away from the
detection of an EU 54 Shaw footprint but

14
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,158
looking more at the behavior why am i on
this on this kick well if you think

15
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:31,409
about the past 20 years almost a long
time ago we decided to you know who this

16
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:33,509
defense in depth stuff

17
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,520
the fact of the matter is we started
building rings the endpoint failed

18
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,210
miserably first things got in the way

19
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:45,179
stop business processes it didn't really
work doesn't really work and businesses

20
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,470
lost a point and there's free to go back
sweetie invested a lot of money in the

21
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:55,000
preeminent but the world has changed all
businesses change and most of the

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,659
critical assets are actually sitting at
the end points and you can find in the

23
00:01:58,659 --> 00:01:59,729
white however you want

24
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:00,480
mobile phone

25
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:10,759
lentil that stop or even something like
a server just wide haven't was worked

26
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:15,209
think everybody knows this one you know
the magical line I didn't work because

27
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,820
it was incomplete and it didn't take
into account the acceleration of the

28
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:25,459
army technology but does anybody know
this one so that's Hadrian's world

29
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:33,030
between England and Scotland it wasn't
as a security mechanism right it wasn't

30
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,300
built to keep the Scots our courts would
actually jump over the world

31
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,230
these side effect was when they were
raping and pillaging they had so much

32
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,109
stuff to bring back that can get back
over the wall so they were actually

33
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:50,010
trapped inside the environment plus real
the real purpose of this was the show

34
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,010
the status of Rome and I still show the
status of the Roman Empire and today

35
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,370
when we look at the technologies that
we're putting into place to protect

36
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,520
perimeter winter things slightly the
same thing the more technology you put

37
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,760
in the perimeter the more the attackers
a certain other assets behind that wall

38
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:14,179
but also because I really like it was
last year effectiveness in 1545 right so

39
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,950
that's from the physical part I think
from the i-team part we probably lost

40
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,950
effectiveness in the year 2000

41
00:03:40,700 --> 00:04:02,529
in the wrong place we've been relying on
one of those things doing just giving

42
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:08,630
you another picture of the perimeter the
endpoint is still only seen millions of

43
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,680
post its don't like what you're in post
incident you're in too late you know

44
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,260
something's happened on your important
data zexal traded you've lost things

45
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,099
something suspicious in your global dogs
you activate endpoint resolution why

46
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:28,040
can't we be more proactive and actually
bring and point real time and point to

47
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:36,700
tensions back into place so you guys are
you guys ever played on windows

48
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,789
Sysinternals tools specifically the
street stalls but it really cool

49
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:48,760
websites Process Explorer problem on and
TCP view my favorite is actually gives

50
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:56,210
you a world of information what's going
on in your system so we can take a quick

51
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,969
look at it so if you take this is
Process Explorer those who haven't seen

52
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,280
it essentially gives you a view of
what's running on your system but it

53
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,388
gives you actually more than that you
can actually drew into the incidence of

54
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:14,110
you and you can get additional
information like who want which process

55
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,220
launched it what time it was first
launched you can see what network is

56
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,669
doing so much

57
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:25,870
performances using friends so you can
actually see what yeltsin loaded insight

58
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,450
into the process is important because if
you being exported somebody's going to

59
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:36,810
load DLL into it no problem is even more
powerful actually

60
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:45,500
takes a bit of time alone is looking
into the

61
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:14,349
and actually everything even while
you're running basically Explorer every

62
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,280
time you open like a book store window
or anything like that

63
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:24,979
it'll actually create actually go out of
reach files that are in the country

64
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:30,190
directly over now registry keys to be
the values so pleased to see what needs

65
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:36,690
to view all of this information you can
see every process running information

66
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:43,290
like you can actually get a historical
process of you so if you run this and

67
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:50,200
you've got a process of spoons off does
by frys Asian bypass with elation

68
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,719
privileges you actually be able to see
the steps it took to do this privileges

69
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,390
so even if the process killed itself in
the background the process in which

70
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:06,219
states in this in this problem of you
can see when a process will allow for

71
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:14,760
example so that means a very powerful
tool the problem is a very noisy tool as

72
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,390
you can see it's you know there's a lot
of data being generated I mean we've

73
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:23,090
been running it for a few minutes and we
got a hundred fifty thousand immense

74
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,849
right and I'm not running and not really
running anything on this Virtual Machine

75
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:36,909
once you start to understand this you
can actually start bills what we call

76
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:42,159
application DNA so we take those
informational events associated together

77
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,880
on track similar events over time so
that when you looking into the API's the

78
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:53,560
right level so if you're looking to hook
looking into the filesystem you get all

79
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,140
hockey operations far right operations
for weed operations you can start to

80
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,910
build a picture of how an application is
actually doing things so you can

81
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,010
associate a secret of a sequence of
events typically what we look for these

82
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:11,470
things like a five-game red and a
farming written we can convert that into

83
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:17,210
labels fire if you see a far red and
being written to a different location

84
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:22,030
it's like a Save As or removed now how
do you determine whether it's a Save As

85
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:27,959
I remove well can track the renamed as
well because the real name will allow

86
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,510
you to say well this file is being
written by another process into a

87
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:37,500
different name so you can do things like
capture when somebody is doing something

88
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,420
like typing data into a new file or you
can capture it you can use it to capture

89
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,610
things like to see saudis you going to
actually in the important files when I

90
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:50,790
was saw you can actually see that
because you'll see the file open for the

91
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,250
first part where you can hide just and
oversee and going too far weeds and then

92
00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:00,380
the phone right into that opened file
different files in the same process so

93
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,930
we started we can start to build
patterns and we can start to build

94
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:10,400
higher level events than that problem on
actually does so you get to see things

95
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,579
like what you see here which is we can
detect network operations we can detect

96
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:20,450
all rights network operations we can
only answer because we can tell based on

97
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:25,940
if it's during operation that starts
downloading stream of data were actually

98
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,660
doing a network download a file read and
then start to see streams of file of

99
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:36,020
data being uploaded you can determine at
five follow those kind of like this is

100
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:42,079
so its internals asceticism totals on
steroids right now we do you know we're

101
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,660
looking to follow that will also reach
three operations deal activity process

102
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:53,290
data whole of data that we can we can
collect of actually exploding databases

103
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,520
with it

104
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:01,510
so what we're doing is we're looking at
basically real-time friends it if you've

105
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:05,939
worked in forensics typically when you
have an incident you take an image of

106
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:11,510
you in your machine and when you gonna
run to set of tools case or whatever

107
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:18,910
tools and you gonna rebuild a profile of
that incident so you gonna run the

108
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,329
memory seat which processes were running
which till they also rejected you gonna

109
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:28,670
spending and I have to the journal's the
USN journal to see what for whites and

110
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:33,010
greens with done which files were
deleted which follows what had it will

111
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:44,580
like our tool which is basically a super
duper problem we can actually do that in

112
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:50,900
real time so we're actually detecting
those events in real time and we can

113
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,110
look those and we can basically love
does include a footprint

114
00:11:54,630 --> 00:12:04,650
a real-time timeline of events that are
happening so incompetent sample data

115
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:14,400
here so I don't look at first is so I'm
assuming of us up some of you guys

116
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:20,400
watching companies do business with
China Chinese employees and the first

117
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,310
thing those Chinese employees do as well

118
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,000
english isn't my first language so I
need a tool to help me understand

119
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,740
English so they install these tools
those tools are actually really

120
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:34,230
interesting because they are really
important assistance and now really

121
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:42,080
translation assistance then I'll show
you an example of Droid X so I can put

122
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:48,170
it right next time we talked the whole
bunch of date on it and then recently I

123
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:48,829
had a

124
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:54,990
we we've run into a situation where
we're running the tool for a customer

125
00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:01,770
wouldn't talk to the customer and one of
his users went to a site with a news

126
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:09,230
reviews site and they got hit with the
latest Flash 0 day so we can actually

127
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,880
see that what happens after that flash
to a day basically escalates into the

128
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:30,310
into the system so the Chinese software
is so so view is one of the biggest

129
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:36,709
Chinese operators Chinese software
providers they provide set of tools but

130
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:44,240
do bunch of stuff there like the Google
China they provide a Google Drive they

131
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,630
provide online stories that provide a
weekly they provide translation tools

132
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:58,590
they provide I am tools and they provide
endpoint solutions for the users like us

133
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:08,450
to a certain extent but it's not western
Google Google two days so this is the

134
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:18,490
tool why we find it here is because it
was spawned office so office that the

135
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:23,990
two likely when it installs it installed
a bunch of the LLC into office in Figure

136
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,570
ok installed a DLL is gonna stores will
vote now goes even further

137
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:31,990
actually spawns off office so it's it
launches a bunch of some processes

138
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:39,440
office and it actually launches Sgt to
social cloud and keep it clean install

139
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,390
why right

140
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:48,430
but ok so fine so these are to help you
typed invasion Chinese what's new

141
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:54,989
translations but the tool as he can but
we will be seeing is a tool actually

142
00:14:54,990 --> 00:15:03,760
starts to hang out on the network so far
this so you see it starts actually

143
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,780
communicating over the network so first
gonna security profile then it goes to

144
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,189
check for updates if it does if it's
check it has gotten updates actually

145
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:14,850
gonna install the update in the
background but it doesnt download the

146
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,080
conflict ok but it doesn't stop there

147
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,170
just keeps it just keeps going on and on
and on so if you look it will see it

148
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:30,439
will cool down and PC just all of these
network operations happening in the

149
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:36,620
background and it just keeps talking and
talking and talking one of the issues we

150
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,600
have with this is well if you're running
you would document and you've got all

151
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,980
these tools running in the background
you actually done other running in the

152
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:50,600
back room what exactly is sending back
to china specifically to so we're still

153
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,960
working on that point we need we
actually need to hook into the actual

154
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:03,440
words back in data streams and see what
it's actually picking up but we so one

155
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,950
of the things we can do is actually
listed with these IP addresses and all

156
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,850
these DNS names we can start to action
query what they're actually trying to do

157
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:19,080
it just goes on forever and ever it's
like every second is just picking out to

158
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,080
the network

159
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:36,709
so then try X so this is actually
reverse order so here so I can explain a

160
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:41,550
little bit more depth later but
basically this is this is a test user

161
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:58,849
but opened a so what we see here is we
see a fire being copied off outlook and

162
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,920
then Xcel also copy now

163
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:07,980
file this is basically this morning of a
user that working on a on an excel file

164
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:15,940
in Outlook it runs it starts to run a
macro which we see this but this is the

165
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:21,990
Muckross substance to be led by by by
subtle and then it starts to network

166
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:28,840
connection so you see this network
connection we can get the DNS name and

167
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:34,939
I'm not sure this one has the URL
doesn't have the Euro sometimes it

168
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:41,590
sometimes you pick up the URL depending
on the network operation there is so we

169
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:48,230
actually get the URL so you can actually
go back in and from this picture I

170
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:57,870
bought this URL or you can actually go
out and get the original file Excel

171
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:03,479
writing this file and you see what it
actually is actually become File Rename

172
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,840
because it's too far really was 55 AMG
44 which he probably wins seat which we

173
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,250
wouldn't be able to detect if you do
post forensics when you see this movie

174
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:23,000
OST being started written started from
itself from there you actually doing

175
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,310
some network connections there is

176
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:32,820
so the application starts and then you
actually see you get picking out to its

177
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:40,730
command and control and you can we got
the remote port here and there were your

178
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:45,980
honor because it suggested PCB connector
is doing and

179
00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:18,029
this was actually the attachment with a
Word file with well with JavaScript file

180
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:34,429
but it's cold it's cause I cornered
education underscore 05 or 6:10 dot dot

181
00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:38,990
dot Jas and when you look at the
original email it's like really well

182
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:44,919
class Friday basically ran a payment old
bridge now you've been notified to go to

183
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:50,159
court and you know a layman will open
the same see the doc wants him to digest

184
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:52,119
because they have extensions

185
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:56,789
double click on the dog and they don't
see anything happen so they just give up

186
00:19:56,789 --> 00:20:00,490
what was actually happening is w script
runs in the background and goes out and

187
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,490
comes out and goes out and don't get
some stuff

188
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:39,030
so this is the latest Adobe Flash 0 day
so what happened worse it isn't in here

189
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:43,100
because there were some I had to remove
the line where we detected ie going out

190
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:48,540
to a website at the link I was going out
to that was there was information and I

191
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:56,370
didn't show it but the next day but we
still commands show running batch

192
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,520
command when we look at the batch
command is what it looks like

193
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:07,750
appeared so in most cases your network
forensics boxes will pick this up

194
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:13,580
think this encrypted well this command
line up thing is you know it's not very

195
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:18,110
useful because now I have time which one
run in the virtual environment see what

196
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,240
it actually looks like we'll have to
keep it to myself and I'm lazy I got a

197
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,230
whole bunch of other stuff to do well to
be honest since we're capturing

198
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,230
everything anyway

199
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:38,530
anyway but we might have captured the
original command line the final command

200
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:45,300
line and that's what we're seeing up
here so you look at it basically that

201
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:51,639
bat file was actually running script
command with which is back with a yes

202
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,640
which was downloaded as part of the
Adobe

203
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:00,639
0 that's second thing I started
specter's password and then you see

204
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,130
actually going out to this really weird
URL and telling him I it's good it's

205
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:14,650
acting as an Internet Explorer oh after
that what we see his reaction to see

206
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:34,670
them that we can actually going out so
here actually

207
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:16,799
when you're in the right place in terms
of correlation of what you can do and

208
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,658
the amount of additional information
gonna bring to your overall footprint is

209
00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:26,529
incredible it was actually gonna be able
to build a real-time timeline so if you

210
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:31,570
had this information to what you see in
your firewalls and network events you

211
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:36,168
can actually call back to why did this
happen while process was actually

212
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:40,129
responsible for this one of the toughest
part is when you see network activity

213
00:23:40,129 --> 00:23:44,809
don't necessarily know from which
process it was coming from and that's

214
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:54,119
you actually do the full full
investigation so well we we've always

215
00:23:54,119 --> 00:24:02,309
events what we see is that we actually
started to see patterns for me so when

216
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:08,999
you look you basically always seen the
same thing

217
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:16,090
outlook says since 2007 we run this from
2007 away up to 2013 when you

218
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:21,299
double-click on the phone outlook what
it does is he competent a temporary

219
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:26,789
internet files make sure that it's a
temporary internet files makes a copy of

220
00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:33,789
it passes it on to the two Excel Word
Excel copies that into a temporary

221
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:42,059
location as well this is helped us
actually determine a system of behavior

222
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:46,700
so we've raised our application DNA to a
new level where we're saying basically

223
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:54,759
ok so if this sort of event happens we
can now use an attachment off outlook

224
00:24:54,759 --> 00:25:01,350
right so once we start to do that we can
look at what's happening afterwards so

225
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:06,799
in fish so in like in a phishing attack
what we what we can see if we can

226
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,080
actually start to build a behavior tree
so

227
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:17,779
look it's a temporary file the following
into your location or another process

228
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:23,620
all opens it what we can do to is if the
user's does the same as far as a very

229
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:27,529
similar process the fog its temporary
Internet Explorer but then you look at

230
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:32,440
saved into something like download
documents so we can actually that file

231
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:39,640
and memory and say okay if this file was
saved and its attachments are we talking

232
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:46,380
as an attachment further down the line
that follows it opened so we have an

233
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,610
attachment open there's nothing wrong
with user opening an attachment

234
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:55,469
we don't really care where most of these
events and say no this you know it's

235
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:01,580
just an attachment being opened but then
it loads of macro and micro subsystem

236
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:06,699
this is where we get start to get to
active touch with what I'm calling an

237
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,380
active attachment that means the
attachment is intent on doing something

238
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:18,870
it's no longer just a Word file no
longer just a PDF file from that we see

239
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:27,729
the work process or Acrobat process
itself process rights of file or stress

240
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:31,960
doesn't network connection and then
write so far so he was trying to get

241
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,789
into a little bit more serious domain
because we're actually starting to see

242
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:41,120
that the file that was once opened is
now doing stuff right it's actually

243
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,070
doing stuff in the background then that
file gets moved to be used directory

244
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:53,470
right so we are starting to look at this
is getting interesting because this

245
00:26:53,470 --> 00:27:00,399
isn't normal behavior for something
that's happening in user using Word and

246
00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:03,629
buy music director I mean things like
Abdullah

247
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:08,300
updater company rite temp things like
that

248
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:16,570
usually save directly into those folders
into documents so we can raise the risk

249
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,760
and start to look at

250
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:24,520
saying we're monitoring a suspicious
activity so what if you notice from this

251
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:29,420
right now and I mean the process he's
outside of Outlook being the initial

252
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:34,420
step the rest of the processes that are
launched behind out to be anything I'm

253
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,970
not looking at specific and I'm not
looking at specific footprint i'm

254
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:42,180
looking at a specific time 25 or
anything like that I'm just looking at a

255
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:47,080
set of activities are happening at the
end point and I'm collecting the data as

256
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:53,590
I go now with the father used directory
then you know the process gets porn off

257
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:59,080
of the world without so there will
actually elevated at risk because that's

258
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:04,520
just not normal behavior we've seen a
couple businesses worry is normal

259
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:11,110
behavior so if you guys you guys
refinance Thomson Reuters

260
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:21,419
Microsystems similar to this so you can
actually Thomson Reuters for Excel

261
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:25,700
actually does something similar to what
we're seeing here because I actually do

262
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,210
temporary it'll download temporary deal
else for their queries what it's doing

263
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:36,460
its software like that that's a bit
weird WebEx does the same thing if you

264
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:42,750
can actually see the WebEx actually
writing a stub application-based usually

265
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:47,420
go through so for example you gotta do
set that will text you actually end up

266
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,920
with the stuff that occasion in that
data so that there's some processing to

267
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,510
actually do this not naturally but in
the majority of the cases it's not

268
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:59,860
normal so you gonna be able to witness
those few processes

269
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:14,290
basically saying thats space so much
time

270
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:59,110
get back into seems so we can correlate
the endpoint data with the stamps so we

271
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:03,990
we start to the example I usually given
explained

272
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:54,850
so if you prefer if you look at there is
a solution right the enterprise security

273
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,500
module will give you a nice picture
timeline of all the events are happening

274
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:03,580
environment and all the all the attacks
were happening in your environment but

275
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:08,490
it's all network focused and when you
look at the time line the actual time I

276
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,840
started when they see it

277
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,830
network they never start before and we
started doing some tests with them were

278
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:20,290
we thinking about the date of this state
of it with generating cash until the

279
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:27,300
complete time right now because we're
actually looking at going from the time

280
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:32,310
the endpoint actually ran something
giving him the date of what was run to

281
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:35,600
that network connection and then that
network connection can be correlated

282
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,100
back to the back to the network events
what you're seeing in the files or your

283
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,520
ideas

284
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:59,410
the more day we capture the more
relevant information we can provide the

285
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:29,390
problem we're having right now generate
it becomes very difficult because we're

286
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:32,850
looking at doing right now is going to

287
00:32:45,500 --> 00:33:04,520
to former soviet focused and yes even
the user focus has a long way activity

288
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:09,730
and what we do is we regroup the events
into similar patterns so if they come

289
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:14,130
from the same process if it's as if it's
a normal time line if it's not you know

290
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:20,750
if it looks like it's supposed to happen
so it's a plus D policy right so one

291
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:25,050
plus one plus one equals three if we get
one plus one equals five you start to

292
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:28,050
get them normally so that only to be
things like

293
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:55,649
something that happened but isn't
necessarily doing various things

294
00:34:55,649 --> 00:35:06,000
everyone basically what's happened there
is but a service that hardly ever sports

295
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,430
or hardly ever starts goes into play so
you start to see events coming from that

296
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:16,819
one activity that only coming out every
so every 30 days whereas 15 days we had

297
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:21,180
a lot of trouble training this to do
Windows updates because as you know

298
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:25,480
couple in September Windows changes
something like an ISM they started doing

299
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,740
not out of band patches so we started to
see Windows Update acting up and we were

300
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,180
striking a straight away is it normal
because it was that that wasn't supposed

301
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:40,500
to run the middle of the month at the
end of the month so that's a lot of

302
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,780
things that you do this much data and
that's where I'm coming back to my story

303
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:50,700
is that we why are we doing this stuff
at the end point I've got answers for

304
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,200
that and fortunately most of the
enterprises don't want to hear it

305
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,859
because it's always business takes
priority over the business is killing

306
00:35:57,859 --> 00:36:03,279
you is at the same time so we need to
think about it we want to protect the

307
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,839
business and protect the assets or do we
want to play with the with the users and

308
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:11,839
say well the users don't want it because
it gets in their way

309
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:30,430
times do quick demo so you will be
seeing the product I didn't do too much

310
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:38,950
products offered $6 running just running
in the background so

311
00:36:50,260 --> 00:37:25,980
campaigns so so interfax service to get
this can as if you know as a user you

312
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:30,150
think well okay so it's cancelled
following its normal because they want

313
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:37,170
to say they don't want to send a big
bigger scan and email so they set it up

314
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:43,900
so most users once you know most users
will have a few like this they might not

315
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:50,520
recognize the icon below it its ok my I
T guys said I can't open docx files I

316
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:56,380
double click on above 50 yet because it
was downloaded it opens up north this

317
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:05,310
one so you know things are happening in
the background with my file an opening

318
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:18,150
going on

319
00:38:53,790 --> 00:39:17,210
basically here so their web sites

320
00:39:46,470 --> 00:40:25,020
does running a process a process and
it's actually running and you see it i

321
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:30,730
mean this is stuff you know you would
only be able to get a full forensics

322
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:35,310
dump of the machines after the fact
right so I'm giving it some more time

323
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:36,210
with us

324
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:42,310
you see the process launched got all the
relevant stuff that I would use in

325
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:47,540
forensics is three times Wednesday I
actually have I was totally into this

326
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:55,380
you notice but it's still not showing up
as a virus total AMT 5-2 there's no

327
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,970
scandal so basically I stability under
52 virustotal forrest was told me

328
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:04,529
there's nothing there so that means none
of these would capture this right now

329
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:10,200
and he's he's so the process of the
activity was seeing all of these

330
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,290
application launches

331
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:22,050
different versions of the phone so even
this 1 p.m. to 5 11 out of 55 but

332
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:26,960
depending on the rain but I probably can
put a check mark next to it or what but

333
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:35,500
that's nothing oh no but command that
one

334
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:53,190
yes he is question mark means voters
total process I know but with this I

335
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:59,410
basically detected have warned behavior
on the system right I detected us use

336
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:05,339
our opening a zip file running aw
scripts then launching some executables

337
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:08,549
outside doing it during a network
connection launches executables all that

338
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:17,140
data so this is why you know I strongly
believe that we have enough power

339
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:21,690
nowadays Endpoint Protection back into
place not the traditional and for

340
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:25,569
protection but some put something new
something that actually does detection

341
00:42:25,569 --> 00:42:27,839
something that actually gives you
intelligence

342
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,640
associate this to the rest of your
intelligence you have a much better

343
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,640
picture of what's going on in your
environment

344
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,460
any questions

345
00:42:52,200 --> 00:43:24,560
that's so I can actually put into block
mode so because we actually get into the

346
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:32,700
same actually low-level API the most of
us do the same places but most of these

347
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,700
now is one of a kind so we have been
their first

348
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:48,130
already would like something is infected
is launched wild log largest some PDF

349
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:53,240
get some exploit and execute somebody
you can block that we're we're having

350
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:57,169
trouble right now a days the full gamut
of detecting come things coming out of

351
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:03,690
Internet Explorer for example the Adobe
Flash we actually don't see that he's

352
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:08,970
running because I W us an interesting
things to obfuscate itself in Internet

353
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:15,220
Explorer and Internet Explorer doesn't
see if we can don't see it so it's when

354
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:19,430
we're working on it one of the things
that I don't have to go on right now

355
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:26,220
he's so you know the previous
presentation was painting so one of the

356
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:32,339
things we do is we actually lol
injections and side loads so we can

357
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:36,420
actually highlight deal injections so
when you have a process of trying to

358
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:41,480
deal injections we can see that the
Droid X one but I should use this one

359
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,630
variants that does uac bypassed by going
into application

360
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:48,990
by inserting itself into the application
compatibility database I can actually

361
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:53,520
see those registry changes being done in
the application database engine being

362
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,060
run so that they can also thinking
process which takes over though which

363
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:06,880
becomes the proxies to capture the
elections because we're seeing on the

364
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,750
farming operations as well

365
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:15,320
data exfiltration once the process
started touching data we can highlight

366
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:22,760
it we've had some good stuff so we can
actually detect was a season start doing

367
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:30,140
massive changes and we highlight them as
potentially could no longer or morning

368
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:34,049
off Explorer 7 Explorer as one of the
other things that could no longer does

369
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:39,740
so that low started taking a lot more
you can start seeing along a lot better

370
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:44,529
that's that's the whole point before we
try to do is just being able to see

371
00:45:44,530 --> 00:47:15,480
better so that we can bring back the
impact of right now

372
00:47:17,130 --> 00:48:33,289
showed actually that's why we're
actually seen that they are being picked

373
00:48:33,289 --> 00:48:39,599
up first will be generated Tristan
Tristan doubts as to the network so even

374
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:45,190
with encrypted network sites using
tourists herself who actually seen the

375
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:45,910
process

376
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:49,899
manipulating the data before it goes
into the tunnel like you're looking to

377
00:48:49,900 --> 00:49:00,730
have some of this race ya database that
closer which just his own characteristic
