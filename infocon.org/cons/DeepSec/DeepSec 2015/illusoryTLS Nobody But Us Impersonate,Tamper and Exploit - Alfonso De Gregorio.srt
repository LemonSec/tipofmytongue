1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,580
good morning thank you for the
opportunity to speak with you today this

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:14,320
is also my first time at the SEC and
first times should be unforgettable they

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:25,090
can be just considered is the first live
concert gets any person

4
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:30,830
man-in-the-middle attack I remember this
poses first time when I was man in the

5
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:39,480
middle of yours I configure declined to
pull logs from a web server being

6
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:46,230
necessary action over it or not after
some time as new serious where establish

7
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:53,919
a new device failed to connect you to a
certificate so I don't deserve a

8
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,500
subpoena gate I was getting from the
United point if I wanted to differ from

9
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,650
the one I was expecting to see and in
that time I realize my gosh oh my gosh

10
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:11,060
and getting men in the middle of the
next to me is why this is so cool

11
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:20,619
this is the only security flaws of birth
every study from the inside out first

12
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:27,250
times are informally we could notice
that I ordered the memory of it

13
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:34,380
positive but this event is possibly
armed number by the force but it false

14
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:41,350
negatives or which is to say that
current web public infrastructure is

15
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:46,009
project we are as a security community
witnessing with increasing frequency

16
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:47,899
incidence

17
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,930
dramas in fields of the infrastructure

18
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:58,960
we didn't trust our business upon China
Internet network information center

19
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:06,119
Lenovo IdeaCentre India and see us to
trust each other

20
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:13,349
komodo Verisign in the aggregate these
united stance on issues or otherwise

21
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:19,839
allow the impersonation of a number of
high-profile websites right into the IMP

22
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,440
impersonating entities ability to spy on
a sizable number of unsuspecting users

23
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:33,660
so no more memories for those of us who
remain oblivious to their first right

24
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:43,549
because if no silent fair if not silent
killer is the pinnacle goes undetected

25
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:53,180
impersonation is a measure of success
you know engineering we are not just

26
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:59,150
about building cryptographic back doors
go figure I work at the intersection of

27
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:04,769
software security and security software
exploring a try to contain the space of

28
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:22,389
unanticipated I want crypto I want to do
be open and robust to be secure backdoor

29
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:29,750
some snowboarding in axial like almost
say he made your special somebody unsafe

30
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:37,099
during almost like this is not a
satisfactory answer so before going

31
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:44,540
partner list already started gusting the
source data infrastructure we didn't

32
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:51,840
trust our businesses shortly I will
introduce you to illusory get us in as

33
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,519
Medicaid or targeting the receipt
generation that has saved me to do the

34
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:03,419
first under ended I will use the back
door sign in order to discuss the

35
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:10,579
kitchen that this story is closed doors
on the current web public infrastructure

36
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:16,978
it is foreclosing I want to share with
you a novel algorithm using alligator in

37
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:22,849
order to do surveillance so great the
back doors is a timely topic of debate

38
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:30,009
as a matter for the government later
today I proposal to approach it as a

39
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:36,729
technical space this Sunday night I
practically explored regardless of the

40
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:41,639
policy framework is somebody in the
believe however questionable the back

41
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,340
door with a secret recording is possible
that people will be able to notice if

42
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:55,710
our communication would be supplied will
be able to notice before delving into

43
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:01,008
the technical details I would like to
pull your trip to be course if you feel

44
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:09,620
inclined please rise around in an
organized so that big horse in the US

45
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:18,910
and one and that big course can be
planted in that

46
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:47,130
giving up skills in the fourth quarter
if you can spot prices yet this car

47
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,130

48
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,400
figures can be there completo does not
enable anyone except those without

49
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:05,900
access to recovery system or planted in
order to paraphrase the popular vote on

00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:34,570
storyline parts they did you know that
generating while I'm not in the position

54
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:41,080
to know if I decide to explore is an
audio both experimental and speculative

55
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:47,469
point of view and back in November 2014
1 year ago I said tonight read

56
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,320
illusionary pls the first under ended
the contest

57
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,389

competition to write or modified code it

58
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:03,479

something have you any jewelry class is

59
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:11,599
an instance of the younger you tour
in-ear a second generation security is

60
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:17,030
the worst possible because they ignored
completely hurts the security guarantees

61
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:23,419

talker two points doctor with a message

debit side reflects the fall we try to
model the back door designer can insert

specification for commercial publicly

66
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:51,960
technologists interfere with a chain
disregard everything about policy or she

67
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,520
simply the position to build a security
model used by the certification

68

simplicity we don't loss also has a

72
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:34,159
variety of Service declined since they
basically become the server anyways the

73
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,799
server response to a question is if the
client to server code is contributed by

74
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:44,620
an open source project and is used as is
without any modification where is the

00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,949

that attract or universal protection or

86
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,630
sit atop a creep 296

87
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:58,470
is an instance of the young political
resume debate or

88
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:04,660
generation these were built upon the
research published in the Proceedings of

89
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:16,740
selected areas in the same publisher of
working limitation is a college provides

90
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:22,150
the security properties the first of
which is that nobody but us know bus

91
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:27,220
meet meaning that this nation requires
access to resources noting that in the

92
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:34,490
back door itself in this case there is
an elliptical privately or which is to

93
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:39,210
say that the vulnerability game is
played by the back door signer inside

94
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:44,070
the assessee conferences so before
moving farther I would like to ask you

95
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:49,220
if you believe that is possible to
forbid an enemy intelligence

96
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:57,470
organization from gaining yards as well
respected do said you were trying to

97
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:02,490
believe that is possible to forbid any
any intelligence organization from

98
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:07,480
gaining access to product key will be
also inclined to regard to figures

99
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:14,640
released this kind of the sign of doors
as possibly secure at the same time vice

100
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,490
versa I spent it doesn't you are
inclined to regard all measure prevent

101
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:27,120
disclosure to be seen in that regard
cryptographic detours and Lee insecure

102
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,920
but on the top of the property

103
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,710
implement some other properties such as

104
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:43,250
as long as a computational ordinance
essential elliptical decisional

105
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:48,090
diffie-hellman calls the back door key
pair appearing probabilistic

106
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:55,340
like genuine Orosi appears therefore
that box artists the key generator

107
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,760
doesn't love it actually black box
office the key generator does not allow

108
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,910
detection in moreover the biggest
prosecutors or even reverse engineer

109
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:10,410
reached into the key generator than it
previously stolen information remains

110
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:16,550
confidential in this book tour is
reusable because can use multiple times

111
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:24,959
are therefore it is interesting to look
at the impact and implications of this

112
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:30,830
kind of backdoor can have on the current
web public infrastructure that doctor

113
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:37,160
can used a certification authority
product key factor in the models in

114
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,160
order to break the less security
guarantees that we are exposing the

115
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,800
comedian points to a variety of topics
ranging from impersonation message

116
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,609
Danbury ITV's dropping of encrypted
never done that in months and then

117
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:57,410
individual attack no necessary for the
first time this means that there's no

118
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,569
need for a target have access to the
private key system outdoors

119
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:09,230
there's no need to talk about what the
attacker is to retain control over the

120
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:15,250
key generation or the target or receive
margins therefore I wonder is the

121
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,350
malicious implementer it right

122
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:22,170
mitigated by aidid product security
certifications later I will briefly

123
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:27,199
review the security requirements set
forth by the most protection profile and

124
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:33,190
demanded by industrialization it I will
argue white this is not a case before I

125
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:39,220
would like to spend a few minutes longer
or on the web

126
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,370
public because as it has a seagulls

127
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:55,600
interest certainly parties they type in
a security becomes as you may have

128
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:02,950
already experienced 100 technical points
the world body rocking through it

the ps3 market diagram for
recertification here it is

133
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,779
certification enables entities one
public infrastructure

134
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:41,970
entities in another public
infrastructure trust relationship should

135
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,830
be typically support by a certification
agreement between the certification

136
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,740
authority for each public infrastructure
the agreement established the

137
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:54,820
responsibilities and liabilities this
means that whenever we have a mutual

138
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,180
relationship each certification
authority is required to issue a

139
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,829
certificate of the order in order to
establish a relationship in both

direction the public prices not
necessary I food aid certificate

141
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:16,199

that after 2 certification authority and

142
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,580
establish and specify the terms of
prostate issue the certificates to each

143
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:25,529
other and it is a separate PTI can
interact subject to the palace's

but this is just you know in practice

145
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:38,050
most current public infrastructure
software implies a form of employees

146
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:43,069
across our nation in which all root
certificates are equally trust this is

147
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:49,810
equivalent to about that process
application for certification which is

148
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:54,030
to say that any certificate can be
trivially replaced by muslim traders

from in order certification authority
the forty security the real security of

150
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,810
any certificate is reduced to the
security of the least prosperity

gall surprises what it really is the

157
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:55,120
rotting fruit makes the PKI as weak as
they were now in asthmatic bit or with

nicety is not sufficient anymore don't
have source the key generation other

essential to have insurance about the

it is time in sexy and confident we have
188 trusted Certification Authorities

up on this forum requires public trusted

172
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:19,240
certificates to be issuing compliance
with European standard EN according to

173
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,620
the standard this situation is to be
corrupt within a device requirements

protection provides the assurance level

176
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:41,809
EAL for our mint condition comes from
adherence to three additional security

177
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:47,899
requirements this security requirements
are focused on assessing the target of

178
00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:52,418
evaluation occurring in the
implementation representation is not

179
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:56,169
completed cessation or the target
evaluation security function

180
00:18:56,169 --> 00:19:00,769
requirements special emphasis is placed
on identify covert channels in

181
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:05,360
estimating a paucity which is fortunate
because set up a attacks exploit the

182
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:13,360
region as a covert channel for itself
but it ended today is the developer be

183
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:19,840
charged for the assessment phase it is
clearly conflicts with our trade model

184
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,820
right away to his left with the
documentation and implementation replace

185
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:32,260
representation to be assessed so can the
presence of Victorian be allowed at the

186
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:39,269
issuance level if they've always was to
be carry out the higher levels of death

187
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:42,750
used for matters this be but it

188
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:47,549
yell for the implementation
representation here under back to that

189
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:50,679
action likely just think about difficult

190
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:55,730
can be despite the presence of malicious
pelagic looking to there are no

191
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:00,259
description language provided some time
or did not list provided at publication

192
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:06,320
time therefore the key takeaway I would
like to live with for today is that as

193
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:16,519
long as the implementation or essay or
more generally our algorithms tax audit

194
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:25,019
by relying parties today is to be
regarded as a potential big door which

195
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:28,570
is to say that as long as the
implementation of the riddles adopt a

196
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:33,418
certification authority available to
discuss your skin right parties

197
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:39,169
insurance provided by usually tell us
know whatever is not any different from

198
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:44,509
the show has provided by system relies
pls in Orosi certificates for or Egypt

202
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:08,689
no nadamas been widely deployed yet so
but let's look to the final part because

203
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:13,019
the suddenness of a bigger plan agreed
gotta credential resides in the absence

204
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:17,570
of malicious logic in the system was
security Bureau's no malicious logical

205
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:24,668
in the communication like me to live is
the back door embedding algorithm for

206
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:31,279
today I would like to share with you
another way to bed or in the internet

00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:36,600
piracy generation few weeks after my
submission underrated

208
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:42,719
to contest right Castellucci share is at
a convenient so I would like to start

209
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:51,309
treaties the basic idea is adequate to
5590 public key generator in generating

210
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:52,168

212
00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:00,190
using this to kiss is possible to
computershare share secret using

213
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:05,340
elliptic curve if you are using the show
secret we concede a cryptographically

214
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:12,389
secure to the random number generator or
visible abs and using this generator we

215
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:19,900
can generate a standard that occurred
and replace 32 by 30 generate a female

216
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:27,940
5519 public and this quantity and
regional providers computer crimes

217
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:35,039
leading to the new models and they
needed a female public economic put a

218
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:41,658
bigger compared in order to recover the
key material that academic start

219
00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:45,400
instructing the funeral to 5590 public
key from the target modulus

220
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:53,000
computershare secret in order to do this
of course need to have access to the

221
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:01,309
private key public generator before that
nobody but us security property and

222
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:07,408
using this decade using the shared
secret that I consider again the same

223
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:15,200
cryptographically secure a random number
generator injury appear that darkness

224
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,659
Porter replacing 32 by Sarah target
values with a female who have defeated

225
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:26,770
519 publicly in using this quantity in
the regional providers to compete to

226
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:31,980
reprise leading to the target markets
invading the funeral publicly and

227
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:43,100
attackers succeed because they cannot
recover Orosi years while the ideas nice

228
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,010
deke period generated using this
algorithm for short in terms of

229
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:52,620
indistinguishable before this game
should be regarded as broken apart it's

230
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:58,399
easy to tell backdoor certificates apart
from set mine or see certificates using

231
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,830
only black box office does anybody see
why this is the case with rising

232
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:13,090
well what we do here is when they depart
the key into the pharmacy modest but

233
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:20,189
politically are points on the curve and
elliptical points can easily be

234
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:25,280
distinguished from uniform runner
streaks because they satisfied elliptic

235
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:30,930
curve equation so they evaluate or
simply check if the coordinates encoded

236
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:36,440
using the candidate 32 by substrings or
the modernist satisfied elliptic curve

237
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:42,920
equation is it possible to repair the
back or we can do that yes

238
00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:09,600
breaks into the key generator can
recover that party so far from it

239
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:13,330
architecture perspective

240
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:24,779
if you don't want to raise so don't know
somewhere need to communicate is so

241
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:31,789
unique that quality

242
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,669
my question is if we could make the
elliptical pies indistinguishable from

243
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:47,809
running streams that the back door
indistinguishable he will be retained by

244
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:54,230
the investor and across northern my
combo internalized in order to make the

245
00:25:54,230 --> 00:26:00,389
censorship articles on the technical
indicator provides a medal for including

246
00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:08,678
our strength in this indistinguishable
from uniform running streams know this

247
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:16,940
is very because all cyber security
technology is currently use believe is

248
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:23,919
corroborated by alligator just like any
also security tools and editor bility of

249
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:29,200
course points can be used for good or
for ill for censorship circumvention or

250
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,669
for surveillance but I believe we can
positively contribute to the discussion

251
00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:39,850
properties of information security by
walking the fine line between offense

252
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:45,799
and defense and in this period I did it
time to write the python bindings

253
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:54,250
alligator implementation really get a
supporting 5255 1902 the back door

254
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:58,190
embedding algorithm in order to make
sure that Victoria material is

255
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:04,970
indistinguishable from general policy
here and that tucker works i spose we

256
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:11,669
started by D occurs to 5519 public key
generator and generate anything 0:50

257
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:14,590
5519 get around them in a sec

258
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:19,779
represented history using this dickey's
we can computershare secretly using any

259
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:23,860
pictures if you use the shared secret to
see they could be crushed

260
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:30,428
to run the numbers the radar based on a
yes running using the generator we

261
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:35,600
generated RSA key pair and replaced by
Sunday generate modest with their

262
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,600

263
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:47,920
2:55 p.m. publicly this is
indistinguishable from uniform streams

264
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:54,559
before the committee will be
distinguishable from a gentle minority

265
00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:02,389

to a new model is inviting the uniform

that they uniformed represented history
we cannot boot or is it and that's

277
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:09,629
pretty much it as far as the theory that
the tacos in publishing work so please

278
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:16,770
use it responsibly before concluding I
have one last remark to me I would like

279
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:23,700
to close between someone once said I
often in the death of me sorry there is

280
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,990
still companies

281
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:33,030
in music inside me if you like me
believe deep insecurity or the presence

282
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:38,470
or mitigated by surprise is the misery
of our time if you like me believe that

283
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:44,500
insecurity is the misery of our time and
at the same time you like me are also

284
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:50,440
sanguine about our ability to attend
batters it to give our children have

285
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,330
been killed which confidence in the
process by which they will entrust their

286
00:29:54,330 --> 00:30:01,220
business then we can paraphrase August
led to the death of insecurity they're

287
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,780
still carless

288
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,540
music inside us thank you
