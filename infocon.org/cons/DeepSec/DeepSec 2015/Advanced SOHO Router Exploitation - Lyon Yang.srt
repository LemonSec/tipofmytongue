1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,309
one thanks for coming by Nima is from
Santiago I work at a company called

2
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:12,309
vantage point security which is based in
Singapore

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:18,539
spend most of my time doing web
application pen testing mobile network

4
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:24,850
and independence to do and doing a night
during my free time i do research on

5
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:32,279
anything like and just to possibly open
researching on how to divide us which is

6
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,879
why by definition is because of one
stupid comments month CD if you support

7
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:49,989
this amendment dozens and I spoke to
accomplices in the box X calling about

8
00:00:49,989 --> 00:01:00,089
the village of exploitation workshop
today I'll be talking about events or a

9
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,859
declaration from the symbol of the
hanging fruit swept by reduced to

10
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:13,260
writing a sports on US soil of the
governor orders so one year ago I

11
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:20,820
attended a training he's like the x86 go
so I got inspired by him and I thought

12
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,689
all contributing back in content on the
right thing explodes on army admits

13
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:35,089
before we go so a regular guy basic
understanding of assembly

14
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:42,290
some training and yeah I spend most of
my time in almost like I have a double

15
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:42,820
life

16
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:56,710
yeah so shocking is running with online
by the other isn't really a methodology

17
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:47,359
content on I'm really scared and I just
different been different but not and I

18
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,660
find It s sex involved as well as its
theme park as it everything exactly the

19
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,350
same

20
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:59,570
most likely spend this do not care about
security is just put this off the shelf

21
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:09,100
software but into this box and just ship
it out like these vendors just 11 of us

22
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:21,329
money just by his office so if you want
to look at the box office

23
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:27,209
understand why we've been testing of
whining about everything entry point

24
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:29,530
where

25
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:47,290
so our mobile devices actually wifi UPnP
there's really a lot of the other

26
00:03:47,290 --> 00:04:01,299
hardware trudy together and start
looking for engineering and four bucks

27
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:10,190
so what I did was to be a disorderly
chip off but ended up looking into the

28
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:17,269
laptop and you have the wrong way so
once you get the firmware can start

29
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:21,739
digging through these somewhere and
understand why is running on it what

30
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:29,280
software and basically find everything
in other ways where you can do this is

31
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:36,260
by informers on line of course there is
no way they could do I use any other

32
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:40,969
freely available to us when you came and
picked this one way and understand what

33
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:48,900
this software is running so vendors
point I refer to our defenders and most

34
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,299
commonly electorate a case study history
P internet service because that's where

35
00:04:53,300 --> 00:05:03,270
most of the box I and you can easily
test them and so the box where you will

36
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:08,370
find his are like they're on on the
internet every other Monday is always

37
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:14,300
someone publishing was your day on any
device where you can find his back doors

38
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,300
with security was not implemented at all

39
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:25,729
overflowed the UPnP command injection
really this really in the whole new

40
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:32,400
playground I would advise all kind of
box where you can find I would we want

41
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,400
remote unlocking the box we don't just
110

42
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,950
10,000 rupees

43
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:46,030
I wonder if I want to bond it ok if I
can control $10 million devices I can do

44
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:59,590
thinks so why is because this 23 are
most commonly open to win by development

45
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:05,179
of friendships the roller to anybody who
usess it so it's going to be in the grip

46
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,710
on the laugh

47
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,979
children so these days there I
discovered for this particular order

48
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,940
exactly right now there's thousands of
them open to the internet right now

49
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:27,680
where we can just hang in there they can
control the weather so why why are there

50
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,920
so many duties as I told you before the
the story where these vendors will not

51
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:40,660
care about the group also because
typically developers I I do not know a

52
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:52,610
lot of good sushi places most people no
job numbers by the end of this

53
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:57,240
developers will know about your C++
developers take this off the shelf

54
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,170
software like michael's DVD the customer
and because they customize it that's

55
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:09,240
where the bodies are so they do not know
how to code in secure your C++ coding

56
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:19,890
just copy and you can easily find
everywhere so I find books like these

57
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:25,039
are you can just as easily just do a
stack of law in the

58
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:33,660
the Telnet and and very easy you can
find one I don't have a lot of modern

59
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:39,230
look at is the UPnP in the UK Mr B's
just files everything go

60
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:50,750
requests and you can see if I stay with
us so today I'll be talking about 20

61
00:07:50,750 --> 00:08:00,400
discovered on the road so who exactly is
the the base in the USA the day provides

62
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:09,219
voters for ice piece of small enterprise
networks and why they look as so one

63
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:19,430
look at it before and to my ISP forces
me to use this rather and actually make

64
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:26,230
me pay for this rather to rent as well
as from them so the government is where

65
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:32,590
I wanted to go right I don't be so I
started I want to configure it right but

66
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:37,140
they won't get any user credentials so I
called the tentacles of what he can I

67
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,830
get a min credentials I want to do some
configuration and they said no so

68
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:49,840
challenging game on radio so I started
looking around about it yet so just to

69
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:57,070
see how many ISPs are using so you got
to show that you just such a zone and

70
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:04,850
you can actually see that's quite a few
I speak they're using this model so so I

71
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,100
started looking and of course you can
find

72
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:13,149
College group being and you can just put
a stop to get started taking the tech

73
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:17,509
support I live in Singapore in Los
maastricht like an attack might want

74
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:24,009
expert right I don't go to jail so I
started looking around and when I

75
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:32,509
realized what the separation between the
users so basically any user can call any

76
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:38,829
functions what it is they did this
provision operation by the JavaScript so

77
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:44,868
what we can do is just call any imagery
the functions in and yeah but but as the

78
00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:50,369
user and developer I do not have to be
the immune function so I don't have to

79
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:59,029
take some time to find all this energy
functions so if you see on the job on

80
00:09:59,029 --> 00:09:59,699
the right

81
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:04,949
see if using a mean show the amendment
to basically you can just put it would

82
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:13,779
be just replace the the i mean so every
word you say so if you think the user

83
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:21,709
this lady so then we can see the menu
and we can start of another and you can

84
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:25,939
see finding all these rollers they
actually did they did not properly

85
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:32,110
session cookies in others and can even
if I always do this we also now know I i

86
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:38,170
mean functions of other right now but of
course I understand looking for more

87
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,959
right I wonder possible on a change I
don't I don't expose the beam I wrote it

88
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:46,829
so I started looking and I will never
realize was that they start the possible

89
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:54,290
it's a function of the readers and
support out in the back of our basically

90
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,299
fine called it so I just get the file

91
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:04,439
the basics for Friday in just a min
possibilities what possibilities of

92
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:11,949
possible so that I notified been done
and passed it and what I was thinking

93
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:19,100
when I don't have a couple I can get the
password rates are not remove it from

94
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,350
the back of our why not try uploading it
back and pitch to persuade myself so I

95
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:29,510
do need to know the password I just a
simple settings using the functionality

96
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:36,520
that is that possible so this is great
so now I got the admin password

97
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:44,300
yeah so it's not affect on this rather
you can try a lot of a few dollars in

98
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:51,650
Singapore you can just grab the back of
following the path we are now I pass

99
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:58,170
away but my main goal is to I wanna get
so when I get home all mobile good

100
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,780
qualities I guess that's causing the
relative to my GV still wanna start

101
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:09,170
cutting it by Tony in and of course the
gift that show and that show you can

102
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:19,310
just type it you can just pipe behind
any commanding running your comments so

103
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:28,520
now when I i mean i i show grabbing all
these files like to do stabbing all

104
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:40,880
these huge TV service by Mary Webb I
need a running and doing so is it a

105
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:49,560
fraud and look for show only for myself
when I just show and my phone was this a

106
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,880
lot of commands

107
00:12:50,880 --> 00:13:02,070
names were challenged by combining show
so what I found was actually can easily

108
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,440
find

109
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,300
India travel most common around us so we
can just type it in the pink

110
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,089
functionality of the treaty optional
being you can start running a shock

111
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:21,770
mounts but the problem is when when you
have a role in his black box running the

112
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:30,750
clients so but because I I was I can
just run by Tammy some falling into the

113
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:37,430
temporary doctrine and things like that
so what I did lost I followed my show

114
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:41,380
put into temporary directory usually
elected but it would have cost esta

115
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,430
please

116
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:46,650
whereas most commonly right about most
of the other places on a road near each

117
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:55,140
box and you might think maybe you can
write up a month so you try writing to

118
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:09,270
the temp directory change the permission
of the shell to write on it and I have

119
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:17,770
access to dollars I put what I like to
do I find that works well for me i didnt

120
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:24,380
putting human try to replicate the
firmware that there's a lot of work and

121
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:35,050
sometimes you just get what I like to do
is a test to be over to the process the

122
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:40,990
process start passing so you can easily
just do

123
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:59,950
7082 back just for any extension so I
did that and so this is what you see

124
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:13,830
something I mean I mention of a flawed
and gain control over the counter so

125
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:21,010
what exactly is like if you know x86
like your instruction pointer which what

126
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:27,290
is what is called controls the flow of
the program so points to the location of

127
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:32,439
the program and you can point to the
location of a show called and I can put

128
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:44,500
you out so what this case I was lucky to
have other registers I can use these

129
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,990
very helpful because you can please drop
gadgets addresses then can use it right

130
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:59,270
you export before I write the exploit I
like to find out what I have so much

131
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:05,089
time writing exploit this time so what
is get out at all what I wasn't so lucky

132
00:16:34,880 --> 00:17:32,940
so so so so

133
00:18:17,760 --> 00:19:09,670
I want to do this and then when I read
it felt like I got everything but we're

134
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:16,370
totally off I don't get myself I was
looking through the encoder in and I

135
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,370
didn't really understand what he was
doing

136
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:39,639
maybe there was something that you sure
it's so you can actually what you do is

137
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:48,440
you can buy a simple message so so you
can just put the two back writers and on

138
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:54,890
the flight record in just his tobacco so
this is a simplified version where I

139
00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:09,060
just bought the back nine at night so I
got my my show court and have read and I

140
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:23,560
was like oh my god what's happening so I
thought I get my show quote myself but

141
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:30,520
why is it always is not looking so I
realize is actually most runners have to
