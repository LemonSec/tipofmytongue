1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,360
my day was really brought the city of
prostitution and the provision I think

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,560
they don't know San Francisco citing
security concerns and I walking from

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:28,769
yeltsin jihadist groups not just an idea
security you can find me but everywhere

4
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:40,690
else so today what about first we will
talk about the starting point of the

5
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:51,120
study because what we find the end
depends of frame we have so that's good

6
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:58,489
too good to choose a group them's the
Jews to that's good to make your point

7
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:10,110
about this story before and after that
we talk about trip and we will talk

8
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:19,960
about finally the tools they use so
first let's talk about the term we may

9
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,960
be able to stop to release another paper

10
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:44,500
the nuclear power so first we had there
with so many explanation of the world

11
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,500
jihad

12
00:02:32,770 --> 00:03:05,900
but it's not like killing people so you
know this world this jihad by so is like

13
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:21,720
today but that's not the real means of
jihad in today's world is just used by

14
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:30,870
people who want to put everything they
want in this world of jihad this using

15
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:42,480
encryption perform this jihad and I want
used terrorism today you know those days

16
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,160
that summit

17
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:51,670
rhetoric but every day for everything
and you know if you just look at

18
00:03:51,670 --> 00:04:02,170
Wikipedia you have so many explanation
of this world terrorism is using for

19
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:11,329
political religious ideological
pressures after that you are so many

20
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:21,830
definitions round and they can vary
because of people meaning but I'm not

21
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:32,870
talking but I'm talking but cryptography
use by people who make this crazy jihad

22
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:40,430
terrorism but they will talk about
wicked tourism we get there is a use the

23
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,790
term created by Mark secure

24
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:55,840
is French researcher if it's an
international center that means choose

25
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:05,750
to use the same process like so
everybody can come and bring this motif

26
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,010
icings everybody can participate

27
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:22,599
losses although you had so let's listen
to this centralized sorry network online

28
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,320
on the ground but

29
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:43,560
or professional and you have lots of
problems because of that is also linked

30
00:05:43,560 --> 00:06:15,260
to mass communication to find and read
but what they think about that

31
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:46,349
website talking about asking people to
do the jihad jihad there in 2005 5020

32
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:54,250
work site several a because of this week
everybody can create websites and

33
00:06:54,250 --> 00:07:12,620
participate in French language we find
in 2015 to 500 website which I've I

34
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:44,680
don't know I never readers about website
which a lot of people

35
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:57,549
by the brunt so that's linked to the
ground

36
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:09,430
website just created result in with the
connection of people with at Mass

37
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:14,510
Communication they create runs out not
so much

38
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:32,250
visit so most famous words beginning
which began in 2006 really really really

39
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:44,400
for us we are part of the team were
arrested but the trip site is staying

40
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:53,459
alive like I said be changed because
they had problems usually pronounced

41
00:08:53,460 --> 00:09:12,320
dead and that's that's a bigger one and
they're really really really big machine

42
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:22,240
of communication is a fog medicine to
Alfred media center is the bigger

43
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,500
organization of propaganda Islamists
have it was at the beginning

44
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:43,160
linked to al-qaida the specials in media
production but more and more and more

45
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:54,500
and more guidebooks to ask people to use
cryptography tours and to explain to

46
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,690
them how to use that

47
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:16,660
this platform this big communication
group of joint venture of two groups the

48
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:28,500
Jay Jay G Islamic media order one and
the IMC

49
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:38,000
Islamic media center at the beginning
why was talking about the internet also

50
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,830
was doing the mass production they
decide to to work together and six

51
00:10:46,830 --> 00:11:11,590
months after this group creation from
six everyday to 7,400 people so it was

52
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:26,040
great great deal because they increase
communication and the way to share the

53
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:43,420
tools and way you look also to Twitter
account why because they are really

54
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:51,569
talkative you know I talked about
terrorism lots of people with this

55
00:11:51,570 --> 00:12:05,900
two-day john also show that even they
follow love between themselves

56
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:18,120
you can find loves of a lot of new about
to say use lots of news about encryption

57
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:28,500
techniques because in the groups of
people on the line you are so many kids

58
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:40,610
you are people who know about security
and talked very easily about that so I

59
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:58,400
took some that I lived with and all the
informations with lots of big big big

60
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:09,000
machine you have to know between
September and December 2014 so one year

61
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:34,770
ago used rocket broadcast is propaganda
was like Saudi Arabia before part of but

62
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:45,439
what is important is they use to
communicate so yes there is mass

63
00:13:45,440 --> 00:14:00,460
communication but there is a lot of
communication inside and inside and

64
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:06,100
that's before French French just six
months

65
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:21,520
so the first thing we see is there are
between between himself to you know

66
00:14:21,520 --> 00:15:27,310
because the last week's so well fall in
somewhat side went from phones sorry I'm

67
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:40,939
speaking to us we're finding someone
phoned also returned account so you have

68
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:49,030
to know cryptography didn't after
revelation

69
00:15:50,380 --> 00:16:02,300
30 they use really really really early
to the platform is great but was just

70
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:12,939
sort of email blood from the youth that
scenes 274 that's really really really

71
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:34,390
old but it was it was to protect against
not so much for not so much for coming

72
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:51,310
just because those have to see that all
schools had is why why here it's not

73
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:59,859
because of the bill because of two fish
I think everybody knows what is to fish

74
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,860
yes

75
00:17:46,650 --> 00:18:02,180
to encrypt traffic text message traffic
so they used to fish and myself for

76
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:37,590
transportation so this I used for you to
lots of information in plain text you

77
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:46,139
have this message

78
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,680
encrypted with two fish

79
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:29,149
2014 for SMS and two fish so why didn't
I just so I think maybe because you know

80
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:35,260
so much

81
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:56,570
yes really good but they put so much
good and so they create the use

82
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:14,200
encryption but the create that was fit
but why why because as you see

83
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:23,770
was lots of Arabic communication and so
in some countries you don't have access

84
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:29,129
to internet at home because it's
expensive because you don't have papers

85
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:36,860
so lots of people in some countries have
access to internet just on lobbied for

86
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:50,270
so that way again to do to do mass
communication using using two is

87
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:57,950
teaching younger people Eastern she is
teaching more and more people you know

88
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:05,400
because because the uses way to connect
so that's not just about Snowden River

89
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:11,860
asians that's also about the ground
about people you want to communicate

90
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:25,459
with this Tues you saw there was there
was pizza and there is all right tools

91
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:38,700
you can see you notified by using this
to us

92
00:22:23,240 --> 00:23:41,380
to be protected

93
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:16,100
and we want to create

94
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:58,770
because you know so we make your
indicate love ramzi stores but the

95
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:06,770
problem is creating these truths means
to have high technically high-level so

96
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:18,360
if you are great engineer with the brain
you don't go into strips if you are in

97
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:32,810
these groups and you could run says
notes so well so wanted to protect

98
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:44,190
protected protecting himself again with
my slide show in order to protect

99
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:47,700
themselves against with them they create

100
00:25:49,260 --> 00:26:13,070
abilities creating good to you don't
have to

101
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:42,719
they have lots of people who are here
they are creating homemade and finally

102
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:52,230
they don't seem to be the same if they
are they are these

103
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:59,980
that's ok sorry I was really really fast

104
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:41,409
I didn't find the Blowfish just found
just so to Fisher 230 232 implement to

105
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:46,680
fish for themselves or their you some
library or and what kind of program do

106
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:53,380
they use what kind of question is that
they implement to reassure themselves

107
00:27:53,380 --> 00:28:11,310
that they use some some library what I
saw what I saw it and who you are and

108
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:18,710
what kind of doctors to the user I read
once upon a time for mobile encryption

109
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:24,600
they used like governor or something
like that is it still in use this

110
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,480
software for mobile encryption or do
they use right now there is a kind of

111
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,550
software do know if I spelled it
correctly

112
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:44,010
such fear both at least you several
years ago for awhile encryption

113
00:28:47,330 --> 00:29:02,220
the website I never saw that that's why
the beginning I played which which part

114
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:22,370
of the which permits I studied because I
know the truth right by your light come

115
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,370
across any kind of big

116
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:32,210
during your research did you ever find
any backdoor versions of their software

117
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:47,860
no but you know so you have really down
to earth but to access to the doors that

118
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:54,189
means long long long time because you
must go to first forums be accepted by

119
00:29:54,190 --> 00:30:02,950
some people to the key to go to another
40 discuss with some people to be

120
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:08,440
accepted in order to go in another forum
and you jump you jump you jump and

121
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:17,020
finally finally you can have access to
stuff but sometimes that's that's really

122
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:30,889
really hard to to can access to two
sisters also I'm not I don't reverse

123
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:34,860
engineering that's not my job I don't
know how to use it

124
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:58,159
2007 I'm just looking at the
installation screen so they've got it

125
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:04,850
and it's it's a drop down menu where you
select the symmetric site where it

126
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:10,969
starts with a yes I just wondered why
you were saying they were focused on a

127
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:17,460
two-tier because I think all the 844

128
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,240
the mood for

129
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:37,050
application using the using the same
underlying mobile phone platform that

130
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:46,450
our PHP thing isn't it because first you
say you know that they want they want

131
00:31:46,450 --> 00:32:06,340
different tools and Jayden secret was
all made by Jay G just for Windows again

132
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:21,800
with private key areas say receivers
encryption but thanks

133
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,909
yet created

134
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:29,710
towards using using to fish

135
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:47,590
using fish 2012 2013 but maybe that's
not just the same people I don't know

136
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:53,600
why they don't use the same sort of
platform but I think just because it's

137
00:32:53,600 --> 00:33:02,600
not the same people who are I don't know
if I quite understand your question

138
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:12,949
asking if you thought that they were
fixated on that algorithm because I

139
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:17,950
thought the other stuff with the Vuze
formerly owned just goes through all the

140
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:23,820
AES candidates and uses I suppose I
could see openly available I do these

141
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:28,710
don't think they're writing much of the
code you agree

142
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:42,389
but I can't answer out through the
answer to this question because there is

143
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:53,919
a long time ago didn't have you looked
jaded secrets wonderful mistake on the

144
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:59,539
front one thing we can enjoy is a
