1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
or one morning I guess almost good
afternoon July first off thank you for

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,879
having me back as I suppose to be a
couple years ago but it is thanks to my

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,219
daughter my back was so here in so yes I
am here to talk about the examination of

4
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,720
tools some of the tools of the actors
and the defenses that are available

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,369
crystal clear this is not a vendor
related pitch in any way shape or form

6
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:26,130
but we do have data from our platform
that will be using so I just wanna make

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,259
sure that I'm clear that up front
because I don't like to sit in the crowd

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,640
and have somebody go will you click this
button and then nobody enjoys that so

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,370
why am i standing here talking to you I
have been in this industry space for

10
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,140
over 20 years now and before I came over
to join Akamai about two and a half

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,620
years ago I did about twenty years on
your side of the phone if your defender

12
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:49,190
I have worked and all manner of
companies from couple of power companies

13
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:55,260
several banks us' Department of Defense
which will be clear and Canadians are is

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,620
actually rather impressed they let me
mess around with their firewalls at the

15
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,589
pentagon and it has been an interesting
really entertaining career for me and as

16
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,689
a result as I've gone long of collected
a lot of stories and I'm going to drive

17
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,699
the cameramen nuts because I wonder so I
apologize in advance and one with these

18
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,170
stories that are managed to collect I've
actually read a lot of stories and as a

19
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,869
result of the stories I've been able to
write for CSO online forums and few

20
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:24,140
others as one of things I really enjoy
being able to actually share these

21
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,750
experiences with folks and not from a
you know look how great of a hacker I am

22
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,310
because that ship sail twenty years ago
now I get the chase paper on the desk

23
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,479
and come talk to get folks like you so I
really enjoy this opportunity able to

24
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:40,619
come out and talk and share these
stories and hopefully you're able

25
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,670
actually take something away from this
to help you know improving your own

26
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,439
environment such as Adobe and my copious
time I actually like to hang out with my

27
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:48,919
family

28
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,740
nothing like waking up at five o'clock
in the morning with two small children

29
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,530
going to a deeply with us

30
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:59,399
awesome but I do feel like this alot of
the time with a lot of conversations

31
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,950
that I have regarding cloud especially
when it comes to large organizations and

32
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,380
government which are still interest the
idea of cloud is rather scary

33
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:14,200
really isn't there's a sticker that i've
seen on a few laptops that says cloud is

34
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,489
just somebody else's computer to agree
to a degree that is actually true but

35
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,180
the reality is that it off loading up so
that you can actually do a better job

36
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,180
with what you're doing and one of things
that really frustrates me is with the

37
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,420
media icon Solis to stories about a
distributed denial of service but they

38
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,809
never really give you anything of
substance other than hacker group of the

39
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:40,740
day said to be clear I like to use the
term attacker I i sort of fumbled there

40
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,820
myself I prefer that as opposed to
hacker because I see that as our word

41
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:49,310
and the media likes to try and scare you
because they want you to look at their

42
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,260
various sites and they leave you with
the sense of terror that something's

43
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,579
creeping up behind you but the security
controls that are in place

44
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,020
aren't always going to see the thing
that's coming up after you with media

45
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,840
they like to just put that fear into you
and this was one of the things that

46
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,120
actually relief I found wanting

47
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,860
I really was left with a rather empty
sense after that so that's where this

48
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,820
talk was actually born out of so the
game plan for what I'm talking about

49
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,250
today gonna go through the actor's the
attacks tools trends data and what can

50
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,400
you do and I want to say what you can do
things you can do now today that can

51
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,240
help with your own environment so one of
the really interesting things starting

52
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,090
off and this is always intrigued me are
the actress or higher

53
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:37,030
the mercenaries of the internet and
these have always tickle me because when

54
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,590
I was doing contract work for the
department of defense in the USA years

55
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,660
ago we used to see these characters all
the time and they even tried to get us

56
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:51,760
to hire them to do various attacks on
mobile attack country X for you know but

57
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,299
the thing that really caught me was that
you could actually have a bespoke

58
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,500
implementation of their services so this
is a couple years out of date now but it

59
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,430
just gives you a rough idea so this was
from 2012 and this was from a Russian

60
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,300
underground site that you know we can do
X Y and Z in a really interesting thing

61
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,590
was a DDoS but that was only $700
whether that was at one time for your

62
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:18,440
current fee that wasn't entirely clear
but this was when we first saw 2012 we

63
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,410
really saw this

64
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:25,980
coming to in into its own rape and we
saw in North America where somebody a

65
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,370
company hired a group like this to
attack one of the competitors this

66
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,750
unraveled and they caught the attackers
and the attacker slipped on the people

67
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:40,700
declared them and they went to general
but it's not all bad news the really

68
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:46,729
ironic thing is when I first gave this
talk at North SEC in Quebec City this

69
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,160
was one of the things that I found was a
group where you could get back together

70
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,160
various types of attacks hackers to do
its penetration testing things like that

71
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,250
for you if you don't have them on staff
because of me honestly not everybody has

72
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,030
these bench strength available to them
so you can do this

73
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,830
the funny thing was the data presented
this about twenty-four hours later they

74
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,830
were compromising every single user that
was using the service was actually

75
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:14,260
exposed so at least it was a good start
so given that now the attackers

76
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,730
obviously we're gonna go through really
quick version of this because I mean I

77
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,800
know you guys are familiar with this
thing but with the first off we have the

78
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,690
board kids and this is one of the ones I
always like to talk about because I see

79
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:32,010
it as our duty collectively to go out
and educate the kids today as to how not

80
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:36,400
to get themselves thrown in jail when I
first started doing this sort of thing

81
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,260
back when the world was flat I didn't
have any sort of guidance but I had a

82
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:46,130
little sick sense of I don't want to go
to prison so I learned to build my own

83
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,130
systems and do my own tests in my own
environment not everybody was actually

84
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,980
quite so lucky or so smart

85
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,650
a lot of people went to jail even today
we see with all of these implementations

86
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,340
of various cloud services for higher
that do stress testing we see a lot of

87
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,390
people getting rounded up and sent to
jail that he didn't know any better and

88
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:09,060
a lot of this is because we have the
board kid element when I was a kid was

89
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,640
bored of go outside and play hockey
because that's what we did in Canada

90
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,360
nowadays kids have access to the
Internet

91
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,180
they're bored they're looking for a
Cause are looking for purpose something

92
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,550
to be a part of

93
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,660
unfortunately there's a negative
elements out there that will gladly

94
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,870
conscripted these folks into a
disposable army of one of a better term

95
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,300
and this is one of things that really
worries me because a lot of these kids

96
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,919
make decisions that are bad and they
don't have any understanding that

97
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:41,818
they're actually making these negative
choices for example when hurt lead came

98
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,000
out let me to say that was a fun day
when her plea came out there was a kid

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,319
in London Ontario in Canada who decided
he was going to go after the Revenue

100
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,060
Canada site which is the site is
responsible for collecting taxes for

101
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,699
Canada none of us like them this kid
particularly been like them and went

102
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,770
after them using heart bleed to see as
much information as you could get within

103
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,349
24 hours the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police showed up and we haven't heard

104
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:05,770
from him since I don't know quite what
happened with him

105
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,000
the problem with him is he was actually
eighteen years of age which in Canada

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,210
means you go to jail do not pass go so
kids don't always make the right choices

107
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:21,020
you know they'll see something that
looks appealing but me and badly and the

108
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,159
problem is not only end badly you can
actually come back to haunt you years

109
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:37,000
later and lover hate the ISU squared I
serve on the Board of Directors at least

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,580
for another two months one of the
service they have is they have a service

111
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,068
actually help go out and teach kids as
well i mean Starcraft fans we got them

112
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:49,710
maybe one guy to guy alright well
Starcraft was a game back when the

113
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,568
nineties that I used to play and these
particular characters are called deserve

114
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:56,969
so every time you the premise was you
build up these resources you bill

115
00:07:56,969 --> 00:07:59,870
everything out and then these guys will
show up and destroy everything these

116
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:04,129
guys piss me off it wasn't for 14 cheat
codes I would never got anywhere but

117
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:07,460
this is how I envisioned denial of
service every time I hear about it

118
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,400
because these guys are a pain in the ass
and we would see all kinds of Sindh

119
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,159
floods and things like that too would
attack our users and it's really fun

120
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:19,710
being able to actually mitigate these
things and the problem I see is that if

121
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,529
you're not properly protecting your site
you know you could have the most amazing

122
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:27,379
looking site but if you can't protect
that you're stuck in the mud or in this

123
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:34,190
case in the pilot sheep so I had hoped
to give you are cute three data but

124
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,640
apparently our report is not going out
till December 2nd so unfortunately I'm

125
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,000
only gonna be stuck with cue to data I
really apologize for that because

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,350
I was battling with our internal folks
for right up until yesterday so here's

127
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,310
an example of the type of attacks we see
broken out based on infrastructure type

128
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:56,729
of tax the really interesting one that
got me was SSTP was one of the top to

129
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,560
attack types I wrote an article about
this and I believe it was forbes and I

130
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,359
just went through the whole type thing
is how this was a major a reflection

131
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,220
attack the Universal Plug and Play
consortiums to ground these said

132
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,780
Universal Plug and Play is perfectly
safe there's nothing wrong with it

133
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:21,230
this article is patently wrong would
like to take it down this is why we do

134
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,180
the data cuz I've seen too many times
were articles to talk about attacks but

135
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,319
they talked about in terms of hyperbole
and they want actually scare people but

136
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,090
they don't give you any raw data so I
assume we have data so almost 16 percent

137
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:38,150
of all the attack types in Q-two only
and that's actually since gone up in

138
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:42,569
Q-two we're using this as their attack
vector saw this really interesting that

139
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:49,810
they thought that I would take it down
because it was gonna happen and SACP is

140
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,670
a simple service discovery protocol and
this is actually something that

141
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,810
shouldn't be available to be an attack
but it works and this one of things that

142
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,520
a lot of people don't take into account
is that when you're deploying services

143
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:08,380
via SNMP NTP whatever it is it's like
patch your stuff patcher systems because

144
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,550
if you're not keeping current on all the
revisions of these things that you're

145
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,219
exposing to the internet you actually
becoming part of the problem and that

146
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,830
shouldn't be the case with all security
professionals this is what we do so why

147
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:23,920
is it that our environments end up
contributing to this sort of thing

148
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,680
simply because I get it we have
resources like so many hours in the day

149
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:34,589
I actively lobbied for 26 hour days and
that failed but what it is it's just one

150
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:37,630
of those things that we have to take
into account as we have to own up to the

151
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:42,660
responsibility of making sure our
systems are up to date now when we're

152
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,420
talking about a different type of tax
the one that really gets me is the

153
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:51,670
application layer attacks these always
focus on the logic or not always but

154
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,240
focus on the logic of you

155
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:59,140
web forms and things that affect how
your site is working so just simple

156
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,399
denial of service attacks have limited
utility if you're using a service like

157
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,070
ours or any of our other types out there
that is going to have limited effect for

158
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,810
the attacker the world's biggest bang
for the buck and this is where they

159
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:15,959
require some level of intelligence is
going after the application logic it's

160
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,160
simple to download until now click click
Next and I'll talk about some of these

161
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:27,020
tools later we just launched an attack
in Lego looking I'm gonna die and this

162
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,410
one of things that gets me so we're
looking at application type of tax these

163
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:33,969
are the things these are the factors
that we saw from denial service

164
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:40,709
perspective and Justin Q-two so ACV get
was only accounting for less than 9

165
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:44,899
percent of the overall tactics or less
than 10% of the attacks were based over

166
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:50,560
application type of attack so it's
really interesting but the one thing

167
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,479
that we saw a rise to greater prominence
with the extortion level attacks in

168
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,209
particular was needed for BC will talk
about it but the second now the last

169
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:04,670
year we saw these attacks were these
sites were getting extortion note saying

170
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:08,569
they would get a burst of attack traffic
and they would get an email saying okay

171
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:14,050
we've attacked you now what you gonna do
you gonna give us X amount of Bitcoin or

172
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:18,449
we're going to attack you again the
thing that really got us was the tax

173
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:23,779
traffic at that time wasn't very high
was pretty insignificant in the grand

174
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:27,750
scheme of things but the amount of money
they were asking for roughly equated to

175
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:35,000
about between 80 and $150 United us'
dollars and so this is the oddest

176
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,450
extortion attempt ever seen and it
really struck us that this was actually

177
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:43,579
I was really surprised that this is more
of somebody testing out their new

178
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:48,420
monster and in short order we had the TV
for PC or distributed denial of service

179
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,779
for Bitcoin

180
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:54,899
name ever they need marketing people and
they began to organize and the amounts

181
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,980
went up

182
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,170
and in rather short order so this is an
example of an email that was sent to one

183
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,219
of our customers saying this is going to
be the best part is for those in the

184
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,930
back I can't see it says we'd like to
introduce ourselves here are some links

185
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:12,550
the only thing that really surprised me
they didn't say Google associate know

186
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:17,569
they did just google tv for pc and
you'll find out more info so these are

187
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,650
folks that are becoming more and more
enamored with themselves that they were

188
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:24,240
actually sharing their own press with
her attack targets is really interesting

189
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,670
and they have progressively increased in
their abilities to the point where it

190
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,620
now they're asking for 30 Bitcoin and I
don't know what the current exchange

191
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,430
rate is at this point but it has been
going up so when they would launch these

192
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:41,560
attacks they have increased from half
usually half of this year ago to they

193
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,069
claim they can do between 400 and 500
gigabytes per second the reality was at

194
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,860
the time that I did this particular side
which is about a quarter ago they had

195
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:55,700
only gotten up to 50 gigabytes in size
for their attacks and progressively they

196
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,120
will improve it's just inevitable
because they're expanding their platform

197
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,550
so they will get better at it and this
goes back to the application

198
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:08,890
amplification attacks this is what I was
a moment ago when we talked about NTP

199
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:13,020
SMP DNS is perfect examples if we're not
patched the current and we're not

200
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:18,730
securing these demons properly we are
part of the problem and I mean it it's

201
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:24,350
something that we need to fix we can do
better at this and it's coming up on us

202
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,010
to take this message out to our
respective organizations as a look every

203
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,040
part of the problem are we

204
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,520
contributing to this and one of the
really interesting things was with these

205
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,290
types of attacks that we see one of the
really want fun ones with DNS we saw

206
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:45,490
using tax records as amplification so
here's a sample anatomy of an attack I

207
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,960
don't imagine this is newsday anybody
manage traffic reflecting off DNS there

208
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,500
are amplifying the amount of traffic
that's hitting the target of cool part

209
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,260
was the sample pack of the attack

210
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:05,760
target President Obama's taking action
to ensure opportunity for what they had

211
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,850
actually taken the time to take a press
release from the US white house put it

212
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,760
into their attacks to make a statement
as well as while they're attacking

213
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,310
others liked

214
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,949
thereby increasing the amount of traffic
increasing the amount of volume of the

215
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:22,930
attack I'll give him credit that was
kind of neat in that respect and they

216
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:29,359
voice their opinion whatever is exactly
that was an entirely sure so now let's

217
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,230
talk about a little bit of the types of
tools that we see because it's one of

218
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,930
things that really interests me is that
with media types we never see what kind

219
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,920
of tools are discussing on occasional
mentioned robot but for all intents and

220
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,449
purposes they don't really talk about
the different types of tools and within

221
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:48,540
the tool locker we have obviously
volumetric single injection so on so

222
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:53,290
forth one of my favorite ones is and I'm
probably gonna be sure the names of

223
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:58,329
those who have it or I'm assuming a
percentage rate if I didn't apologize to

224
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:03,630
the authors this is a really handy tool
this is very simple if you want to do a

225
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,730
single injection attack you put in the
information you click Go

226
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:14,460
it's incredibly simple to use and freely
available online so the barrier to entry

227
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:19,120
for an attacker has dropped
precipitously over the years when I

228
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,910
first started we had to read all our own
scripts we had to do all this now you

229
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:28,380
just downloaded tool and click a button
and look at me I'm attacking and this

230
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:33,900
really plays into this culture of look
how awesome I am because I can attack

231
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:38,520
you blah blah blah and which is great up
until the police show up because a lot

232
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,520
of these tools do absolutely nothing
obfuscate the origin

233
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:47,010
now this is one that we found 2012 and I
love this tool simply because of the man

234
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:53,010
so the whole cool is http unbearable
load King is what it stands for

235
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:57,130
wasn't overly unbearable but it was
really interesting that it would send

236
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:03,610
traffic at the site the user agent you
can make it a random value but here's an

237
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,990
example of the type of traffic you would
see it in your site there's really

238
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:11,839
nothing overly obvious about this
particular traffic

239
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,329
other than there would be this and
millions of his friends and it would do

240
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:19,589
nothing to obfuscate the point of origin
so the attacker had to be sure that

241
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:24,928
they're covering her tracks and if they
did not so as we go through these

242
00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:27,630
different types at all here's another
issue to be flutter this is called on it

243
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:33,850
being Canadian we have art importance we
love her don't it's very simple URL port

244
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:38,459
number of threads start and this is the
traffic that we received back it's

245
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:43,760
really really simple so anybody who has
any ability to search Google or Bing

246
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:55,250
actually you know the searches and finds
tools rather simplistic fashion so I

247
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,149
thought ok so they're not doing anything
to obfuscate their point of origin what

248
00:17:58,149 --> 00:18:00,010
would be an interesting way to change
that

249
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:04,590
oh ok somebody thought of that towards
hammer this is kind of neat this is a

250
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:09,418
Python script which actually leverages
the Tor network to launch the attacks

251
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:17,270
are pretty interesting but knowing folks
like they're like over it or project not

252
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:21,679
kind of people upset I quite liked them
so i didnt never tested this to myself

253
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,610
so this would do a low and slow across
the Tor network and it's really

254
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:30,529
interesting this is how simple it was
the use tours hammer that the IP address

255
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:36,200
number of threads and off the coast so
one of the things that we did was in

256
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,140
addition to this is just one example
there's other types of attacks are going

257
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,720
across the network so what we did was we
went through the amount of data that we

258
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,470
had from collected on our platform and
look to see what kind of store base

259
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,399
attacks are we seeing and don't get me
wrong I love story think it's a great

260
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:54,100
idea I think it's a wonderful thing
unfortunately it's much the same vein as

261
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,490
nonsensical argument were saying about
encryption right now in the media people

262
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,000
going encryption is evil

263
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,600
it would have stopped XY and Z will
actually had nothing to do with XY and Z

264
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,990
but this whole thing people like to
demonize what they don't understand and

265
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:11,679
tourism example but unfortunately have
attackers are leveraging its launch

266
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,220
attacks the really interesting thing was
born 10 port scanners are you going to

267
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,610
action with the main types of attacks
that we saw going across the Tor network

268
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,899
and compare we did a comparison with non
tour based IP's

269
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,880
and it was really interesting how they
pretty much wrapped together on the

270
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,360
types of attacks that were doing but
heaven forbid the people plan along

271
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,570
nicely so here's an example some of the
targets that were being hit with tour

272
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,899
based attacks and when I said orbiaz I
mean there were just using is how they

273
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:45,000
get their retail and financial services
were wanted to so what we saw previously

274
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,060
with the al-qassam cyber fighters were
they were attacking financial sites

275
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:55,659
namely banks and credit unions has now
shifted because those individuals or

276
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:59,420
companies have gotten better at
protecting their site and now the

277
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,470
attacker to switch their attention to
retail but by and large has not done a

278
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:08,560
wonderful job as we see in with Target
Home Depot and so on and so forth and

279
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,120
admittedly those were primarily
targeting their point of sale systems

280
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,770
but not exclusively so we do see a lot
of that in a way of attacker and heaven

281
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:21,210
forbid I do things in order so this is
actually a capture from donut which was

282
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,840
talking about a moment ago

283
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,980
here's the traffic for donut which again
is really not all that obvious there's

284
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:34,720
nothing to say haha other than the
volume now when I talk about these tools

285
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,360
I'm sure everybody in the room knows
about lower but ion cannon if you don't

286
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:44,010
really funny little to all this was
something I was put out by anonymous

287
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:49,170
quite a few years ago now and the whole
idea was they were going to use this

288
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:53,970
disposable workforce this is possible
army of kids to go out and attack sites

289
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:57,940
they provided the module and then it
would go on peaceful or whatever and say

290
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:02,330
here's the target we're gonna hit and
miss the day we're gonna hit effective

291
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:06,419
in its implementation but the thing is
anybody using this tool this tool did

292
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:10,900
nothing to obfuscate their point of
origin so if they were attacking

293
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,180
law enforcement had their IP address yes
IP address does not equal you are the

294
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:22,330
attacker but sure cause you a headache
when they show up and this really

295
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:28,340
interesting so would join the fray they
would jump in the click the Buy they

296
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,260
would check in the police would show up
so ultimately led to the natural

297
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,190
progression to the high orbit

298
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:37,740
the really interesting thing here is it
there were actually able to changes

299
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,210
using with a cold blaster packs where
they could change the type of attack

300
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,500
that we were using because lower but I
am can I was very limited and very easy

301
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:50,259
to block hire an accountant at least put
change it up just a bit and again

302
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:53,259
there's an HEB get related type of
attack

303
00:21:54,179 --> 00:22:02,009
simplistic but effective and then robot
robot was what are saying about earlier

304
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:04,500
with al-qassam cyber fighters this was
told that they were using where they

305
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,490
were leveraging compromise WordPress
installation is it was not exclusively

306
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:13,070
WordPress but primarily and having run a
wordpress site now for the better part

307
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:17,168
of 10 years I can tell you it's a giant
pain in the butt to keep secure and I

308
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:23,669
saying secure so this botnet that they
had built was extremely effective and

309
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:27,519
they were able to actually pivot very
quickly they get updated quickly it was

310
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:30,950
rather impressive in its implementation
giant pain in the butt if you were a

311
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:36,909
victim of it but it what they would do
is when they would attack the site they

312
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:39,940
would say ok we're going to attack you
at this time and is going to run for X

313
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:44,580
number of minutes and they were true to
their word which is really interesting

314
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,439
because we saw with cd4 BC they would
say we're going to attack you they

315
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,809
wouldn't say you how long or how long
after their throat you now we see the

316
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:57,210
Armada collective which has come up
which is basically a video of Duty four

317
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,210
BC they're trying the same type of thing
but they don't always make good on what

318
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,419
they're going to say they say they're
going to attack and sometimes they do

319
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:06,889
sometimes they don't I don't get bored
and go for pizza it's really an

320
00:23:06,889 --> 00:23:11,539
interesting one that we shall puzzling
out now we're positing these sort of

321
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:16,649
things out we see robot being pretty
effective platform to tools like W get

322
00:23:16,649 --> 00:23:22,129
this drives me nuts in this goes back to
law enforcement and governments not

323
00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:25,149
understanding what they're afraid of and
demonizing the things that they don't

324
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:25,989
understand

325
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:30,889
encryption W get is a very very simple
tools I use it all the time it's very

326
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:36,399
effective for doing research at one
point in the media they were demonizing

327
00:23:36,399 --> 00:23:39,908
this thing it was an attack to land
there is actually some legislators in

328
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:42,909
North America that wanted to outlaw this
which is just fine

329
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,250
not a good idea and it's incumbent upon
us to actually go forth and talk to

330
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:53,300
these folks we're very very good at
talking amongst ourselves I I start my

331
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,159
navel all day long and I talk to myself
and this is one of the things that we

332
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,220
have to do a better job of talking to
the non-security types we have to get

333
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,710
the message across

334
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:05,000
so we don't have to deal with crap like
this there's no good reason that we

335
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,160
should be doing this when I hear there
was just last night on the television

336
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:15,790
there's aus senator named forgot his
name already and how he's on their

337
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:19,710
intelligence subcommittee I use the
internment Odense loosely he was saying

338
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:24,420
that encryption is it should be bandaged
there's a real problem is helping the

339
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:28,300
attackers now to use the Paris example
which is very fresh

340
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,960
this was a close-knit group of people
that all knew each other live together

341
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:37,000
and used SMS to communicate encryption
was never part of the equation based on

342
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,530
the published information to this point
I don't know if there's anything else

343
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:45,560
they just haven't come forth with that
still obviously in motion but this is

344
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,429
one of the things they worry about that
if we don't do a better job of speaking

345
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:51,580
up they're going to start taking away
our VPN are going to take away our

346
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:56,649
encryption to the point where we're
going to become the Outlaws I mean that

347
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:02,350
has a certain cachet to it but I really
don't want to be on the run so with the

348
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:06,469
amount of data that we have we actually
have the ability to go through and look

349
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:10,190
at all these different type of the trans
and see the things that are evolving and

350
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:15,530
serious some really new stuff this
particular piece hear them talk about is

351
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:20,560
not that new actually not that new in
any way shape or form but it has taken

352
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:25,500
on a different view and I see media
grandstanding that usually says media

353
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,530
whores but I decided imma down now

354
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:34,639
a perfect example of these guys are the
lizard squad in church here is a tool is

355
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,780
really that's less not less than
expected this was a crew of attackers

356
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:47,510
that were basically gamers on a gaming
platform that shall remain nameless that

357
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,210
discovered very quickly that people that
they didn't like that we're getting a

358
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:56,620
higher score on Dustin around to be that
they could kick them off and they would

359
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,449
actually launch dial service attacks
against these individuals on this gaming

360
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:03,430
platform and then they realize quite
accidentally that they could actually

361
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:08,300
knock out entire swath of this
particular network and then they decided

362
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:14,149
oh we really had hackers and then they
started doing interviews if you're doing

363
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:18,480
criminal activity one of the things you
really don't want to be doing is doing

364
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:25,870
television interviews with the BBC two
of them did do this as far as I know

365
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:30,820
they were actually incarcerated now I
won't give him points for intellect in

366
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,830
that particular case but one of things
that they have done is they've actually

367
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:38,270
done a good job of illustrating one of
the new dynamics that when I think you

368
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:42,110
dynamics it's a great greater prevalence
is the commoditization to distribute an

369
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:46,199
hour service we see all these different
types of botnets are being built out

370
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,930
using home routers using compromised
systems using whatever it happens to be

371
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:58,520
this attached to the Internet toasters
probably next and what they're doing is

372
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:03,480
they're providing a SAS implementation
of DDoS and for a trivial amount of

373
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:09,210
money you can actually launch your own
DDoS case in point last year almost

374
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:14,630
December last year there was an article
here about how for 66 bucks a month you

375
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:20,260
can start your own DDoS and they thought
they could get away with this

376
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:24,330
believe this platform is actually still
up today because they keep moving around

377
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:29,600
but one of the interesting things when
they first world other platform

378
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,850
the platform was actually built on code
from another group called the titanium

379
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:37,909
structure group they did absolutely
nothing to lock it down apparently easy

380
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:42,710
access files are true novel idea for
them and so we were able to actually

381
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:46,020
incremental go through the site we were
able to download the user's everything

382
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,809
it was amazing but this was real thing
that really got me you have your

383
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:53,678
different packages you could do monthly
subscriptions for you distributed denial

384
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,440
of service attack the one that got me
the most was $69.99 for 7200 seconds a

385
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,080
month or you do the lifetime for 280
lifetime has not been determined

386
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:09,918
probably shorter than they would hope
but not in terms of Canadian dollars if

387
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,049
you're looking at it from buying an
American coffee at Starbucks I use an

388
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:18,090
example I will not buy it but here

389
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:24,809
$69.99 a month and take that divided by
30 days every month the cost ends up

390
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:31,549
being less than a cup of coffee a day to
launch an attack for 7200 seconds it may

391
00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:34,450
not seem like a lot but for a site that
unprotected that you just happen to be

392
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:37,830
annoyed with that could cause a great
deal of heartache some serious financial

393
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:44,559
penalties or cost at least so the first
part of that was talking about where

394
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,760
they were targeted targeting folks on
the gaming at work this is perfect

395
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,460
simple to use what's called a bitter
they can actually target the individual

396
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:57,210
users and not my flight so is so it was
really interesting in that regard to

397
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:01,760
said that tool that they were used
basically based on a rivalries like

398
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,289
kicking people off because it was kind
of annoying but that gave birth to the

399
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:11,200
stressor these are platforms that
actually legitimately exist in the past

400
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,780
I used to use one back in the nineties
for one of the financial institutions I

401
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,908
was working we would actually run stress
tests against our site to see how our

402
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:21,860
application stand up under load so there
were legitimate uses for these but the

403
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:26,639
thing is calling it a stressors illegal
artifact the idea that they're using it

404
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,030
by calling it a stressor saying we're
providing you a tool

405
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:32,889
they're hoping that they're not going to
get arrested by calling us treasure

406
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,710
because we're providing the tools but
how you happen to use it

407
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:39,640
is a different thing and when you flip
it on the head you look at it like I

408
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,380
have a hammer can build a house or can
build about the head with it it goes

409
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,669
back not to the tool to the intent and
fortunately the intent with these

410
00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:51,690
different platforms is not so much of a
noble cause but here's an example of

411
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:54,880
some of the different types of Buddhism
stressors that we've seen in her in our

412
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,549
travels you know various types here but
my favorite one here simply from the

413
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:01,600
marketing aspect apparently is platform
is absolutely terrible but Big Bang

414
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:11,110
puter and I will get into that because
this see if this works this is a video

415
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:16,490
ever found online for Big Bang buddha
where they're generating revenue it

416
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:20,399
really has gone around the other way so
some of the other highlights that we've

417
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:26,289
seen inner journeys are different types
of crews that are a rising a rising up

418
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:30,470
to copy folks like TV for PC we're
seeing more of those popping up

419
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:35,440
Joomla and others have been targeted
rather frequently and the thing that

420
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,340
really gets me a skipper in the bottom
data breaches are feeling login attacks

421
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,059
this is one of things that drives me
absolutely batty because all the

422
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:46,330
different types of sites out there if
you go and you buy something on Amazon

423
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:53,168
password everyone in here uses a
different password for each safe ok

424
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:59,200
there said not unfortunately folks like
our parents or non-technical friends

425
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,480
don't do this human nature being what it
is we can remember username or password

426
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,520
we don't have to have a different one
for different sites do we

427
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,559
this is the problem because attackers
are able to compromises site download

428
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:17,840
all the usernames and passwords as we
see all too frequently in the media and

429
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,720
then what the hackers do they take those
and run them against different sites so

430
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,169
if I can get your username and password
from whatever site and using it on your

431
00:31:25,169 --> 00:31:30,419
banking using on Amazon I can take a lot
of money in your pocket in very short

432
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:31,720
order

433
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:40,010
so this is one of things that drives me
absolutely nuts is attribution and the

434
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:44,908
media loves to blame somebody and I
don't care about this what I do is I

435
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:48,940
care about is the data so the
information about to show you is

436
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,919
actually just raw data there is nothing
to be gleaned from this other than this

437
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:55,919
is where the attacks originated in cute
too

438
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,539
based on IP whether or not they actually
came from these points of origin is

439
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:03,309
another thing entirely because we don't
track it back even further than that

440
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:08,850
because there's only so many hours in
the day and it was really interesting

441
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:13,289
that include to China came in at 37
percent but in queue when they were only

442
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:17,190
about 10% of the attack so this actually
varies from quarter to quarter and read

443
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:22,929
from it what you will and so with a
different types of attacks we see the

444
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:27,980
primary number of $100 bit plus a type
attacks have been hitting primarily

445
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,710
internal telecom as well as gaming so
these are the types of targets of people

446
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:37,960
are going after from just the sheer DDoS
huge volume of attacks and we break that

447
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:43,960
out this is obvious this is cutie
obviously gaming and suffering

448
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,650
technology are huge but the ones that I
worry about are not just financial

449
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:53,059
services but is retailing here retailers
not on a retail retail it shows a blow

450
00:32:53,059 --> 00:32:57,070
there but that is steadily increasing
why because the same information that

451
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:00,309
the attackers were going after in the
financial services they can just pull

452
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:03,678
that from retail sites which by and
large have not got the same level of

453
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,640
security for the most part some of them
are doing very good job you're on some

454
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,210
of them are not and it's easier to pick
off the low-hanging fruit from an

455
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:16,740
attacker I really don't want to be
spending a lot more work and time on it

456
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:20,130
to get the money that I want I want to
go after what's going to work so I'm

457
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:22,850
going to retail

458
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:28,919
nice five minutes or so this is
normalization of web attacks her by

459
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,820
industry again for the web attacks on
what I'm saying this is

460
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,110
application-level based attacks
financial services retail again where

461
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:39,409
the primary targets why financial
information

462
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:45,770
skip there so was in floods this is
really interesting this is how simple it

463
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:50,910
is essential that we would see that our
perimeter this particular packet was

464
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:53,610
part of a three hundred and twenty one
gigabit

465
00:33:53,610 --> 00:34:00,100
DDoS attack we were having fun with it
was rather amusing something that simple

466
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:06,840
so what are we seeing as a progression
we've gone this what this particular

467
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,670
juror for those of you in the back and
see you going from 21 2013 too cute to

468
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:14,840
2015 you can see that with this graph
wheres plotting out the different types

469
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:21,010
of attacks both on volume and in time as
you can see it nationally grows to a

470
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:25,440
much greater density in queue to 2015
for Q-three that's almost a smudge at

471
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,080
this point because that has increased
yet again i truly interesting things

472
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:34,980
like you are sure to actually see that
sort of graphic representation so types

473
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:39,850
of attacks that were doing seeing rather
single injection is the primary one that

474
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:44,310
drives me absolutely bonkers a single
injection is still a problem how many

475
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:48,520
people remember the first time Segal
injection showed up on the top 10

476
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:57,040
anybody have an idea I'll give you a
hand over 10 years ago why is there

477
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,759
still a problem why are we still
combating this this is something that is

478
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,320
a solvable problem but this accounts for
roughly 35% of the successful attacks

479
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,000
that we shall there this is shouldn't be
the case we need the sanitized imports

480
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,060
we need sometimes opus this is a
solvable problem and a lot of this balls

481
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,390
to companies in

482
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:22,870
managers that have a deadline to meet so
they are working very hard to make sure

483
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,480
that they get their product in front of
customers fast as they can so what's the

484
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,200
best way to actually shorten that time

485
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,730
bypass security I used to be one of the
gates or financial institution my team

486
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,330
would actually vet any application that
would be public facing

487
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:40,120
we have one that went right around us
luckily we found at the day they went

488
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:44,380
live on Triple take it offline we did a
test on it if anybody had actually

489
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:48,090
taking a swing at it that would have
gone down very quickly because they had

490
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:53,240
done some very simple coding errors that
would result in the problem so security

491
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,229
as frustrating as it may be for
developers is there for a reason to help

492
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:06,680
protect the in the organization I'm
sorry I stopped when the other things

493
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,410
that we saw was file inclusion was a big
thing a remote file inclusion so this

494
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:17,120
one here is for red slider which for
WordPress is a plugin that would allow

495
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,230
you to actually shift the images on the
front page so if you want to WordPress

496
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:25,650
site near you seen the images that slide
across and change visually appealing but

497
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:32,100
an earlier version of this year ago now
was susceptible to attack and would

498
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,900
allow people to upload stuff like this
which would give them a shelf so they

499
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:40,310
called the roadside herself this was
really interesting because this sort of

500
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:46,840
attack and others like it were based on
these types of issues CVE for open flyer

501
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:57,300
Green Party want people to see is he
sees TV 2009 TV 2012 CVV 2008 this is

502
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,390
from Q-two of this year

503
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:05,390
these were successful attacks are things
that have been known issues for years we

504
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:13,850
have to do a better job of securing our
environments that are it so with regards

505
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:18,089
to our applications and anything that we
have forged facing to the external

506
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:21,480
parties we want to make sure that we're
not becoming one of these we want to

507
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,820
make sure that we're not contributing to
the problem we want to make sure that

508
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:29,830
we're doing proper updates on our
systems because how long is it before

509
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:33,250
law enforcement are coming around
knocking on your door and saying well

510
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:38,910
because of your negligence your
inability keeper system's current you're

511
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:43,089
now culpable because you participated in
this attack hasn't happened yet

512
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,950
but I heard rumblings to this effect
only a matter of time before somebody

513
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,649
starts doing this so what do you do

514
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:56,750
yeah vendor understand but sequel
injection is a solvable problem this

515
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:00,480
shouldn't be a prob issue this is
something that application developers in

516
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,880
your own houses can fix please take the
time to do that one who better job of

517
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,140
hiding your systems if I can do a
directory traversal on your site and

518
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,009
2015 you will have a problem

519
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:16,320
work with your ISP is that our next hop
ups from you if you're not doing a cloud

520
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,120
implementation for services like classic
interior architecture talk to your ISP's

521
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,520
they may have some sort of mitigation
strategy in place they may have

522
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:26,290
something that can help you I know when
we asked our ISP back in the nineties

523
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:30,130
they looked at us like we had three
heads I'm willing to bet that you have a

524
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:35,930
better response these days hope you want
to look at IP rate limiting and I keep

525
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:38,710
going back to this one

526
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:42,630
patcher systems make sure that you have
proper web hygiene because otherwise

527
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:47,040
you're becoming part of the problem so
the data that are presented to you today

528
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,570
is actually pulled from the state of the
internet dot com and this is a freely

529
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,340
available

530
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:56,740
report that we do quarterly so that we
have always dated we pour into these

531
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,319
reports this free for you guys to use in
a way you see fit

532
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:03,270
we have a lot of customers that use it
for building business cases or just you

533
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:07,150
know better education for their c-suite
feel free to use it it's free

534
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:12,320
there for you to use that being said I
would like to thank you very much for

535
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,370
your time and attention today I like to
thank you and i really appreciate the

536
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:19,370
opportunity to speak with you today

537
00:39:21,670 --> 00:40:10,010
question came across one is not when I'm
well-versed on so I be rather speaking

538
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:14,240
out of school to actually talk to that
link so I won't do that to you but I am

539
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,779
familiar with it on your left

540
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:28,680
thank you for the beginning of your cock
you talk about the the children there is

541
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:37,618
something with so in France after
Charlie attack in January you had to rip

542
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:45,980
of animals fighting themself one from
French one attacking Arabic websites

543
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:50,790
with Arabic attacking French websites

544
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:55,770
everywhere like camping website and
stuff like that and what we saw is

545
00:40:55,770 --> 00:41:01,880
children making lots of the does lots of
those laws of the dispute really really

546
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:08,400
young kids and after that people are
selling that the basis of black market

547
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,640
every time all the data bases you can
find is this site and it was crazy

548
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:20,980
because you just see their what you say
about the the using they are doing our

549
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:26,900
children that we can verify that with
this event

550
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:34,020
unfortunate reality that we have to do a
better job of educating our kids got two

551
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,130
of them and one of them likes the VPN
and other countries to get content on

552
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:42,240
Netflix so she's gonna be a problem
she's been doing that since she was 5

553
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:52,680
I'm so screwed we have more questions
thank you very much
