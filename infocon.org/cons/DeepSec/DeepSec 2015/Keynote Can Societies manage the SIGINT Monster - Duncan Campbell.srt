1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,919
thanks very much thank you welcome and
good morning how would you may know I've

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,550
been here before my profession is
journalist although I also work as a

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:20,760
forensic computer experts my background
is in physics the rampage I see we have

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:28,080
the problem perhaps they see is that I
know the technology Dr help explain some

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,719
of the things that have been behind
closed doors for TK we are micro was

6
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:41,649
going to be good societies manage the
secret lost the revelations they

7
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:44,450
understand the zealously a little while

8
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:49,690
surveillance that Edwards noted the
other day but in this week at this time

9
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:55,390
we are yet to get forced to confront the
opposing evidence of its failure

10
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,718
years after these programs will reduce
the chances in the wake of the 11th in

11
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:07,220
Boston New York and Texas Atlanta
Copenhagen palace earlier this year

12
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:17,909
massive update if we fail nothing kept
the people say the question is not just

13
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,650
the tradeoff is alleged between privacy
and security which i think a little bit

14
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:29,869
but technology properly reviewed by an
understanding of the technologies

15
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:36,640
outside the secret world we could be
safer for privacy security and integrity

16
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:45,479
at the same time the issues we face the
secret but I disclosed to what

17
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,240
electrique everything that is accessible
digital communications center caps

18
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:58,429
previous the plane goal of making
everybody and yet never explain or

19
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:03,340
justify the proposal now that you've
acquired by those of human rights

20
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:11,390
the effectiveness of what they do with
the power of computer systems but what

21
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:19,548
do the people of their families at
Palace so this week was a gross failure

22
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:23,180
and it gets worse than that when you
start to look at just some of the

23
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:30,280
details of the systems we can talk about
I want to stop by making this personal

24
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,549
data connection I put your hands up
who's going to data connection life one

25
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:43,140
highway do you think your packets are
going how many people are getting right

26
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:50,420
here but this particular that the
technologies that this close by it would

27
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:59,929
appear ok but actually they are familiar
and easy to understand and it is compact

28
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:06,840
and looking at some of the particular we
could do privacy and security we could

29
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,810
do without more security means less
privacy something

30
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:49,980
like this but it doesn't just stop there
because of you

31
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:58,890
328 here there's something extraordinary
equipment which may very well be likely

32
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:04,850
be collecting all the packets that you
in the audio through your life baby I

33
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:11,829
say they have received that site that
we're pointing to the hell is your casa

34
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,110
212 the Embassy of the United

35
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:27,010
do these architecture this is so cold
with you could see the television campus

36
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:34,750
guarding it you can see the barbed wire
what you're looking at a dielectric case

37
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:44,830
these white girls to buy the taxpayer
microwaves wifi range you radio

38
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,219
frequencies

39
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:53,720
inside the electricity like your privacy
except with a big computer is massive

40
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:00,770
collection we ever got probably pictures
inside those except to rate it the

41
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:08,990
little guy that was not what you got
there safely is phased arrays likely

42
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:15,200
take a focus on anything wildfire GSM
perspective but GPRS

43
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:23,070
systematically analyze food processing
equipment usually directly below the

44
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,390
collective this type of system which is
beating

45
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,140
papers is asked to do

46
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:40,820
signal recognition across the entire
global for PC and what they post the

47
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:46,240
organisation SES is the special
collection services about it and if the

48
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,010
collaboration particularly 2013 through
the middle part of their this equal

access for collection exploration
corporation microwave wifi microwave

Familia technologies if its peak

51
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:12,680
transported by the way they have a
collection system don't just to take but

52
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:20,190
also to manage listening devices which
may be powered by radio-frequency beads

53
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:29,340
other side of the day as opposed to that
way probably about this another time

54
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:35,049
this one sits at the Trappist Russia
it's part of the international city

55
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:42,130
credit to lower college at least 40
after the supposing this one it

56
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:48,020
literally 60 probably United Nations
International Atomic Energy Authority

57
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:56,180
which is the white building just to the
left of the power right on top of it you

58
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:03,560
have to share their that's a picture we
just took a couple of days ago after we

59
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,210
burned it it's a little hard to see
against the background but here it is

60
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,289
still there that people call it what
least two weeks away

61
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:23,360
exact picture of the shared euro project
assistant coach state by the Special

Collections and

63
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:33,780
according to documents lee Brice Taton
website so that signal intelligence

64
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:40,359
collection sites located to diplomatic
facilities abroad the October after

65
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,510
their movie is not by the majority of
the diplomatic staff at the facility

66
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:52,500
which there was tried it goes on to say
just exactly what we've been looking at

67
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:59,370
the electric equipment is located so as
not to reveal the secret activities for

68
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:07,040
example it says down for the bottom line
is it's impact pulls out a picture of

69
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:14,240
peaches or bad it's completely illegal

70
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:26,380
adventure but it goes it happens with
the USA Persie's

71
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,830
accomplice about the 19th century
architecture

72
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:40,450
collected from this one which was early
exposure it was still good documents

73
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:45,890
this that you're looking at the full
potential features the windows at this

74
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,069
Victoria fill it with those anymore

75
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,860
providing facades decide which the
collection equipment and be good to see

76
00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:04,750
you this particular so I was listed with
the embassy top secret documents showing

77
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,360
the whole eight directions around the
world

78
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,360
satellites blog table accesses

79
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:17,090
some 15,000 so-called implants at that
time that small we're all packed with an

80
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:23,460
attack host computer world with the
target you going to literally millions

81
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:31,760
of computers with a black Impala we're
all big back to the intelligence network

82
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,230
talk about this is points of presence
just as you would talk about it in today

83
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,200
to protest the presence that their
points of presence of forgetting to

84
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:50,960
sales to transport systems that's very
quietly or implant security compromises

85
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:57,230
if the ground that we would use their to
exploit this is one of those out to the

86
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:05,370
survey all these top secret society this
is a radio frequency service whose which

87
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:14,270
cell phone towers could begin with
microwave leaked letter there are of

88
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:19,620
course this is not just the date the
price that is carried out by speaking

89
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:26,240
countries as it happens as you see if
your signal is being taken by the

90
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,080
British as it as it passes over to their
list which you could virtually season

91
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,890
the window at you a little higher its
classic straight through the space above

92
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:41,170
first the Russian embassy and that the
Chinese embassy and a part of the

93
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:45,670
citizens and organizations we have no
doubt they have a lot of bugging the

94
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:54,329
hell out of each other or to the north
west of you ever was a separate

95
00:10:54,330 --> 00:11:03,070
demonstrations activists went to take
pictures are the americans try to stop

96
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:20,410
that sheds reach these particular shared
played a significant role decade or so

97
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:30,430
ago which led directly to the death of
telecommunications engineer vote if you

98
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,630
want to hear how he explained

99
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:38,170
death games behind the famous
longstanding

100
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:42,819
sale is right here with us in the front
row it is going to be giving the next

101
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:50,139
night is an example of what they call
the fact that we all will is effectively

102
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:56,500
a reticle gate when they try compromise
occasions the computer systems that I

103
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,949
could do stuff as well not stuff that
may work for the kind of purposes that

104
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:09,130
would have served the people I don't
just speaking countries another slightly

105
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:20,029
for the Liberation Organisation vienes a
row of the shares at least 35 countries

106
00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:32,310
with cables satellite signals breaking
up with NSA with it such a cup to be

107
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:42,018
almost as well as participation is
passes available physical evidence this

108
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:48,910
particular site I'll bet that right is
about 50 kilometres east of here down

109
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,060
the danube in the cold war years person
it secret

110
00:12:53,630 --> 00:13:05,350
across the island near the cities which
are visible in the background that that

111
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:15,510
slide it magically expanded its been
massively expanded and repurpose the

112
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:26,459
years since 1998 Corolla waves act like
a commercial communications satellites

113
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:32,099
it's part of a medical that were cold
wrap party which

114
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,920
according to us why the partners access
international communications from

115
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,920
anywhere around the world

116
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:45,279
ready to support you and God willing and
very important top-secret at the top

117
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:51,889
there most wrap up those were the fiber
project on the cover of a compensator

118
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:59,130
what they're saying there is that like
myself techies like yourself

119
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:04,889
recognize our satellite station which
you see one because of its government if

120
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:10,319
it's this big tits not doing
broadcasting ticket but finding out

121
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:14,420
where the access the fiber optic cables
that dictate that help is much harder

122
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,729
because the cables go on about seven
miles east of Fairfax believe that their

123
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:25,100
government isn't doing Fri but I suspect
it's because those people in the office

124
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:31,459
of government now that top secret
supervising what we are often without

125
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:40,199
third-party relationships ok this is why
they were being brought up for a variety

126
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:47,389
of reasons our relationship so rarely
disrupted many of our foreign partners

127
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:56,930
capitals museum officials outside of
their defense intelligence operators to

128
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:06,410
be us' or the others say they might be
willing to share about his willingness

129
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:13,069
to do something politically risky so it
took part where access to communications

130
00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:19,880
capability is traded off against
something that made very pleased to

131
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,880
local officials

132
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:35,540
to European practical said about germany
where quickly seven separate countries

133
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:44,219
for them the date of it goes from there
to directly to it as a headquarters with

134
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:50,800
to what they called sightseer secret
site waters the Colombian made this is

135
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:57,760
also where all the day to top of
american Metal American domestic you

136
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,760
were looking at one camp legal of a
massive

137
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:16,190
feeling of what happens next targets the
language used by the secret intelligence

138
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:22,420
agencies can sound like normal English
but it's impossible unless you work out

139
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:28,660
the secret dictionary of tradecraft you
have signals intelligence that's

140
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:37,480
understandable but the man they call the
probe if they call it touching enabling

141
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:44,060
a very very gentle would specifically
beans breaking cryptographic protection

142
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:59,750
shake me again but in fact in this
context for example by BGP is so close

143
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:06,780
which have a particular with a flowing
white Paris with something comfortable

00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:31,139
a plant is that they are aware really
sophisticated advanced persistent

147
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:38,590
threats with many aspects to be negative
about so destructive capabilities

148
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:49,550
yes BC guys like yourselves or four-year
the whole process of it back to get me

149
00:17:49,550 --> 00:18:02,010
get his computer network exploitation
and then I'm seriously affect this is

150
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:08,750
making something maybe it appearing with
an organisation by sabotaging

151
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:15,390
communications it may be deliberate
physical attack of systems as a receipt

152
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:21,290
with stops matched his intended and I
was sitting around waiting for

153
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:38,520
instructions if you can actually deeply
familiar but take a long time to work

154
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:46,160
and I we never heard over to all the
stories but it means digital network

155
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:56,780
intelligence it's what they did you go
back to work ok that was having to have

156
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:08,050
to beat the deputy director of rivers
Ave left the house because of the

157
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,600
illegal activities

158
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,040
yes explain to me what specialized wars
it's pretty obvious now we're familiar

159
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,040
with it

160
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:27,050
was deep packet inspection dpi but
inside the agencies which started in the

161
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,810
companies which copy the technology to
sell dpi

162
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:34,129
it was so he can I say

163
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:40,880
cross-section icing is really rebuild
ERP sections of the other IP solutions

164
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,960
once you've taken the mobile
communication system what do you build

165
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:54,840
them into again I think this is the
first time any of these work the mantle

166
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:04,919
unit of a stolen data stream that's what
they call it to rebuild a packet packet

167
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:12,610
stream get it all in place and according
to the student papers hundreds of

168
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:17,370
billions of those are being taken from
the Global Select collection systems

169
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:25,360
every hour worked which we build another
document that you could see down there

170
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:36,639
were secret document that means the date
that Sydney Cricket Board destinations

171
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:43,650
but I was selected as well it is
possible together in the second danger

172
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:54,280
for preparing for massive long
storehouses reaction if the selection

173
00:20:54,280 --> 00:21:02,649
system want to hold hands of the section
I communication it's a massive by the

174
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:12,890
transports itself using these products
will call the databases appealed to many

175
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:13,789
of the documents

176
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:17,609
they have addressed by a dataset

177
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:29,700
heard that the professional business is
a highly technical audience and it

178
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:37,789
doesn't sound like a very strange just
never heard what does it mean looking at

179
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:43,499
the papers and with the assistance of my
partner Matt Apuzzo go to a techie who

180
00:21:43,499 --> 00:21:49,179
has helped me with many of these things
as promised we can see it's a popular

181
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:55,440
database programming approach which is
extract transform and load

182
00:21:56,599 --> 00:22:07,229
validate some elements into a database
format they have hundreds of these

183
00:22:07,229 --> 00:22:10,119
moving out bits and pieces

184
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:20,369
stores to steal the input has been
putting stuff together from many

185
00:22:20,369 --> 00:22:24,908
different sources be developed as you
would expect since the early nineteen

186
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:39,009
nineties regional systems which session
I great soul place by very very simple

187
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:47,359
very very slow speed now but in fact the
lead was then taken by about two seconds

188
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,739
automation Research Center

189
00:22:49,739 --> 00:22:58,450
that was actually led by a man who years
earlier but always be capable of

190
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:04,909
building the guy who's going to be here
tomorrow night after the showing of his

191
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:17,249
film developed the first session of the
p25 be 26 which apparently meant nothing

192
00:23:17,249 --> 00:23:22,290
at all it was mostly joking at some of
the Ohio out

193
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:34,840
the p1 b24 a system section my nose si
or 53 megabits per second and was the

194
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:41,010
basis for the first deployment so
monitoring system called Grand Master

195
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:49,680
may claim his famously was after the
code was given to the israelis and their

196
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:56,930
israeli engineers work but their signal
intelligence so called eighty-two showed

197
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:02,860
up in companies cold now those with
section Isis which event so back to its

198
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:13,639
a miami is the sixth leading to the
first aware that something very

199
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:21,430
substantial was going on and it's easy
for this system appears to be wealthy

200
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:26,070
class but we just call it a PRI will be
like to call it that

201
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:37,710
by 2006 the data rates going up to OC
for the heart you could be the first if

202
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:45,940
they could have an essay to develop
technologies founded by over weeks back

203
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:51,000
I was a little things written about a
program called Trailblazer fairly to the

204
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:58,870
ground so it wasn't into five or six
years at 2:11 logical systems with

205
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:06,159
employed under the JetBlue program the
turbulence of which something called boy

206
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:12,360
was too passive surveillance system but
also includes substantial

207
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:21,830
automatically survey intercept it
signals these packets after format

208
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,960
spotting vulnerabilities

209
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:30,580
the one end of a type II connection is a
target tomorrow with

210
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:38,910
looking for ways to attack including by
direct access to the transport pathways

211
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:46,110
to eject packets pages to send back it
was sports to see Facebook all the pages

212
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:52,929
looking for it to be effective by
automating the process according to the

213
00:25:52,930 --> 00:26:01,910
documents computers globally was by now
targeting the bill use to be a great

214
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:12,320
surprises also backed by NATO rates of
the session going up to 10 per second

215
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:26,570
Lucy 192 nations be able to track they
say that you are using is what you would

216
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:30,820
expect it to be what you would
understand to be from the ISO dropping

217
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:35,260
in just above the tracks both way of
seeing what you could get this is a

218
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:42,300
secret diagram showing the processes and
again don't know if you have the packets

219
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:47,530
if you have to lie P this stuff makes
complete sense it's completely obscured

220
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:53,230
by the main language of tradecraft
secrecy by which it was consumed

221
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,100
annually

222
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:59,169
multiplex multiplex

223
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:09,260
changes necessary I'll protected
casually communication it sat down with

224
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:18,840
the automatic decryption systems on site
or boat over high-speed packet system by

225
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:32,830
wealthy class do you see the name
recognized that Davis Street potentially

226
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:37,449
for three days so it gotta let me go
across that because

227
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:47,990
processing in the same way in retrospect
with searching therefore becomes

228
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,330
possible

229
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:53,299
databases but again that using the same
tools my secret

230
00:27:54,330 --> 00:28:02,850
clusters packages all the stuff that
this is an advanced processing it was

231
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:08,969
used as used in the British to pull the
system which was mentioned in Revelation

232
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:25,779
but last weekend show my best known work
in this area was attention national

233
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:31,159
which was the 1960's project to start
collecting promote communication

234
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:44,490
satellite where decades before the
internet documents again no secret which

235
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:50,019
I was able to publish this sum of Indian
society magazine furthering the actual

236
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:59,190
was exactly what I describe because it
was mostly program you can see there

237
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,370
correct

238
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:08,158
during the height of the cold war again
you see the extort me miss purposes of

239
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:17,990
this is the cold war was a serious
existential threat to the plan say that

240
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:22,649
the British were planning to collect
against the civilian communications

241
00:29:22,649 --> 00:29:30,000
satellites over where they didn't have
any war so perhaps begin to see how the

242
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,840
management of nature of its prized lead
to demands for the surrender

243
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:45,090
privacy and security and yet as we saw
the basic system by which the collection

244
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:50,500
from satellites was done again I really
think about using it was cold addiction

245
00:29:50,500 --> 00:30:01,020
but once the dictionary now we are told
pagers it's described here is a

246
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:13,549
selection to date back to the days of
pills then yes we just go from

247
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:22,379
satellites to do this this table is the
forward to destruction tables so it's a

248
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:29,419
fact market your this jack we have
simple you see something interesting to

249
00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:33,250
say that would it matters I'm gonna fool
with it and we can understand this

250
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:44,899
simple enough technical terms would
score system which is the massive data

251
00:30:44,899 --> 00:30:51,389
gesture to be at the Sept added to that
signals with talking about seeing them

252
00:30:51,390 --> 00:31:00,460
seeing that the principle to use to
analyze later chica bits per second is

253
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:05,429
something which is contextually
extremely simple actually walk backwards

254
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:11,110
dates back to the days of calligraphy
massive amount of information

255
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:17,700
incompetent fools focus on stealing
everybody's date and then not being able

256
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:21,450
to do the job because of that these are
the components you can see

257
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,210
organizationally

258
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:26,419
perhaps you can also see them
technically contribute to the

259
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:33,760
understanding here is part of the
manuals published number again

260
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,680
top secret of course the ex keys go
system which is

261
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:43,650
basically a Google of the actives
reviewed data communications and

262
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:48,820
communications around the internet in
the familiar way you wouldn't want to do

263
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:54,129
it real expression such a right to be at
the C++ no problem I can't think of

264
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:57,560
anything and everything you like to grab

265
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:04,870
supported you once again we find that
you can see some with the clinic state

266
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:12,830
data structures their habits it contains
the master slave event that usually

267
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:20,100
files and once again we've got this
tables from fifty years ago still at the

268
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:32,270
heart of this data processing system
there another XP school now has some of

269
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:35,580
the things you can do and what doesn't I
think is important

270
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:43,110
computer was always his input directly
at the category awful comes up again and

271
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:43,790
again

272
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:52,300
papers and what they're actually talking
about is the AltaVista Google problem

273
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:59,360
how do I reduce the number of hits we've
got this problem big time they scaled up

274
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,169
a technology from don't really want to
see the gap the day of the legacy that

275
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:08,870
that's what they did the earliest and
most book sits at the center of the

276
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:14,969
Pacific systems and one of the finest to
do we have to switch off what they take

277
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:20,360
from this is every day because it
overload and systems sometimes massively

278
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:32,959
he has a top-secret 2011 and examination
collected by SSO special services

279
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,960
organization that's the outfit that goes
into the fiber cables revealed that a

280
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,010
significant portion of collection

281
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:48,790
was repetitive better place to be to the
positive value you give the big danger

282
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:56,970
they screw up big time you can see the
explanations for why doesn't work why

283
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:03,730
they had another one if an analyst needs
to find all the people in Kabul

284
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:10,280
performing websearch is she had how
could this be done he had indicated

285
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:17,200
would result in full even as collectors
the key word use web page Logan three of

286
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:23,250
us says this is 2011 these are the smart
folk of the biggest intelligence agency

287
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:33,520
that well I think just learning what we
told you previously here is another

288
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:40,300
answer to the problem the DNI Knoxville
TN complicated reference to different

289
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:45,250
cable cap excites and third party
companies but they're basically saying

290
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:50,580
we can't handle it anymore that busy
building a massive datastore that you

291
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:56,259
turn the sent to the United States
restore a database scope it well which

292
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:02,050
is essentially these atoms right thing
and yet they can't handle the dates and

293
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:09,450
these are limitations from a particular
slide 8 p.m. thought already here is how

294
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:14,100
we view a program of XP school you
implement the threat is not very

295
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,690
sophisticated you just the categories

296
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:26,609
222 and it's going to shut down all
these communications regarding which

297
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:34,160
might have been looking at a highly not
fit for purpose I but boy do they like

298
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:34,960
what they can do

299
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:44,050
do capture with tonight to send the data
flows past clearly want to BGP protocols

300
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:47,940
of attack the one of the ways but
sometimes such as in america where they

301
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:55,490
have direct access to the carriers the
instructions can be issued by the

302
00:35:55,490 --> 00:36:02,500
communications providers they are
targeting to get inside networks secure

303
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:07,070
systems above all because that is what
they seem to hate most of all and I

304
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:13,359
think that they can't get their biggest
so these are British top secret

305
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:18,900
operations to get into mobile
communications whose on a property

306
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:25,470
system here and have been using them
tonight proxy there we are all out if

307
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:32,118
they wanted to the GI tract systems
which have overwhelming of data they

308
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:38,640
want to do the gateways and they wanted
to the building housed access to this

309
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:48,210
particular operation targeted Belgica
Gaul Belgica medications provider right

310
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:54,170
there in the attack tables you could see
the autonomous system numbers 6770 look

311
00:36:54,170 --> 00:37:01,510
it up if you work in this area you're
fine see you tonight a massively attack

312
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:07,640
buttons GCHQ it's not in the middle east
it doesn't support terrorists that's

313
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:18,339
what they are doing he also attacked and
satellite stellar context use their

314
00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:20,359
ability to map into the

315
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:25,460
to see just how far they've got into
side streets of tolerance systems and

316
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:30,650
it's linked networks and the results of
factly horrifying this diagram about

317
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:34,940
getting the second is taken for men is a
strange about which is there essentially

318
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:42,359
global but for cyber war and in this
particular diagram if they have

319
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:49,680
collection then they have a red markings
inside the simpson soon if they could

320
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,989
get Google Inc

321
00:37:50,989 --> 00:37:58,640
that's also show you can see just left
only have ownership of both note both

322
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:06,859
systems but access to the communications
between them yet they still did most of

323
00:38:06,859 --> 00:38:12,779
these systems on this diagram which
includes eight European autonomous

324
00:38:12,779 --> 00:38:19,609
systems appearing with the German
companies access points that's a great

325
00:38:19,609 --> 00:38:26,619
achievement for getting to steal day
date but it didn't stop both events in

326
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:37,489
Paris Paris back to the USA embassy and
that is totally 14 piece of architecture

327
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:43,460
damn embassy share heated to look like
the windows were booted there in

328
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:49,960
Victorian times this massive structure
is set to the bottom of it got a

329
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:55,489
wonderful line of sight to the
president's but apparently as President

330
00:38:55,489 --> 00:38:57,470
Obama said this weekend

331
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:05,899
know like and cited all the people who
did so much of the city's streets what

332
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:12,180
they collect powerless WikiLeaks has
recently published in this week's top

333
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,700
secret global

334
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:18,470
highlights targeting top official

335
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:23,580
trade negotiations targeted what really
happened

336
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:32,270
able or interested or competent to do
anything about it while I was putting

337
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:39,040
this all together now this document was
deployed in Venezuela where it once

338
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:46,290
again another set of APIs issue ads is
targeting the government's records

339
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:57,880
wavers between the company and its a
point to visit which perhaps to pick up

340
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:06,590
a time tomorrow night is that by going
for greater scale evidence evidence of

341
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:18,530
history you're the last 10 years
including this over which their

342
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:29,290
satisfaction that they are so clever
that nobody but us the security breaks

343
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:40,779
at work days he could dramatically
failed this document you start what I

344
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:47,580
would advise you to act or think about
your practice 0 click to politics go

345
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:55,140
back to the technologies that will be
developed in the late Mr busy we'll talk

346
00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:02,950
about the hymie select they were
directed to throw away earlier the

347
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:11,250
points of specialization that which was
not use here you see some serious going

348
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:19,970
to a guy in 2006 to see what the Germans
are doing the Germans were still using

349
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:25,660
code that the NSA in the mid-nineteen
night which was restricted ensuring that

350
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:31,399
analysts for example protected traffic
protecting civil liberties discarding

351
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:41,180
stuff they also give us a clue that if
the walls of secrecy only sensible

352
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:48,410
technologies applied there was a way of
making security privacy trade or not

353
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:53,770
zero sum game by throwing away as much
as possible

354
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:59,800
allegedly at the session ization of
collection points to enhance the rally

355
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:05,790
you that which is retained this is
thirty just at the bottom of the german

356
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:14,200
system can make judgments that practical
level specialization I can see this

357
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:20,180
before this time seeing that do
politicians think we come from the

358
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:29,480
planet Mars thing I ask you to take away
from this toll in this context this work

359
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:34,869
could you bring your knowledge or ideas
of security systems and protocols that

360
00:42:34,869 --> 00:42:43,330
this problem would say colleagues is the
word out to making privacy protections

361
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:50,690
and the nation's systems better while
also perhaps as an effective as a result

362
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:56,650
in housing security and making it clear

363
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:06,640
evidence-based privacy and security do
not trade off against each other that

364
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:28,430
way perhaps society can repurpose I
think we have seven to ten minutes

365
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:31,598
before I think we have time for
questions

366
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:45,990
you mentioned the problem with the sheer
volume of data do you think it's just a

367
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:49,410
matter of time that they solve that
problem

368
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:57,580
sheer volume of danger on the evidence
appears to be the problem getting as

369
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:03,710
much data as possible but I've also had
to get to be realized

370
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:06,800
simply finding that which you want to

371
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:13,810
is a major problem I don't think there's
any street or simple answers but the

372
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:23,740
older collection of day to be over which
the investment systems failed if you

373
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:38,319
look at the records of the investigation
but there was it was also put into the

374
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:45,670
technical collection systems are not to
be old Peter McGrath follow people who

375
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:54,040
belong to work of trying to cover the
evidence base lesson of the year since

376
00:44:54,040 --> 00:45:00,460
911 he is not necessarily what you would
predict but it does appear to be

377
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:08,780
evidence that the collection of big date
doesn't work the fractious introduced a

378
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:14,330
new surveillance tool there's something
to massively increase the date the case

379
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:17,330
and yet

380
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:37,150
I spent my last five years is that there
will be a security agency or whatever

381
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:47,120
you need me i running way we live I
could not US citizen that you has done

382
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:54,720
any move against GCHQ out there any safe
from my perspective do you think they

383
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:05,830
will change if how the question is
whether as a strike for you whether the

384
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:17,200
EU will act decisively through limited
collection systems I am fearful we first

385
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:22,930
address this I think in the context of
an investigation into the actual system

386
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:27,529
which I was asked to lead to them they
spent another year

387
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:37,180
Jackie to see if I was writing included
I was there was a massive proposals to

388
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:44,520
enhance security but there could be
other things and restrict access to that

389
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,890
which is bullshit they were all passed
by the European Parliament

390
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,940
Vista September 2001 we know what
happened next

391
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:59,060
the problem almost is not so much but
he's will be situations with the media

392
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:04,900
my profession because every type of
attack is interpreted the most

393
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:14,080
simplistic way as justifying military
attacks or domestic surveillance and not

394
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,810
in a politically mature way to build
security

395
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:26,910
without a devastating to the middle east
of europe you have to see it in that

396
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:33,899
context but we're probably going to see
that the blood on the streets of powers

397
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:38,670
like the blood in the streets of New
York Washington Post will be exploited

398
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:49,530
to demand more surveillance so
catastrophic failure of the political

399
00:47:49,530 --> 00:48:00,150
institutions to UK long-term response to
what is reported I wish I could be

400
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:06,329
optimistic but any more questions

401
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:21,450
thank you for that to your last point
friends are actually trying to pass

402
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:25,930
constitutional changes to give them more
rights to privacy so it will be harder

403
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:33,759
just asking for more weapons the other
aspect is the world's most common

404
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:39,360
question but technologies made it just
easier to do this right this has been

405
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:44,870
going on for centuries there is no I
mean we've not been on learning from

406
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:52,190
history because you know one classic
example of a French incidents but the

407
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:57,880
14th will decide that he could put
everybody inside outside and spy on them

408
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:04,160
as as he saw fit right so I mean we know
we will be introducing any new concepts

409
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:13,629
we just made it easier because the
technology I i agree with that said

410
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:23,750
there's nothing the week goes back to
before biblical times

411
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:44,040
that's the best step it up to the lake
point to the tokyo would give I think

412
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,009
very tough time thank you again
