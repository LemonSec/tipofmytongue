1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,319
everyone so I'm going to speak a little
bit about several incidents and

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,300
cyberattacks how we can or how nations
can response about against this type of

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,429
incident that are happening now every
time so it's quite well talk is not

4
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:18,960
going to be buried technicalities summer
interested them because it's all the

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,550
time in the news and it's good that you
know what is going behind all this level

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,810
so we know that the incidents are
increasing rapidly and everything are

7
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,370
more and more damaging and they are
becoming the Afghan already a concert

8
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,820
for national security for for a long
time however until now there is no

9
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,180
common approach about how this these
things and Sarah are being addressed at

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,010
the at the local level at least national
and international level so most nations

11
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:52,199
are are working or half were cutting in
what will be there they're approaching

12
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,690
how they deal with with incidents using
their own criminal laws there are also

13
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,070
some approaches for international
cooperation bad

14
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:09,010
lot of all this different solutions are
crashing and there is no no really

15
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,060
international organization that says ok
this is how this should be the owner of

16
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,490
this is what we could do mainly because
there is no remembered in the nation's

17
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:21,479
about how this should resolve there are
differing types of of cyber incidents at

18
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,270
the same time we have what in this talk
I will yes concentrating what they

19
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:30,780
called savored criminality in a portion
of our community that will be what we

20
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,050
called cyber attacks and there are no
agreed definition about what all this

21
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:41,840
means so we will try to to come to
Tucson definitions well speaking so

22
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:50,979
ok that should not be there so the
program way we have all these challenges

23
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:55,140
legally are also well known by most of
the people so one thing is is that

24
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,830
revolutions in cyber with no its not
immediately know who is going to be

25
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:05,289
there they were questioned the shit in
the attacks and also we have a single

26
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:09,410
jurisdiction so they're incidents go
over the frontiers of where the borders

27
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,870
of the nation's so it's very difficult
to enforce your national laws when the

28
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,070
incidents are adding another the people
who is attacking innocent and other

29
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:26,209
jurisdictions another problem is that
the incidents are targeting

30
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:32,210
critical infrastructure that are mostly
private managed to operate Lee operated

31
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:37,780
and so how we need to have some
cooperation with the private industry

32
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,250
was also this is private industries of
national interest that they are not

33
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:51,050
getting tired so that's a problem so
there is also a very fine line about

34
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:55,850
what you can say civil criminality and
what you can say this is starting to be

35
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,670
a not an issue of national interest so
you can see their denial of service for

36
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:06,149
example if it's it's it's just
criminality criminality that you can

37
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,160
deal with international criminal law but
if it's for national interest and it can

38
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,430
go into the realm of cyber attack this
national interest this happen without a

39
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,500
car for a bank if you are talking about
us we're still in the hundreds of

40
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,750
thousands of hours for a pair of
accounts think it's just normal

41
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,440
criminality but if you try to bring
complete financial system back to the

42
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,790
bankruptcy thing it may be national
interest and they happen with things

43
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:36,739
like spinach if you thought and
financial gain its product but if you're

44
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,210
still there

45
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:43,160
for national interest so it's a very
fine line and it's not define exactly

46
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,090
what is what

47
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,580
so that's a lot of problems there are
some some characteristics that you can

48
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,400
say okay if there is a need to resend
nation then you are going to speak out

49
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,510
and attack the title going to be
critical infrastructures than you might

50
00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:04,590
be speaking at the national interest
then you might be there when you're done

51
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:14,510
much as you might guess so they're also
more important for sure it's not

52
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,988
everything so easy like you ok we have
these characteristics and if we know

53
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:21,880
then we have the solution because you
have problems with attribution we spoke

54
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,650
we have national sponsor attacks are
things like both but you can rent so

55
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,190
it's very difficult to know who is the
originator and what is the motivation of

56
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,480
a lot like this I think the couple will
be contended that is very difficult that

57
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:43,390
going to reach agreement on that were
there are three sticks like for example

58
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:57,300
their target yeah I hope that yeah two
characteristics that are for example the

59
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,640
target and the perceiver damages that
mostly are miserable and I said to be to

60
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:10,880
be known so they are always available
they cannot be contended so if we take

61
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,390
this took a risk that our moral issue 22
message if we go out targeting of

62
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:19,039
persistent much for tires we can see
that it's quite easy to find what are

63
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,880
for example critical infrastructure so
is this the you s presidential directive

64
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,250
21 at least all that are critical
infrastructures and it's quite a

65
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:37,060
distance of almost everything he could
to you have government's health care so

66
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,930
that's that could be things that are
important and that in fact I it could be

67
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:49,840
considered a cyber attack damage we're
speaking about the consequences of the

68
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,039
attack resemble those of armed attack
then you might be speaking out or if

69
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,760
there is something that is exceptionally
grave

70
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:13,060
ok now better it's moving well I'm
moving but I hope I would try to move my

71
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:34,810
style ok yeah yeah ok so now we can
continue its good now it's better thank

72
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:35,330
you very much

73
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:42,190
ok let's go now that we know more or
less the framework let's go about their

74
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:48,800
what the low to high level so when we
spoke about crime it's it's very good so

75
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,260
it's legislated by most nations we have
criminal 0 everywhere we have for

76
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:59,200
example in Europe of cybercrime and
there is a lot of international

77
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,500
cooperation so we have to answer if

78
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:11,650
someone is making criminal cyber tools
can be prosecuted and there are tools

79
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:16,549
for forgetting them but when you speak
about attacks then basically there is

80
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:23,370
nothing so there was there was UN United
Nations initiative to to make some legal

81
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:29,360
instrument serious attacks but it didn't
get very far so it was felt at the

82
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:36,199
moment there is nothing that has been
agreed by all nations the only examples

83
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,880
of the united nations to come is parked
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act so we have

84
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:48,760
a lot of samples are from the USA but
this is the closest thing that we have

85
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,900
22

86
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:58,320
guidelines about how we should speak
about cyber attacks but it has a lot of

87
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,760
caveats so the first thing you'll retire
down it's prepared by an international

88
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,010
group of experts at the invitation of
the natural products have a different

89
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:15,590
centres of excellence so that means
first that this is not done by seven

90
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,380
percent difference in traffic still at
work is done by a group of experts so

91
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,740
that means this captures the essence of
this group of experts debris will

92
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,930
expert but I guess they are sort of
experts are not something that nations

93
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:36,400
have said the second caveat is not a
center of excellence is impact not not

94
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:44,189
indicate that is just organization that
is far ground-based some countries and

95
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,880
is funded by this country's but it's not
capturing what not to or not a nation

96
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:55,939
said whoever with all these caveats it's
still the only all the best approach

97
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:03,770
that we have at the moment for how cyber
attacks could be treated like it works

98
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,649
by

99
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:09,430
making oncology between what incidents
in the cyber world are and what

100
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:15,800
incidents in the kinetic or are you just
try to to say okay if a cyber attack

101
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:23,709
will be compared to what connecticut a
quick do I will be deal with it and with

102
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:28,449
this analogy is that he can use what is
called international humanitarian laws

103
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:37,498
of the United Nations chart so we go to
the nation's the first one is what could

104
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:41,389
be a cyberattack for the Italian manual
a severe attack receiver operation

105
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:46,449
whether offensive or defensive that is
reasonably suspected to cause injury or

106
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:49,998
death to personnel and damage or
destruction to objects so there are

107
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:55,019
there some points that are important
when it when it says is reasonably

108
00:09:55,019 --> 00:10:00,809
expected that means is not only that you
are causing but also if the action is

109
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:07,029
for City Council thing then it's still
covered under the under this definition

110
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:12,620
and the other is that it speaks really
about how much destruction of persons

111
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:18,870
people I speak several physical effects
so if this cyber attack remains in what

112
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,870
is the cyber war and does not cause
injury or death according to this

113
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:31,120
definition is not attack will not be
treated like an attack whoever they are

114
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,759
they finish so I put their went from 100
way that is a researcher that is working

115
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,990
alone time and this is just a test
consists of any action taken to

116
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,240
undermine the functions of a computer
network for a political national

117
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:49,879
security purpose so completely different
here spokes about the purpose of the

118
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:56,420
attack not about the results here she
spoke about any action so it does not

119
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,849
have to cause physical damage in order
to attack so it's it's a problem that

120
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:06,199
there is no agreement on what even what
the basics of water taxis

121
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:18,340
ok so now we are going to start speaking
about the United Nations child's so we

122
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:23,270
what the Taliban logically says the
first thing that we have to to consider

123
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:26,640
when we started speaking out attack in
the kinetic war and then we will see how

124
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,670
we are we translate that into the cyber
world is whether you are or are not so

125
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,750
there are two different courts of law

126
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:42,270
along with the other is just so they
just seem below is going to tell you

127
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:46,980
what you can do when you are in war so
it's going to tell you you are already

128
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,880
fighting you are killing people this is
what is allowed and this is what is not

129
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,470
allow so I believe you are going to do
this you will be a war criminal

130
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,630
while they saw their actions are out so
I'm not going to discuss muscle that

131
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:07,420
because it's quite a lot of people I and
the legality of its a very important

132
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:12,199
asset value is more important because
it's more of these actions are taking

133
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,610
place so it's when a nation has the
right to initiate a war so you are not

134
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:23,200
in war you are in business debtors but
so is attacking you is taking so long

135
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,500
hostile actions against you and then the
question is a chance give you right to

136
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,080
respond or give your rights to initiate
a war is steady such as that you're

137
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,600
receiving or even consider a heart
attack so this is what we are going to

138
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:46,000
the speaker right now the first their
point the status at the culture of the

139
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,640
chapter for the culture of the united
nations so it says what you can retire

140
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,850
at the cyclists that you have to refrain
from jews from the use of force so says

141
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:00,900
it's private it for all nations that are
part of the united nations to use force

142
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:06,270
against other nations so with that
definition is quite PC now we just have

143
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:12,240
to say it's a cyber incidents use of
force if we know if its use of force but

144
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,240
of course it is not that easy

145
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:42,029
right we have interference that's a
little bit on the borderline depending

146
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:46,820
on the interpretation might be allowed
or not legally and then you start going

147
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:56,750
into their room of use of force and when
you go really far their highest would be

148
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:02,700
an armed attack in which you use weapons
weapons to attack our country so it's

149
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,120
important this definition between this
difference between use of force and army

150
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:12,670
attack because we see that they're this
brackets between use-of-force an armed

151
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:19,490
attack there are a gray area in which
nations cannot affect self-defense so

152
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:24,240
you are being attack so are you doing
something illegal against you but you

153
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,740
cannot self-defense I can start that's
that's what we can see here that fifty

154
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:35,980
one of the United Nations this article
that says that you can use self-defense

155
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:42,650
if you are the target of an armed attack
so the national debt nation says nations

156
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:47,449
cannot use force against you but you can
only self-defense if that force close to

157
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:52,060
the level of an armed attack there is
this area there is great area for use of

158
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:58,349
force in which you are still being not
really well we can go to the attack is

159
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,579
not an armed attack that you are being
attack but you cannot self-defense

160
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:06,400
yourself and this is very clever from
United Nations because that's troubling

161
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,819
this coalition of course so was it clear
what they try to say okay we don't want

162
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:17,730
that you responded in this response will
escalate to award so we are this gray

163
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:21,980
area there in which you can respond by
other means to cover example of coercion

164
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:27,170
but you should not responsive attacking
your country you cannot you have not the

165
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:32,270
right to self-defense yourself even with
you going to into the area of what we

166
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,550
will call the armed attack against still
even when you have the right to

167
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:41,130
self-defense is not that you can just
execute self-defense you want so there

168
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:46,670
are so on some routes their electricity
and proportionality society tells you

169
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:51,449
that you can just south of offensive
it's basically the last option that you

170
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,900
have if you have no other options

171
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,709
a proportionality tells you that first
you have to assess what was the damage

172
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:03,160
that we are talking to you and you have
to respond proportionately to those

173
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:13,439
damages so if you are subject to an
armed attack you will have right to

174
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,040
self-defense if someone is yes

175
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,260
threat or using the forest for you to
you then you cannot solve the fence we

176
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:28,480
will you can imagine already now that
broad range of cyberattacks fall into

177
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,890
this gray area which you cannot not
self-defense they are illegal wrong for

178
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:42,470
that they are non forceful so in this
area will say we can use question you

179
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:47,000
can use sanctions you can use maybe the
controversial drug doctrine but you

180
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,950
should not be able to do you say to go
to war basically that's because we will

181
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:57,960
see that the cyber world that this is
poking a lot of times it's really the

182
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:03,140
saturated at least legally solid
countermeasures that I was just

183
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:07,990
mentioning so this unilateral unknown
forceful measures so they don't get

184
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:11,459
bored armed force that's because it
could be a possibility to respond to

185
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:16,420
cyber attack and they are doing exactly
for that for for defending about

186
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:21,890
internationally wrongful at the problem
with controversial speller lot of

187
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:27,310
caveats but one thing is that the idea
is to stop the ground doing estate to do

188
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:32,300
whatever they are doing and the Arctic
cannot use kind of a kind of revenge so

189
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,210
radically I use the contras message to
force you to stop

190
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:42,779
attacking me and once you have a stop we
are done so its own conditions it could

191
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:48,710
be used but this is probably not the
panacea for the problems

192
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:57,090
ok we were speaking about this area that
the process

193
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:02,360
cyber attack and we say that if we have
a cyberattack down with cancer will come

194
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:08,100
through as self-defense now we go into
what we can say society erratic and

195
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,799
there are three different views there is
no agreement also here there is people

196
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,649
that's a that's a cyber attack is
considered armed attack only

197
00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:20,600
conventional military weapons are yous
so thats restrict its quite a lot

198
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,059
because you don't use conventional
military weapons for cyber so I example

199
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:29,360
would be for example bombing computer
servers so that's a very restrictive

200
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:37,370
restrictive you basically if you took
that you will be just probably use of

201
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:42,510
force but no one of them will escalate
to what we call an armed attack we have

202
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,379
another view that is the target based
approach this coast yes on the other

203
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:52,370
side of the of the of this color so in
this case it takes that everything that

204
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:57,178
Toyota assistant at this important
enough it can be considering attack so

205
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,940
if you are targeting a critical system
it will be an attack irrelevant of

206
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,279
whether you make too much or not just
for targeting such a system you are

207
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:10,159
already attacking me so the problem with
that of course is that it's it's it will

208
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:17,640
escalate so it will leave their grind
the grounds for a lot of Nations 2230

209
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,559
self-defense and two it will initiate
lot of wars so the last used their

210
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:27,049
victories approach and this is the one
that is defended by by most people

211
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:34,870
basically says you can see there a cyber
attack attack if you can say that you

212
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,668
can see that the effects of the attack
dosed at your house without physical

213
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:40,930
with a kinetic

214
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:46,810
weapons so if you are destroying
something if you are killing people and

215
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:52,679
this killing of this destruction is
caused not by bombs but by cyber does

216
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,940
not matter how you have caused this deal
is an attack because it's the same the

217
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:05,250
same damage that you are causing this is
the main way to to go and this has

218
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:13,590
somewhat Italian Le Manoir proposes so
now this this was basically what is

219
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,560
there in in what is low

220
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:20,230
know what I was going through some
examples of of cyber incidence I will go

221
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:24,600
from from the low-level to their highest
level and I will discuss a little bit

222
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,389
based on what we have learned what is
what what's cooler or how you will react

223
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:35,550
against them so that the lowest level
will be figure 3 I'm printing or making

224
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:40,540
some kind of traffic analysis traffic
monitoring for this kind of things I

225
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:44,450
don't think that anyone is going to be
worried about what I'm not at the

226
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:53,070
national level not at international
level they are probably legal there are

227
00:20:53,070 --> 00:21:00,480
no no legal implications for doing those
things if we're going to a spoofing when

228
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,170
you are masquerading I use resides and
you try to to gain some elite and better

229
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:12,990
benefits with it well soon legislation
that will already criminalizes spoofing

230
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:17,870
a mainly if you if you say that is going
to be four for making illegal acts so if

231
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:21,939
you are going to commit fraud are going
to perpetrate a crime that could be

232
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:27,050
prosecuted by the criminal law in solar
installations but it still does not go

233
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:31,120
through to the levels of use of force of
these things that we spoke

234
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:39,460
we spoke about this kind in that lot of
people here is maybe doing so in this

235
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,830
case there are legislations for
prosecuting

236
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:49,090
militant Sunday cumby can be prosecuted
if you disclose with the ability and the

237
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,659
Company does not like what you are doing
depending on which legislation you are

238
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,240
you can have problems

239
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:01,160
the USB Digital Millennium Copyright Act
can or cannot be depending on which

240
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,720
pages you use but it could be used for
for prosecuting disclosure

241
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:11,610
vulnerabilities other nations is just a
grey area and there is not a lot of

242
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,270
discussion

243
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:19,260
social engineering you know that this is
quite legal so you can't control you

244
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,690
with wife route with France related to
activities in connection with success

245
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:27,430
devise an authorized user of credit
cards there is the use can expand the

246
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,260
privacy and electronic communications of
the United Kingdom so if you

247
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,500
if you make social engineering again
this is still on their real of criminal

248
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,679
law it will not go to to to the levels
that we were speaking during the current

249
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:48,900
international an Italian though we go a
bit higher we are going to acknowledge

250
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,669
me shoes and for that I understand
basically use system resources from

251
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:57,610
Planet processes so this is just
installing a mall where for example is

252
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:01,000
something so simple extolling the matter
whether or not I still in anything you

253
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,160
are installing them over there so it's
still that's illegal in most legislation

254
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:12,000
so you you are you can tell you with
since like authorized access to computer

255
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,929
material success with intent to commit
or facilitate commissioner for fence or

256
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:21,730
unauthorized modification of computer
material the convention that we are

257
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,880
spoken for their from the Council of
Europe it tells you that destinations

258
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,230
that they should criminalize this kind
of offenses and you are for example the

259
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:36,799
UK misuse art but also say this is our
fence because you are basically making

260
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:42,230
damage to the computer so you are
comparing the operation of a computer

261
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:49,780
and you should not be doing that so this
is this is just for four changes from

262
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,200
biting the computer even if you are not
doing your not stealing any that are you

263
00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:01,410
not doing anything it's quite a strong
ally of services that you offer as

264
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:04,380
almost every 10 days

265
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:09,240
illegal and their most national laws so
you have the article for other with a

266
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,580
post-convention it's also tells their
the company's to criminalize that you

267
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:20,500
have to use Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
also speaks about causing damages

268
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,860
without irritation to a protected
computer and you can discuss ok denial

269
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:29,178
of service is not causing damages but it
is because they find a much as the

270
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:34,500
impairment of availability so that's
covers the denial of service and then it

271
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,080
comes there because this is quite use
you know this has been used

272
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:44,010
in lot of conflicts against nations and
then the question is is this can this be

273
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:50,549
considering army attack so for this
there is not much discussion because

274
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:55,610
they do you need to charge the article
41 is quite clear on that so it it lists

275
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:59,889
here a list of measures that they say
that they don't do not involve the use

276
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:04,149
of armored force between this measures
you can see that is the partial

277
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:10,139
interruption of economic relations
service here I posted a graphic audio

278
00:25:10,139 --> 00:25:13,039
and/or other means of communication

279
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,408
well you can of course discuss if if if
it's something of communication but I

280
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:22,760
think for my interpretation is quite
clear that it will be cover into this

281
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:32,779
article 41 so that allocation here we
are speaking about espionage basically

282
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:36,179
you are still in the comments from from
a company you are still in the command

283
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:44,669
strong from a previously north does not
fall under international laws so it's

284
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:51,179
it's very damaging its criminalize by
the by the national laws the National

285
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:55,429
Coming allows criminalize as pure Nash
and international laws do not say

286
00:25:55,429 --> 00:26:02,710
anything so it's it's not an attack not
use of force is internationally accepted

287
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:07,519
that they all do it and they are not
going to go to work for that whoever

288
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:11,139
nationally of course they will
prosecuted for example the German penal

289
00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:14,939
code you have there were gathered
information or producer Mark ice hockey

290
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:19,330
with intention to hang on just affect
access to someone with the to somebody

291
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:25,710
else that will be prosecuted so that all
nations were prosecuted locally to you

292
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:29,120
will never go to war because they are
spy

293
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,840
it's quite curious this this German
penal code because it's even just

294
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:42,600
developing the tools shoes can be
criminalized that very strong so now we

295
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,110
are going to their to the highest levels
in which you for example modify that you

296
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:54,389
are you are intentionally going to
modify that this is nationally this is

297
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:58,450
the same like like the misuse that we
spoke before an effective if you modify

298
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,540
that they might charge you first with me
she was because you access to access the

299
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:06,870
computer and then with other charges
because you made all the things like

300
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:14,809
Alterian that whoever can we say that
this is a tech so there is discussion

301
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:19,050
there's people that say of course
because you can temper that time such a

302
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:22,559
way for example that you can bring the
complete financial system of the country

303
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:29,410
to the ground you can just delete all
the accounts of our country and yes the

304
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:34,100
complete financial system out and that
will be great enough and targeting

305
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:40,600
system that is important enough to be
considering attack it's theoretically

306
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:47,439
possible I personally think that that
will never happen because in particular

307
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,990
the banks they have strong business
continuity and disaster recovery so they

308
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:56,230
are one of the few organizations that
they do with cyber mainly because they

309
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:59,870
know that they are dealing with money
and they have a lot of revelations that

310
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:05,300
that tells them what they have to do and
I cannot imagine the bank cumby attack

311
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:09,030
and they don't have the means to recover
from a backup or from another

312
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:13,980
alternative site within hours that they
will be there will just lost all the

313
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,030
data that will be really something very
difficult in my opinion

314
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:26,389
and these are the two cases in which you
could start speaking out about really an

315
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:30,230
armed attack so if you if you are able
to make a denial of service to our

316
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:35,000
system and the system is control and
physical resources and you can pray

317
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,540
example united people to access to
emergency services or two ATMs or to

318
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:46,550
electricity or water networks or sensors
networks so in that case is you could

319
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:51,700
cause death of people you could cause
damages and that's cool

320
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:58,190
go to the to the level of attack and the
same happen if you explode system the

321
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:03,250
abilities with them to destroy things
and that's what the case of techniques

322
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:08,720
so this too will be armed attack but
then the question is occurring on the to

323
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,590
be an armed attack is still you have to
speak about the severity of the severity

324
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:16,949
similar to what you will do with an
armed attack then this will be two cases

325
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:23,360
that could be covered by by
international law as the final byte

326
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:30,699
element of course so practical you so
that you know you know ready because you

327
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,710
see it in the news but the to see the
application of all this that we are

328
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:39,020
discussing so when you saw istook next
most of the people say this was at least

329
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:45,430
I have to force if not an armed attack
whoever you wouldn't see Iran going to

330
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,660
the united nations and saying they are
going to start a war but they resorted

331
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:57,210
to use to attack retaliate attacking US
banks that's what they did so I thought

332
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:01,360
they will have have grounds to to go
further they didn't choose to do that

333
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,669
this thing happen if you see this
persistent threats the report on the

334
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:12,300
persistent threats 128 sorry there was
no snow that they are going to insist P

335
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:16,340
nash the green sabotage they are
misusing that the tampering is proof

336
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:24,649
India doin lot of run things against
nations who ever wore a toupee 28 as far

337
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:28,490
as I know there have been no actions
against them so they say they have a

338
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,160
vision problems with that so

339
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:36,270
they have not done anything against the
one about the one that deceptive YouTube

340
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:42,540
22 China I so it's not that they are
initiated any action United Nations or

341
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:47,030
try to to say okay I'm being obtained in
the present the pressure would say they

342
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:51,520
are being attack but in reality they
will not respond

343
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,230
legally as if they are being attacked
they will respond locally as if it's a

344
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,110
criminal act and this is what they did

345
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:03,729
dictated fight people and tell them okay
you are accused of hacking economic

346
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:09,840
espionage and this kind of things I
thought they knew that they are hardly

347
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,179
ever going to to get those people but
this is basically the only solution that

348
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:25,930
they had so to conclude the talk with
pecans seen this in this truck is that

349
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:30,220
basically at the end of nations will
resort mostly to international criminal

350
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,100
law and international criminal law i
think is the way to go to sort this this

351
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:41,730
kind of conflicts evening if if it's
difficult that you get this tradition

352
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:45,640
from some countries for example is most
likely that that you're going to request

353
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:50,920
that the two are going to try to restore
to start a war and this means that I

354
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:55,930
believe the sidewalk is highly unlikely
and it's our turn to this very

355
00:31:55,930 --> 00:32:00,440
accelerated if there are attacks that

356
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,200
that will be done much in most of them
are going to fall under the use of force

357
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,040
and you are not going to have the
possibility to self-defense so this is

358
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:12,560
not going to escalate to a war
nevertheless and there is just a very

359
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,720
very small slice of attacks that you
could say okay this is attack that could

360
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,240
be able to to start a war but it is
really a small and the ideas covering

361
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,650
this international law that we discuss
in this Taliban while but again this is

362
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:31,000
not even accepted by all nations so it
does not mean that if you are going with

363
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,860
that of the united nations they would
say yes you are right and you have now

364
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,949
the right to self-defense they can
always say this is just opinion of some

365
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:43,760
people and we hope we have another
opinion and another important takeaway

366
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,450
is that this is going to change in the
future so that the nations are not

367
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:54,780
working as far as I know in into
operating in this area so mostly just

368
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:59,760
that after we continue for a way it's
such a nice area because at the moment

369
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:06,690
everyone is trying to operate into this
area for use of force and they all know

370
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:10,560
that as long as the operating to this
area of use of force and you don't go

371
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,409
through through this wrestling which
will cause massive damages or kill

372
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:19,910
someone you are quite safe to go there
is nothing that the other nations can do

373
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:26,370
against you a part of may be complaining
or making some kind of coercion and

374
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:33,409
therefore it's quite an area for for
everyone so that will leave you have any

375
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:36,870
questions

376
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:54,199
now this is just my personal view this
is just us two morrow so of the Taliban

377
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,230
well with my comments on my personal
view that's also because I'm not

378
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,970
presenting it under any

379
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:06,710
never did tell Emanuel is a natural
product I looked at the list of people

380
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,139
who wrote it

381
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:13,889
experts there were mostly relegated with
nato or native friendly its institutions

382
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:18,389
how many Chinese how many russians how
many Iranians were on that 1010 telling

383
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:26,310
manual like an author author lists are
you aware of similar documents from

384
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:31,710
other and other groups are not aware of
this offer document that has kept the

385
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:35,389
white audience of this document may be
there if they are frightened something

386
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:40,889
but I'm not aware of it and ruin your
question it may be that the authors Dr

387
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:47,460
Easter authors that that's for sure
through is for sure not true that so its

388
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:55,030
has nothing to do with not one that I
have a question about you very last july

389
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:58,030
2 is as you say it's cyber war is highly
unlikely

390
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:05,029
yeah what I see is that big nations are
all hiring Dorrell they called cyber

391
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:11,190
warriors and I would say Stuxnet was a
type of cyberwar think the question is

392
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:16,770
how do you define cyberwar when you say
it's highly unlikely but I'm trying to

393
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:21,220
to say that this highly likely that
because of all this we will speak out

394
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:26,890
all these incidents and I was showing
you that include none of them really

395
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:31,250
escalate to the level of of what will be
considering I tuck me in this United

396
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,480
Nations Framework so if you don't have a
tax

397
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,540
united nations that not recognized those
actions as a tax then you can never have

398
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:42,190
a war because you are never not talking
to their country you are of course doing

399
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,600
illegal things that is not an attack

400
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:49,230
so as long as you don't go through this
level that says now you are attacking

401
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,170
the other country and I recognize that
you are they can get their country you

402
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:56,520
can never being war you will be making
illegal things you will be using force

403
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:03,830
maybe but this never got back into the
country and this is what a lot of people

404
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:10,410
try to a standard list wrestling with
you will go into into attic and I do I

405
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:16,279
mentioned as darkness fell that could be
maybe the only case in which I will be

406
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,870
able to speak out an attack but even
that most of the people think it was

407
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:34,529
just use of force not even an attack but
the us- government personal personal

408
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:39,270
management office was hacked and tens of
thousands of their staff including CIA

409
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:44,730
staff and their security clearance
applications and all these things that's

410
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:49,830
also very serious and I think they're a
lot more things we don't hear about its

411
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:54,460
in that case for example if you follow
this this reason that we were speaking

412
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:59,600
it's very serious but you are speaking
of espionage and i think is that

413
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:07,319
recognizes that took so it could not go
to war because of that problem and say

414
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:07,990
this ideas

415
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:12,990
nevertheless there is no nation that
have that have say okay i agree with

416
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:18,240
these ideas of a group of experts so
does not mean that this is the true

417
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,709
there is no trouble now so that have say
this is the truth and this is we have to

418
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:26,840
have this request from this nation and
we accepted so there is no prior

419
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:34,150
jurisprudence that you can say this is
we know that we can use this unless you

420
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:39,570
have this country will now indicate or
whatever that's ok we recognize this is

421
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:44,470
