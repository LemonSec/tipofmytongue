1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,138
hi everybody has it was introduced by
talk about a job security

2
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:12,610
this is the first time that so far
enjoying I would like to thank you for

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,109
staying for the last talked and I
sometimes there is a bit rough hope you

4
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:22,750
had a day for concessions and I hope you
will enjoy my attention to this targets

5
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:28,099
for my personal experience also in my
current position as positions before you

6
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:32,369
go deep dive into their job security
well I would like to express myself

7
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:38,989
separately under security leader type
work a lot of people ask what is

8
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:44,968
security what is the security leader and
what does it do so busy I'm in charge of

9
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:50,420
the project security from head to toe
this means that for example security of

10
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,520
my cycle is under my responsibility

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,050
processes and evaluations from the
requirements all the way through beyond

12
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:04,849
talking to customers getting feedback in
response basically I'm in charge of

13
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:12,548
making sure that our products go out
secure also as a result of that strategy

14
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:17,600
and process driven I mean I did you
plant a few steps when it comes to to

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,970
the products because we're security
company and also need to implement the

16
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:27,340
process as efficient as possible to make
sure we are secure and I don't like to

17
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:34,630
do things halfway or only partial manner
the insecurity I'm in pain in the ass I

18
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,399
don't like to get things done

19
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:44,000
50% of 60% I didn't think is done
correctly so this is also why I came

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,330
here to talk I've been around for a ten
round 10 years in the security industry

21
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:55,380
in the past I've been doing some
consulting services was a security

22
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:02,000
researcher and i dont son I have done
some tension testing as well so all the

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,030
different worlds and still I feel that
this talk is far enough to emphasize

24
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,680
this development lifecycle a little bit
about sidebar

25
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:19,750
iraq was established in 1999 is located
mostly we had partners across the globe

26
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:25,350
and we are truly in the field of
privilege against security we feel very

27
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,320
strong about security actually was
encouraged to come here and also by my

28
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:36,150
company but I don't want to talk too
much about summer access it is also if

29
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:45,239
you want to please look us up we also
hiring so if you see something I like to

30
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,130
start my lectures with a quote this time
according to its

31
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:56,079
should not talk about a job security
there are a lot of best practices out

32
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,150
there a lot of guys on what to do and
how to do and sometimes it's not that

33
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,930
easy to implement them I had a lot of
questions regarding this process which I

34
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,970
I did find answers for these questions
by myself so I had to implement these

35
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:16,040
practices and see where it fails or if
they fail and I'm sure there are people

36
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:22,720
in my position that rides things and it
didn't work so I want to come and talk

37
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:30,810
about to help these people and to help
you or it will be interesting to adjust

38
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,810
their program to be at stake

39
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:41,010
compliant with agile development so I
don't expect you to go back and sit in a

40
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,899
bubble bath with a shotgun but I do
expect you to take something back to

41
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,900
your program if you need them

42
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,239
let's see what we're going to talk about
it first I want to synchronize with you

43
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,930
about what is a job how many people are
practicing edge lol your daily basis

44
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:05,120
year 2011 ok which is good so we'll do a
short introduction I'm not going to go

45
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,609
deep inside just going to talk about
then going to talk about on frameworks

46
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:18,470
for development lifecycles and there but
they don't talk about how to collaborate

47
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,350
with other R&D functions regarding
security because a part of this movement

48
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,330
into a dressing area is to talk with as
many people as possible insider

49
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:33,520
departments and empower them to help you
with your security program and the last

50
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,169
thing we'll be talking about why am I
actually talking about this topic why

51
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:43,659
security development lifecycle I don't
he's not as sexy as a key to our homes

52
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:51,250
or talking about tour networks will try
to show you why this is the cornerstone

53
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:59,030
of security when it comes to reaches its
response and other aspect of security so

54
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:04,400
let's talk about a job first what is
that job a job as a concept as it was

55
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:12,780
around many years but was formalizing
2001 a group of 17 software experts from

56
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,388
the group and tried to talk about why
development processes are failing they

57
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:22,009
had some for cornerstone concept concept

58
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:27,689
which are presented here basically these
things are valued by the singing green

59
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:32,749
things that great are valid even more
they came to two cents about individuals

60
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:37,169
the fact that that the development was
focusing on the process rather than the

61
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:44,258
people pushing it at promoting it was
causing the processes to fail so there's

62
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:47,610
that interaction and individuals in the
center of the edge of development was

63
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:54,059
reports also working software offers
comprehensive documentation when you go

64
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:57,009
to a customary once you show him what
you got

65
00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:01,490
you don't want to then tapers 12 percent
definitely want to present the OC so

66
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,059
it's my parents really things are not
completely ready so you can show them

67
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:10,629
instead of just got papers and showing
them to customers another example is

68
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:16,309
responding to change over following your
plan even though it is hard for me the

69
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:22,490
security professional attitude to go by
this concept it is ok to change demands

70
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,770
during during development changing
requirements rather than falling

71
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:30,979
implanting oh sorry we have plans until
the next few days so we're not going to

72
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:36,849
change anything because if you respond
to changes you will probably lose

73
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:43,128
customers in today's world so this is
basically the production of a job and I

74
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:48,099
will talk about two famous methodologies
in a job just to make sure that we are

75
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:56,300
all we are all in the same the same line
the first one is called strong strong is

76
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,870
based on short cycles basically the test

77
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:06,700
task as a kid in school from a product
that clock that product catalog is owned

78
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,680
or managed by someone called product
owner or against feedback from customers

79
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,950
as well as from their requirements for
the company to try to create a container

80
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:22,860
of futures wants to to be developed to
be developed actually these creatures

81
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,900
coming in the form of stories instead of
having technical requirements saying

82
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:35,929
this API integration they think about
what do you want to do I want to be able

83
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,820
to upload this so it's much more
comprehensible to understand rather than

84
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:46,870
just about you that the future is passed
into the Sprint backlog which is called

85
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:53,630
the Springbok lock is that managed by
the development team to test it

86
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:58,520
dispensed by the Editor spent you
supposed to have something deliverable

87
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,849
this means that by the end of every
spent you will be able to show something

88
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,820
that works

89
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:11,110
a future that works this is a purpose of
the short cycles to do something that

90
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:16,690
works the cycles could be want to four
weeks following today's world because

91
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,760
their online services and they're very
popular there could be even less than

92
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,760
one week

93
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:33,549
knowledgeable because it originated in
Japan actually teared up your task into

94
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:38,299
small parts and to ship them between
lanes or faces as they are ready

95
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:42,469
which is called just-in-time principle
is means that you don't think that our

96
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:49,380
project movie 2011 faced another phase I
just tried to shift the task when

97
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,410
they're ready

98
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:55,550
an important concept in the company is
working progress this means that every

99
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:01,630
phase regulate has a limit of the number
or limit the number of tasks that are in

100
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:05,880
it and if it reaches the maximum you
cannot put more tests until you move

101
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,820
something out of this late today nicely
this is what creates the flow

102
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:17,139
so these two methodologies actually
represent the ability and the dynamic

103
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:27,579
the dynamic nature of a job development
in the letter was a job

104
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:32,279
concept and also talk about security now
as we just went through the edge on

105
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:36,999
production and I was so what how it
integrates with security or sometimes

106
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:41,069
not integrated with security one of the
content is to deliver working software

107
00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:44,069
frequently from couple of weeks to a
couple of months

108
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:50,769
referring obviously couple of weeks if
you were you our business on it this is

109
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:55,970
great because it means you will ship
your product out faster and it will be a

110
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,389
lot more value and there will be more
free agents if you're a developer it

111
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:05,470
meant that the test will be smaller and
everything will be simpler and much more

112
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:11,439
there if your security professional it
means that you're about to freak out

113
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:17,329
because if you had this time to do your
security task now you have a lot less

114
00:10:17,329 --> 00:10:23,868
time and to do it again again so when
you going to add value are sometimes and

115
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:28,339
I don't think you should give up so I at
first tried to find a framework that

116
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:35,819
would work with a child development so
what we have today insecurity we have

117
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:40,229
been based security development
lifecycle programs like Microsoft or

118
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,489
south of Cisco they published their as
the OC online and something you can

119
00:10:44,489 --> 00:10:51,959
follow them all sort of maturity models
to sample the BSI mmm you also have

120
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:56,309
standards by and other institutes that
will help you

121
00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:05,059
unfortunately those frameworks are very
general and not very edge of driven it

122
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:09,019
does case you might consider that you
have some compatibility issues with a

123
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:13,549
jail and you want to think about which
hold those famous really work with each

124
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:16,569
one of them or maybe the only one I
could find

125
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:25,660
was microsoft does SEO by Microsoft was
revised in 2010 this was presented in

126
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:32,350
black cat actually they took their
regional air security of our life cycle

127
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:39,440
and classified into three classes test
their happened every sprint

128
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,200
happened every few sprints which is also
called bucket and once in a project this

129
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,640
is the one time only this was a very
radical change the significant changes

130
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:57,620
to help working security and that's all
together however if you examine some of

131
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:03,230
the tasks or the classes you will find
some difficulties for example if we take

132
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:09,440
every spent requirements you have
running analysis tools daily or rebuilt

133
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,610
their footballing faulty features
filtering and escaping libraries using

134
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:21,070
strong crypto which is a big general but
ok so let's choose a test and see if we

135
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:29,360
can do it every spreads just just work
let's say we going to do a threat

136
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,150
mouthful of the new features

137
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:37,230
however as we said before we welcome
changing requirements even late in

138
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:42,660
development which is a principle I
personally very alike or I like to hate

139
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:47,280
because when you ordered a review on a
feature and you have the complete

140
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,760
security analysis and everything is
great and then a product comes up and

141
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,430
say well done in two weeks before
release the customer wants to change

142
00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:00,620
something could you maybe do another
review of the future and I like but I

143
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:07,530
did it already and said yes I know but
its needs to be redone like okay so this

144
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:11,100
means that ollie is not only for new
features but also for a change features

145
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,160
which makes things a bit tricky because
threat modeling in general

146
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,130
supposed to be kind of clear desk

147
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,700
but it's not a very small one because
you need to choose your approach is it

148
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:30,880
what is the center of the approaches its
tack to software assets then it to map

149
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:37,750
everything as actors and she pointed out
the data goes through those competence

150
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,690
and what kind of logic happens for each
case everything so much I think about

151
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:49,330
this for every feature you or change
ever spent and it got something which is

152
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:56,290
not very light weights or not very easy
to do ever spent so how do we get out of

153
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:04,199
this mess as I said before you need to
coordinate with your product this is a

154
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,970
very this is a key principle to get
things done right at the top

155
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,530
his after of the backlog and this is
funny because whenever I see this

156
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:17,130
picture and I think about the product on
my company I think about this what they

157
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:23,480
have to say look like this one which is
a bit too even if you are now in sprints

158
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,440
in as a sort of spent the product needs
to probably knows what's going to happen

159
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,080
in three four five or six princess and
you need to talk to him to make sure

160
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,480
your coordinated about what's going to
happen first

161
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,360
you can you can tell what's the future
that about to be developed are sensitive

162
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,360
which of them need your attention more
than others

163
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:51,020
rather than that of the bucket test that
I talked about before like briefly

164
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,680
because you have to spend the one time
in the pocket some security personnel

165
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,329
like to squeeze them into one spread to
do them all together and it did against

166
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:04,670
Penn called a security spends so you can
talk with product on and tell them ok

167
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:09,240
I'm going to do all the testing this
spent please allocates resources for the

168
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,470
team and you can negotiate over this and
it will be much easier and also you can

169
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,720
talk with their product owner and tell
them okay for this product if it that

170
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,140
the main threats are ABC and you can
agree or disagree but eventually you

171
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:26,840
will have to synchronize understand what
is the cutoff for the most important

172
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:31,340
threats because it will save you time
and the product will be happy because

173
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,340
you know that whatever you find his
relevance

174
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:41,830
so this is by the way every time you see
a star after all if this luxury you can

175
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:48,510
go to these last days of the tapes so it
will take some time searching and other

176
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,689
portable the most efficient and
effective method of conveying

177
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:58,610
information and within development team
is to face conversation no more emails I

178
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:02,170
don't like big threads and talking
e-mails link Skype whatever it's

179
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:07,020
sometimes a bit worse and I do like to
just jump to do next door and meets the

180
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,470
people and talk to them however for
example instrum there are also meetings

181
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,310
called scrub dailies which means
everyday you meet and talk about what

182
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:20,410
the team does you have dispensed summary
of the spring planting and retrospective

183
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:28,360
so they are otherwise not security
related necessarily but you do want to

184
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:34,260
be there to just to make sure that
nothing goes unnoticed so you sometimes

185
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,340
feel like this at our meetings just
everywhere their meetings and nobody

186
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,710
anymore you get like all your outlook is
just stuff with

187
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:50,600
so let's do short exercise that say that
your security professionals which you

188
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,580
are and you and your company to spend
his two weeks you're overlooking four

189
00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:00,830
teams when it comes to security and its
team has a daily of 15 minutes a meeting

190
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:05,270
for hurting mister synchronize and why
they do the calculation adds up for

191
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:09,280
about 10 percent of the time it doesn't
sound much but that you waste 10% of its

192
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:16,599
just understand what's going on and it
doesn't have to be dirty a lot of time

193
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:21,599
to do something else so the way we saw
this is too

194
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,089
appoint security checkpoints it means
that you go into teams and you talk to

195
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:29,299
someone you know these guys that can
help you

196
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:33,100
these guys you are very curious or a
security friendly as I like to say

197
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:38,559
because they stay after elections you
give the ask questions they care they

198
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,980
want to know what it is they read
something and it's up to you that they

199
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:51,350
could be really strong resource just
because the time before but also because

200
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:54,949
they probably know the product better
that you if you're in charge on sale of

201
00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:02,150
products they know that the headquarters
you may not reach by yourself so this is

202
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:11,270
a very structured as far as I'm
concerned if potentially just joined the

203
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:25,158
darkside security so there's also a
growth potential for a team ok himself

204
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:35,850
the best architecture is warranted
designs self organizing tips no its not

205
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:36,969
as they used to be

206
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:41,690
today have a lot of functions inside a
team across organizational structure

207
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:46,740
expected to go more it expected to touch
code by other of other genes that other

208
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:54,740
products in order to promote features
that it works sometimes it doesn't need

209
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:00,929
some help anyways this is how it's
happening now and the structure of the

210
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:07,650
team is very versatile because you have
developers and architects QA Analyst

211
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,700
they have different

212
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:16,450
they are sometimes unexpected don't know
what to expect when they know they can

213
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:23,559
be also very specific skill but security
you don't really know what is the

214
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:28,260
security is expected results

215
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:33,379
the fact that they would expect you are
the security guy that helped the team to

216
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:40,620
be extremely strong and do all the tests
do all the things that you do all the

217
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:52,139
things that concern is the pain of the
team customized training I've seen a lot

218
00:19:52,139 --> 00:19:58,590
of companies use one session it's all
kind of thing where you just go over the

219
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:05,850
basics of security at this does not work
with a job this just doesn't work any

220
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:13,320
more about who needs and what needs to
what you can create your position

221
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:20,439
example from a product which is a
general example you bought from a

222
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:27,149
website to track certify that give you
it's important that they will test

223
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:31,209
because he felt that it just going to
your session go out today to forget

224
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,630
everything so if you make that road test
it's much more effective and also

225
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:40,850
recertifying the better to make sure
they brush up on what you told them this

226
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:47,129
give you some flexibility carrying out
the security just also sometimes I can't

227
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:52,220
lift up across organizational effort
security

228
00:20:54,429 --> 00:21:03,460
this is an example that we had training
for cross organizational functions we

229
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:08,799
thought that first everybody's optional
to all the sessions there's no one who

230
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,869
will not be able to join us we feel that
something should order mandatory for

231
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:19,649
some positions which one to build up
people in management positions we felt

232
00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:26,918
it makes the time for testing so just
want you to be presence decisions rather

233
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:36,889
than learning positions that's so some
of them just 35 that's okay with us this

234
00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:41,869
is for is a great track because each
other and how they can how they can help

235
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:56,789
I would like to talk about is the reason
why I'm talking about to develop a life

236
00:21:56,789 --> 00:22:01,169
cycle as I said before it is not
something very attractive today's

237
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:10,009
securities landscape however there are
several links of the chain when it comes

238
00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:19,009
to get rich and I feel that it fell
apart is the first link still see will

239
00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:27,190
show how strong your software is there's
defazio release security deploy software

240
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:35,909
deployed obviously there are people out
there that would like to research to

241
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:41,379
prove it they will treat your customers
environments so I will be going over a

242
00:22:41,379 --> 00:22:44,389
few famous lines

243
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:53,640
development lifecycle this will be also
based on internal sources which i will

244
00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:00,050
share with you the first one is we will
fix it post-release something was

245
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:12,919
discovered two days before the release
date will be released as is the

246
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:22,390
application security he's the CEO
security election two months ago is real

247
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:29,960
and he showed a survey that White had
had the QSR based customers and they

248
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,910
showed that the average time to fix days
was very versatile but there was nothing

249
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:46,090
less than seventy days average to fix
what did have a year so even if you

250
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:52,139
don't you want to know there will be
some exposure four-year term it is this

251
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:58,390
is something which is not acceptable for
critical very high high boy or girl

252
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:09,250
tease so I feel that this reasoning is
not very strong data with this other

253
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,590
things I sometimes like to hear that
once I could be its people that post

254
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:21,310
release is OK even if it's out of reach
the customer will surely

255
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:36,170
well had a survey by itself we ask 600
sea-level CEO CIO since the S l's about

256
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:40,620
how they feel about different

257
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:51,640
fifty-five percent feel safe to say that
will take days or less to detect that

258
00:24:51,640 --> 00:25:04,300
there is a bridge how many here feel
that days to detective rates exactly a

259
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:10,520
face of it is accurate let's say that we
have other 45% that it was a week's

260
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:18,790
specials represented they don't we just
don't know obviously the bitter fight so

261
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:30,250
this as far as I'm concerned I'm sure
that there are other factors to bridge

262
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:37,470
rather than bad practices of development
wrong those managers felt that 50%

263
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:49,280
reasons leading factors for every
security either you deploy the software

264
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:56,540
it securely did you develop things
without proper SDLC so this is also very

265
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:01,940
true obviously there is a 30 percent of
technical sophistication but if someone

266
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:06,870
goes for that direction again go back
and say hey but if they're very

267
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:10,939
sophisticated how are you going to be
sure you got to detect them days or less

268
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:26,640
so it's kind of a game here to think
that someone else's fault that would

269
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,630
like to discuss

270
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:42,100
be about that our lives separate labs we
have an analysis tool that we can say

271
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:50,919
the connection between Windows host
between windows-based hosts and we saw

272
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:57,380
for example that works just not very
secure unfortunately how would you

273
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:14,660
define Ivory Coast has access to other
windows-based holds you would like to

274
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:20,000
guess what is the threshold of the
high-risk access to 50% of the other

275
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,740
machines 60% gases

276
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:43,430
80% that hosts which is 88% of the other
Windows based host so if I go for

277
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:51,230
example for the 51 and you're sixty
percent there's like this guy that works

278
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:59,080
that were sampled over the computers
with access to 80% of the decade or more

279
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:09,280
and the right on ninety-one percent over
90% of their hosts all the roast with

280
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:14,520
access to over eighty percent of the
other hosts so it was very connected

281
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:20,810
network very secure so saying that it
doesn't matter as a lot of companies

282
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:27,330
anyways when you see this kind of data
it's irrelevant because if you

283
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:37,610
infiltrate 128 percent of the network
just dangerous and also think that

284
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:47,439
companies are being that works since
it's a risk but you can really see that

285
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:54,010
doesn't matter how many computers are
the word because of the high priests

286
00:28:54,010 --> 00:29:08,370
coast is just fluctuating between sizes
so it's really not based on size ok just

287
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:13,699
run by to invest in and everything else
will be treated by a really is that I

288
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:26,990
use this is incorrect and I invited to
take your order to force the traditional

289
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:41,110
I would like us to go back over the lazy
dog she is very commonly used today if

290
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:44,699
you're a security should be integrated
however in practice

291
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:52,740
as you did i do adviser to go over the
presentation if you practice development

292
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,450
for the stars

293
00:29:54,450 --> 00:30:04,220
tips and there's a long chain about
security as DLC is the place where last

294
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,220
Lynx chain

295
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:45,480
so for example having dispensed summary
has to have something very few of the

296
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,680
activities that were done that spread
this is about the government's we have

297
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:55,760
also we also use compound for the task
to everything else will get some sort of

298
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:02,030
security great how much attention will
be focused like something relevant as a

299
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:07,410
graphic changing a website or something
that changes the authentication

300
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:14,870
mechanism to balance out this reflects
the cards were put on the board this

301
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:21,719
also helps us to track things as for
screen specifically we mostly use the

302
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:28,990
security options as well as we set also
we have a continuous review of the

303
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:38,120
product roadmap to make sure that does
this region

304
00:32:45,580 --> 00:33:03,800
45 minutes

305
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:11,540
measurements one of the suspects was
also measuring so since we was company

306
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:16,030
boards we first for the security
emissions which are not the development

307
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:22,970
we've used we measure how much time to
take from planning process to done so we

308
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:26,960
have some sort of cycle time of death
time that it takes us to carry out a

309
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,990
mission we also measured the average
time to fix some work so we know if

310
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:37,790
something is out of the agreed timetable
is 246 according to the severity of the

311
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:44,260
bug is the second one and this one is
every time a task in the development

312
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:52,780
team goes to done that is we actually we
review all the activities of the task to

313
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,360
make sure that even if we are far from
releasing we have a fight with Sprint

314
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,699
until the release we have time to cover
up if something was not done so these

315
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:12,630
are the three key elements of measuring
the training table

316
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:16,179
p.m. was optional yes

317
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:24,810
I wish I could stay ahead strong control
of product management harder they are

318
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:29,339
very experienced that somebody could be
very stubborn luckily my company their

319
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:37,159
operating but I wanted to go into this
product measures and say you need to be

320
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:42,300
my security session you could do that
unless you have a backup of your manager

321
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,899
because it can lead to situations I
don't know if the product pages is part

322
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:51,348
of your department outside so if you do
it and I think it should be done with

323
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:52,260
wisely

324
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,580
this is why I said it optional lots to
see people running around chasing p.m.
