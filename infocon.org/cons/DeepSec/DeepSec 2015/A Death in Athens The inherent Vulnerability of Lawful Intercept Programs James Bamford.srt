1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,559
thanks very much really great being here
I loved being in the perfect place to do

2
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:19,270
a talk I used to come here a lot when I
was covering the cold war for ABC news

3
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:26,640
so my job is chasing spies here in
Vienna and my most memorable times being

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,670
arrested by the Austrian secret police
and then interrogated for about two

5
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:48,120
hours this was this guy he was one of
the most wanted american spies who is

6
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,089
running a very big firing near Vienna he
was a former army officer and I were an

7
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:01,870
interview so took me about a week to
find amusing idea how but I found him

8
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,089
and then I want to follow him around the
end of her about it

9
00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:10,270
half a day just see where he went before
I approach to interview didn't know was

10
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,179
the Austrian secret police are also
following and they could understand who

11
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:19,790
I was so after about an hour or two they
pull me over and pulled me out of my car

12
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:29,189
to me down I thought I was a thousand
from the communist countries trying to

13
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,929
assassinate

14
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,869
defected to the west here to to austria
so anyway that was my last experience

15
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:43,220
here so I'm happy to be here not under
interrogation and get my little talk

16
00:01:47,430 --> 00:02:05,140
the last few months ago basically on on
this case and asked I'd really been

17
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:11,150
fascinated by it for years there was
then an Athens where this huge bugging

18
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:17,630
operation was discovered it was an
enormous scandal in Athens or was it was

19
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:22,380
basically like watergate in Athens it
was discovered that somehow some way

20
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:31,049
somebody was the major aspects of the of
the government the Prime Minister his

21
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:38,040
wife Mary of Athens most of the top
officials in Greece and that was back in

22
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,459
2004 during the Olympics there so that
became a big scandal but nobody knew

23
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:49,000
what to do with it because nobody knew
who did the buggy I mean they did a

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,549
number of investigations in Greece and
then come up with much evidence well I

25
00:02:54,549 --> 00:03:02,930
interviewed at Snowden spent three days
with Moscow hang out with them and I did

26
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:09,290
the cover story for wired so in addition
to interviewing him I also got access to

27
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:15,329
documents and going through the
documents I saw documents that dealt

28
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:24,320
with the bugging the Greek government
the Greek telecom system in the snow

29
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,730
documents that have never been revealed
before so I really started to look into

30
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,899
it and I found a number

31
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,230
sources in washington that's sort of
what I do

32
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:40,409
specializing in televisions so I had
some top and it's a CIA officials i

33
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:47,439
talked to and what I told me yes it was
a it was an essay bugging operation not

34
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:53,470
only that it was a rogue operation that
was done without the permission of the

35
00:03:53,470 --> 00:04:04,810
CIA chief of station and at one of
things I just recently if you wanted to

36
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:14,019
look at this week is did a piece on the
attack and Paris just came out a couple

37
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:20,548
days ago in time and one of the things
that the director of the CIA came out

38
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:22,299
with this week was to blame

39
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:29,039
basically blamed for the fact that the
failed in its attempt to discover this

40
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:34,080
before it happens so I wrote a piece
basically saying that nothing you do

41
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,060
it's known it was just bad intelligence
the NSA's mysteriously every intelligent

42
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,590
every terrorist incident since the
beginning so it wasn't really anything

43
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:52,729
in a big surprise this is the person
that was involved in the Athens of fair

44
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:56,159
that's what was called an advocacy at
the fair

45
00:04:56,159 --> 00:05:02,680
Costas was a really interesting he had a
master's degree in electrical

46
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,419
engineering

47
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:04,190
got that in

48
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:12,340
UK it was about to be married he was
happy living a very good life in in a

49
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:26,919
sense and some more pictures of him and
then he was found a picture of Matthew

50
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:36,030
Lee took him down he was hanging in his
apartment and it was hanging from the

51
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:42,460
ceiling leading into the bathroom what
happened was the day before the CEO of

52
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:48,469
Vodafone the big wireless company in
Greece discovered now where they

53
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:53,960
discovered the power huge piece of
malware and they had it removed the next

54
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,489
day

55
00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:00,890
causes was found dead so obviously led
to questions how did this happen

56
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:09,610
what what was causes connection again
there was no answer because there was no

57
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,500
leaks from the USS nothing came out and
again this is one of the reasons I

58
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:22,380
decided to look into this year's one of
the documents with this article I did

59
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,130
does which I've been writing about
Tennessee forever but is one of the very

60
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:31,240
few times you could take an NSA
operation from the very beginning to the

61
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:37,470
very end show exactly how the whole
thing worked so very first thing and

62
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:43,040
this should be a wake-up call to
governments in Europe actually anywhere

63
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,270
around the world

64
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,000
America

65
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,100
other places is the end table come into
a country and those Salo you gotta have

66
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:56,140
the World Cup where you gonna have the
Olympics you have some big event will

67
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:03,150
you need us because we can tell you when
there is going to be a terrorist event

68
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,849
because we can search for all of
communications so you don't have a scam

69
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,340
in US bug your home

70
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:14,169
telecom system and we can help you you
know we're there to help you so that's

71
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:20,340
what they did they got the permission
from the government to come in and do

72
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:26,500
the do the bugging you with this stuff
in here from the student archive talks

73
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,270
about is they've been doing this for
years that I say it's been going around

74
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:37,539
to various Olympic venues and saying
we're here to help and let us come in

75
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:43,200
here and after its over will disappear
you'll never hear from me again so

76
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:49,860
that's pretty much what Tennessee's
pitch was to the Greek government so

77
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:55,540
that's the agreement at this was from my
intelligence sources the Greeks identify

78
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,660
errors that so the NSA put these devices
in there and they told the Greeks ok

79
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,360
when it's done

80
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:11,169
turned out not so coming from both
documents and also from senior officials

81
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:21,299
of the key things and this is something
that is very rarely discussed especially

82
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:27,460
by the CIA is when they want to do these
kinda operations you can do a fair

83
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:35,460
amount remotely but if you really want
to get in there and get a lot of you

84
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,070
really prefer to have an inside person
somebody in

85
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:47,770
country who works for the telecom system
and this case it's the CIA that actually

86
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:52,800
goes in there and recruits a spy that's
their job CIA's human intelligence and

87
00:08:52,800 --> 00:09:00,829
technical so they had a CIA person that
went in there and this is what the

88
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:07,510
intelligence sources you could just read
that and it's a legacy collects the

89
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:13,189
technical side but they need the human
aspect of so they really need the CIA to

90
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:33,740
do that so this was the recruiter looks
like santa claus actually that's a that

91
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:40,760
was one of the few public shots of Basel
Basel was never known until I did the

92
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:47,560
story I found out who he was and I did a
lot of desiccation who he was and where

93
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:53,209
it came from and how he did it work and
everything which is in the article but

94
00:09:53,210 --> 00:10:01,310
he was the chief recruiter in Athens for
the CIA recruiting local Greek citizens

95
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:09,280
to spy for the USS he had one picture
taken for Facebook and you put this

96
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:17,500
phone appeared on whatever hide his face
his family was on either side managed to

97
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:23,310
find that picture and here's a picture
from the

98
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:29,939
Greek government it was his passport
picture here's another picture of him

99
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:36,170
and his visa and this is a picture I
found his daughter got married in Greece

100
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:42,110
and I managed to find the the photos of
the wedding he was trying to hide from

101
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,220
the photographer just as soon as he saw
the photographer he put his head down

102
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:53,730
you don't want any pictures taken at
this is the CIA official involved in the

103
00:10:53,730 --> 00:11:01,480
case again he wasn't really known until
really exposed here and this these

104
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:12,110
stories so what made the embassy or
actually one of the things that made

105
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:19,339
basil really useful was that he was a
his parents were born in Greece back and

106
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:24,520
forth the grease a great deal he spoke
Greek fluently like a native who do

107
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:33,880
everything about the culture this is
basil as a young kid over his father got

108
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,439
remarried and one of the Greek islands
so we got that from one of his relatives

109
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:47,690
so this was his business card he was
posing as cover title first secretary

110
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:54,180
regional affairs for the embassy in
reality he was CIA covert operative

111
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,180
covered officer

112
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:12,910
so was the perfect person if they see I
want somebody he was 39 year old telecom

113
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:20,699
engineer network planner manager wasn't
up the ranks of been there I think dozen

114
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:27,340
years so if somebody wanted to recruit
somebody that's causes inside the

115
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:34,080
facility the Vodafone facility so show
me one recruit some because it would be

116
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:48,220
perfect person to do further interviews
brother and Kostas happy life he was

117
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:59,560
doing very well right up until the time
they found it by and understand why he

118
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,199
would commit suicide I mean there was no
real reason he was fine financially

119
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:13,110
about the very nice living but
ironically he was founded the day after

120
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:21,570
the body was discovered so when you
recruit the inside person the next thing

121
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:28,750
is developed the malware to take control
of the system to take control of the

122
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:36,040
network basically take care of take
control of Vodafone all this all the

123
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:42,339
cellular phones cellphones and in Greece
using those devoted phone system and

124
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,500
that was the biggest system there

125
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:52,320
NSA developed a procedure known as
lawful intercept well let me back up

126
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,560
lawful intercept is a program that goes
with most telecom systems you're buying

127
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,920
a big system of your big is your go-to
phone you're buying big system the

128
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,699
company or buying it from in this case
it was Ericsson

129
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:10,230
will also supply with a program known as
lawful intercept all that is a program

130
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:16,200
that if the government wants to monitor
somebody's phone suspects phone

131
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:23,110
legitimate monitoring of criminal
activity or whatever there's a technical

132
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:29,320
capability of doing that is called the
lawful intercept system and still comes

133
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:36,180
as a package and Vodafone got it as well
as Vodafone got it from Ericsson and

134
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:41,640
Costas actually was a person who signed
for the problem is the Greek government

135
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:47,900
didn't have any capability for doing
he's dropping it didn't have a very

136
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:56,400
rudimentary alligator clip type buddy
system that has been have a system for

137
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,660
widespread

138
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:02,939
eavesdropping so they never needed the
lawful intercept program and because

139
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:09,200
they didn't need the lawful intercept
program Vodafone never bought it from

140
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,440
the they had it there but they never
paid for the key they never pay for the

141
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,140
digital key to turn it on

142
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:23,810
cost tens of thousands of euros to
debate at Erics and actually turn on

143
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,239
ever turned it on

144
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:37,250
well that was a perfect opportunity for
NSA NSA develop now we're here this was

145
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:44,210
the NSA's program this one of the top
secrets lies from snowden and this was

146
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:53,750
the NSA's basic internal roundtable
about how to turn lawful intercept

147
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,750
programs to their use

148
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:24,480
put into the system that would not
activate the next light I think there's

149
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,529
two parts of the lawful intercept system
the first one is the intercept

150
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:34,519
management system and that basically
creates an audit trail so if your Greek

151
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:38,060
government you wanna come in you want to
use drop on James Bamford you think is

152
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:47,170
by then you turn that over to the
Vodafone Vodafone puts my name my phone

153
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:53,800
number into that first program the asset
management system the IMS and then the

154
00:16:53,800 --> 00:17:01,609
second that will keep a record of of the
intercept the second part the the re yes

155
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:07,179
well actually initiate the town that's
actually doing the test so the malware

156
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:14,130
that as they came up with bypass the
first part and secretly turned on the

157
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,240
second part without ever notifying
Ericsson that they were turning on the

158
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,349
system without the key or whatever so if
anybody looked at it they would see that

159
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:27,918
there's no activity when in reality they
are doing a great deal of eavesdropping

160
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:37,480
that was away the NSA but using in
countries around the world countries

161
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,929
that don't necessarily use the voters
appear even to the NSA will come in

162
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:47,260
there and secretly turn that system to
their own use

163
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:35,639
system they have other ways

164
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,450
foreign status foreign satellite
interception and these are all top

165
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:47,040
secret slides from the one on the right
shows where all these foreign set

166
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,590
locations are those pics la dishes
intercepting telecommunications

167
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:58,899
microwave of six that was the system
that Duncan mentioned special collection

168
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:05,400
services little cuts on the tops of the
tops of embassies and what they do is

169
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,030
they collect the microwaves passing
through the city so they're getting all

170
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:17,350
the local communications and because the
Embassy's use a long and 20 embassy area

171
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:22,699
you're getting a lot of poor embassy
communications as well as the federal

172
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:29,280
national government communications s6 is
the internal code for special collection

173
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,850
service official source operations is
the section of Venice say that works

174
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:41,080
with telecom companies in other words it
would work with AT&T to secretly get

175
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,830
AT&T eavesdrop on us' communications and
this case they probably worked with

176
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,740
Vodafone to get the

177
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:54,470
access and that you get to tha OH Taylor
that operations were the ones who

178
00:19:54,470 --> 00:20:00,679
actually do that malware that created
that Mauer so all these groups according

179
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:04,640
to state documents that I had all these
groups people from all these groups were

180
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,950
sent to Athens to do these this work

181
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:21,950
so basically you know you've got the
inside you got the agreement the

182
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,200
government you get the inside person you
get them out where you got the external

183
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:32,450
intercept operations going what what now
is needed was some way to get that

184
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:37,770
information after its been collected
efforts been intercepted basically in

185
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:44,370
the same boat 00 phone calls will come
in from the targets and and there'll be

186
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:50,000
a duplicate made of those signals and
that single then will be insane or be

187
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,890
sent out to an NSA facilities so you
need some way to get that signal out and

188
00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:01,630
normally in a normal case it would go
out to the law enforcement agency if

189
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:07,130
Greece or whatever this is a legitimate
wiretap but since you wasn't

190
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,750
illegitimate wiretapping since it wasn't
going to the Greek government and as

191
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,970
they had to find a way to do that so
they came up with a whole bunch

192
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:24,110
basically the shadow of phones that are
untraceable they go around a lot of

193
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:28,020
places by these phones that are
untraceable and that the signals get

194
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:35,429
transmitted to these phones and once
they transmitted to the phone then the

195
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:41,169
phones in transmitter to it another
location which is an ass a secret

196
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:48,919
location where they have the ability to
store and analyze communications but if

197
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:54,220
anybody did tracing they would only go
to these untraceable anybody didn't

198
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:59,289
follow the signal they don't go to these
untraceable cell like cell phones and

199
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:00,890
they go no further

200
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:06,640
so it was a very good setup you got the
agreement the government you put him in

201
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,780
there look for terrorists during the
Olympics keep everybody happy

202
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:20,530
get an inside person there you get the
malware X filtrate the intercepted

203
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:25,970
communications to these cell phones this
phone these untraceable cellphones and

204
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,970
then that puts it in into NSA

205
00:22:38,230 --> 00:23:01,960
operation and say goodbye to the Greek
government agreed

206
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:10,520
telecom system problem was the
coordinate mice confidential source they

207
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:16,110
never removed it all they did was they
turned it off for a day and then they

208
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:21,090
turned it back on again but now instead
of going after the terrorist which is

209
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:28,899
the whole operation the first place now
they're secretly turning it on the Greek

210
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,860
government they're turning on the Prime
Minister wife I don't know why but they

211
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:40,229
did keep us safe by knowing what the
mayor of Athens is telling us this is

212
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:45,549
total overreach by the NSA but this is
what they do in this one just one little

213
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:50,620
example you could extend this around the
world to other places came out in

214
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:56,939
Germany they were working so far so this
is just standard operating procedure I

215
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:05,049
mention this to a senior and it's a
source and do you know the usual way he

216
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:12,790
laughs they never remove it when she got
it in there in there so that's just

217
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:21,520
standard operating procedure for
everything is going fine the Olympics

218
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,668
are over and it's a joint illegal
eavesdropping and

219
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:35,500
something happens so many put some
malware I rather somebody puts a boudoir

220
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:46,270
change into the Vodafone system whatever
updated system something happens to

221
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:53,158
update or whatever but because of that
screws up the NSA system and as a result

222
00:24:53,159 --> 00:25:03,330
of that the it prohibited or stop the
number of text messages from going out

223
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:08,418
so they began getting complaints from
customers that they weren't getting text

224
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:09,929
messages

225
00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:16,090
well that set off like a burglar alarm
at Vodafone you know all the sudden the

226
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:22,668
system isn't working people are losing
their text messages so what happened was

227
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:30,080
that they simply all the data all the
printouts and everything to Ericsson for

228
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:39,129
technical analysis and Mr J's Ericsson's
impact of Vodafone reports say you know

229
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,779
sorry folks but you've got a huge bug in
your system there

230
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:51,970
6500 line piece of code of malware in
there so you got a huge from a very big

231
00:25:51,970 --> 00:26:02,159
bug in your system for some reason the
CEO of Vodafone did a bad mistake when

232
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,659
they did it on purpose or not

233
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:08,970
nobody can know at this point but he
immediately got rid of that malware the

234
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:12,270
problem doing that means good thing is
to get them our out the bad thing is

235
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:16,690
there's no way to do a forensic analysis
now you can't figure out where it came

236
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:24,289
from can't trace it back very well like
destroying the episodes anyway the next

237
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:28,299
day that's when Costas was found dead
cost us

238
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:37,200
going to cause his brother was going to
concerts apartment and he walked in

239
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:47,279
there and brother hanging from the
ceiling horrible horrible so there there

240
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:53,299
were a few pieces of technical detail
that the Greeks could trace back and

241
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:58,720
they were able to trace the signals from
the signals being sent to some of the

242
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:07,100
the the phones the trees of all
cellphone so what they did was they saw

243
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:15,110
the signals all went in the direction of
the USA embassy so you know there's a

244
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:22,668
fairly big clue there but there was no
smoking gun again didn't have the snow

245
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:30,590
documents that I sources I had told me
these diagrams were singles are going

246
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:44,820
so after a decade of on-again-off-again
investigations and the Greeks give them

247
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:48,379
credit they were really trying to find
this out but you know how do you find

248
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:56,500
these are visible singles is very very
difficult so they were able to find

249
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:03,590
though was one of the sum of the cell
phones are popular in particular cell

250
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:11,639
phone store and they were able to trace
back to the well there were able to find

251
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:17,030
out who purchased the owner of the cell
phone store actually recognized when the

252
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:28,030
investigators show pictures pictures of
basil's life as being the person who

253
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:34,670
purchased chattel well there's a big
clue right there that's how baseball

254
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:40,410
came into the picture in terms of the
Greek investigation in addition of that

255
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:47,100
they were very sloppy I mean CIA stop
when you see on television it's a very

256
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:55,669
sloppy organization they used some of
these untraceable cell phones to make

257
00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:02,300
calls to Maryland where NSA is to the
embassy and all that so so they were

258
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,600
able to see that the phone calls the
shadow phone calls but by the CIA

259
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:12,830
officer's wife were actually being made
to not only collect the signals

260
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:19,580
intercepted signals but then make phone
calls to the embassy and even 22

261
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:25,860
Maryland even a place where basil used
to live outside of here and it's a very

262
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:35,310
sloppy and as a result there's now an
arrest warrant now for Santa Claus the

263
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:39,830
he hasn't come back to Queens it's
really is sad for him actually because

264
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:45,389
he has a house on a little island in
Greece Voice Actions living in in Athens

265
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:57,420
Greek also and he according to documents
I found this signed a petition to have

266
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:03,680
some land use or whatever something in
Athens I found it said I'm planning to

267
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,640
retire in Athens well that's out the
window and Alice he wants to spend his

268
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:14,350
retirement in jail so the Greek sir
after him he hasn't surfaced found them

269
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:21,850
occasions in the USA several places and
sent emails and phone calls to relatives

270
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:26,110
his wife daughters everybody but he
never got back to me

271
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:30,659
big surprise so he's disappeared
someplace in the

272
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:39,409
if he ever goes back to Greece there
will be an arrest if they have an arrest

273
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,410
there will be a trial and the trial will
be very interesting because

274
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:52,320
come out which is exactly why you will
never go back to Greece causes family is

275
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:59,790
still hoping for answers they're looking
hopefully maybe there'll be some answers

276
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:09,129
from the USA government but I really
doubt it did in 2011 they asked a some

277
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:21,080
corners to reexamine some of the
documents that the original medical

278
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:29,100
examiner's produced and among the people
they asked was a pathologist from the

279
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:34,590
United States from San Francisco
somebody who's had a lot of experience a

280
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:40,639
lot of experience in terms of looking
into the causes of death and so forth

281
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,760
and he went to Athens looked it looked
at all and he he thought the whole

282
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,240
original examination was

283
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,490
very very sloppy he didn't actually
think that there was a suicide inside

284
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:02,850
you know might be murder so I'm not big
on conspiracy theories but there is the

285
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:09,219
medical examiner from San Francisco did
say that from looking at the photos and

286
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:14,090
the autopsy report he didn't think it
was suicidal thought it could be murder

287
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:19,429
some external cause so what are the
possibilities

288
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:27,590
it's one is that this was an inside
person and to you

289
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:35,820
think you doing something very patriotic
bucking the system defined terrorists

290
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:41,990
because somebody from Greek intelligence
or basil policy and somebody posing

291
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:47,409
false flag attendees from the Greek
intelligence saying over trying to catch

292
00:32:47,409 --> 00:32:51,299
terrorists so here doing some very
patriotic here and then all of a sudden

293
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:55,900
discovers are not looking for terror is
fucking the top people the government be

294
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:02,840
like me all of a sudden somebody from
the us- working for AT&T just try and do

295
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,580
something

296
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:08,439
honorable so they discover in there
bugging President Obama's wife and

297
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:15,309
everybody else in the top government in
the scandal i mean facing family the

298
00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:20,539
public everybody efforts discovered that
you're the guy put them out there cause

299
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:27,039
that that would be a good excuse for a
suicide on the other hand he may not

300
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:32,000
have been the inside person there are
other people in Cyprus and cusses could

301
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,460
have been the person who discovered the
malware and wanted to report it to the

302
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:44,710
press or to or exposes somehow and
somebody didn't want him to expose so

303
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:53,049
explain that the photo was bugging
senior members of government I mean that

304
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:58,450
would be a good reason to buy so these
are questions that haven't been answered

305
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:04,080
but at least we move down the road quite
a bit to show how it happened who's

306
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:13,250
responsible for why it happened and so
forth anyway that's my little talk in 10

307
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,800
minutes left so anybody has any
questions i'm happy to take them

308
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,520
thanks

309
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:32,699
think he did a really good job
explaining for I got here so I always

310
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:37,668
learn stuff from Dunkin iced started
this business a long time ago so it was

311
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:44,109
very happy always followed dunking so so
happy to have him here anyway any

312
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:55,248
questions to take code to use it for
tomorrow where was lured away as far as

313
00:34:55,248 --> 00:35:04,538
I know the code was it was lawful
intercept it was found that check them

314
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:16,499
out to where you see that was kinda ask
you know I got a lot of talk to Dunkin

315
00:35:16,499 --> 00:35:21,109
if it's above the level of what I gave
you hear talk to Dunkin about it because

316
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:24,109
it's something important that too little

317
00:35:38,430 --> 00:36:14,390
to the public from Sol on the matter
where was the running order MRO and

318
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:18,868
someone something Martin Jeter and they
don't shut down on reboot to that a C

319
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:25,470
which only takes hours and hours to
reboot and as far as I know they don't

320
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:31,089
have any code any piece of code is it
true or not but you know there's an

321
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:39,869
awful lot of the technical details is a
huge amount of documents agree I don't

322
00:36:39,869 --> 00:36:43,819
read that you can read that actually
gets a lot of technical analysis because

323
00:36:43,819 --> 00:36:51,170
one of the investigations of 56
investigation but one of the best

324
00:36:51,170 --> 00:37:00,829
investigation was done by the technical
report is public now part of a trend

325
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:07,309
because I I had a partner in Greece who
is helping me on this and he translator

326
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:13,549
parts of it for me but you know from my
audience of what I was talking about the

327
00:37:13,549 --> 00:37:22,140
story but not so you can find a lot of
detail in there give you those details I

328
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,350
I personally don't

329
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:26,990
details but they they did say they came
up with that

330
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:36,600
6500 piece of malware there so you know
I just have taken nothing to go on

331
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:44,900
beyond that you get their hands on the
couple will be interested to know

332
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:49,670
they're there is a lot of documents
which is fantastic if you could speak

333
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:54,310
Greek but I couldn't read any of those I
can go ahead have help translating some

334
00:37:54,310 --> 00:38:03,830
1,000 pages worth of information there
you can read any further questions from

335
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:06,980
the audience then I have a question

336
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:18,370
yeah arrest warrant reach tus the
leading international interpol type

337
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:22,839
restaurant so it goes to any other
country outside the united states and

338
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:30,640
countries are obligated to detain him
and then extradited to follow us for so

339
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,290
it only happens very rarely happened
once before as far as I know that's a

340
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:41,930
CIA people were subject to arrest and
that was because of

341
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:55,669
kidnapping or the technical term for
taking rendition rendition in somebody

342
00:38:55,670 --> 00:39:01,599
so that happened in Italy but nobody
actually went to trial and we went back

343
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,630
to Italy and probably isn't going to
happen the United States but who knows

344
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:12,270
if he leaves the country he could be
subject to arrest so thanks very much

345
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:17,020
appreciate your attention and I'll be
around very well as any questions thank

346
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,770
you thank you
