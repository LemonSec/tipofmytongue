1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,259
hello and welcome to my talk about
McAfee application controller said

2
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:08,800
anything Cuba and I'm going to tell you
something about the application might

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,950
listening in the next 15 minutes so
let's let's have a look at the plan for

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:17,779
the day but affordable introduced my
company said contract before it's just

5
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:22,560
one side and then restarted route topic
application whitelisting so what is

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,810
application whitelisting where is
application whitelisting used but

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,720
problems that they are willing to to use
McAfee application control which is one

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,790
software which can be used for
application whitelisting I told record

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,839
solid core or make some eggs just a
short form of McAfee application control

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,640
next I come to the different purpose
techniques terrible talk about how you

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,390
can bypass the protectors and also some
bull abilities as well a sample of blood

12
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,340
in the car and at the end of
demonstration videos that is everything

13
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:03,160
is really rocking and it's not just
erotico at the end of your conclusion is

14
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,408
mainly about the vendor response what
face the band or what is currently fixed

15
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,409
but it's not fixed of course how you can
fix it yourself

16
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:17,939
second flight was founded in 2002 and
you know I start we have our headquarter

17
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:23,919
in general is the security team of over
60 security experts make many many

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,670
technical audits or really passes or two
in technical security penetration

19
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,150
testing and I think one interesting note
for you is that we are currently hiring

20
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:39,400
so if you're interested just come to me
after talk or go to our outside and

21
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:47,189
offices all around the world application
whitelisting so the idea of application

22
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:52,008
whitelisting use if you have service you
just have a few application installed on

23
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:58,229
time so like Pepsi database or maybe our
enterprise product and so on and its

24
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,429
applications change very rapidly depends
what you can do is you can install

25
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,340
applications and then install
application whitelisting application

26
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,490
whitelisting then create a database of I
placed

27
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:15,410
of all installed applications and after
that if you then executed application

28
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,440
application whitelisting always checks
is this appreciation already in the

29
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,280
database so vital stat yes it was always
there to be executed if it's not in the

30
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,300
database appealed it was not there

31
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,200
the police executions prevented for
example if you go to a website you

32
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,079
download a virus or more than something
like that the model cannot execute

33
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,030
itself because it's not invite list
system main idea behind it is mainly

34
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,480
used in critical infrastructure systems
like Scott environments like power

35
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,899
plants or medicine computer systems
something like that or some important

36
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,140
company systems or administrative work
stations and so on

37
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:03,500
to talk to you that closed systems for
example computer systems for students I

38
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,160
can just go there and you don't want
that one student in fact that a student

39
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:13,150
is something we can help prevent
execution of unwanted applications there

40
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,450
many solutions for it

41
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:19,890
mcAfee is just one of them for example
Microsoft epic is also very commonly

42
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:25,589
used and I received a license for a
McAfee application control on the custom

43
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:35,750
project so that's why I'm focusing on
too soft here so I only licensed version

44
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,590
of it but I didn't have a look at the
Lite version of it just covering the

45
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,090
stuff here I made all metastasis version
six months ribbit was the current

46
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,830
version when I was trying to order tests
and I've done mainly the tests on the

47
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:55,350
client systems like it but I thought
under test for just their fight at all

48
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,690
techniques or to work on Windows 2003
Windows 2000 tires and so on

49
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:06,380
the reason why after experience that
express very commonly used in Scott

50
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,260
environments but of course you should
not use XP anymore because it's just not

51
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,260
supported so just until 6 p.m. or

52
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,459
and 2008 I was not able to make it
working because every time I was

53
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:24,140
installing application whitelisting
operating system doesn't work anymore so

54
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,390
don't really know why this was the case
but basically everything blocked on

55
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:35,229
several occasions to on 64 bit systems
too if you want to work with McAfee

56
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,190
application control it basically
purposes console application so don't

57
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:45,180
have a graphical user interface you just
a few testament to attend you provide

58
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,160
the comedy but you want to execute for
example you say disabled or a neighbor

59
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,300
or passivity to set a password or code
solidify solidifies the main coma which

60
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:02,340
is used to enable application
whitelisting so if so that if I eternity

61
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,700
to rate overall fights which are on your
system and it creates a database in this

62
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:14,479
example it's a free trade orders 55 now
2505 in Europe at least in your database

63
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,850
next step is that you anybody
protections and then have to reboot the

64
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,820
system and the protection works so for
example you should download an

65
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,610
application and try to execute it would
just say commissioners tonight or if I

66
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:37,630
try to execute script like about five it
would just say exercise tonight there

67
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,100
are some other features works and
provide protection which means it

68
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,050
prevents you from over IP applications
for temperature of one but the

69
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,560
certification you cannot just overwrite
it with your own application because

70
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,470
then you really can't bypass the
protectionists that's also read

71
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,520
protections for example you cannot reach
passport files configuration files the

72
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,919
bite list itself the database fire into
on particular to add protections for all

73
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,430
other fighter like

74
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:12,880
protections have become the dominant bit
late does not are important concept art

75
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,590
to update us so the main problem of
application whitelisting how you deal

76
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,169
with updates so for example if an
application whitelisting and stored and

77
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:24,560
you using one application at this
application try stops

78
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,669
update itself that replaces its own
libraries and library is because of

79
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:34,590
fraud protection can be replaced or you
cannot enter library because the library

80
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,690
libraries or to protect that we cannot
load in you live area and what McAfee

81
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:44,450
application control is doing is to
specify a list of special processes that

82
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:48,550
this process just completely bypass
architectures to this process can

83
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,780
override or fives at this process can
start applications which are not invite

84
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:58,830
list so that your updates are working to
make a few applications but some like a

85
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:08,570
purchase here or is your child the
update process and so on but mainly

86
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:15,150
McAfee products so that their own
antivirus products on work in addition

87
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,299
we have some memory corruption
protectors part because the problem is

88
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,790
if you have a memory corruption you can
check called into work by clicking

89
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:28,060
applications application whitelisting so
this is the reason why they he was a

90
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:33,820
member of protections for some sites
from them from the side like this

91
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,760
because I like you cannot exploit
possible losses the protections or to

92
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:51,800
protect against attacks and attacks or
any more if you are crimes to certain

93
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,050
main components of McAfee application
control and how to work together so

94
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,590
basically if you a user sitting in front
of the system

95
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:06,110
top some comments interactive console
application to just a DRS appt in a

96
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:14,810
neighbor or a separate solidify and so
on then you have to see this comment

97
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,930
like to interact with interprocess
communications

98
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:24,520
named pipes and drips through the
service the service tendrils responsible

99
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,340
to create the database so tempted to
rate overall fight

100
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,250
lightest and difficult component

101
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:38,479
which is sitting here as a country and
was responsible to to implement all the

102
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,460
protections for example every time an
application get started the country

103
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:50,330
other checks is this application invite
list or not they put up control codes is

104
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:58,510
the country but when I come to The Piper
says so if you have the problem that we

105
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,439
cannot execute

106
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,940
application of their ideas just start
execute whitelisted applications

107
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:11,110
applications can execute at least we
have to find an application of its just

108
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,720
the errand or two stars because it
wanted our pipe systems so they have

109
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,530
made this three possibilities the first
of all you something between store buy

110
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,920
microsoft windows but then we have two
problems that on business Expedia other

111
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:31,310
primaries as on Windows seven and so on
so Roberts then you can use applications

112
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,209
installed on the application control
itself which would be very good if you

113
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:40,270
find something useful or we can do
something some comments about party

114
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,770
tools like off at all

115
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:49,960
Flash Player and so on which is very
commonly used but this would be the

116
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:55,040
first to approach us because the last
one battle for control systems but

117
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,469
basically I found in all three
categories some stuff

118
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,980
the first thing that comes into your
mind as power show because it ever since

119
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:10,390
and it solidified Patek 45 a modern
operating system because nobody should

120
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:16,500
be anymore I have policies they are and
I can use it and i cant use PowerShell

121
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,380
book she could execute any structure
which I like

122
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:28,240
have bypassed application whitelisting
at this point so it's so you cannot pass

123
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,080
policies scooped up because pollitt

124
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,780
executing powershell script is not
enabled on all systems but effort but

125
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,959
what you can do this

126
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,910
PowerShell encoded coma and can pass the
comp

127
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,370
script URIs argument that this works on
all systems that this case it's just

128
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:53,110
base 64 encoded the comment in this case
is just a start to calculate the butt of

129
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,920
course you can start any artists
Repertory like the questions which

130
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:02,329
script we got to start just have a look
at our spot which is a very powerful

131
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:07,900
collection of polyploid scripts as I
polish a script you can find it on top

132
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:13,140
under many different except for example
you can check P fight which means you

133
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:18,069
can load any executable now into memory
and start an executable or we can invoke

134
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,440
trade cold or hot key locking democrats

135
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,200
express what spot scanning and so on
many many more because even compare

136
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:33,750
right to complete more inside PowerShell
so just noticed a script which I'm using

137
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:38,100
it from the social engineering toolkit
this just checked much according to

138
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:45,860
process base and just start execution of
it so recap if you somehow managed to

139
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,540
stop our show you can completely bypass
application whitelisting because it can

140
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,520
start an executable can start check out
and so on but the main question now is

141
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:00,960
how to restart policy because we cannot
just end up at 5 a.m. because I thought

142
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:09,500
but three pups I thought about lestat so
apart I will not execute to my idea was

143
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:15,790
to divide all task of getting caught
executioner into two small steps first

144
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:20,219
step is to get something like basic code
execution which means you can execute

145
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,690
some scripts like Dallas trip to Ibiza
basic script or something like that and

146
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,860
mister script that can then start our
applications on the system like policy

147
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,870
and 22 are used to get full code
execution and starting applications

148
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:41,470
which can be used to execute a cold so
let's talk to us about basic code

149
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:47,410
execution if you have some simple ideas
just want to start policy for

150
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:51,160
temperature just sitting in front of the
system can just type it in there really

151
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,589
a basic attack but it just works on
closed systems like

152
00:12:55,270 --> 00:13:00,060
like workstations for students or
something like that but we can use this

153
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,420
idea of his USB sticks malicious use it
takes its called rubber ducky you can

154
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,770
order tees on the internet it's just a
USB stick which act as a keyboard so if

155
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:15,030
you plug it into your computer it
doesn't say it it's a city I'm a keeper

156
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:22,819
and I'm not typing what I before it
would just thought not but writer some

157
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:27,950
elaborate stuff but it can also say that
power showbiz my ministers payload so I

158
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:32,240
can trust niggas social engineering and
tech computer USB stick and if you plug

159
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,370
it into a computer just infected and
application whitelisting doesn't protect

160
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:45,700
you from that and the most common a text
you just sent a victim of fire at the

161
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:51,130
victims just started opens the file is
infected however to stop location like

162
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,830
listening because they are mainly used
exercise advice or something like that

163
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:02,100
all are just bite list that however I
found out that African some of them so

164
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:10,480
for us it's Dr fights but it's the mail
application fights to see your html5 but

165
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,570
you can use these are basic script in
Europe with me so basic split second

166
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:21,110
trust anything you like like in this
example and just starting to calculator

167
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,510
but can also start PowerShell or
something like that so if someone clicks

168
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:30,390
at this HDR fire distrusted factors to
consider a little bit late in the

169
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,250
demonstration videos

170
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:38,540
cs5 is basically the same to the same
construct an application or you can

171
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:43,640
justify shortcut so I can just create a
shortcut pointing to publisher and an

172
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:49,370
entire argument just passed malicious
payload it would look like something

173
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:56,620
like this and just get executed in this
case I'm just planning calculator but of

174
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,820
course I can also spawned a shell or
some other stuff

175
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,230
what my idea was lost to have a look at
the most common take back to us and then

176
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:13,379
have a look if their application
whitelisting anybody systems so the

177
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:17,170
first part was only social engineering
attacks so now come to other attacks

178
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:22,069
like taking a better location I find
their sample abilities and I try to

179
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:28,009
attack to support systems protect the
application and in order to cases

180
00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:31,060
possibly execute some comments

181
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:37,540
responsibilities here for temperature
checked ravages badly configured to

182
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:42,019
write a better show to the web server
and on the web server perception I can

183
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:45,699
execute any comment which I liked the
pics I can execute PowerShell again or

184
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:47,750
something like that

185
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:55,259
publication it's also possible by bus
station by listening and I dot textin

186
00:15:55,259 --> 00:16:01,529
area are personal attacks are then I go
to a customer for internal auditor

187
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:05,990
typically have to lapses me so one
laptop with automated securities cannot

188
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:10,589
which has 2000 2005 stance against the
computer network and my own laptop

189
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:14,980
laptop to make the publication audits
and stuff like that but you cannot

190
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,939
automate

191
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:22,300
at the end of the day in 99% I have a
critical vulnerability aww automated

192
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:28,180
security scanner or security out it
depends really ok nearly all cases I

193
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:35,209
have at least accessible for example if
a very old system which is not update or

194
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:39,489
if you have a pass with christopher
credentials or something like that

195
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:47,559
have access to water systems you can
deposit asia's the problem is that

196
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:54,000
Microsoft has a design flaw in proper
accords which allows me to authenticate

197
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,779
against two stems if I just not a
presentation don't have to go to clinics

198
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:02,399
password at this attack is called past
has to take so if the administrator us

199
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:08,720
the same local administrator password on
phone so I can trust

200
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,339
respond compromised system then after
passing the presentation and uses

201
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:19,089
special password hash to authenticate
against the next two storms typically to

202
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:24,099
express what often remain oppressed
waiting memory and enough compromise the

203
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:31,949
domain controller and everything is over
this past Dec reducing typically the

204
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,900
Metasploit module place except for it it
would look like something like this

205
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:46,130
should take your system as a people 39
you make a stop at any can just use PSX

206
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:54,650
settler to have to take another system
with this case 133 and then it just get

207
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:59,650
the shelter however if you protect the
system with application whitelisting

208
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:07,539
this attack is not working and find out
the reason why this is not working

209
00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:13,179
yesterday just have to look at the
source court in this case it looks a

210
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:18,770
little bit complicated but on the next
slide I have heard or read a book so if

211
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,330
you want to execute the comment I over
PSX

212
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:32,340
up and executing this year though just
starting to execute a comment the

213
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,870
comment is Stan

214
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:41,379
so you're writing this stuff you're into
that part that Israel want to exclude

215
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:48,289
another comment just started and pitched
art simply accept its just start but the

216
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:54,270
template here to party but this is just
hope I pass or districts of antivirus

217
00:18:54,270 --> 00:19:01,129
product basically end up executing this
fire temple but just find who are a

218
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:07,559
tourist pipe to randomly the problem is
cases that distant the party's not like

219
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:12,860
mister which means excuses just
prevented again at modify it it's really

220
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:19,179
really simple you just have to modify
the comment Europe to territory

221
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:23,770
security or coma to don't have to write
about 500 application whitelisting

222
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:29,080
doesn't protect against this stuff and
this is a good except costing nearly all

223
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,490
cases application whitelisting protect
you from the basic attack but if you

224
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:37,020
just use five minutes of your time to
find a bypass and it's working again

225
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,640
just protect against the basic attacks
but if someone has a point she can

226
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,790
really easily bypass all the stuff and
I'll come to full code execution until

227
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:54,100
now we just discussed policy so someone
can say okay I just remove power from

228
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,719
about lists you cannot execute it
anymore I'm not protected but that is

229
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,630
not true because there are many many
other applications which are installed

230
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:07,420
but you can also use to get code
execution so here are just a mistake for

231
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:13,080
example 142 because it can be used to
load the library and call a function of

232
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:19,230
it will complete your path for example
yourself or your partner pearl in stored

233
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:25,550
polish eloquent just past the argument
that the people in the argument and

234
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:31,879
choke hold or to Bacchus because the
Pakistan be used to to inject code

235
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,040
interprocess base of lightest
applications or some other common attack

236
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,750
vectors like Java applets to Picard Java
applet Malaysia celebrate looks like

237
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:49,690
this so in the case of a social
insurance attack of some force a victim

238
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:56,230
to go to my website for example are make
fish fishing males and Teta go to this

239
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:59,940
website area can calculate your
Christmas bonus or something like that

240
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:10,260
and what I'm doing tennis in the
resources excuse ever then it just takes

241
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,050
out to a temporary

242
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:17,250
attention started and heroic and have to
problem that dismal failure is not

243
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,970
whitelisted which means execution
prevented what you can do with of course

244
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:26,820
you can trust our selection but if this
case we wanted to do it without power

245
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,649
what it can do it you can't directly
checked herself into the process a

246
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:40,870
process I don't have enough time to talk
about 2:30 today but if you want to know

247
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:46,379
more about it just go to YouTube then
confined to stalk well defined the

248
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:53,559
culture it so I can't really run into
the process of Java this is basically

249
00:21:53,559 --> 00:22:01,870
the same for office macros to send your
PowerPoint file of X files and even my

250
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:07,260
cross applications which means I can
start PowerShell or trusting checked my

251
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:12,730
own called into the power show the
office process could do this mister

252
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:18,670
script here it's called soco to script
you can find it here if you want to make

253
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:25,410
it work and 64 bit systems you just have
to make some minor modifications the

254
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:33,059
last technologies exploiting memory
corruption for example if you go to my

255
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:36,928
website and a facility exploratory
process I can trust in check code into

256
00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:40,140
your process the process spotless
apartment I can execute code on your

257
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,860
system but you can order to the local
applications for example

258
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:50,360
able to execute some scripts like
telescoped and coating applications but

259
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,820
our show it's not not there on your
system I can trust exploit a local

260
00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:03,980
application the questioners which local
application to exploit so I may have two

261
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:08,559
possibilities for this I can use one
application from the operating system

262
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:14,230
but there have some problems because the
operating system developed us know what

263
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:19,760
they're doing so at least the most time
so they have many different protections

264
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,629
like a trespasser Association did
Execution Prevention DEP exception

265
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:27,910
handling controls look at the caucus and
so on and they have any but also time to

266
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:33,080
the very heart to exploit such an
application and of course if I to 6 p.m.

267
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,669
applications as something 27 that means
I have to write an exploit for Xperia

268
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,490
want to win the 714

269
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:44,670
version of the immigration and so on
heart so what my idea was to such

270
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:49,270
applications install application control
because I know that they are stored in

271
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:56,790
the old systems applications and maybe
have just gotten some protections and

272
00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:03,139
found this one Europe trip fire in store
for job of making publication at all

273
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:08,550
it's from 1999 which is very good for me
because they're at this time there are

274
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:14,909
no security protections note that there
are no security protectors and then I

275
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:22,000
started to search for it on then I found
this one year from 2004 its ace execute

276
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,380
code overflow beach sounds good but
could spread which is also quite coat

277
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:32,630
and unfortunately I don't find any
public information for this certainly

278
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:38,429
know how to exploit apologist know their
instability there so then I just grabbed

279
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:43,570
the source code and started searching
for the ability so maybe you can just

280
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:47,639
have a quick look at it just a quick
note you're not found a so this is not

281
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,640
your so something

282
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:19,380
has a fixed size and taking your tired
arguments allotments use controlled

283
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:24,840
attack a control that means this is
fixed I simply can't just write as much

284
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:30,959
as we like to think twice before basic
before flow and really super just as a

285
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,360
quick side note at the time I was doing
research I had access to a very

286
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,969
expensive source code analysis and I
used it to find here

287
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:47,360
150 height 150 powerful something like
that but all of them were just not

288
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,870
exploit ever because he was allocating
its accepted a space for writing to it

289
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:59,469
which was exploited and accepted
responsibility was not found

290
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,240
and I really don't know why because it
is a really really simple ability in

291
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:13,940
this case which is cedar application
just crashes can load up the car and it

292
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:26,110
just say you're all right during the
first six months which is exactly days

293
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:32,158
you can alright you to target location
and of course you can also use some

294
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:38,270
tools which is just a test exploit ever
basically you have your tour from 1999

295
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:44,610
with no security features a princess
section and you can control the

296
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:48,428
arguments to F blast and free and you
can use this to exploit it to run your

297
00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:53,470
own childhood in it at this is slightly
Stoopid effort because all systems by

298
00:26:53,470 --> 00:27:00,789
making publication but there are some
Democrats protections between to prevent

299
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:05,520
you from exploiting locality let's have
a look at it so I can hear the side so

300
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,840
the just say you cannot afford to lose
any more on Windows XP

301
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,590
you have fewer TMP forum member
production costs and possible but

302
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:26,559
everything but also forced relocations
and 81 just everything disappeared to

303
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:34,480
them no memory protects any more on it a
little bit later by this is the case so

304
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,650
what my DeVos to just start my own
exploit which I've wrote some time ago

305
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:42,640
and just their five but they are not
working and then just booked until it

306
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:51,080
works again and using your Firefox
exploit oil or protect ours or anybody

307
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:59,110
in this case a quarter inch the MiFi
locally but it can also be a better

308
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:05,199
server just for us a victim to go to
your website this case I hope this just

309
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,200
for me but I cannot launch it
automatically and it's just that she

310
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,440
could get executed a shakeout just pawns
the calculator but of course we cannot

311
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:22,169
start this but it's the euro is attacked
just brought out any modification on the

312
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:26,299
first attempt so what I thought and is
OK

313
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:31,000
the Firefox monopolies is an integer
overflow at the trustee to protect

314
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,320
against from close to the next step was
to use a powerful flow this case quality

315
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:47,610
player but I think it's just that reason
it just worked again the same by so a

316
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:52,799
test next and then ended up using the
tobacco check what McAfee application

317
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,879
control the cost I just just such a cool
animals pictures because contract

318
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,260
phantom so without McAfee application
control your application looks like this

319
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:08,090
and peacemakers implication control the
trusting checked in here

320
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:14,279
National Library which is called St
checked and 10 assists many many exes

321
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:17,970
violations in the tobacco then the
complication control is in store and

322
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,700
always around this address

323
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,580
so my next step was to find out what
distorted this address here

324
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:30,169
out mcveigh plication control you can
find a concerta to head out from the

325
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:36,470
library is a lot of operating system and
your future ahead of it because retailer

326
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:43,360
and this application control plane
headed out there but now it's not really

327
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,750
play anymore this means every time an
instruction tries to read from this

328
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:54,539
location and exploration industry got
the peace coach from from St and check

329
00:29:54,539 --> 00:30:02,260
library you can kick in at additional
checks so basically she could always has

330
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:08,370
22 nearly always has to read this period
are and what they are doing is the make

331
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:15,658
a break point to that area code context
or not but it will just say this

332
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:21,019
district and structural ordering an
executable memory then it's a lot and if

333
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:26,539
it's not executable to say it's just a
coat but this is just basically the same

334
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:30,510
state Execution Prevention because the
modern operating systems BST tech

335
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:35,340
solution prudential supported by the
hardware so prevention from the

336
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:41,250
operating system it is much harder to
bypass the piece i've been i've got an

337
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:44,330
exploit my exploiters written modern
operating systems

338
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:48,330
the piece I have to bypass state
explosion prevention at the plant at the

339
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:53,720
same time immortal by passing their
predictions here to just very very few

340
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:59,269
systems which don't have to have 246
prevention just in this case you should

341
00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:05,450
because this is a software update
Execution Prevention of course you can

342
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:08,460
also buy passes this one you don't want
to buy the state explosion prevention

343
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,049
but this is not so interesting so just
keep it but something out of very

344
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:20,039
interesting is that they interacted 20
protect the processes your memory so St

345
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:25,429
check delicate memory after entry level
which is reading writing and executing

346
00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:29,970
over something which is writable and
executable

347
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:33,850
this is very bad because this is exactly
what should not do because this

348
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:37,899
completely bypasses state explosion
prevention so for example that we look

349
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:44,160
not found anything which is executable
and light ever just stuff which is a

350
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,580
look at the permit application control
this very bad because if not exploited

351
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:51,960
process and you have to make
implications Android installed you make

352
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:59,710
my life very easy because I can't
justify a shaky start executed if you

353
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:03,430
want to bypass the protections assaulted
Execution Prevention just keep this one

354
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:10,630
here so I told you because the same as
detection prevention class receivers

355
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:14,670
addressed a service issue which is a
believer since been dismissed at the new

356
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:19,230
justice forced relocations whichever
level since 1881 but also in the

357
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:22,920
seventies updates if you keep your
system up-to-date really don't need to

358
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,300
protect just there because the
protection from the operating systems

359
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:35,860
are better and faster and now come to
count control all-purpose techniques

360
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:40,729
which are presented to you yet they're
working normally don't need

361
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,550
administrative privileges for it

362
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:48,050
one technique on the next let's be
required but it won't really have to use

363
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:52,389
this one because he can of course bypass
it another way but it's just simply want

364
00:32:52,390 --> 00:33:01,280
to make something and talk to you have
to buy passes account controlled first

365
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:06,980
saw this one here was introduced think
everyone knows this box is here is

366
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:12,170
called you so i cant control so if
you're lucky you'll receive to talk and

367
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:18,750
talk and talk to the school
administrative privileges and every time

368
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:25,040
you want to use this will happen to you
have to click on guess I really wanted

369
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,870
to the administrator the problem is if
I'm attacking an administrator have to

370
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:35,169
somehow pipers bypass the stuff to make
something as a pianist wait so are many

371
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:39,640
techniques to twist enough time to speak
about all these techniques

372
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:49,160
ok fine too many many techniques very
very interesting basically just booked

373
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,910
by checking the library it was the
process and the problem is security

374
00:33:53,910 --> 00:34:00,590
check the library because they're not
working but there are also some methods

375
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:05,649
which are working on speak about all of
them so just know that there are

376
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:09,139
techniques which work on McAfee
application control application

377
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:15,359
whitelisting and systems to bypass user
account control as already mentioned

378
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,270
there are some processes which can be
used to bypass to read and write

379
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:24,489
protection is mainly the update process
goes up the process can be used to

380
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:29,120
override any application of our
protectors completely bypassed and you

381
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,759
have to service itself because the
service can possibly protection because

382
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:40,250
the sellers has to read all sides so
let's start with the updates its lists

383
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:51,668
for but just wanted to know if you use
each other up the process and I have you

384
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:58,680
tested x5 just fight to start another
try to copy test text test text just

385
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:06,129
your exercise tonight because of fraud
detection test access just over an hour

386
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,230
configure my own up the process
interrupted process tries to copy

387
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:14,290
something over tested except it just
works EC tested access already be some

388
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:23,029
application which prints out you updated
bypasses protection here so I just what

389
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:27,810
I can do a second test start up the
process because then it runs my own

390
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:31,630
privileges is simple but clever and then
I can trust the process

391
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:36,950
elected members be still right into the
planning process but the shaker

392
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:43,210
territory that execution of it is
exactly what I'm here so I just search

393
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:47,870
for the child up the process then
adjusting check Michelle cocktail shaker

394
00:35:47,870 --> 00:35:51,430
just alright so spiteful tested
ex-service old

395
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:56,868
and I just over Rochester Texas new so
basically this of course we cannot

396
00:35:56,869 --> 00:36:00,880
execute this exercise here you have to
do everything in our show or in

397
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,800
childhood or something like that then
you can just alright an executable which

398
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,440
means you can run any executable what
you like but it could also do it with to

399
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,809
sell this but this executive vice
president chief privileges because ask

400
00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:20,940
system but as soon as they are in the
service you can just remove the peso 25

401
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:28,309
correct the SFM program and just a step
into shape let the protections are all

402
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:33,700
just disabled and then you could do
anything which you like better you can

403
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:39,089
configure trusted volume which means
just want directory and i was just as

404
00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:42,670
director complete purposes or
protections you don't have to reboot the

405
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:49,240
system I feel some kinda land-related
will abilities so if you're a tribal

406
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:56,390
practice by sending different input
output control codes parameters and

407
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:59,848
almost and Europe were neighbors who
basically colleges to understand this

408
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:05,410
malicious arguments and stop the blue
screen and of course it's very likely

409
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:09,770
that you can use it to to escalate
privileges for example if your normal

410
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:14,900
user no weapons of privileges you can
trust and malicious I put up control

411
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,540
coates this malicious arguments and
explored there are some who love listen

412
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:25,069
to color to get extra so you have turned
system access and I come to the

413
00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:33,980
demonstration videos so is your IM
Lochte administrator starting to command

414
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:51,950
prompt as administrator of this is
exactly User Account Control then so

415
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:56,118
just enumerated fights so

416
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:02,009
after some time in this case 11 minutes
it just tastes so many fights are an all

417
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:14,020
white list that already just 42 new
applications are now anybody protections

418
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,020
and reboot my system

419
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:34,730
or techniques just work as normal user
to

420
00:38:44,369 --> 00:38:52,470
just everything is working to skip this
during the next few I trusted

421
00:38:52,470 --> 00:39:00,959
application you can run it such as
principal should just copy the copy of

422
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,089
it would not be in the database would
not be executed over not be vitally

423
00:39:06,089 --> 00:39:11,490
certain exclusions prevented you can
also remove it because it's not right

424
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:16,008
protected because it's not in the white
list but you cannot because right

425
00:39:16,009 --> 00:39:20,339
protection to trust prices not a
privilege as partisan don't have enough

426
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:25,078
privileges I'm not using it a try it
with administrative privileges and it is

427
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:31,789
tough enough to purchase we cannot
remove it because of rapid action are

428
00:39:31,789 --> 00:39:39,089
now on my ticket system you're using
archival images of social engineering

429
00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:46,940
toolkit this case I'm saying social
engineering attack then I'll saying

430
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:53,609
PowerShell attack and then if america
america she couldn't check their which

431
00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:57,999
means he should create for me to payload
that just take if you have a russia

432
00:39:57,999 --> 00:40:12,950
which connects to my back then I have
fewer created it again under the victim

433
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:21,269
system you have to HDR fire if you open
it up to look like a normal XQ paper but

434
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:22,538
if you open it up

435
00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:29,630
html5 this exactly calling my PowerShell
script then I'm just saying stop by

436
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:40,319
Russia and Europe if I started to really
of course I cannot start application is

437
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:46,049
fake but then I received your show can
you read it or is it too

438
00:40:49,300 --> 00:41:22,960
Russia in power process I want to
execute

439
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:29,160
executed

440
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:42,890
case

441
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:52,130
exercise tonight try to air to execute
put to you but I also tried to copy it

442
00:41:52,130 --> 00:42:00,610
over about listed application but this
just doesn't work because of because of

443
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:06,940
the right protection access denied the
next step which I too wish I just

444
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:18,950
searched for a child up the process
which is located at the last one is tied

445
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:22,669
up the process that means I'm not
injecting my own code into the top up

446
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:30,820
the process the process and since I'm up
the process I can't exclude any

447
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:36,080
application which I like and I cannot
overwrite whitelisted loans so

448
00:42:46,510 --> 00:43:00,380
also executed so

449
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:27,509
and of course you can now start any
executable what you like and use the

450
00:43:27,509 --> 00:43:29,420
last demonstration

451
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:32,990
just shows you have contributed password

452
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:50,069
passport to issue some comments like
disabled or anything like that

453
00:43:50,069 --> 00:44:00,470
my approach now is to remove the
password five so we have another process

454
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:05,490
cannot cannot remove it cannot read it
but if I checked my coat into the

455
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:10,049
process of service I can read it and I
can override it

456
00:44:10,049 --> 00:44:16,470
exercise tonight is not a process just
got here a little bit forward and not

457
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:21,410
been checked in at the service so
migrating to process 644

458
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:38,799
attempt to pass it along but you can
just remove it can issue any comment

459
00:44:38,799 --> 00:44:42,750
which you like without any person
anymore so we can now a trusted volumes

460
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:49,069
or disabled protections and so on and
I've come to the conclusion ur as he saw

461
00:44:49,069 --> 00:44:54,240
the basic attacks are really prevented
by application whitelisting however

462
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:59,939
issued just modified stuff you can
easily bypass or to protect us and even

463
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:11,299
some cases the security of operating
system for example if locate writer and

464
00:45:11,299 --> 00:45:17,180
executed sections in all processes is
very bad because you can just remove the

465
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:21,960
effectiveness of the execution
prevention from the operating system and

466
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,900
if you have a softer vez con Edison it
will a privilege escalation which means

467
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:33,799
you make your system because I feel
somehow can't just go to the twice re

468
00:45:33,799 --> 00:45:38,410
tere can find more information you can
harden the system but for example you

469
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:44,480
just have to remove all the processes or
order something that power-sharing

470
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:54,210
system from like last year's event the
response so this eight really are

471
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:59,670
confirmed so far temporary memory
corruption so if you allocate memory of

472
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:06,270
it is vital to suspect however to say
this is very hard to exploit the risks

473
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:13,640
palos just end up with a low score here
this is the reason why did not provide a

474
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,879
poor tricks or a pet or something like
that

475
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,420
just say next release of McAfee
application control somehow someone will

476
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:25,420
fix it they all say doc YouTube
application with the Buffalo flaw in it

477
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:32,379
WTI however they have some medications
exploded so the risk is also very low

478
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:42,079
it's 15 in this case you compare it to
give it a 10 because of course you can

479
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:42,990
exploit it

480
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:51,509
the other pie buses and because they say
it I just heretical there are no proof

481
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:56,869
of concept and so on and of course
injecting up the process requires

482
00:46:56,869 --> 00:47:00,900
administrative privileges which is
completely wrong you can inject into an

483
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:05,130
update process is normal user privileges
because you can start up the process as

484
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:12,059
normal you saw checked into every
process of this is completely the same

485
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:19,690
applies for you need a plus episode of
privileges to set aside records this is

486
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:24,670
not true you can send us a take- coats
as normal users we can exploit it as a

487
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:30,059
normal user i order it attracted you
can't rest their customers a blue screen

488
00:47:30,059 --> 00:47:35,650
as a normal user and of course it's just
you need to run under a subpoena is and

489
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:40,599
so on to make this this is prevented by
our system so we don't have to fix this

490
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:44,650
one here is the complete timeline
basically

491
00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:07,100
so so much sent them all the stuff we
received a response that the contract or

492
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:11,750
liabilities of it he told them that they
should really fix everything on it but

493
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:23,150
it's just a terrific story and of course
right now just yesterday I downloaded

494
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:28,990
the newest version with pictures 62 so
there were two new russian politics 614

495
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:34,540
and 62 and a status that nothing of them
was fixed so if not the supply or

496
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:43,690
whatever and executable stuff which is
not and if you have any questions please

497
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:46,690
just come to me or just come to me after
a talk

498
00:48:53,680 --> 00:49:00,680
we have a question for one quick
question 1 2011

499
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:34,860
like what

500
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:53,990
tries to break but it just makes it so
that's just one field which are to be

501
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:58,970
read more there but she'll coat and
instead just hard to break point

502
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:04,209
admitted very fast and what they are
doing your application controls the just

503
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:13,330
make it you get an exceptionally low
then make the checks and then you have

504
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:17,500
to copy data structure to new memory
location is expected him and

505
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:21,970
recreational which is right next to
taper recently it's probably an excuse

506
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:26,919
ever and then they can execute it can
break after eight and ten copies in

507
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:31,280
Pakistan start exclusion tear which is
very very slow but also the reason why

508
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,240
your system becomes very slow issue
install McAfee application Mr memorable

509
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:41,649
pictures so basically a Met has more
security futures and their little bit

510
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:41,800
faster
