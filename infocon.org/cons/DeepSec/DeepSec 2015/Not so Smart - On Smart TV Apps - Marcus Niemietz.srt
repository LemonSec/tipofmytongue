1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,130
as he always said I love my dog is not
so smart on Smart TV tech obviously it's

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,980
about martinis and before it will stop
just a few words but also some of our

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,789
guys who did was work one of them is
sitting over there for black shirt say

4
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:20,789
hello maybe this is your life

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:28,439
yeah we all probably will University be
also form a company which is called

6
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:35,130
curity or deny curitiba's survey and in
Germany and what we doing this one

7
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,440
doesn't work here

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:51,680
perfect so what so I'm from hospitality
240 security which is a proud of you or

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,070
university board and has been for a
while it makes sense to do something

10
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:02,440
tests and security training as we did in
the last ten years and this work is

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,149
actually more less apprentice and very
death sentence because it took about

12
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,290
four months not at all

13
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:14,490
yeah we are actually web security
experts are also experts and this is the

14
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,600
reason why it looks mad abuse because we
are using roses but you will see best

15
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,770
and you can also follow me on Twitter so
this kind of stuff so this is what table

16
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:29,048
of contents looks like people begin with
an introduction at a generalization so

17
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:33,729
we will see that these attacks also
transferable to other fields our

18
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:40,158
products when you'll see us what devices
we have tested what's the attacker

19
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,950
immoral and eavesdropping scenario
vicious very very true but it has so

20
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:51,450
many a crucial heroes then we go
in-depth interviews on the spot

21
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:59,979
used it affects all smarty Houston's
2012 so it's very very nice and last but

22
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:03,149
not least there is a conclusion section
with a little bit of lessons learnt so

23
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:04,510
what can we do to

24
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:14,440
yeah have some countermeasures so i
introduction all of us know vet years

25
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:22,250
ago as Stevie was just a few so we used
it to local movies and it was quite a

26
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,810
trip your device and nowadays it's
actually computer and one function

27
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,800
office computer which is lacking in most
cases is

28
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:39,030
PTV faction and a smart already
indicates it interacts with something in

29
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,420
general with some service and give us we
have also an internet connection to a

30
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,420
computer with an Internet connection

31
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:52,730
this might be good for a remote attacker
may be and when we look on absent

32
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:57,070
general will not only smart to view the
app's maybe we can see that we have

33
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:02,380
social networks peer streaming services
are very very popular with the highest

34
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,640
traffic on the internet games like Angry
Birds it's like a play Angry Birds with

35
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:16,700
a remote control which is quite nice
maybe and draws websites with it so true

36
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,589
figure or actually the worst thing is
that you brought a version auto

37
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:28,900
manufacturers like Samsung doesn't
update is also frequently in Chrome or

38
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:37,930
Firefox nowadays case and if you have a
look on devices but the generalization

39
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:43,280
we are we can't rule out cancer transfer
via text which I would present of the

40
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,250
next flights we have a few requirements
to transfer them so first of all an

41
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:54,519
internet connection and rendering engine
in our case maybe a nap rendering engine

42
00:03:54,519 --> 00:04:01,560
from a web browser does make sense from
a security perspective and last but not

43
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,290
least and attackers app which is

44
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:10,819
in somewhere in state device for example
in our case later on we can plug into

45
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:18,858
USB device or re-upload it will be a
battle of a victim thomas was so there

46
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:24,960
are several ways to do it and when we
look at our device decide not abuse we

47
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,180
can see that we have for example BMW
ConnectedDrive so we are able to use

48
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:36,669
Twitter such an important and also next
I mean

49
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:46,150
also your Google Account play or Android
car you can see here what your needs

50
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:53,530
out on the road is Skype or 45 ICQ on
what else freedom of course very very

51
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:58,948
important at the time of Internet of
Things and this was also totally hyped

52
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:06,979
di watch watches in general and even a
fridge has no attacks so you can write

53
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:14,320
SMS were you can call me whenever I
don't know why but you can buy the

54
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:22,180
Steelers and of course if a guy
presented before we have a smart home

55
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,740
base which was maybe in some cases of
possible even smart home can have

56
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:37,440
devices including EPS and last but not
least of cross Matt abuse and website I

57
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,449
thought how can this woman maybe
customer

58
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:53,349
hey my my devices because they make you
happy and consumer you say I actually

59
00:05:53,349 --> 00:06:02,659
don't want this shit but i buy it so
shut up and the case so test of devices

60
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:05,979
what we did is that we bought

61
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,460
top five devices market real situations
of top 50 from the manufacturer

62
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,049
possessed perspective so first of all
Samsung which has a market share of

63
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,110
footy process I think of 2014

64
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:30,639
then because we are going to keep you
was owned by Apple TV without an app

65
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:39,620
stores model model forum March 2015 and
Emerson and what we did is we updated

66
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:45,360
each device so that there are no fixed
missing checks for her abilities may be

67
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:56,229
so they are really up to date so first
of all from a triple perspective we

68
00:06:56,229 --> 00:07:02,229
haven't spoke protective service
actually meant of a middle what we did

69
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:09,960
is that we have opened an encrypted
network and said hey I will listen to be

70
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:16,250
packets which fly around and see what
you can also do this if you have a hot

71
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:21,520
what else or alter it depends on your
setup then we have attached storage

72
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,008
attacker this means an attacker who
keeps un USB device find your device and

73
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:38,050
say hey it's a good idea to put it in a
suit and a Texas Tech number free her

74
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:45,099
victim go into the store and say hey
that's a calculator good idea to have a

75
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:50,020
calculator on the TV show at the
Dartmouth because it's just a case of it

76
00:07:50,020 --> 00:08:00,049
right so first of all be dropping it and
then you move on what we saw is that

77
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:10,610
there are analyzed also be top type of
each category store us 56 apps and 16 of

78
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,509
them have a login option so you type in
your username and password

79
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:22,520
interview yep and for a few steps of
honorable this means they do not use

80
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:34,799
https so no SSL or TLS the same 34 apps
7 absolute lock and free on a cruise and

81
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:46,829
apple just did it in a right way we
always used for us all that pls 102 and

82
00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:52,000
Emma's you at this time so maybe this
was the reason why we didn't find any

83
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:02,120
the airport was packed so let's from p25
pre and stale tabs on TV but where to

84
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,740
ABS which are centered later an
encrypted in the case of a lot in

85
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:14,550
whatever animal skulls and was called to
testify in germany has a very popular

86
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:20,810
company we have tested flight five EPS
somewhere W kids

87
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:29,239
41 absolute total and absolute honour of
all new moves and put that to be the

88
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:37,420
case of course Facebook friends Madrid
aitor unencrypted I didn't expect credit

89
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:45,140
because of Facebook actually using HTTPS
nearly everywhere but not here maybe

90
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:52,560
because of legacy reasons and we know
this company hear the case of Apple

91
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,349
whatever you saw that already in sam's
case so whatever in moscow you put pat

92
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:06,699
Facebook eBay and producer quite nice
for simply take and why we looked on the

93
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:09,699
log files by using Wireshark we found
something interesting

94
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:23,890
will show you what we felt so I will
open its content and I say ok I have a

95
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:31,540
lot of things here I wanna see HTTP
traffic and let's have a look we have be

96
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:40,949
101 here for example please give us an
HTTP request me check XML loaded from

97
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:51,620
Samsung cloud solutions ok now we gon
see Google Analytics somehow about the

98
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:58,420
days may be able playlist because we
watch the music video

99
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:24,620
people in it and if we go life and in
one case line 655 655

100
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:36,440
this so obviously URL here we have an
HTTP request

101
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:44,730
scoreboard research dot com and we
certainly was website and what we saw

102
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:51,180
was surprising because research tricks
you so attract a video of Jennifer Lopez

103
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:56,140
almond oil carry and limited free and
you watched it for two or three minutes

104
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:02,740
quite ok about let's look a little
deeper inside this bequest so we look

105
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:09,670
parameter us a parameter

106
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:24,310
index HTML country do you have the wrong
number and what we see now is what

107
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:31,508
single sign on a democracy what's my
name at and single sign-on possible I

108
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:44,019
don't arrest will switch now to have a
window so business at least part of it

109
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:47,019
we quest what we see here

110
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:48,020
and i cant control animals which was
quiet privacy critical and of course

111
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:53,040
they can look for potential into my
account and any attack Richard slipping

112
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:01,069
my connection because it's transmitted
via HTTP so let's go on to be even

113
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:13,460
better and better so we have a shop
window credentials here and what is

114
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:20,490
written on the webpage squamous research
community a leading global market

115
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,970
research before that studies and reports
on internet trends and behavior

116
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,740
conducts research by collecting internet
web browsing data ok nice and venues a

117
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:35,580
date but it ought to help people use
what they like about it and what they

118
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:40,760
thought so do you have my credentials
for what

119
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:51,350
and potential interviews I'm song single
sign-on chrome world's environmental hey

120
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:58,250
I can stay open remote apps with this
website here I can directly access with

121
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:03,590
the help of a Java applet clouds I can
see what you have safe

122
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:10,470
your computer or laptop maybe BC they
had even recognize us what you have

123
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,120
written with his arms on pan

124
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,950
health so if you have some fitness tips
they can see what's your heartbeat is

125
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:23,480
maybe because of leakage who knows and
so you can also go to the store so you

126
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:30,640
can see credit card data very big time
muscle so more or less you can hack it

127
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:38,090
quotes complete environment if you have
this kind of data and what has already

128
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:42,400
said the LA Galaxy apps something League
find my mobile so you can see where your

129
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,840
victim is now a smart appliances east or
pen up some Sun wallet so there are

130
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,320
stored product updates on such things

131
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:57,360
health is our clothes or all of which
are connected because I think the school

132
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:05,630
and the right way so and we thought ok
situation is really bad case of someone

133
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:15,030
because of this finding may look a
little bit deeper and I thought about

134
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:23,420
him of something abstract be used to
compromise in some way of compromise and

135
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:31,949
as I actually just website website which
is lauded by parsing XML XML just says

136
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:39,780
hey I have this bush in my name and by
the way police opened the index HTML

137
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:46,260
file index HTML color can include
cascading style sheets JavaScript and

138
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:46,780
what else

139
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:55,589
html5 supported and the cool thing is
also but it supports USB device so if

140
00:16:55,590 --> 00:17:00,500
you have a faltar where conflict XML is
stored on it will be ultimate

141
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,650
continually recognized as a nap I just
putting in

142
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:13,560
your smart actually draws experts before
hey let's play out some things in the

143
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,819
Document Object Model at Borders

144
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:25,970
never get out you ok and we all put
walls up SmartTV little apple AAPL

145
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:32,529
WebKit ok smarty view so something
changed somehow I kind of strings so at

146
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:39,100
least they implemented or edit spot hop
into string its mouth and obviously it's

147
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:44,500
also do not space to store ok nice
change to browser what could go right

148
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:51,299
and penetrate our budget location to see
what's actually the fire which reopened

149
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:57,769
and what I saw was surprising because
just once again automatically edit my

150
00:17:57,769 --> 00:18:03,710
singles online account of a single sign
on password and I never expected that it

151
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:08,240
will be transmitted are shown if I use
document location but because it's

152
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:16,549
actually the UL or the file system but
you can also see by the way is your

153
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:25,408
number and some other things so you can
also be anonymised this case so bad

154
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:32,600
enough versus maybe the reason why we
transmitted data because obviously I

155
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:38,600
think document location and then we
tried out some HTML elements to see hey

156
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:45,740
there's something may be smart and they
think it makes sense to get some

157
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:52,980
elements for security reasons and it
made it a lot of using my friends and

158
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,240
maybe some of you know I'm actually
really love the topic of clicking at UAB

159
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,799
dressing and I thought I frame so I can
do

160
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:08,500
classically clickjacking attacks what a
pity and I asked you if your nose and

161
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:19,169
elements are about to shoot us the same
as an iframe HTML context so for us it

162
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:27,990
can log on website that object perfect
so you have a first bypassed we took

163
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:34,480
this year so you say object last I
framework type text HTML later and we

164
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:43,870
have i phone functionality by loading an
arbitrator UAL which is nice I look what

165
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:49,779
I found was very interesting development
for all thought there was there to the

166
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:55,289
iframe element was forbidden because of
security reasons so obviously become

167
00:19:55,289 --> 00:20:04,370
bypass security reasons and the answer
is this week here with the help of you

168
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:09,678
object element we were able to use the
fire protocol so we put in finally and

169
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:16,460
perhaps we can also access system so we
have access to be smart if you even

170
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:23,860
worse we have like access so we can read
all the files which are stored on my TV

171
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:34,379
here and we can put in here a path
filename directly open it and also said

172
00:20:34,379 --> 00:20:39,080
it's deliberate complicated to rely on a
spotted you so you want to transfer them

173
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,799
to a server to get a clue solver and
possibly have a little bit Ajax

174
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:49,580
functionality which we implemented and
two kinds of transferring data so first

175
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:57,760
of all Ajax think so what we do that we
read the file and send it to me to be

176
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,940
server and the second one is xxxx

177
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,940
for XML external entities and what we do
is we can reach out automatically one

178
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:12,050
line of code so for example we are able
to read out automatically by just

179
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:17,159
plugging the USB device intuitive you or
just having and steals and malicious app

180
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:23,720
without opening it you first name or buy
something singer someone I did which is

181
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:32,470
safe here and this is how i text look
like so for example we have xxxx we say

182
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:38,840
at the complex XML which is a truncated
here police open source files folder

183
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:46,030
here at after that you should check out
all the XML file because of some entity

184
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:52,980
stuff and what we do here is that we are
requesting a UL which does not exist or

185
00:21:52,980 --> 00:22:01,510
is not as expects to file a payload or
the continent from our hijacked by law

186
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:09,980
file system so we are requesting a fire
which is named because of constant here

187
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:17,630
which means an attacker looks in 20
lakhs is able to read on any date or if

188
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:25,900
he's able to change something here this
attribute double-cross so what kind of

189
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:31,500
bias can we access so first of all we
can access wifi dater so various Britain

190
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:38,460
hotspot its name and of course a text so
every time when I go into the whole tail

191
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:48,320
and a USB device will have to be wifi
password then at cookies and cookies are

192
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:58,159
accessible local storage later of course
so we were for example able to steal her

193
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,240
from his attitude

194
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:12,270
haven't already named Rosa history and
coming use this means if you are using a

195
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:18,430
Samsung TV it automatically stores each
user input into a file and I'll rings

196
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:23,690
your you so when you put in your
username or even your password

197
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:31,130
it will be stored fair and on pace and
place to that was my username and my

198
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:39,380
best but because these credentials are
in most cases I am i coming and we were

199
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:45,060
also able to access the webcast will you
can see some some web cam locks we have

200
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:54,720
API possibilities here actually we more
or less able to control smart TV in some

201
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:04,510
way but we also found is also be able to
read out our API keys and API secrets

202
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:11,310
for example from Facebook and just once
again as a reminder call ya

203
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:16,960
Britain and not to log into the user
Internet application but access rights

204
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:24,990
specific resources to it so it grants
access rights but we were able to spoof

205
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:31,920
a client but we are not able to steal
potentials but however able to go to

206
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:39,160
Facebook and say hey I am and I can
authenticate which is quite nice and the

207
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:44,740
most important figure API cree is
probably instead of millions of devices

208
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:53,640
because its aesthetic you delivered by
Facebook and his approval so we verified

209
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:57,800
this really works its aesthetic
JavaScript file and interest JavaScript

210
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,530
API cream and the API secret

211
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,960
and what can you do if victim things
hate you are really has undergone

212
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:19,210
airport a Facebook app for example you
can see the public profile of a victim

213
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:26,770
reduce heat the timeline for
relationships fotos de France websites

214
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:31,350
nearly all of the things you can even do
a post on the timeline and sent

215
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:39,270
notification so actually control some
cases the whole environment of a victim

216
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:47,260
here and I just want to say it's
actually a never ending story the case

217
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:56,150
of some sort because there are several
attacks before had some problems with

218
00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:02,440
your voice recording so when you are
maybe a chance but it listens to your

219
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,380
commands and these commands of the
transmitter to sample so they know what

220
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:13,420
you are talking about the past this is
this a very big spread out there was

221
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:19,100
also a nice attack from Collin Mulliner
which is called read twice the storage

222
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,719
space time of use a time of checkout
time of use a tech and what he did was

223
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:29,460
in stable and militias feel up to it

224
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:36,860
intuitive you just by using some tricks
and this is quite nice so we see is

225
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:41,939
leaking dangerous not new its daily
malicious applications also no

226
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:53,410
credentials to an arbitrary epicenter is
right and in the past several magazines

227
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:59,620
TV stations and so on covered this topic
because it was published I think one or

228
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:06,169
two months ago also gone and the
question is what happens what did

229
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:15,270
because her abilities in March and
actually nothing happens oh well it

230
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:22,370
happens something they do not answer any
email after publishing is quite nice and

231
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:28,649
what I have read last week's was that an
instance of from our trip was failure

232
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:35,610
which has caught up with some pollo its
consumer advice editor of our contact a

233
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:43,760
lawyer because of some privacy
violations and we're not our findings so

234
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:50,590
we are also some other vulnerabilities
and we fought him wouldn't it be cool to

235
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:54,340
get some money because of backbone to
programs because when you're gone on

236
00:27:54,340 --> 00:28:00,039
Facebook body program and you get 40 X
60 attack for example about 20,000 euros

237
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:07,210
and I've had come by but we can to get
something and we didn't get any taller

238
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:18,309
and eerie Wat Pho it has written a page
and a contender reason why they told us

239
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:20,928
our website

240
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:25,600
there was written abilities

241
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:33,350
parties without our agreement so this
means I will never have a possibility to

242
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:43,120
publish backs if something will not fix
them or give them a chance to fix the

243
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:49,719
Xbox within six months I think and I
tested them one month ago and they were

244
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,280
not fixed yet conclusions

245
00:28:53,799 --> 00:29:00,389
fast we have a lot of Internet of Things
technologies and I think it's it's a

246
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:06,370
good idea to use him some way out for
example I have a samsung Smart TVs and

247
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:10,239
I'm also using Amazon Prime and I think
it's quite nice because it's easy to use

248
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,220
and I have two services why not it's a
legal thing also comes up

249
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:20,900
but it may be a better idea to change
something which should be only changed

250
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,919
by experts for example if you change
your browser

251
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:30,600
the only person or instances companies
should change your browser should be or

252
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:39,850
maybe Yahoo Microsoft and when we look
at the lessons learnt sexual we can see

253
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:47,719
yet provable countermeasures lack pls
encrypt your data which is not really

254
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:55,440
you should not safe send it later like
wi-fi crater which is maybe complicated

255
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:02,159
fix and of course use our imports coming
years I imports unencrypted on your TV

256
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:12,450
and even business also you should not
run with root privileges this is

257
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,270
nonsense

258
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:18,730
fifteen years twenty years and we have
also expected a cent boxing like

259
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:25,299
mechanism because there is also it is
also possible to use of high protocol

260
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:33,200
there but we expected to various kind of
layer which is a lot of excess but it

261
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:40,520
wasn't the case or they really did all
the things wrong I think and was

262
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:45,639
actually for you of all of us if you
have a Samsung TV or a smarty by as much

263
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,820
as a webcam maybe put a paper before all
the webcam in front of it to protect

264
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:57,168
your cell so if you want to be watched
so that's it i hope you enjoyed it thank

265
00:30:57,169 --> 00:31:00,169
you

266
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:22,780
your questions dangers internet you
mentioned you looked at other smart TVs

267
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:35,330
did you find similar sorts on LG's but
we are a little bit different I will not

268
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:42,699
save it be a secure a difference and
also but the focus was because of our

269
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:49,920
privacy violation finding a talk about
at least three months of evaluation

270
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:05,840
getting the wifi password of the Samsung
TV public understand a little bit scared

271
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:20,040
to do this maybe after his response and
losses but they are not really not happy

272
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:39,020
personnel further discoveries for the
question so maybe even if you want to

273
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,690
know what actually continent of

274
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:50,250
also history was playing we looked on
the TV to drink a beer for me because

275
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:54,660
there were some really nice finding so I
can tell you what we technically

276
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:59,020
technical guy before we received it

277
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:20,210
if you look at the browser history or
something that was returned to the store

278
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:26,529
and then sold to you with a new device
cannot cannot really say that because

279
00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:34,080
it's actually update would have also
updated the firmware and this is maybe

280
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:45,769
we brought all of these devices may be
all but sealed refurbished device or

281
00:33:45,769 --> 00:33:50,700
that was the visit tomorrow in a shop
for example some customers probably

282
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:57,679
check their facebook but we have tested
