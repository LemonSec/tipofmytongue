1
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,010
my name is on the lawn on this
presentation will be about their results

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,240
for security assessment of the Internet
protocol version 6

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,530
um just us

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,650
introduction of our of the material that
I am

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,730
that I'm going to prison today it is
basically like a a high-level discussion

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,540
of the results that I got I when working
on I'll

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,880
in odd on add to your all brushing on
security assessment of

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,940
ipv6 from this is a brief

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,849
into the action of the world that I have
been doing the last few years I

10
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,600
basically it has been about working on
security assessment of of communication

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,320
protocols

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,280
for the UK I for the most part analyzing
protocol specifications

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,300
analyzing a implementations of those
particles

14
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,890
finding ways to actually iraq both
implementations

15
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,839
them for these fixes and to the extent
that was possible in some cases even

16
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:00,650
actually

17
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,019
values in some patches to actually fix
those problems

18
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,110
I so you haven't fuel URL's their where
you can find

19
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,150
publications that have done during the
last few years and

20
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,460
and so on soul on

21
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,220
this is briefly India agenda for this
presentation

22
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,298
first of all I will give like it very
brief introduction

23
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,060
to ipv6 just a single slide so that the
fee

24
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,710
maybe just stay appear about ipv6 but
don't really know what it is so I'll

25
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,149
I will provide be so many and try to

26
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:36,329
do a compression of both particles so
that

27
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,850
if you're familiar with I before you can
basically port

28
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,170
done knowledge to to ipv6 and then
getting to the

29
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,229
I don't say that they technical
discussions the Daniel discussion about

30
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:50,009
that too cute implications of

31
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,090
of ipv6 arm

32
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:57,560
so what's their motivation of the doc
offers the following the event that you

33
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,719
could have just hit about ipv6 but

34
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:03,049
don't really know what to disavow the
DA's that we

35
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:07,299
the current internet I uses the ipv4
particle the house

36
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:11,180
32 lead RSS and where basically running
out of address es

37
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,580
which means that we will be having
problems with connecting new devices to

38
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,300
the Internet

39
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,020
sold these protocol ipv6 was I develop

40
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,980
to actually address the problem
basically ipv6 cuss

41
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,470
128 beat addresses which means that

42
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,720
it should give us enough obvious is to
connect all devices that we may want to

43
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,800
connect to the internet

44
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,850
I am the original idea was that we would
have deployed

45
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:41,340
ipv6 like about ten years ago or so
before actually need in it

46
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,590
that wasn't the case for example

47
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,740
current estimation sound that I one
person or actually less than one percent

48
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,430
of the global Internet traffic he said

49
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,040
26 which is of course just a little bit
of it and

50
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,200
it's like God very different place from
the one in which we would like to be

51
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,280
we like b6 traffic to be much higher
right now it is not

52
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,600
are however on the upside or on the good
sign

53
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,560
I am most of the general porpoise
operating systems to help support for

54
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,400
ipv6

55
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,030
I which essentially means that if for
example you wanted to deploy

56
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,120
dawn usually on on a local area network

57
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,610
you are able to do it I am

58
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,070
I say that up 18

59
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,410
ipv6 had been like basically nor from
quite a few years

60
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,780
and the skier that situation sort of
change

61
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,370
a little bit there was basically as a
result of a number of events that

62
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,420
happened this year

63
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,700
for example if I recall correctly will
see in February L your

64
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,550
in February this year that on the three
pool of ipv4 hours he said the INS but X

65
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,130
Houston

66
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,530
basically I I P RSS either

67
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,010
before or ipv6 are a sign

68
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,390
first of all by Anna deliberation on
registries

69
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,090
for example right in Europe airing in
there in North Americans along

70
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,790
and did the central ball a free %uh this
is something I got exiles 10

71
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,690
I am that again actually got quite a bit
of press

72
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:11,430
so in many organizations the got to know
about the problem of artistic social as

73
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,190
a result of

74
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,550
of that event then in June eighth

75
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,630
the CRM now we have the quality 16 which

76
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:22,340
basically what about having and be
content providers

77
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,259
such as cool facebook another's I enable
ipv6 on the production services

78
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:31,940
I which from my perspective wall so much
for BD from a technical point of view

79
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,730
but he was important from an awareness
pond a few

80
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,100
many people started talking about ipv6
all they started talking within the

81
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,760
organization somebody p6

82
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,500
awesome something quality six-day I am

83
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,560
agency that we learn much from the wall
I B six day but again it was important

84
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,140
from an awareness point of view

85
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,539
and finally as a result of that babies
to events

86
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,550
I basically most organizations right
here started to consider

87
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,960
dick exception of the local below three
ipv4 addresses

88
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,840
for example there are estimations I
don't know exactly what they read more

89
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,170
its

90
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,390
already exhausted but for example the
asia-pacific region

91
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:12,110
it's the first one to exiles the the
round ipv4

92
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,230
space prolly Europe comes next

93
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,300
and then I will prolly Africa and Latin

94
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,360
and the Latin America and Caribbean
region soul

95
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,130
disorganization started now to conceal
did morning which the

96
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,320
actually not be able to get anymore I am
ipv4 addresses

97
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,740
from the racial racist rate so so so the
fourth

98
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,150
all of this event I it looks like it P
six is finally taking off

99
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,420
in the sense that I most organizations
are

100
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,400
up the very least having some kind of
plan about what to do with it

101
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,620
doesn't mean that they are deploying the
Drano but the

102
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,430
they have something in mind to do what
to me about it

103
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,000
so llame what's the motivation of this
presentation

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,550
if you have ever hear about ID six it's
some highly probable that do you have

105
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,040
I rental lease into quite a lot of
minutes

106
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,870
about him I if we talk about ipv6 in
general you may have here thing such us

107
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,490
arm that it has improved quality of
service

108
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,050
you may have even share things such as:
seek helps with the

109
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,310
Lake a with the consumption of energy

110
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:22,690
a chance funny but actually I have even
read just sort of Claim Form quite

111
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:26,130
from quite a few people even people that
are supposed to work on on on the

112
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,409
technical field

113
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,660
and when it comes to security itself are
you he had prolly

114
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,590
sure to meet such as: a that's a cutie

115
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,360
wall sconce either away I BBC Trust been
deciding

116
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,680
then there's people that are dad with a
BB 6 did the security but i think im

117
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,720
will basically

118
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,190
basically change from neighbor centric
to ha sentry

119
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,090
which means that if you have I'll just
say no they stand endorsing which

120
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,700
for the most part securities in force at
the network edge

121
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,860
with ipv6 that'll change and basically
you move all the security that you have

122
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,080
on the network edge to

123
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,389
to the hots I then there's people that
aren't that

124
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:08,620
as a result of b6 deployment there will
be increased use of IT sec

125
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,350
on Baldy Smith a good actually continue

126
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,380
from my perspective basically they have
had a negative

127
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,940
impact I index Easton ipv6 deployments

128
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,730
and in the new ID six the problem is
that I'd imagine

129
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,790
basically because people start blowin my
PC queen

130
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,260
we the wrong assumptions so arm

131
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,570
for the most part when I will try to do
in this presentation is

132
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:36,639
try to analyze most most of these myths
and try to see

133
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,010
I am if they are actually two or

134
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,909
nayyar if there's some truth to them or
if they are basically just me

135
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:47,639
a nothing more than done and of course a
said

136
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,650
because of the the time constraints are
I

137
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:54,220
one really get into specific people
never lied is but

138
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,790
actually try to influence the way in
which at doing what you think about ipv6

139
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,000
security

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,440
and on allies up too high level some
aspects of

141
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,880
of ipv6 security soul

142
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,199
first the full before actually getting
into the technical stuff

143
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,270
its interesting to actually analyzed big
the context in which we are working on

144
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,680
on basic security you week usually when
you are

145
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,580
even like some kind of technology do I
delight it's a cutie

146
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,930
up properties you basically focus just
on the technical aspects but

147
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,360
when it comes to the effective security
that you get with that technology

148
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,430
they are usually other factors that come
into play

149
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:34,909
so I have tried to summarize here are
they want to rethink their most

150
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,439
important of all

151
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,139
first of all we have much less
experience we'd be six then we have with

152
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:41,219
ipv4

153
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,459
and that's important because no matter
how good or bad thing though she may be

154
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,519
eased a personal that East employees and

155
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:49,689
that technology is not the nomination a
lot about in

156
00:08:49,689 --> 00:08:53,259
up role in the the quality and the
security of those deployments is not

157
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:55,529
going to be quite good

158
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:59,720
I and then there is the one about the
maturity of ipv6 implementations

159
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,309
basically people to any site that

160
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:06,209
keeps a database of of will now be
judged by serious you will find at least

161
00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:07,089
100 about

162
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:12,009
I before implementations and if you look
for the same thing but for ipv6

163
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:15,069
you prolly will find like half of it
like

164
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:18,998
up fifty or maybe even less up on any
device is

165
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:22,600
on for some people that's kind of like
an indication that ipv6 is more secure

166
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,019
than

167
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:26,699
done before but from my perspective
that's actually an indication that we

168
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,019
still have to do a lot of work on B six

169
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:33,180
so eventually will we will help sort of
the same number of gravity of bison is

170
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,660
forty-six done for before

171
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,999
is just a model of working more on on da

172
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:41,930
and actually get to the school yr old
they're born at need is that may still

173
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:42,619
be present

174
00:09:42,619 --> 00:09:46,769
in in in ipv6 implementations

175
00:09:46,769 --> 00:09:50,899
there's also the issue of all ipv6
support and security devices

176
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:54,069
usually for some the other file lot your
organization

177
00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:58,189
in may be the case that he has some
these are the feature 44

178
00:09:58,189 --> 00:10:01,740
and if you try to I do similar things

179
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,949
but we don't bb6 what that support is
not present

180
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:08,180
arm told there's not body of features

181
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,439
in in in security devices that are all
other

182
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:15,329
cases in which maybe a device has
similar features for before then

183
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:16,319
forty-six

184
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:21,170
but I am for example the ipv4 support
East implemented in hardware

185
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:25,069
we rested basic support is implemented
in software so depending on where in the

186
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:26,699
network you're deploying the device

187
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:29,910
that might or might not be an issue I

188
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:34,100
did another factor is that of network
complexity us we deploy in PBC

189
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,160
didn't know were the complexity of of
the internet we weekly increase

190
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,410
first before we will basically have to
networking protocols in the internet

191
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:41,749
that

192
00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:45,029
a supposed to just one so we basically
running

193
00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:48,220
ipv4 and ipv6 in Puttalam

194
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,309
I'll have increased use of gnats I

195
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:55,129
someone who may wonderful cock on the
insane that we will have increased use

196
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:58,829
of nazi factually I mean people aren't
that I am

197
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:03,459
we have ipv6 to actually get rid of
gnats well the thing is that

198
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:06,639
as a result of deploying ipv6 we will
actually have to deploy

199
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,129
what it called a lot of of Matt's to
actually be able to deal with it

200
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:14,379
with this transition they will have
deployment of are quite a few other

201
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:15,809
transition technologies

202
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:19,129
that does may be in the form of all of
tunnels

203
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:22,189
translation and others but the the
bottom line

204
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:26,240
he studied complexity of the network is
going to increase quite a lot

205
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,910
I am even right now if you try in some
cases if you try to do

206
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,660
to troubleshoot network problem son
let's say that

207
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,618
you cut some sort of communication that
is failing and the cost in ball

208
00:11:37,619 --> 00:11:40,809
are you seeing I D seats are some
transition technology

209
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:44,029
sometimes it gets like berry had likely
troubleshoot

210
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:47,819
those in areas because of the complexity

211
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:51,589
and finally there's the issue of lack of
well-trained personnel

212
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:55,029
which is sort of related with the first
one but the thing is that

213
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:58,759
not only we have less experience with
the six but there's also usually

214
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:02,410
not that many people died I have
actually like good knowledge of

215
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,689
of ipv6 I inning when prolly

216
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:09,009
by looking at the issue would have like
it very negative in

217
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:12,009
impression of what the then this
situation is right now

218
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:15,160
the thing is that form many
organizations ipv6

219
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,160
is the only thing that you have on the
table talk to you remain on this

220
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,839
business

221
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:23,629
which essentially means that if you want
to continue incorporating new customers

222
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:27,619
you need to give them a précis and the
only thing that we have on the table to

223
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:28,230
do that

224
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:33,369
he said bb6 so you would be you will be
sort of Fortune to actually deal

225
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:36,850
would be things Salaam

226
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,749
I would provide it very very brief
operation about before I'm ipv6

227
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:44,119
to accept that it's possible I usually
try to lock highlight that what

228
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:47,679
what the two particles have in common
possible to take the attitude of world

229
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:50,480
peace is a completely different particle
forget about everything they know about

230
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,980
before

231
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,300
%uh because actually in many aspects
or.org at least the high-level

232
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,439
they are very similar in most cases

233
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:03,209
I what changes what changes are the

234
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:06,929
the the small details so I as I said
before

235
00:13:06,929 --> 00:13:09,939
the the most important aspect of the 60s
I

236
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:13,980
the increased our myspace 120 a beat as
opposed to the 32 it's in

237
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,889
in before for others resolution before
employs art

238
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:21,220
a supposed to neighbor discovery in
ninety-six

239
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,249
neighbor discovery is based on on ICMP
version 6 messages

240
00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:28,679
I'll when it comes to out configuration
before

241
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,929
I we have basically the ACP version for
on grid or solicitation and advertising

242
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:34,129
messages

243
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:37,529
also I I'd say that the most widely

244
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:42,369
article generation mechanism East the
ATP many system don't even need support

245
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:46,160
dole's ICMP before message than perfect

246
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,069
I in the six we have Judy friend out a
configuration mechanisms

247
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:53,869
I am one is space on ICMP messages
where's the other one

248
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:58,730
is the ATP version 6 which is analogous
to the ATP version for

249
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:02,290
44 isolation that he's are reporting
there were errors

250
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:07,349
we have in I'd be 4i CB version for and
see nothing in ninety-six

251
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,519
actually prolly died of fall isolation
he's one of the aspects in which

252
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,499
these two particles are more similar
with each other

253
00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:20,220
I'll then I did before I i guess its a
40s optional

254
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,910
which means that according to the
protocol specifications if you have a

255
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:27,730
a night before implementation that
implementation Dustin necessarily

256
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,399
implement might be sick

257
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,600
i in the case of ipv6 I P six support

258
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,699
is supposed to be mandatory but the idea
if he's working right now to actually be

259
00:14:36,699 --> 00:14:37,309
great that

260
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:40,499
that requirement to optional which means
that I

261
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:43,699
in the future in one be mandatory to
have I

262
00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:47,869
be sick implementation in an ipv6
implementation

263
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:50,999
and finally another aspect these data
fragmentation which are

264
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:54,649
in before use perform both up cost and
waters

265
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:57,910
whereas in the case of ipv6 is only
perform at at

266
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:02,019
in systems right host yep

267
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:06,379
Emily ismael the gust least not this
going which is basically improbable that

268
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:07,239
he's use for

269
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,860
come to come August traffic and the
reason we G

270
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,509
a mention in each India in the slide is
because arm

271
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:17,869
when it comes to for example neighbor
discovery that of

272
00:15:17,869 --> 00:15:22,569
stay in my being obviously sterling
layout missus ipv6 uses Malta gust a

273
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:23,459
postal

274
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,529
broadcast that we have been in before
and that

275
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:29,839
basically the reason for which he has to
implement more because he's in on this

276
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:30,339
colony

277
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:34,389
to so at strictly speaking want to use
for other solution

278
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:38,790
eastern neighbor discovery ICMP messages
but then you also need to have more to

279
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,110
go season and is calling

280
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,209
we chill Blyden I'm not going to discuss
eating

281
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:46,389
the said the Flies bud there are some
versions of

282
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:49,699
Emily that are actually quite complex
saw

283
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:54,649
yet emily has its own I security
implications

284
00:15:54,649 --> 00:16:00,079
um okay so let's start discussing some
of their security implications of

285
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,019
of b6 on the first one that I will talk
about Easter implications

286
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:07,339
I of ipv6 address in

287
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:10,749
sole such a brief overview a city for
the main driver

288
00:16:10,749 --> 00:16:13,809
for the 60s increase other space

289
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:18,269
house 120 beats obvious is and but aside
from that

290
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,769
I mean aside from the artist's any other
space other sites

291
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:25,119
are basically 86 addressing he said very
similar to

292
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:28,119
I i've been for everything I you have
the offices

293
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:31,989
aggregated for the purpose of running so
of course you will have a longer path

294
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:32,749
exists but

295
00:16:32,749 --> 00:16:36,499
it's essentially the same I have
different type of irises

296
00:16:36,499 --> 00:16:39,889
for example you need us and doesn't want
to Gus unique us

297
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:43,819
obviously mean that I to single out is
that identifies a single system

298
00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:47,019
we asked for some political see some
single others that identifies

299
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:51,379
in multiple number of of systems I we
also have different other schools

300
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:54,819
which means that we have addresses that
are only barely on the local Inc

301
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:57,819
all other a.m. that's the case of lingo
calamitous

302
00:16:57,819 --> 00:17:01,309
ya to help dole addresses that are in
supposed to be unique and the whole

303
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:02,499
internet and so on

304
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:06,120
and that's exactly the case we before we
before we also happening not allow this

305
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,260
is Lowell Allison

306
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,490
and so on Bali one of the few difference
between

307
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,130
on before 96 is that on

308
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,240
when you look at them up to 96 cost I

309
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,319
any given time its use in more than one
out this a of

310
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,119
more one a of more want i okay so it's
usually the case that

311
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,480
if you look at the consideration of a
single interface in at the six cost

312
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,630
discussed telling local artists and it
may help 1 or maybe a few more

313
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:36,580
I for example global unit cost assist us
probably the

314
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:41,529
all the different between the before on
the sick side missing

315
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:45,970
so um of all the others is that are
available in the six-day only one

316
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,110
the only once a about which I'm I'm
going to talk a little bit

317
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:53,500
are glowing unique %uh star missus this
is basically the format of the sinuses

318
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,200
I have basically a girl would impress X
which is the perfect

319
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,000
has been assigned by your ISP for
example then had a few beats for

320
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,740
submitting

321
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,740
exactly the same as with ID for and
finally have

322
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,960
if you reached 64 beats usually for the
interface a the

323
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,580
which is analogous to the host lady that
you having in in ninety before so

324
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,289
essentially

325
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:17,500
your sis destructor all the other sis
are the same us in

326
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,519
in before I said before did big-dollar
with graphics is usually assigned by

327
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,730
your ISP

328
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,289
this summit anybody know where means
trade only two sides have to summit

329
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:30,360
the network I when it comes to the
interface eighty its

330
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,799
I usually a sign but the actual cost is
not like a central server

331
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,330
that handles order to sign the interface
anybody's actually

332
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,510
every cost to connect to the network
assigns its its own

333
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:45,480
interface eighty there are different
policies that you can use to

334
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,840
I am to selecting the face Eddie the
most common one is what is usually

335
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,899
referred to us modify

336
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:56,249
EU 164 identifiers which job putting
English

337
00:18:56,249 --> 00:19:00,440
means that you basically take them my
Goddess of your network interface card a

338
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,179
new board

339
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:04,979
that are rescinding the face any just
sleep in a few minutes but

340
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:08,649
up basically what you do is you put in
my car is in the interface nd

341
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:12,589
there are always to select the interface
City for something you may manually

342
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:13,479
configure

343
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:16,959
and iris and then I am and then

344
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:20,199
end up without assessing which thing the
face avec all CEOs

345
00:19:20,199 --> 00:19:23,459
except for the last fight iron there are
some

346
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:26,629
in some systems the other sis are
assigned randomly

347
00:19:26,629 --> 00:19:29,859
sold the day they may be a random number
and so on

348
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:33,489
so what's on related with the

349
00:19:33,489 --> 00:19:36,649
the globe the format of blowing you need
us other cities that there's usually

350
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:40,249
me dad you gonna redo Pasqualini

351
00:19:40,249 --> 00:19:44,259
ipv6 usually the when you hear the sort
of claim

352
00:19:44,259 --> 00:19:47,309
it's because people usually assume that
scenes the

353
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:51,709
ID ID six artists are I SolarEdge for
something up sixty four beats

354
00:19:51,709 --> 00:19:56,309
just for a single network be virtually
impossible to actually perform

355
00:19:56,309 --> 00:19:59,418
alike and brute force scan of the whole
other space even

356
00:19:59,419 --> 00:20:03,559
if you talk about the single subnet I
mean seeing local network you should

357
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:07,969
you should need to I you need to send
like lots and lots of pockets usually

358
00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:11,219
the numbers this initial somebody to
take more than a hundred years to

359
00:20:11,219 --> 00:20:11,749
actually

360
00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:14,859
scanning a complete naylor so I am

361
00:20:14,859 --> 00:20:18,968
that essential basically gums on one
hand because of the increase on MySpace

362
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:22,319
but on the other hand because people
usually assume that I am

363
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,539
date the cost obvious he said basically
selected randomly

364
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:30,069
for a long day at the the available at
this pace so when I was studying and

365
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:31,158
analyzing this stuff

366
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:35,709
I a trying to figure out I with that was
actually the case

367
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:39,789
of course the eight the obvious basis
much larger but the idea was to figure

368
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:42,889
out whether the %uh this is work to be
randomly selected or not

369
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:47,359
of fortnightly there was a paper that
was polish not that many years ago

370
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,399
its references herein this is like its
nice

371
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:54,019
this is is a nice winning on what these
guys actually tried to

372
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:58,269
they basically connected some I don't go
to was a web server an FTP server

373
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:02,759
to the Internet I of course accessible
to the public

374
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:06,459
and are what did basically did the
recorded

375
00:21:06,459 --> 00:21:09,959
each of the source RSS there were use to
access that

376
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:14,239
FTP or web several whatever so they try
to figure out if there was any

377
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,399
Potter that the other ceased where where
we're following

378
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:21,579
when so these are some of the cathedral
is that these guys Pro Bowls

379
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:24,839
for the for the RTC's their first the
first of them

380
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:28,448
East I %uh this is that are based on
their on the mic congress

381
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:31,449
the Nissan this is that in me at that
include in the in the face it:

382
00:21:31,449 --> 00:21:36,539
did mr congress of of of the cost there
are other issues that include on ipv4

383
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:37,219
address

384
00:21:37,219 --> 00:21:41,019
there are others is that as I said
before these ones that are Colo vide

385
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:44,049
that basically have an interpreter the
awful seals adjusted

386
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:48,999
last by by race and in our Privacy on
this is that basically our

387
00:21:48,999 --> 00:21:52,569
run them other overseas dad are the

388
00:21:52,569 --> 00:21:56,649
referred to them a swarthy which means
that some sort of ipv6 addresses

389
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,849
I am been expressing accepted him on the
station

390
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:03,069
you can forms if you were such just did
the fair

391
00:22:03,069 --> 00:22:06,418
and there are a few other out is that
have to do with some transition

392
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:07,219
technologies

393
00:22:07,219 --> 00:22:11,289
so these are roughly the results dust
that these guys got

394
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:14,989
when measuring the how obvious is our
sin I

395
00:22:14,989 --> 00:22:18,249
on the left you can see a tale that
summarizes how addresses are assigned

396
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:18,979
for

397
00:22:18,979 --> 00:22:22,129
for hostile fifty percent of them where

398
00:22:22,129 --> 00:22:25,589
a including in my car s in the interface
eighty

399
00:22:25,589 --> 00:22:29,259
the have a 20 percent of them that would
include in an ipv4 address

400
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:32,789
10 percent worked eighteen detail of
this is did I say

401
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:37,329
a at transition technology that is
usually implemented mostly in Microsoft

402
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:37,829
products

403
00:22:37,829 --> 00:22:41,399
that are open source implementation but
mostly Microsoft products

404
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:44,509
on the rest of the bodies are mostly
marginal

405
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:47,719
of course if you tried to light up all
of these all of

406
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:50,979
those world values you don't get to 100
percent because there were quite a few

407
00:22:50,979 --> 00:22:53,190
obvious is that they were not able to
categorize

408
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:57,209
into one category or the other now when
it comes to our sister

409
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,909
are employed by waters I the numbers
changed quite a bit

410
00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:04,259
last seventy percent of the irises are
low by dialysis

411
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:08,119
which means that the interface a the
East all seals except for the last nine

412
00:23:08,119 --> 00:23:11,139
and the reason for that is obviously
done in the case of writer's

413
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:14,969
usually configured the addresses by him
so you're not going to select like in

414
00:23:14,969 --> 00:23:15,869
random number

415
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:18,929
but you basically select a an interface
and the or another is that he's

416
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:22,099
easy to remember sold seventy percent of
the outages hello by

417
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:25,649
then you have a five percent of all this
is that are hiding for base which means

418
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:28,889
that the include a and 94 others in the
ipv6 address

419
00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:32,219
the recent for ladies policy not to

420
00:23:32,219 --> 00:23:35,889
una ball to the low byte out missus you
see that you have a on

421
00:23:35,889 --> 00:23:39,029
I think the forerunner a new you
remember it's

422
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:42,200
I it's a pity for artist so it's

423
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,829
I am 11 possible one possible way to
actually

424
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:49,200
select an ipv6 address that is easy to
remember

425
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,289
East included before advancing the six
hours

426
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:55,679
and the rest of the numbers they were
the ones that are worthy privacy and so

427
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,379
on they are very very small

428
00:23:58,379 --> 00:24:01,700
so what are they conclusions to which we
can get from

429
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,769
from these numbers well first of all

430
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:07,940
ipv6 other Isis are not assigned
randomly

431
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,059
actually should take a look at those
numbers Dr I not run the model

432
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:15,389
I am so it's not really true dat

433
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:19,089
I ipv6 makes a whole scanning at X
impossible

434
00:24:19,089 --> 00:24:22,569
actually strictly speaking probably what
they make impossible

435
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:26,269
use brute force scanning at us with
basically means that if you are going to

436
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:29,309
just try to run democracies well you're
prone

437
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:33,079
Brian are going to get anywhere but I am

438
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:36,319
it's still possible to performing cost
cutting out again

439
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:39,509
in ipv6 if you L

440
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:44,009
incorporates some intelligence in in
your us cutting tools

441
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:47,359
I'll my take is that oppose cutting
other

442
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:51,408
seen in ninety-six are going to be much
less brute force and in before

443
00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:54,829
the reason for would you do with forests
coming up it's in the 40

444
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:58,899
because it doesn't really make sense to
try to I incorporate conditions in the

445
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:00,059
in this cutting tools

446
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:04,229
I mean is cheap to actually do before
scanning but e96

447
00:25:04,229 --> 00:25:08,659
you if you don't implement any sort of
intelligence in yours cutting tools

448
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:12,509
I'll you're probably not going to be
able to find any any cost that he's

449
00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:15,699
that he's like us it got a point I think
that

450
00:25:15,699 --> 00:25:19,299
for example in MoP just landed implement
any sort of are

451
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:22,569
like cost-cutting for b6 cost-cutting
the sense of

452
00:25:22,569 --> 00:25:26,289
trying more than one address okay they
do implement for example port scanning

453
00:25:26,289 --> 00:25:27,190
forty-six

454
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:31,129
that he's even a single ipv6 address
they can tell you which ports are open

455
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,459
or not but the

456
00:25:32,459 --> 00:25:35,719
Donnie implement like I am

457
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:39,799
anything talk to be scum that gave me a
whole range of of irises

458
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:43,449
I am there are quite a few techniques
that could actually be

459
00:25:43,449 --> 00:25:46,769
a employed for for doing b6 cunning

460
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:51,109
for example I basically liberation Rs
predictability

461
00:25:51,109 --> 00:25:54,129
which means the for example you good
I'll

462
00:25:54,129 --> 00:25:58,029
let's say that you know that something
work selects the other sis

463
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:01,129
I starting from others 1&2 once a lawn

464
00:26:01,129 --> 00:26:04,629
well you could basically tried just
decided to sing instead of doing it with

465
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:04,959
force

466
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:08,259
stunning attack another thing that you
could do for some police

467
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:11,289
try like start trying run democracies

468
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:14,639
and then if you find another study so
alive and you know that

469
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:18,009
miss say that the Dodgers corresponds to
are real pic

470
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:22,569
interface cars world often for one
single obvious then you try all the

471
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:25,089
other obvious is that it belonged to
reel tape because he thinks

472
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:28,319
like a large organization chances are
that all of their

473
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,729
system that they have in that there were
have been modified to abide by the same

474
00:26:31,729 --> 00:26:32,769
people

475
00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:35,779
I and then there are all the ways in
which you good perform

476
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:38,789
cost-cutting attacks like take another
dish

477
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:42,369
of all of all the particles it could be
local particles such as neighbor

478
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:43,299
discovery

479
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:46,809
more because the NES and others but you
could also you could also

480
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:51,289
exploit for example up occasionally in
particles arm one mic construct for

481
00:26:51,289 --> 00:26:52,999
example a doll that looks for

482
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:56,919
are not torrents and tries to me
extracted be six offices from the

483
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:57,690
torrents

484
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:00,929
you can for example being some kind of
told that last serches

485
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:04,249
are online me some types on the Internet

486
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:07,619
and usually if you take a look at the
mall he there if you can find b6 out

487
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:08,489
this is the air

488
00:27:08,489 --> 00:27:12,999
are still there are quite a few um but
if you think that you could expect you

489
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:13,889
good the

490
00:27:13,889 --> 00:27:18,449
exploit to actually do Arkle scanning
asset kind of accommodation

491
00:27:18,449 --> 00:27:22,489
I when it comes to water scene my take
is that for service you don't really

492
00:27:22,489 --> 00:27:24,879
care whether the others are some
particular nom

493
00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:28,769
because usually people to several lines
because you want lines to get to them

494
00:27:28,769 --> 00:27:33,049
I but when it comes to clients themself
it probably makes sense to like to use

495
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:36,239
run democracies so that I'll like brute
force

496
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:40,009
stunning updike's become like other how
to perform

497
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:43,259
in any case the idea is that you
shouldn't really rely on I

498
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:47,259
on on the outer some predictability but
if you wanna system not to be reachable

499
00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:47,749
by

500
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:52,399
other seasons on the internet basically
try to deploy if I was there

501
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,059
Salaam public comments about n2n
connectivity

502
00:27:56,059 --> 00:28:00,499
an ass a brief overview of or
introduction that the A's dad in there

503
00:28:00,499 --> 00:28:02,139
the ipv4 into my world

504
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:05,349
wash.-based on a core principle that is
usually fair to us

505
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:09,218
into in principle which basically says
that didn't name for itself

506
00:28:09,219 --> 00:28:12,289
East dumb on the old intentions in a
Wendys a

507
00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:16,219
implemented or at the extremes to the
network on the cost

508
00:28:16,219 --> 00:28:20,349
I am also that any node can communicate
with

509
00:28:20,349 --> 00:28:24,450
any other noblemen and we're so that if
you connect to the Internet or

510
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:28,029
let's say twenty years ago you could get
to any hostile you wanted

511
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:31,589
and also that didn't know what itself he
didn't care about what was inside the

512
00:28:31,589 --> 00:28:33,759
pocket that you were sending on the net
like cost

513
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:38,229
the sorry water swim only take a look at
the beast AAIB hither

514
00:28:38,229 --> 00:28:41,659
but not in take a look inside of of the
content

515
00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:45,719
on this principle did this this set of
ideas is usually referred to us

516
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:49,389
interim principal and people usually
aren't that I'll

517
00:28:49,389 --> 00:28:52,499
d Anton and principal enables innovation

518
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:55,440
and the reason for which many people are
these is that if the network itself

519
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,829
doesn't take a look in

520
00:28:56,829 --> 00:29:01,219
what do you do inside I P that means
that you can basically for example

521
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:06,349
the sign year-round Transfer Protocol
deployed on the Internet usually

522
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:09,479
a however Singh said seems quite a few
years ago

523
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:12,729
I am dub principle has been

524
00:29:12,729 --> 00:29:16,729
been removed from the internet for the
most fun as a result of the deployment

525
00:29:16,729 --> 00:29:17,019
of

526
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:21,009
Nats know or understand leaders which
basically

527
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:24,279
the by late all of these principles for
example

528
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:27,579
enough by the full usually don't a
Dustin a low

529
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:30,809
incoming connection to your local
network I usually not

530
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:35,039
also has to look inside the contents of
on IP packet because it needs to look at

531
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:35,769
the

532
00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:39,759
or numbers read/write the por number
since it it said that a

533
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:43,239
I which basically means that now a day
if you want to deploy something on the

534
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:43,789
internet

535
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:47,479
usually needs to be the CPU the B or
ICMP

536
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:52,009
on we are prolly heating integration of
that everything needs to be over HTTP

537
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:52,599
like

538
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:56,158
never done we need inlet anything of
through if it's not

539
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,919
HTTP I am many people are that

540
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,999
I scenes of course it may be six dozen a

541
00:30:02,999 --> 00:30:06,099
doesn't require the use of or

542
00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:10,428
of knots because it provides all the IP
addresses that mean

543
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:15,450
that at the usually are that with I do
six we will be able to actually

544
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:20,479
I'll return to their into in principle
that is we will move back

545
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:23,539
to having the end to end principal in in
the Internet

546
00:30:23,539 --> 00:30:27,669
so so this is basically the math but I'm
talking about

547
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:31,609
and this is one of their recent one of
their decision points that many people

548
00:30:31,609 --> 00:30:33,179
use for ipv6

549
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:36,749
like well they are not be that it's not
only about

550
00:30:36,749 --> 00:30:40,559
are missing that have been more obvious
is but also that we don't eat exceeds

551
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:45,239
we could actually simplify the network
and get back to the interim principal

552
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:49,869
am however from my perspective I'll
that's not really going to be the case

553
00:30:49,869 --> 00:30:53,139
even week even when with ipv6 we have
enough

554
00:30:53,139 --> 00:30:57,440
obvious is to actually assign one global
unique us obvious to every system that

555
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,450
connects to the internet

556
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:03,529
I don't think that that global
admissibility it's going to imply

557
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:07,289
on global connecting grow into an
connectivity

558
00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:10,799
on the reason for that is that I am for
example

559
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,329
in most cases networks didn't really
care about innovation

560
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:17,908
the basically are they are just to
provide some sort of service for the

561
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,889
organization which they are deployed

562
00:31:19,889 --> 00:31:24,149
so as long as the naval the impression
employees for example to the email with

563
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:25,489
one that kind of stuff

564
00:31:25,489 --> 00:31:28,809
they are fine I

565
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:32,039
also there's also know there's no
actually

566
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:35,099
a requirement to go back to the end to
end principal

567
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:38,489
because all the obligations that day
users know a bomb

568
00:31:38,489 --> 00:31:41,769
basically gun operate even without the
end to end principal

569
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:45,659
sold there's not really an application
that could that we know that could be

570
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:47,859
possible with decent when principal

571
00:31:47,859 --> 00:31:51,440
so we don't really have a and moderation
actually get back to the interim

572
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,729
principal

573
00:31:52,729 --> 00:31:55,950
I am even then if you if you think about

574
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:00,039
m2m connectivity for example is not I is
probably not like it

575
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:04,569
decide property for example in many
cases if you have a home network

576
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:08,158
you don't really know you don't really
want every of your systems to be

577
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,609
directly accessible from

578
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:13,159
from the outside in most cases would you
what your

579
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:16,619
because are doing is simply consume
information from the Internet

580
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:20,069
sewing those cases prolly you don't
really want to get back in if you could

581
00:32:20,069 --> 00:32:22,999
get back to the end to end principal

582
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:26,969
and what's interesting is that even when
people within the the idea

583
00:32:26,969 --> 00:32:31,049
GC the organization that stun device is
the internet articles

584
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:34,529
even when many of them are in favor of
the interim principal

585
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:38,219
that release that last year the ATF done
device a

586
00:32:38,219 --> 00:32:42,529
some specification for calm waters I'm
basically what they say is that by

587
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:43,129
default

588
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:46,659
every home brother should have the fight
will that only a loss

589
00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:50,679
I'll going connections but not incoming
connections so that means that even the

590
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:51,839
ATF cuss

591
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:55,079
up cuss basically stun device a comp
writers

592
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:58,359
which a.m. all by a lady's

593
00:32:58,359 --> 00:33:01,839
into and principal or decent when
connectivity soul

594
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:05,089
I am the wing which I think that sings
her

595
00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:09,279
sheeting is dat you when you will have
aglow you need to stop this is for all

596
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,499
your system's

597
00:33:10,499 --> 00:33:14,579
I when it comes to connectivity will be
essentially the same us right now

598
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:18,979
you will only be able to up do upon
connections but

599
00:33:18,979 --> 00:33:22,139
you 1 get incoming connections and
unless

600
00:33:22,139 --> 00:33:26,479
or do you you manually enable that

601
00:33:26,479 --> 00:33:29,519
few comments about others resolution %uh

602
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,479
I said before in this summary I E 96 on
this solution is

603
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:37,059
perform with a particle called neighbor
discovery which essentially

604
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:40,408
I uses ICMP version 6 and messages

605
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:43,929
it's very analogous to our in
ninety-four so

606
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:48,799
I am essentially you have exactly the
same will never leave the scene ipv6

607
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,219
now we used to having in ninety-four eat
this complicated I'll even be because of

608
00:33:53,219 --> 00:33:54,219
the fact that

609
00:33:54,219 --> 00:33:57,819
scenes ICMP messages can get fragmented

610
00:33:57,819 --> 00:34:01,629
on-the-go have extension here since a
lawn the traffic gets more complex

611
00:34:01,629 --> 00:34:06,429
and its like more difficult to actually
deploy confirmation for the side x

612
00:34:06,429 --> 00:34:10,668
I am these are basically de mediations
techniques they have for the side x

613
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:14,589
first of all he's the deployment of send
send the sick you labeled is going

614
00:34:14,589 --> 00:34:19,099
which is basically outing crypto to a
neighbor this going

615
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:22,419
the problem with the plane Sen first
before we start for example Windows

616
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:23,618
doesn't implement it

617
00:34:23,619 --> 00:34:27,119
so even if you wanted to are you are not
going to be able to protect Windows

618
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,319
systems with 10

619
00:34:28,319 --> 00:34:33,179
and also that it's very hard to deploy I
basically requires that the key I

620
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:38,809
and so on then %uh not to prevent but to
actually detect a neighbor discovery at

621
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:39,339
X

622
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:43,190
you could do for example a neighbor
discovery traffic monitoring

623
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:46,579
I'll to be another close to what you
probably do we

624
00:34:46,579 --> 00:34:50,000
IP for with are watch are the only
difference is that

625
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,149
again in this case traffic can get
fragmented so in practice

626
00:34:53,149 --> 00:34:56,268
I it's basically useless to do the

627
00:34:56,269 --> 00:34:59,989
neighbors call me traffic monitoring
another option is

628
00:34:59,989 --> 00:35:03,569
in some cases to other start against
have been able to share analogous to

629
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:04,009
what

630
00:35:04,009 --> 00:35:07,670
you used to do or you could doing before
with the option

631
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,769
only thing to consider here is that
there are some implementations

632
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:14,180
in which even if you are the start again
trees they don't care about that and

633
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,069
east to use neighbor discovery

634
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:19,239
I also you should keep that in mind I'm
finally dunno

635
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:22,930
restricting access to the local network
which is like channel thing

636
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:25,730
and not just put in a word is going
which means that to the extent that is

637
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:26,059
Paul

638
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:30,269
possible if you can petition the morning
making it worse that basically restricts

639
00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:33,819
the number of systems that not occur can
can attack so

640
00:35:33,819 --> 00:35:37,000
summary we neighbor discovery at this is
that the situation is

641
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,259
not read that the from from from before
but I it's actually lead

642
00:35:41,259 --> 00:35:44,719
just a little bit more and more
complicated

643
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:48,849
the worse about article T racin I am

644
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:52,980
in b6 we basically house we basically
have to make any sense for other

645
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,170
configuration

646
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:57,369
last a full what one of them is a state
which is

647
00:35:57,369 --> 00:36:01,440
the ATP analogous to the ACP motion for
arm

648
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,029
on the other one eastwood with usury
refer to us luck or

649
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:08,859
stateless on this article T racin which
is based on ICMP person

650
00:36:08,859 --> 00:36:11,969
mission 6 messages essentially the wing
which

651
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:15,480
us like worse is that when you connect
the hostel in and were it sensor

652
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,839
request to any water that might be
connected to the same Taylor

653
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:22,940
and it gets all day configuration
information in an ICMP message

654
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,150
so the sorrow daughter dies ones that
are the messages that you get from the

655
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,699
runners

656
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:30,339
contain all sorts of configuration
information such as prefixes

657
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:33,440
our roots are some network integration

658
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,210
some network parameters such as
compliment and do some and so on

659
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:40,349
so of course the this sort of %ah text
that you could

660
00:36:40,349 --> 00:36:43,640
perform I against article T racin

661
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,629
are basically money in the middle on I
denial of service attacks

662
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:51,109
which essentially means that you could
actually cost cost

663
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:54,250
although of the traffic to be directed
to you or basically two

664
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:57,770
be directed to a hosta does not even
exist so the traffic gets

665
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:01,559
gets dropped um when talking about them

666
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:04,859
a condom issues that we have available
for that the art most of them are the

667
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:05,380
same

668
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:09,270
us in the previous case solely not talk
about them the only one that he's

669
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:14,359
are specific for 'em rare objects
against %uh stateless on this article to

670
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:15,449
a Chinese

671
00:37:15,449 --> 00:37:18,759
a confirmation that these refer to us
with another tightening guard

672
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:22,279
which is basically about featuring these
messages actually just

673
00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:25,460
on in summary data loss that the most on
the vice

674
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:29,420
by the idea of in what implemented by
Cisco and it doesn't work

675
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:33,160
so I if you want to know the details
just look for would revert to

676
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,759
good another Dutchman gobble it up needy
or stuff on the Internet

677
00:37:36,759 --> 00:37:40,559
and you would basically get the details
for which beast doesn't really work

678
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,750
but I'm trying to highlight days because
many people deploy the sauce like the

679
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:48,020
first line of defense against these
issues

680
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:52,429
um couple have gone to law I B 64

681
00:37:52,429 --> 00:37:55,980
I am many people are dot I ipv6 is

682
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,609
more secure done before because
supposedly

683
00:37:59,609 --> 00:38:02,848
a house arm support for I'd be sick

684
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:06,690
if you look at the specifications they
say that ball in the case of before

685
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:11,009
I B six support is optional but in b6 it
supposed to be mandatory

686
00:38:11,009 --> 00:38:14,489
I'll however desist mostly war some
paper

687
00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:17,770
in the sense that you have lots of
before implementation do contain

688
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:20,929
a 96 implementation and we also have

689
00:38:20,929 --> 00:38:24,179
regardless of what the specification say
I we have up

690
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:27,690
b6 implementations that done we support
96

691
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:31,429
on even then I mean what what's required
by the specific agencies

692
00:38:31,429 --> 00:38:35,710
b6 a4 but not usage which means that you
could have the 86 aboard air but that

693
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,440
doesn't mean that the costs are

694
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,679
really use in II dissect so in summary
ball

695
00:38:40,679 --> 00:38:45,299
the cease really not through that of be
six be more secure done

696
00:38:45,299 --> 00:38:50,009
done before on it's also not true that
we're going to have increase use of IP

697
00:38:50,009 --> 00:38:50,710
sick

698
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:53,799
just because of my ipv6 deployment

699
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:57,230
even when many people are about this

700
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:01,119
I okay couple of Los about

701
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,869
%uh security implications of transition
coexistence mechanisms

702
00:39:05,869 --> 00:39:09,170
media basically is dat I the plan that
we had

703
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:15,069
for for ipv6 will start people at like
everybody deployed be 16 years ago or so

704
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:19,730
so by the time that we actually needed
v6 into already present in the network

705
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:23,219
so we it will then be late it wasn't
going to be a big deal

706
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:26,299
to a for the ipv4 address air

707
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:30,788
space to get exhausted but the thing
East at peace plan basically fame

708
00:39:30,789 --> 00:39:35,359
I only a few organizations actually
deploy the BBC sending many kisses the

709
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,839
deployed eating the core of the name
were but they don't we provide ipv4

710
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:43,538
ipv6 access to their to their clients so
the current strategy for a4 b6

711
00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:44,819
deployment is based on

712
00:39:44,819 --> 00:39:49,109
on on a set of arm of transition
technologies we basically

713
00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:54,400
aid in deploying b6 in environments that
are mostly ipv4 only

714
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,690
almost all the a of the stocks that you
have available

715
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:02,089
up in general-purpose operating systems
support

716
00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:05,869
our door stock and the officer for some
form of arm

717
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:09,670
transition technology for example a in
the case of Windows 8 support

718
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:13,130
its slow start but it also supports it
today though I set up

719
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:16,699
I think it yeah one other 624

720
00:40:16,699 --> 00:40:20,079
so whatever did security implications of
farm

721
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,309
of the transition to know she's first of
all is that the

722
00:40:23,309 --> 00:40:27,410
some the increase the complexity of the
network in many cases the interview

723
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:28,928
single point of failure

724
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:32,730
with means that if you have a 26 cost
that use these technologies

725
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,029
all traffic need to go to a single
system so thats

726
00:40:36,029 --> 00:40:39,739
going to be a very interesting target
for attackers to the night at the

727
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:41,559
service to many clients

728
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:44,449
and then it's also interesting that
usually people don't really talk about

729
00:40:44,449 --> 00:40:45,150
these

730
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,520
about the privacy implications of some
of these technologies for sample that

731
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:48,809
are

732
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:52,219
many providers in the US that offer like
freed on

733
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:55,420
dining services which means that if you
want to use P six

734
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,719
you can get a free service from them a
and

735
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:01,789
many people try that and see all that's
great I don't even have to pay for

736
00:41:01,789 --> 00:41:04,359
learning some days you don't even need
to get an icon

737
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:07,369
but Braun is that all your traffic is
been sent

738
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:11,179
through them which of course in some
cases you may not care about but if you

739
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:11,739
think about

740
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:14,750
E eighth I think that nobody could
forcible think about

741
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,359
Chinese benders or the Chinese
government actually tunneling or the

742
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:21,609
traffic through the US just as an
example right

743
00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:25,130
I another consideration is that of the
complexity of the result in traffic

744
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:28,759
here you have probably one of the worst
example States the instructor

745
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:33,920
of a TCP packet that he's been sent on
the network by using did TV don't

746
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,140
transition technology the point is that
I E did

747
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,779
there something by could maybe be a very
complex Cup lots of heaters

748
00:41:40,779 --> 00:41:45,349
on as an exercise of accomplish these
can be for example for security devices

749
00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:49,309
just try to implement a lead pick up
feeder for for example detecting

750
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:52,599
traffic sent to a specific PCB board in
this case

751
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:56,289
I need my get likely to be da of

752
00:41:56,289 --> 00:42:00,799
I'll I'm finally some war song onto cute
implications of b6 on

753
00:42:00,799 --> 00:42:05,089
before members usually people think that
will be mining worries before only I

754
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:05,949
don't really care

755
00:42:05,949 --> 00:42:09,210
about ipv6 have not deployed it but the
thing is that

756
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:13,000
as I said before most general tional
boolfalse operating systems

757
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,429
the you have support for a for nineteen
ninety-six on also for

758
00:42:17,429 --> 00:42:20,980
our transition technologies soul that
really means that

759
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:24,739
even if you all Cup not supposed to be
like an ipv4 only know where you really

760
00:42:24,739 --> 00:42:27,799
have a partial deployment of ipv6 anyway

761
00:42:27,799 --> 00:42:32,130
I the security implications of L of b6
on before New Year's

762
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:35,509
could be for example that are not a cure
might connect to your network enabled

763
00:42:35,509 --> 00:42:37,609
ABC's connectivity in all of your
system's

764
00:42:37,609 --> 00:42:40,640
on for example liberation that to
actually invade a

765
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,520
some security conference that you might
have and also there's one thing all she

766
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,239
did I mention before that history don't

767
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:50,390
that the goal of the release of is to
actually make cost accessible

768
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:53,500
through and not which means that you
have to read a lot today the running

769
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:57,589
on your local network that might mean
that your cost could be accessible from

770
00:42:57,589 --> 00:42:59,349
the all seeing their work even if you

771
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:04,109
are behind the net okay um

772
00:43:04,109 --> 00:43:08,558
soul just closing the presentation I
like to highlight the few areas in which

773
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:12,489
I think that for their work is needed
first of all I'd be sick sick you do.

774
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,049
resiliency if you want

775
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:17,969
I if you asked again if you look at b6
implementation they are not mature at

776
00:43:17,969 --> 00:43:18,559
all

777
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:21,770
actually us a result of actually destin
many of them

778
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:25,029
basically the idea that you get is that
the yard at the point in which we were

779
00:43:25,029 --> 00:43:25,480
with me

780
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,270
be for like 15 years ago so the failed
to enforce

781
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:33,730
validation checks limits on that the
strike to sign all that kind of stuff

782
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:38,380
are we also need to I improved a ipv6
support in security devices

783
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:41,369
I mean no matter how good about the
particle maybe if you don't have basic

784
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:43,020
support security devices

785
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:47,579
I am did they were sold in there were
some not going to be much secure

786
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:51,270
and the last one is a lot education and
training doesn't necessarily mean

787
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:53,849
attending a training a reasonable but
just

788
00:43:53,849 --> 00:43:56,949
a at the very least coming somebody in
your organization

789
00:43:56,949 --> 00:44:01,390
at least play with ipv6 read about ipv6
because eventually they will be asked to

790
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,759
to deploy the scene in the network I

791
00:44:04,759 --> 00:44:08,190
of concussions up first of all we were
about

792
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:11,739
rb6 marketing I might on I'm it %uh

793
00:44:11,739 --> 00:44:15,730
there are lots of people died try to
sell it BBC's we the

794
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:21,829
we properties that ipv6 EA supposed to
have that he doesn't really have them

795
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:25,409
I some mi6 basically house this same

796
00:44:25,409 --> 00:44:29,799
I did provide the same fashion ideas
before but the deal say don't need to be

797
00:44:29,799 --> 00:44:30,429
different

798
00:44:30,429 --> 00:44:33,449
on some diced those did those small
differences

799
00:44:33,449 --> 00:44:37,449
have big difference when it comes to to
security on the game the DA said even if

800
00:44:37,449 --> 00:44:39,009
you're not planning right now to

801
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:42,390
deploy ipv6 I you should have in mind
because

802
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:46,109
your network us at least partial support
of I B six and it's very likely that you

803
00:44:46,109 --> 00:44:46,969
are going to deploy

804
00:44:46,969 --> 00:44:48,409
in the in the near term
