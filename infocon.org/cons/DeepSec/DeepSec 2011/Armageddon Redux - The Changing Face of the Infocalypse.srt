saw own the first time when I was here

25
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,780
others are on the guys up in testa and
Mitek talk was on hacking Scott

26
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,409
obscenities

27
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:40,049
acid electrical power grid swatted
distribution purification sleaze

28
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:45,409
industrial processing plants and so on
on the title the stalk was a play on the

29
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:46,119
acronym

30
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,670
I am file I sophy uncertainty and doubt

31
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,829
I am and this is %uh tactic frequently
used in sales marketing

32
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:57,459
a public relations politics and
propaganda I

33
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:00,479
its Julie funds in the strategic a team

cementing San needed in

35
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:08,280
dubious of false information designs

36
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,530
credibility existing blade um

37
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:15,860
the Titans talk: was supposed to be
humorous rather than being a hobby

38
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,380
General

39
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,490
digital do I must join us for the given
to come down

40
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,740
thing sensibly about Scott security and
the risks to the

41
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,670
systems that run our lives I like to
think that will help too little

42
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,470
I am during the stalk I said something
to the effect that

43
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,400
allegations packing by Chinese spies and
saboteurs with bruce Lee

44
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,140
stated I'll as we can discuss today I
was

45
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,530
some wrong about this I over the last
couple years

46
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,760
there's been a lot of well-documented
cases nation state-sponsored hacking

47
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,700
from recent CA compromises from malware
like Stuxnet

48
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:57,620
duty I a lot of talk about bling threat
landscape has me now worry about hankins

49
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,380
monetizing using paper install malware
about me

50
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,180
it is selling axis and hosts government
since that's the thing

51
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,990
I much like this in a changing threat
landscape the media hype tissue in his

52
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,120
kennel evil up a lot

53
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,530
hacktivism the Jews Apte Scott attacks
it's been our seven Taj

54
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,070
all somewhat inaccurately described
under the blanket 10 cycle

55
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,680
I am so there's been

56
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,570
a significant discussion about sidewall
in the industry recently

57
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:33,180
a military is described cyber as the new
yet

58
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,630
and women not discussing cyberwar which
presumably refers the actions

59
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,859
nation-state sponsored Akins we talking
about cyber terrorism

60
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,860
which seems to be a label a commute
flight to just about anyone doing any

61
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,430
sort of politically-motivated

62
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:53,000
hacking from WikiLeaks to anonymous
others some real problems with using the

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,100
site's Terms

64
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,660
the the dangerous nature at and lead us
to places we probably don't want to end

65
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,200
up

66
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,160
now I like to think that security focus
skeptical by profession

67
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,690
and you know we try to be resistant to
hide and when if you say so I'm well

68
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,510
that's kinda exactly what you're buying
into

69
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,380
I'm unfortunately we like it or not
cyberwar

70
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,108
is a real thing by real thing

71
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:21,279
I mean the pentagon officially declared
cyberspace new with morph into main

72
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,039
I so this makes verifiably a a real
thing

73
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:28,510
I and big business for the military
industrial complex

74
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,570
I we already have a ride if not you can
as Asians the US fighting over who gets

75
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,340
to run

76
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,710
forms from I we've had a lot of
literature coming out

77
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:41,460
implicitly scary titles like cyber do be
on site to do in cyber attack scenarios

78
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:41,960
newman's

79
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,799
history at something I and black hat
2010

80
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,710
Michael Hayden for general info him a
couple three in our agencies

81
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,549
described the incident as the first
military domain and

82
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,760
woodland see space

83
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,710
up and and being a flaw and said that
cyberspace was the first

84
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,049
man-made location warfare I'm sure no
one missed the description the internet

85
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,700
is not resuming

86
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,710
I this type rhetoric was recently echoed
by Barack Obama who said that cyberspace

87
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,479
Israel

88
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,160
asking so the risks that come with it
now on additional infrastructure

89
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,770
networks and computers we depend on
every day I should be treated

90
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,780
a strategic national asset ass is this

91
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,620
appeared in Al Jazeera just recently
saying that innovations in technology

92
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,660
changing the tactics on Monday conflict
a new tools in today's awesome weapons

93
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,100
helped by advances in electromagnetics
modern information communications

94
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,080
technology

95
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,180
a new form electronic warfare has been
created school sidewall

96
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,740
as increasingly recognized by
governments in the military is posing a

97
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,690
potentially great thread

98
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,060
not this article came out yesterday
happens when the most worrying headlines

99
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,730
a US military once you have kids
obviously the title this article some

100
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,380
positions up but does speak to the
increasing age in the military to

101
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,850
respond with Canada water

102
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:07,480
threats faced by people from people with
keyboards I am

103
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,770
this means basically anyone carries out
an attack competing on website for

104
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,849
instance Navy SEALs lancer is Ruth

105
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,990
run through the house shooting anything
that moves and bury the body at sea at a

106
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,040
crispy

107
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,380
site to your bros issues now said

108
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,620
Sarkozy cycle on while much of the
coverage

109
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,720
on this is centered around the US and
eat Chinese

110
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,090
I know entirely safe in Europe via thus
came out in the register couple weeks

111
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,030
ago

112
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:36,070
US and Europe run through the first
joint sidewalk money

113
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,620
this being a discussion of drilling they
had recently so much the slightest

114
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,150
me to size japan won really sometime

115
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,040
I Richard clock for my US side to side

116
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,850
and national security council member
described in his recent book cyberwar

117
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:57,290
a to be actions by a nation states to
penetrate in other nations computers

118
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:01,150
after the when it works for the purposes
causing damage or disruption

119
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,710
at the scene 3 pretty broad and print
overuse

120
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:08,850
unfortunately all self-appointed experts
in the field and sidewall

121
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:12,270
seem to be using diffusion very similar
to this seems like quite a lot of things

122
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,690
can be called

123
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:18,280
idle on son to put this in a nutshell
side was being used as a catch-all

124
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,110
phrase

125
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,620
turf in a politically motivated hacking
and conduct

126
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:28,090
acts like deputized espionage

127
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,260
missus frequently discusses to our
knowledge is to conventional warfare

128
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:38,020
as will discuss this is both dubious
inaccuracy and political motivation

129
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,250
so let's take %uh quick look at a short
history kinda buzzword bingo to see

130
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,860
what's I'm what is wrong on us

131
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,190
fob are some well-known interests

132
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:51,100
incidents here um I think a lot of
people who have any interest in the

133
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,720
field a little about the stuff right

134
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,970
so April 2007 Houstonian the dozens and

135
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,720
hackers believed to be linked to the
russian government bring down the

136
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,419
website since then his parliament

137
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,460
banks ministries newspapers broadcasters

138
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,490
subtle in June 2000 8

139
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,460
hundreds of government and corporate web
sites Lithuania hecht and some covered

140
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,570
and digital soviet-era graffiti

141
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,199
again implicating Russian nationals
hackers

142
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,740
and August the same year cyber attackers
Hijet government commercial web sites in

143
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,490
georgia

144
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:28,440
during a military conflict with Russia I
mean again implications as the russians

145
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,729
on in September 2007

146
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:36,000
israel carried out in his strike on
Syria job operation orchard

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,089
on US military in it %uh sources

148
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:42,279
speech late in the israeli use
technology similar to that used by the

149
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,219
United States

150
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:46,380
suitor a morning with a tech system a to
allow the plane's

151
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,850
passed undetected by Radha and Syria

152
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,680
suitors a computer program designed to
interfere with their computers

153
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,130
integrated instance and

154
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:02,330
2010 11:26 a group calling itself the
Iranian cyber army

155
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,660
hacked web sites belonging to the

%uh the Council of Islamic ideology
Citra

160
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,850
and this attack was dumb as revenge on
them by

161
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,070
those are the Indian ceramic is the
subject was done by revenge

162
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,620
of the Mumbai terrorist attacks which
have been confirmed have involved in

163

164
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:34,290

165
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,310
in response to the Indian side Romney
facing Pakistani website's

thousand-plus Indian web sites with the
face by groups such as pack axles

167
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,149
team poison who the heck and the company
hacking crew

168
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:50,580
among these were abroad even in local
government web sites

169
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,820
a box of Sandia some sleep been switched
sides

170
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,940
and the Indian hewlett-packard disc

171
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:01,529
on I finally in September 2010

172
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:05,170
something which I'm sure Iran's had
about Iran was attacked by the Stuxnet

173
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:05,880
worm

174
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,070
I which was thought to you specifically
target the town's

175
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,839
nuclear enrichment facility this worm 1c
and

176
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,589
lies in the media two billion most
advanced peace and now we have

177
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:16,720
discovered

178
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,899
and a few to damage the Iranian nuclear
arms phone program

179
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:24,959
on most months now in a yup on her done
similar phrases

180
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,270
when people talking about Stuxnet know
certainly ambitious however wasn't

181
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,120
particularly still theodore

182
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,220
are there was very little some critical
anti friends oversight and design

183
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:37,339
for instance if you examine a memory
footprint of Stuxnet on

184
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:40,380
and you can kisses lots of copies
floating around the internet are some

185
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,910
things really stick out

186
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,939
I am first thoughts ones multiple I'm
didn't know she's also

187
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,100
s prices on examination is a bunch of
problems with these additional says

188
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,070
processes

189
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,250
for stock-based party at the malicious
processes different

190
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,970
the base priority of the differences as
you can see the gym intel says prices

191
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,980
has up his party knowing

192
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,130
on the other pushed prices higher
priority 8

193
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:06,029
om if you run strings

194
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:09,180
malicious binaries a comparison to

195
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,250
revealed three different results on the
API's you seen read other ones

196
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,020
by the malware in addition the malicious
processes looked far fewer deals and

197
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,520
half of you open file handles legitimate
else's processes

198
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,640
on this right even if something can be
done if you dig deep in stocks and

199
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,819
on MHL this great in-house Stuxnet using

200
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,020
OpenSSL toolkit volatility seek looking
accounts 18

201
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,870
effects anyway it's a love the most
overanalyze pieces now

202
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,709
ima and Spike the feeling that was kinda
written by quantum

203
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:41,920
contractors did most certainly get the
job done

204
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,969
duke it was only recently discovered
around 3-4 weeks ago

205
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,940
and now well either by the Stuxnet
authors or possibly more likely someone

206
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,570
that had access to the Stuxnet source
code

207
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:56,420
on you've got some particularly prickly
side where he lines around us

208
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:01,630
I thing that didn't to do was causing
federal damage in silence I war

209
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:05,589
are made his side was becoming reality
on that now

210
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:08,930
and so forth the payload for duke it was
quite different I'm incident causing

211
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,250
centrifuges in nuclear power plants fail

212
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,300
as largely an information gathering tool
designed to criminals and systems

213
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,700
information to use in

214
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,870
operations I am my favorite line opinion
what's this

215
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,550
that DePuy Trojans feel to be a
shape-shifting circular

216
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,260
this is a great kid like on however it's
actually a refrence

217
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,910
to the show Dexter because references to
Dexter actually found

218
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:35,949
degree source code on have a waldholtz
toxin due to a clinical headlines

219
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:36,620
recently

220
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,980
on nations that attacks on you

221
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,839
Fox News call duty the hydrogen bomb
cyber warfare

222
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,120
I sign

223
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,269
so who's behind this campaign and
fiction is not known

224
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:54,600
online many campaigns extended nations
that hacking

225
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,420
in the past have been well documented

226
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,310
this is a very much incomplete history
in ABC campaigns

227
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:05,860
after those who've largely ignored only
a pretty high

228
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,540
ABC stands for advanced persistent
threat are and is usually referred to

229
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,370
hacking sponsored by motivated by
nation-states

230
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:18,089
I was first used by the Navy the us-run
2006

231
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:22,620
and popularize supposed to run by
mandiant scene change reports

232
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,920
much knowledge these operations has
become public due to the increased

233
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,410
culture disclosure poster /a a low so
when this information

234
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,880
was leaked to the WikiLeaks diplomatic
cables did anyone he SP inge

235
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,570
innumerable mites awake searching for
references to hacking and

236
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,029
those leaked diplomatic cables okay

237
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:44,350
newsman strange I'm so I did

238
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,899
and is one could stop attacking actually
especially having believed to be

239
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:49,110
politically motivated

240
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,640
I'm not gonna go through all works is
quite a bet I but Byzantine haiti's is

241
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,050
an interesting example

242
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:58,160
Byzantine haiti's is a cover 10 for
ongoing campaign packing against the US

243
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,360
government and other governments
including Germany

244
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,760
police-related China that's been going
since at least 2003 prolly 2002

245
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,470
and various groups and since been given
related code names

246
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:14,760
& Byzantine chant along as asunción the
Byzantine he's intrusions

247
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,390
as described in the Diplomatic Security
daily from November 2008

248
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,500
Test Kitchen secrets as a series network
intrusions affecting US and foreign

249
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,399
systems

250
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:26,810
and believed to originate from the
People's Republic of China

251
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,870
%uh this group had been running Windows
box and stealing credentials

252
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,930
at the end result which was access to
hundreds of US government

253
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,490
defense contractor related systems

254
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,459
on as you can see much like candice is
it looks like state-sponsored hackers

255
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:43,829
also want to a time line an effing it
out there

256
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:47,320
seen in people files with names like
internal restructuring

257
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,000
or in this case salary increase and
survey forecast

258
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,750
as an expeditious way I'm accomplishing
your goals and this case they manage to

259
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,870
steal a bunch male

260
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,120
and a complete list user names and
passwords for unspecified US government

261
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,570
agency

262
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,720
on may also like to use looking out
names

263
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,579
as you can see we've got a bunch as
things that are registered in Chengdu

264
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:07,510
China

265
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,870
lets you go to the gym like McAfee
response to an old

266
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,930
index used our old these domains use
this command control demands for hacking

267
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,230
campaign committee

268
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,730
pela on another subset

269
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,829
all Byzantine haiti's a Byzantine anchor

270
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:27,060
very inventive naming convention and is
another see network intrusions related

271
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,180
to the Chinese hacking crew java file

272
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,029
and appears in the remote access tool
have been using iraq's was written by

273
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:34,180
John falls leaning

274
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,350
so what did they hack well looks like

275
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,430
they found the skies Trojan that here at
the pentagon

276
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:44,779
on as a seed is one interesting stuff
these WikiLeaks cables if you would look

277
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:50,560
on says you can tell this type
activities been going on for some time

278
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,740
this is also information the government
Germany suffering same type

279
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,470
tax acoustic the leaked cables were
american we don't have the same

280
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,870
detail on these activities have what can
be picked up from

281
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,230
the US discussions on the topic is that
according to officials the German

282
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,279
government assist these if it's a
conductive

283
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:13,760
purposes espionage and present a
significant regional interests

284
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,760
thai gets covered a broad range German
government activities including military

285
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,970
economy science and technology
commercial and diplomatic efforts in

286
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,300
research and development

287
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,079
the officials indicated espionage
focused activity increases

288
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,690
for major negotiations involving German
Chinese

289
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,029
interests I mean like Macy's

290
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:36,709
I was an incident in which US officials
accidentally discovered a patent program

291
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:38,690
probing a computer systems at

292
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:43,600
the pentagon nason the US Department
energy private universities

293
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,250
research labs that it began in March
1990 8

294
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:51,240
and have been going on for quite some
time muscles as report that the invaders

295
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,240
were systematically mornings routines

296
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,149
thousands of miles including Mets
military installations trip

297

configurations military hardware design

298
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,209
the United States Department defense
trace the trail back to you a mainframe

299
00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:03,110
computer

300
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,579
and the Soviet Union but sponsored the
attacks run on and

301
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:10,918
napped brushed 19 involvement obtain
rain

302
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:14,860
this was the designation given by
federal government United States to a

303
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,669
series of coordinated attacks on
American computer systems going back

304
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,319
2003

305
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,199
the text labels Chinese origin although
the precise nature

306
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,400
state-sponsored espionage corporate
espionage around a packer text

307
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,790
and also the real identities the
checkers being masked by proxy zombie

308
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,090
computers and so forth from an unknown

309
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,840
tailoring hackers gained X's she many
United States computer networks

310
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,949
including Lockheed Martin

311
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:41,570
sandia redstone us and nasa

312
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:45,360
sorry operation I'm wrong was a
cyberattack which was stressed

313
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,250
publicly disclosed by Google on January
2010

314
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,929
and in a blog post google said the
attack originated in China

315
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:56,040
detective named dozens of other
organizations

316
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,309
which Adobe juniper and Rackspace
publicly confirmed they were targeted

317
00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:03,720
according to media reports Yahoo
semantic northrup-grumman

318
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,780
Morgan Stanley and out came were also
among targets

319
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,820
on shady rat said great names here

320
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,580
on this is an ongoing since series a
cyberattack starting in mid 2006

321
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,290
basically in this McAfee I think
stumbled upon a CNC dump box

322
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,780
announced at this house revealed the
corn crop you're still not only 72

323
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,809
organizations

324
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:26,120
including defense contractors Fortune
500 companies United Nations

325
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,210
International Olympic Committee

326
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,190
so if you follow the news has been a
bunch a high-profile compromise this

327
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,760
year

328
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,530
among them our essay in sunscreen
lockheed-martin I'm also some

329
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,970
high-profile see a compromise including
motown

330
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:42,020
Georgia I recently disclosed in the
Niger attacks

331
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,860
in which 29 chemical companies will
compromise and data was stolen

332
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,140
I'm not gonna go into these to the
minister in simply covered in the media

333
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,640
in the last year

334
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,830
so would have we learned here on so
everyone attacked

335
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:58,030
all the time but not by the same people
right

336
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:01,200
so I mean least we can take some comfort
in that and

337
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,790
but some clinton's side I we've seen
these types of attacks

338
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,129
I'm for some time

339
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,429
and hand there has been a significant

340
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:14,540
rise and some attention lists activity
CNN's

341
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,090
I know game buzzword bingo would be
complete without discussing

342
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:23,139
freelance these days so NP is a long
time ago we may head we call

343
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:26,900
Road actors all happens I to hacking
group that

344
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,080
you can enumerate on any given day on

345
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,320
the the graph here expands much lower a
thorough reactors

346
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,350
then criminal enterprise because not
fueled by cash basically these guys

347
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:43,040
hackers on as we understand in the
traditional sense

348
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,040
have always been facing d dosing in
participating in mostly harmless

349
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,330
3 a small sums in weightlessness
pleasure

350
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,710
strong things but I am

351
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,090
and the top their approval into price
and these are the guys who make

352
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,370
a lot of money and the reason why the
malware economy

353
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,580
emerged over the last few years am

354
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,129
serve as we go down a bit you get the
hackers me cash

355
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,950
and these guys have hired hands once
right now Wessels your day

356
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,970
and get sucked into the vortex organized
crime eyes are frequently monetized by

357
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,500
mess in the gym paper install malware

358
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,010
from the bar and you get a PT huge time
Texas described

359
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,710
and slightly up from this year to
private hackers working for government

360
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:28,490
interesting issue is the middle as the
middle here which is d

361
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,870
I'll which is we as in the state
interested simply by axis to

362
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:36,080
administering it works from criminals
run the selling botnets

363
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,168
of with state-sponsored attack and
evicted for prime hacking group

364
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:44,169
Private Banking Group dans refund
interests by

365
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:48,000
on selling axis

366
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,640
I am while hiking operations and
governments anything consistent here's

367
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,330
the hacking

368
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,960
as hacking everybody looks and smells
sOooo NECN

369
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,360
however it is useful to make it three
station I

370
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,720
APT 3 it's a simple driven personal as
we honor akers

371
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,510
frequently thing ego-driven and highly
personal

372
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:09,710
on the different types and motivations
lead to different tech patents an attack

373
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,600
habits

374
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,600
and understanding in this is essential
in formulating a useful

375
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,750
defensive stance source can mean greater
context

376
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,799
I am storms over the stuff to stimulate
some

377
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,110
bad shutting down someone's a defensive
system or destroying the nuclear weapons

378
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,950
many factions and he's definitely a real
thing it's not just hype

379
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:32,080
I we have to have a better word though
for the saving people's hair differences

380
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,418
and bombing in

381
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:38,669
on inside your its its cool wall I we've
had this word for some time

382
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:42,309
I some wine hardwood uniforms

383
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:46,700
I'm saw it somewhat wise words are
overused

384
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,780
at the moment not like Street sidewalk
on

385
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,700
I will hunt for some reason sidewalks
works for Friday people

386
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,870
exciting at the media really likes it

387
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:00,020
it's it's polarizing it's an easy China

388
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,250
sloppy analogy which makes it easy to
explain things to people who don't have

389
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:04,840
any friends

390
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,689
reference it's also very convenient
excuse for people's

391
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:13,070
don't mind us on up doing incident
response for a really long time now and

392
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,450
I had the opportunity to observe how
what's different organizations

393
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,929
and people behaving the compromise now
obviously there's a lot of different

394
00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:21,190
psychological responses

395
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,970
witnessed but the common good on two
pots people are initially shocked and

396
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,660
distressed slow my garden

397
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,860
on my professional career as a nurse in
the world and quit my job and 11

398
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,539
ramallah I the next ages dismissal

399
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:38,160
Anderson follows a confirmation bias
that the attack was really lane

400
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,530
oh my god that i truly used its lame to
continues to go to the logs

401
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,610
tools and nineties loser on

402
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,150
and and dipping and how good your
friends yes and how and you discover

403
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:52,429
you really were the ISM a couple routes
on

404
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:56,000
this humorous just like all week with
this Champions League into a new it's

405
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,850
still a star

406
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:00,520
officials should am love you sit down
for a variety of reasons but it's very

407
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,809
common reaction

408
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:05,190
especially in terms that the psychology
getting over being compromised

409
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:09,169
on and is kinda every nation
responsibility people discovering is

410
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:09,980
super on

411
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,059
and all-important he is selling motions
to dump site

412
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:16,309
Pakistan I like this route I

413
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:20,230
they say it wasn't all do what I can buy
a foreign government with victims

414
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,350
I'm war on it also makes a problem sack

415
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:27,150
sexy effect warm enough was make a bunch
of things and sexy

416
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:30,700
are so when all the stuff happen with
wikiLeaks is you guys might remember

417
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,929
I was very very exciting I so jumpy
following

418
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:37,840
is awesome guy have alarms before said
this the for Sears

419
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,129
info war was now engaged and the fuel
the battle is WikiLeaks

420
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:45,289
the troops I Greg point and from what
sounds awesome

421
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:48,700
I unfortunately warm influence in the
scenario and many others

422
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,760
back I really bad leaks that lead to
this

423
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,158
I using metaphors and calling people
cyber terrorists is a great way of

424
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,080
justifying taking actions against people
you don't like

425
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,750
and as we can see move initials are on
tissues because they sound sexy the

426
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,530
media

427
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:09,350
I war is big business on his lot of
people making a lot of money already on

428
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,090
the song

429
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:13,809
I'll for next mention the city today
when he's talking about IDS is that

430
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:16,200
threatened to be an T-eighty your own

431
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,740
people sicken women I'm gonna mention
specific been discussed Michael sellers

432
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,570
free

433
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:26,320
to just but unsurprisingly many in the
usual cycle products being sold one

434
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,850
security industry being repackaged

435
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:32,299
rebranded in the wake of the cyst area
and and given that most of these basins

436
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:34,679
same broken defense models in products
like

437
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:39,640
antivirus ideas phone system you can
probably take a guess is the efficacy

438
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,870
I you also have a new breed endurance
chases arm

439
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:47,169
not contain any specific firms but
research little it doesn't take long to

440
00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:49,150
find him into companies using

441
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:52,470
proprietary techniques to identify
corporate victims

442
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,570
contacting them and then trying to sell
and remediation services at a really

443
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,049
high price

444
00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:01,960
storm as we can see women to force I
just used they sound sexy

445
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,360
media I what is big business there's a
lot of people will be making more money

446
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,309
on some

447
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:10,320
also ru war makes it easy to possibly
just lation

448
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,299
people might otherwise be this to like
that retentions

449
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:18,940
um last year Michael McConnell the
former Director of National Intelligence

450
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,520
made headlines reaches to fight congress
that the US was already in the middle on

451
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,830
sidewall and was losing it

452
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:28,720
on in the washington post I mcconnell
reengineering

453
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,070
the Internet I'm more specifically we
need to

454
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:36,450
reengineer the Internet to make
attribution geolocation

455
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:40,260
intelligence analysis and impact
assessment who did it from where why and

456
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,240
what was the result

457
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,400
more manageable sort

458
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,610
these types techniques when framing I
can

459
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:51,750
not new infectivity may talked about
this at length in 1988

460
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:56,130
the site for fun fact: at the time the
discussion was being used to limit

461
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:59,360
use a strong Tom Murphy in the civilian
arena

462
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,980
I am anyone remember who the Four
Horsemen of the Apocalypse were

463
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,240
sawyer they weren't war famine pistons
India

464
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,289
I but indeed the internet for months
these were

465
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:14,330
pedophiles drug dealers money launderers

466
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,500
and terrorists I the force many popular

467
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,400
info collapse is how they come in the
night yardage liberties

468
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,200
the freedom of speech freedom code and
for your privacy

469
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,169
saw it will be seen that the incident is
to me the Four Horsemen

470
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:33,809
apps a tool for the drug dealers money
launderers the pitfalls terrorists

471
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:37,700
on this picture such horseman was
frequently used during the limitation

472
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,210
strong

473
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,010
toll free tools by civilians you guys
might remember some time ago

474
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:45,390
after a variety of reasons it was seen
useful to restrict the use a strong

475
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,140
photography by non-military

476
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,980
and as such various agencies IQ's I am

477
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:54,380
that the availability a strong 22
civilians only aid

478
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,970
pitfalls many wonders and so forth the
idea

479
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:01,669
hasn't really used in discussions about
actual online criminal activity

480
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:05,190
more about discussions about the
negative or chilling if it's

481
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:09,330
the perception in this activity can have
on uses online experience

482
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,889
you think it is a political tactics in
montana thinking the children

483
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:16,240
I am so I mean

484
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,419
in a good example that is every morn
daughter tension gets pushed through

485
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:24,440
I the ability to protect children from
online traditions as uses

486
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:29,590
the motivating factor here us are you
you know we should be wary of the uses

487
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:33,440
these types of devices by politically
motivated parties I which is again why

488
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,510
we should be particularly wary of
headlines like this

489
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:42,120
on sold these types of his lines and
articles

490
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,120
not only sell copy but they sell when
they notion that we've already

491
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,799
n state 51 I'm

492
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:53,750
the position that we're in a cold side
and losing is a very dangerous type

493
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,400
mentality

494
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,549
style means that we are at war

495
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:01,179
and that's very specific and not very
nice place to be on

496
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,460
and so is actually to contemplate what
actually happens in I mean the first

497
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,190
casualties are civil liberties

498
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:10,419
a well-documented history government
hospitals abridging freedom to speech

499
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:14,429
after being anti-government sentiment
sentiment prohibiting behavior is

500
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:15,460
promoting treason

501
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,880
in abridging rights priest interesting
opinion

502
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,220
additionally increase state surveillance
and monitoring communication

503
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:26,350
is a common side effect being stand for
people who dissent

504
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:29,690
with prevailing political viewpoints can
be labeled in me

505
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,890
more popular these days terrorists um

506
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:36,750
and the government to become safety
Antrel salsa social problems

507
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,820
patron it pictures and distillates and
many people's ability to critically

508
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,899
reason

509
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,169
for some reason becomes diminished

510
00:28:45,169 --> 00:28:48,390
us a brush fire actually see something
really smart he said

511
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:53,250
this power struggle going on for control
our nation's cybersecurity strategy

512
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:58,860
the ISE and the DRDO winning if we frame
the debate in terms of war

513
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:02,750
five weeks if the military's expensive
cyberspace definition of war

514
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:06,500
we feed our fears we reinforce the
notion that were helpless

515
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,880
I'm more person or organisation can
defend itself in a wall

516
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,419
and that others need to protect us we
invite the note you to take over

517
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,429
security and ignore the limits on power

518
00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:19,370
of indigenous engine wartime

519
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:22,710
saw the is some hope you I like recently

520
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,980
I mean I read a report and it was
mentioned earlier today

521
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,630
and by the on National
counterintelligence

522
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:32,770
executive in the US the present a report
to Congress about the activities

523
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,139
Russian Chinese government in Syria and
used Woodside want

524
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,870
mention any had I'm this is insane
voices in this debate

525
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:45,260
bien minority Howard Schmidt his
cybersecurity adviser to the Obama

526
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,510
administration said last year in an
interview our side

527
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:52,480
is no cycle and stitch mints in the
government needs to focus

528
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,870
its cybersecurity efforts to fight
online crime

529
00:29:55,870 --> 00:30:00,380
and espionage I'm PC I think that's I'm
with terminal for

530
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,710
term concept is no winners in that
environment

531
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,710
sawyer if you take nothing else nations
talk

532
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:11,559
think critically about what you're
discussing is it actually wall

533
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:16,039
are more likely had sabotaged espionage
in plain sight a crime

534
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:19,400
as likely than women for isn't actually
wanted on

535
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,710
in this sawyer

536
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:25,760
back to normal its once you start
talking like they are you reach

537
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,850
kinda very wrong conclusions about what
kinda actions justified

538
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:33,529
so next time you thinking of using the
word cyberwar and then you realize you

539
00:30:33,529 --> 00:30:35,520
can use it normal ironically

540
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,029
remember that you're really assisting
these guys

541
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:40,789
sewn just generally don't
