1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,110
the about box pops up to the analysis
box and that's the kind of

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,340
thought process

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,140
it's the patent much to know this

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,300
signature matching statistical anomaly
although the

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,530
the pool balls was the sole boxes I

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,700
account matches box this is really
interesting the IDS terms

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,090
because we presume and rightly so

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:28,599
the 90 S is a passive partner network a

9
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:35,599
but they do have false-positive at
harlem's

10
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,339
that's the countermeasures box that's
tearing up we can have a lot of fun

11
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,230
without by the way

12
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,610
I'm the other books that we do have here
is an ass

13
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,289
it's actually D at the boxes storage box
well

14
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:51,100
what's mandate is useless if you can
access it and that's the whole point

15
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,460
with the box only happen

16
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,660
the box in a box to see box Kennedy box
I'm

17
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:01,350
the job to pretty self-explanatory by
anytime she gotten

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,830
I'm talking about a stick your arm up
I'll China mind you but you could remind

19
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,220
me

20
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,929
you seen a typical deployment receiver
to

21
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:15,760
typical solar deployments an ideal
situation we see it it could detection

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,290
I configuration from I guess system
which

23
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,979
is we see on your side law

24
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:29,479
I'm see last popping bostick just before
a lot so we can see threats coming

25
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:34,250
going in an hour the line really really
good at seeing what access happening

26
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,060
to our hosting a two-out two-run network
really not foreseeing stuff that's

27
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,299
happening on the outside

28
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:44,170
because it's just not convict out with
and we haven't time an attack detection

29
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,439
configuration

30
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,009
which is our idea system normally sits
on the DMZ just before file

31
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,530
so that we can see it strikes the
upcoming to our network from external

32
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,270
sources

33
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,100
you guessed it an attack on is really

34
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,530
crap telling me is what's happening in
time really good times what's happening

35
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,460
outside but real enough times what's
happening inside

36
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,780
and vice versa I'm the bearing in mind

37
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,860
we do see band is to help this one
solution that fits all

38
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,260
so obviously they know something that we
all don't know about how you can't

39
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:16,859
attacked

40
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:23,739
in defend both sides have corn so

41
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:27,280
post verses network is always good I'm
gonna be talking about networks today

42
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,989
sorry

43
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:31,069
come self lucky 'cause the post office
just born

44
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:34,310
but the sorry if there's any post by
skies and

45
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,989
it's not personal the host intrusion
detection system has a plethora of

46
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:40,730
information they can rely on

47
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,609
and he's got all the information in the
Box Tops so it's got

48
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,920
syslog Cisco you know network
connections

49
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,470
probably anything that you can get the
OS two tell you

50
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,640
it's got obviously makes it susceptible
to

51
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,690
I you know briquettes and so on so forth
paw

52
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,890
at the end the day it can tell you the
information the house on the box

53
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:05,470
and presume you just worked out I'm

54
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,640
and network intrusion box I'm well

55
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,709
the only information and and needs could
go for

56
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:14,959
is raw data on the on the wire

57
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,790
I am which is also it's a really good
perspective about what's happening on

58
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:20,579
the network

59
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,360
but it's not read capable of telling
anyone what's happening on a host

60
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,340
up but they are not the brat you know
that that

61
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,400
life and breath a most corporate
networks

62
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,459
they they feel compliancy I'm

63
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,379
sources as I'm going to questions but of
course of all

64
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:43,670
about on a really good job or

65
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,810
bored you already I think it's a little
bit from column B

66
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,220
but the issues the IDS is face

67
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,260
is ambiguous RC's for starters

68
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,159
which is a situation that shouldn't
happen you know RC should be pretty

69
00:03:59,159 --> 00:03:59,679
clear

70
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,980
black and white everyone should know
where r should be awesome

71
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,769
really doesn't happen I'm we see this in

72
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:10,819
networking stocks prime example I'll
talk about in a little while

73
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:14,799
inconsistencies in implementations know
what I mean by this

74
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,110
is I let's take and implementation like

75
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,920
a web server or HTTP Server how

76
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,310
patchy and how I S two things

77
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,970
slightly different and there's a
inconsistency between those two lines

78
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,900
however I D S pass play referee in the
middle

79
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,580
and has to understand the
inconsistencies and if it doesn't fully

80
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,289
understand the inconsistencies

81
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:45,850
the Bad Voodoo can harm I'm lack of
system resources another great thing

82
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,890
if we look at IBS boxes that are being
sold now

83
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:53,219
you know they I have no it isn't right
now the only person reading this notice

84
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,160
when you have 90 s panda

85
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,640
they will talk about three but they do
not talk about texan rights

86
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,099
I cannot I cannot think the last man to
that i've seen

87
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,180
talk about detection reason the truly
meaningful way

88
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,520
they talk about you know we ate with
full duplex we can halt and get it we

89
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,770
can do this we can do that

90
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,630
great but what do you detect know if I
want something to be ready fast

91
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,130
ago while you know if I want something
to tact

92
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:24,230
that's your job and you'll see that this
some sort of parks I don't know

93
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,620
am speaking of the coffee almost seems
as some sort of popped

94
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,280
where the IDS man has got together Sat
here let's not fight on detection

95
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,250
less by on three per and it does seem
like most the commercial guys who

96
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,140
constantly talk about

97
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,890
3 per well who really cares about 3 per

98
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,610
I mean if you're going to buy a box this
supposed to protect your network

99
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,790
is that now we are interested in jiving
its bio

100
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,970
like a system resources for than you

101
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,370
it's hard to analyze what you don't
understand so if you don't have the

102
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,330
resources to capture that data

103
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,140
for you to analyze it while you're
already a fine but

104
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,450
you're already losing about before you
can start and like I say if you've got a

105
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,070
locket data to analyze

106
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:11,159
that said is pretty much came out but
certainly the network to

107
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,940
if you have time he the problem is is
that post calls an example this purse

108
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,940
cause a really good

109
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:22,380
night the Centro Scholes jock are you
are able to within a pocket tell what it

110
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,450
does

111
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,680
I UT people 53 I'm very easy one

112
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,060
we know exactly what's going on in that
pocket we don't really need to do much

113
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,880
to you know little bit deep packet
inspection go on look

114
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,300
it said in a name request awesome
however

115
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,110
some not I'm TC people 135

116
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,850
ms LPC you gonna need a little bit more
than one clock it built on lies that

117
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,160
there's a threat to

118
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:56,160
I you know I think if you run off favor
exploit am sooo 867 you running through

119
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,890
maxis ploy it has 17 friends in length
before you

120
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,650
actually do anything so are IDS system

121
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,900
to be able to determine that that's not
a threat

122
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,120
or it is a threat will lease can meet
between 10

123
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,790
20 pockets so about we can really have
some fun that

124
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:19,100
I am that's working moms talk to you
about

125
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,030
anyone have any questions so far post

126
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,950
so what's the point well surprisingly
have touched on this before what's the

127
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,680
point

128
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,970
well testing 90 s systems is a bloody
important point

129
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,750
to be honest with you it's very very
hard

130
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:39,010
if you think about this in this context
right you you have to point I guess

131
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,940
systems without

132
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,360
a decent boarding process or taking the
band is work

133
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,590
now how comfortable does that make you
feel because if your client said to you

134
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,450
oh yeah we just just a Banda YouTube
governmental

135
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,860
to hymie don't trust what they say do
your own tasks

136
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,230
prove it prove it prove it not be yet we
deploy the systems all the time

137
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,160
and they don't get tested anywhere near
him out

138
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,290
I C band is oversell constantly I

139
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,850
I was in for a sec last year for my
sense but just as I

140
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,500
just as a civilian and not working but
the amount of

141
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,890
I'm teal old second anti up things I saw
that was just astonishing

142
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:25,240
really astonishing I think a I think as
you actually Chris that

143
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,600
mention that the I think it was Vegas
where they saw the the anti Moxi box

144
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,390
to stop all Moxie a tux well you doing
really good friend is thank you

145
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,760
you make our top score some so
surprisingly

146
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,799
surprise surprise spend is Mike slightly
over self capabilities if the system's

147
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,510
and as I said earlier on they do not
talk about texan's

148
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,189
I'm how many view over the 90 S under

149
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,900
so K we won't hold it against you also

150
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,510
how many have you had to deal with an
idea spender in the past 12 months

151
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,220
how much fun was it

152
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,910
did you get any stray on sis yeah could

153
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:11,199
so that's not say the bad guys okay you
should buy them appear

154
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,550
shits about to go about a baugh

155
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,770
detection rates the tough talk about it
this is something you need to look at

156
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:23,350
you know we've done some tasks in La
Salsa inss uses some about

157
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,740
soft with some that tests generally me
look a

158
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,800
standard IDS deployments may be 5-10 in
the top ones

159
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,500
we've run 300 known back door closer
then have a detection rate thirty

160
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,490
okay all know it gets worse so it went
liberal

161
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,950
is good section 8 30 this is the top box

162
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,240
fifteen of those a misdiagnosis okay

163
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,320
that's hier wie me we thought it was
thinking and we think is this

164
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,670
yet we pay you to be pretty much know
what you doing so

165
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,829
if we are really nasty to their have a
texan make them

166
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:05,260
about 5 percent that a tax rate for
being really nice about 10 percent

167
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,600
this is where it really really really
gets annoying

168
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,770
so an SSN by the guys bach they stick
one of their engineers with the box

169
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:17,990
the chain up and detection rates got a
98 percent

170
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,420
these boxes can do a job however

171
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,110
when this ship them out to you I'm they
have very liberal policies

172
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:29,350
because it's all about three per because
you don't

173
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:34,060
detect lots of things because that slows
the network down

174
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:38,630
that being said that's why it's
important to do some more thing

175
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,820
you know thank you I stole your sample
it is not tell you to FactSet

176
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,030
in any way shape or form I was
interesting stories that may be a call

177
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:49,319
I can talk about a pot level maybe not
oppenhiem

178
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,790
book you find a lot to my son is not too
sure about the

179
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:58,339
I quirks that their boxes and it's those
little quirks that can be quite

180
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,040
dangerous

181
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,240
to say the least there is a a box that
I've heard of data

182
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,470
will not a inspect new

183
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,720
network devices unless it's been scanned
by the device

184
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,740
so if we put this into context that's
the Berkeley knocking on your front door

185
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,900
and saying I'm going to break in through
that window

186
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,760
could you please keep an eye on it that
orson about time guys

187
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,800
that's I'm not knowing or not that
didn't know that's kinda box before

188
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,140
stopped acting up that's really were I
can't tell you the boxer

189
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,220
was but if I told you what you quite
worried as well

190
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,710
a not cool really not cool I'm see this
quite low

191
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,480
the reason is is that when we see

192
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,600
me even simply bases still work now and
they wanna touch this before so probably

193
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,210
something

194
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,390
this isn't only small

195
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:56,030
has anyone seen through its not before
do you know this is the third revision

196
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:00,970
okay why would you have a rule the looks
like that

197
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,200
gonna stick your hand up some law Chris

198
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,270
you've got a that this is the third
revision so what this does

199
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,100
is this shock basil leaf

200
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,420
and it goes I'll show called

201
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,550
K also so three revisions but today to
stop for

202
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,870
so we've got too many false positives
less rewrite that rule again

203
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,310
is good a oh no still too many false
positives

204
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:32,270
let's go for a couple mall there is now
another rule in snow

205
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,500
this is awesome that's all C's

206
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,210
ass on his second revision is about four
short

207
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,340
now you would think if this is the game
that we're playing

208
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,480
be would be the next logical step but no

209
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,340
you guys are only write buffer overflows
with A's

210
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,370
or sees if you're feeling adventurous

211
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,750
that Sep right that boo

212
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,960
welcome lots you really rock the boat

213
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,070
so I i guess im test recently with our
favor exploit

214
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,800
up soon to be replaced am I so a 67

215
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,640
against I am snot

216
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,620
I'm disinterest for that and
misdiagnosed

217
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,810
am I so I'm sooo 867 as its

218
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,290
you know is its drum .ms 06 04

219
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,510
I managed to get it to evade without a
problem

220
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,569
but for some reason this ru

221
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:31,950
check it off because obviously the
piercings was amazing that what this

222
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,330
means that

223
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,840
but what we did for shits and giggles is
on

224
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,880
if you really don't like your system
administrator

225
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,689
and you're runnin they're running a snot
box my suggestion is

226
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,960
you stick to a fake promises the NW URL
request

227
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,070
it's not going to be long before back is
turned off

228
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:57,060
I with call that docs I think I'm you
know that the box

229
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,930
that's gonna get start to be filled up
with all those alerts as well but yeah

230
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,080
you can stick it out

231
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,400
the interesting thing is if you really
want to be paying us take back your

232
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,190
signature

233
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:10,330
I every email you know all you can get
my email sorry

234
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:15,230
ike's my pop a

235
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,260
but this is what we're dealing with no
word at the light this is the complex

236
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,040
nature of the room right is that we do
with

237
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,279
the rules then I guess this isn't even
on reassembly this is strict but much in

238
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,400
signatures

239
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,589
both really but that's the best we can
do

240
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:35,230
the detective show codes and you may as
well pack up and go home

241
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:39,420
a America might as well most commercial
vendors

242
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,870
will imports not rules why would you
write your own rules

243
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:46,120
so when I'm sick and couldn't even true
so yet

244
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,890
do expected variation about your
commercial box I have much use kind of

245
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,740
I because we can all see how that's
gonna folklore but there is other things

246
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,690
that make I guess is jobs heart I'm

247
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,630
and some simple evasion techniques that

248
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:06,860
very very loosely connected kinda
reassembly sort of the tops

249
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,930
stuff like HTTP compression

250
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,370
so HTTP compression I'm

251
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,420
awesome we can use things like I chunked

252
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,810
it is it is everyone know what I mean by
HTTP chant is a transfer encoding and

253
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,040
HTTP

254
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,209
its I'm is a very good way

255
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,339
delivering stream media over HTTP

256
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,350
put it up but you can do some freaky
stuff for

257
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,870
so what we could do is we can geez it I

258
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,020
payload a HTTP POST payload and then
send

259
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,380
chumps to the IDS system

260
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,689
but the problem is that this is no
normally when we send data in this way

261
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,130
we know me tell the and

262
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,589
point this is where it stops this is
where our hands

263
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:55,690
bomb it doesn't really work that way
across the you can kind of

264
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,700
on compress on flight compete rank: on
the fly so

265
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,670
but 90 s system a passive observer with
network traffic

266
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:07,839
now has a look a HTTP connection the
house compression

267
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,250
that's happening in bits little chunks

268
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,640
and not wonderful box that stops you
know Lohse

269
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,930
can Optimo love those wonderful things
this box is supposed to save you from

270
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:23,390
a now take the IDS I love it

271
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,810
that's still an interesting problem few
to have two sofas network person how do

272
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:27,440
you

273
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,720
while if I want to see what's happening
in those pockets I have three different

274
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,440
things and think about right now

275
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,520
Afghanistan about protocol Afghanistan
about compression

276
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,250
and a half time some about jumped so
needless to say

277
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,380
surprise surprise HTTP compressions work

278
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,390
very very well against I guess you know
that there is

279
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:49,850
I guess stuff that just defeated but
we're gonna see in any medium places

280
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,800
you are gonna see variations these tax
be successful because

281
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,430
your I guess is only as good is the
dangers analyzing

282
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:02,550
and the people analyzing the data in
writing the rules as well

283
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,709
if they don't seem to top not be able to
fix it

284
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:09,740
the horrible truth is bearing in mind we
talk about

285
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,039
speed throughput most 90 s band is

286
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:18,589
from our experience well known leon
inspect first 300 bytes and payload

287
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:22,198
nice because obviously

288
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,679
everything you know that i'm gonna do
you can on the first 300 bytes

289
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:30,300
I'm with you some crazy HTTP

290
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,690
self referencing tricks sticking 300 by

291
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:38,230
a directory name just gets better stop
before you can guess the endpoint

292
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,380
but there we go isn't jump day if the
IDS to deal with

293
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,030
so there's lots to check some pieces you
can do you a really nice

294
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:49,428
an inherently I guess is really fail or

295
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:53,160
because generally they are passive
aspect other network

296
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,500
IPS is ridiculous story unnamed

297
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,510
sometimes I felt close book he wants to
be the

298
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:03,590
evander talking about three per that
brought down the RBS

299
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,949
because of some that were Cara people
don't want to companies just don't want

300
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,160
to get into that day

301
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,790
so they still tend to fail open that's
exactly the opposite of what we were

302
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,850
looking for

303
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:17,179
I really IDS is inherently there's a
couple reasons for this

304
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,280
because they are not an active member on
the network they're not

305
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,990
gateway they are literally a a monitor
mode

306
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,010
when they fall over no one knows you
know if they

307
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:31,460
it so much sack you know if they are a
Mon falls over

308
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,070
who's there to here its pretty much the
case for these guys

309
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,149
and like I said no one wants to be the
vendor that

310
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,920
takes a network down as well but talking
IDS is but the process have

311
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,760
taking one or two sequences pockets
reconstructing them is reassembly

312
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,440
Don we can all go nap indicated

313
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,860
this is only one technique can be used
as was a different techniques and when

314
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,780
we talk about race and we we really
talking about

315
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:59,899
let's make on stream of data reasonably
complex

316
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:05,090
make the IDS work for a living spry
surprise when they work for the living

317
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,959
things get a little bit kinky they are
devices that do very very well

318
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,650
but its in this aspect testing them
we're able to access

319
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:16,830
and redeploy and tighten up this most
important thing

320
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:21,059
so it's not a great example I'm

321
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:24,139
it does some form free sampling

322
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,280
I'm don't think that's I think that's me
being quite like

323
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,070
we've had two great lot of fun to I know
that the new version seems to be quite

324
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,620
cool

325
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:38,059
to be honest with you a.m.

326
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:41,590
but an insurgent attack if you are not
snickering about now you in a child is

327
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,020
dat

328
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,420
Kenny I'm so bonanza and incision attack

329
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,650
I've been reading this for about five
months national everyday I'm

330
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,710
surprisingly few broke my heart

331
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,170
but the idea is to trick 90 s into you
reading

332
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:00,890
pockets that we know are endpoint want
okay

333
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:04,320
I'm so what we want to do

334
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,510
is we want to make %ah stream look

335
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:11,480
different so the but the endpoint will
see it differently

336
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,510
I'll show you how we talk about this
ball

337
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:18,660
these two aspects to this as well
firstly

338
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,290
I i cant camouflage when I'm saying if
you have to see more of a mass is the

339
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,540
endpoints gonna see

340
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:27,200
I can trick you pure and simple and
secondly

341
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,450
I can really screw around with the
reassembly process because I'm gonna

342
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,630
mess about

343
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:34,679
with the IDS is internal sequencing
numbers

344
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:38,280
I'm and is confined real hard problem
reassembling stuff on it

345
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,730
has no climate grasp about where it is
anymore

346
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:46,240
it's kinda lost a part of communication
I'm so just think your data streams

347
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,150
traps

348
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,540
and the IDS is taking Mia taking the

349
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,460
everything said is as truth but we can
do this with the

350
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,720
to really simple tricks I'm so we could

351
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,730
use I am

352
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,799
either invalid checksums the IP has

353
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,960
because surprise surprise the cost to
the overheads

354
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,410
surprisingly IDS boxes tend not to check

355
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:17,290
checksums a well kisses another less at
processing this all about 3 per

356
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,629
there are some the diet pop bottle
massively no

357
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:23,809
so what we could do it is very very
simple

358
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:27,040
here you know up reversible pop

359
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,620
C first this fall i'm ok New Year

360
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,730
podcast not to the texting the right

361
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,920
would be in packets that have either an
invalid check some

362
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,170
or how about this one or a TTL

363
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:44,470
one hot short destination I'm

364
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,540
so what happens is the box gets it goes

365
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,790
all is nothing here also let sit through

366
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:56,090
if it's an invalid check some guys
probably not going to get past the

367
00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:00,059
the first three tree s to truth be told
I'm

368
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:05,149
TT else a yet is not an IDS community
to:

369
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:08,110
because is not an active member doesn't
doesn't do anything to help secure are

370
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,840
you watch this all it can do

371
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,790
says no aspect I'm but what happens is
is those packets get rocked

372
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:17,549
that this approach in any way they're
not real

373
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:21,830
I'm the true message comes out in the
white nice just one example

374
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:26,470
that's quite famous example truth be
told I am

375
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:31,620
evasions I'm it's great to be an
invasion talk talking about Beijing's

376
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:36,670
paw evasions if insertions are making a
boxy something

377
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,760
innovations are making a box not see
something

378
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,730
I'm by far lot more dangerous

379
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:48,040
if you are susceptible to invasion techa
an invasion attack

380
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,629
than you are flying blind see that the
box I was talking about Iran

381
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,750
us not pass on any their opening on to
sit down them is all pack up to go home

382
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,690
you can mess

383
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,360
hopes to use ami effectively are
attacking the

384
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,650
not receive our guest box a and as I say

385
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:10,490
whole streams can go by on chapt really
really not cool

386
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,880
very honest very few them out that there
is 1i wanted to mention

387
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,630
highly unlikely for you to see a great
practices a

388
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:21,130
academia thinking if

389
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,620
you find yourself in a situation where
the

390
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:28,860
I your IPS has a kinky NT you value

391
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,470
comes to be slightly smaller then you're
endpoint

392
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:36,840
I York County to when he Chi

393
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,149
is highly unlikely that we still see
next network so as possible

394
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:46,120
so if your ideas as a small anti you
value than your own point

395
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,190
which is going to stick to do not flag
meant block on all our pockets

396
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:54,610
because you're not gonna get us through
your MTG thanks very much let's go

397
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:59,330
stop can't pass into processing top of
rain

398
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:03,720
highly unlikely that you're gonna see
and I D S and 90 you value

399
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,720
less than 1500 I've bloody shop but it
does happen

400
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,210
has been seen a has been documented
these things

401
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,270
if you see this on one of your devices
there has i think anti you value

402
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,389
really want to call the backdrop because
that

403
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,059
this is old school chief homie should be
falling for that we can see how this

404
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:23,129
works

405
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:27,150
but the most important one is
transmission control box in mind in Maya

406
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,169
my presumption now

407
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:33,340
to several know what I saw you mean by a
transmission control block

408
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,959
I at this kinda like a data structure
that's used in

409
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,770
a and TCPIP to you order

410
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,559
the this secret sedating now almost dead
date ish

411
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,559
generally is sent in a sequence matter
anyway

412
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:50,480
even isn't supposed to be sleeping the
protocol is designed to be able to

413
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,320
Hunter

414
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,520
I'm in love I D S is used to anyway not

415
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,400
I not do any form sequencing because you
can bring

416
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,860
you don't normally see on ordered
sequence in certainly locally and

417
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,650
but a transmission control is structured
issues to organize

418
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:10,350
what's going on keep keep it up keep
Taylor what's going on

419
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:15,270
I and it's an important factor

420
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:18,620
let the TCB issue well how does

421
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,380
an IDS reassemble data the same way

422
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:26,580
is the endpoint male you know it it
needs to you need to take a TCB

423
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,939
needs to look at the sequencing them
really needs to re assemble

424
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,450
that data structure so if the TCP

425
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,250
is really really important and it gives
them to cope with issues here

426
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,710
when do you start a TCP for connection
because whatever decision you make

427
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,780
is an attack a I'm gonna make you pay
for one's going to be less

428
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:49,580
one's going to be more and and bus the
gray area in the middle

429
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,299
is where we went all lose so this is the
issue

430
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:56,700
when do we start there's two ways that
we can start we can wait for every

431
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,630
three-way handshake and go haha

432
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:02,130
is a connection that's normally how an
end point sets up that's not how

433
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:04,040
connection setup the sequencing

434
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,340
the during three-way handshake bombs
this is awesome

435
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:12,330
but me because mess

436
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:15,710
that three-way handshake and the whole
communication might be able to be

437
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,510
sequence because you don't have to see
people for animal

438
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,700
of is just date on that day on the white

439
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,540
just noise that the the IDS does not
half

440
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,678
the correct information to reassemble
that data

441
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:34,110
I am and we call it. synchronizes decent
rice from the from the street

442
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:37,179
really bad for you this happens

443
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:41,010
deathly pack up stuff time to go if you
if this helps your IBS

444
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:44,440
not cool which take from the traffic

445
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,169
that's awesome because tickets is the
ability to me synchronize

446
00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:51,710
if we get the synchronized quite easily
however

447
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,900
both games two options because we do

448
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,140
on three-way handshake if I commit
three-way handshake in some way

449
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,140
my that don't show part or do something
to make sure that your network is not

450
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,580
your ideas book is not paying attention
in this is a three-way handshake

451
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:10,080
you can if aidid if not and you gonna do
on the traffic

452
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,210
what time when I'm gonna do I'm gonna
sell lots a spurious

453
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:17,740
connection data so that you start saying
not lots a TCP books

454
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:21,850
let's see how much system resources
you've got I see how long you hold onto

455
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,130
that TCP before you drop

456
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:27,510
because from there on in was a good
start page what your

457
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:31,370
what you mine says what your you
configuration is but we can't

458
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:34,870
if you take from data only the usually
just south of

459
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:38,130
to having lots and lots and lots of
TCP's are

460
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:43,980
and having no idea what's going on not
cool

461
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,080
and really the trent keep equipment
unknowns was the finishing soon but

462
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,668
reassembly tops

463
00:27:49,669 --> 00:27:52,990
when we look at them are generally
making

464
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,809
your stream look like two different
things I

465
00:27:56,809 --> 00:28:00,730
giving it and purity which we all know
internet working level

466
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:04,880
is ready not cool I'm and computing
times

467
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,510
obstruction is not awesome we shouldn't

468
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:12,400
whenever we make a computer make a
decision that is not based on

469
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,850
ones and zeros it gets kinda but from
then on inman's

470
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:19,059
I'm day they are

471
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:23,120
a fine line between you interpretation

472
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,370
and the reason Apple this up as I
mentioned earlier on I just checked

473
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:29,660
me here

474
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,000
soak times but eat

475
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,220
is about having two different streams
and the same stream

476
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:41,919
K around earlier on the I talked about
inconsistencies in implementations

477
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,559
this is gonna play out in a little bit K
ball so

478
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,039
what we're trying to do is a data stream
a high-speed different interpretations

479
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:52,210
depending on the endpoint Europe

480
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:56,890
that's really the best point so I can
make a day she might like one thing

481
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:00,160
for Windows system make it look like
something else for Unix System

482
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,080
very very easy because there is
inconsistencies in how the implemented

483
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,899
the our seats

484
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,660
but we see this all the time I
overlapping overlapping fragments were a

485
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,210
prime example is this

486
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:16,080
I am and it can happen everywhere in TCP
IP and you know

487
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,918
so on and so forth an example if this

488
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:25,630
is Windows I'm was once told an IDS
system has to be like a web server

489
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:30,730
I said no 90 s system has to be like
every web server

490
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:34,470
because the problem ends is stop

491
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:38,160
Apache on a Windows system an apache on
analytic system

492
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,280
how they handle the character case

493
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,889
is completely different and that's
that's one implementation just want to

494
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,250
defer net on two different boxes

495
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:51,690
you know that that said so when we look
at home

496
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:55,950
I overlapping fragments work when I mean
by this is we send all fragments with

497
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,490
that buy offsets

498
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:02,900
the crossover Windows and Unix this
battle map around

499
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:06,470
and thankfully this kept his own
employment and I hope we will continue

500
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,760
to do so

501
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,820
but Windows we do this we send some
overlapping data

502
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,668
so we set some new data let me say some
even new innovator

503
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:19,549
say right make your decision about which
is true

504
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:22,629
we ask an end point to do that a bear in
mind our ideas

505
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:27,220
at the same time must work out who I
have to make a decision here that's not

506
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,400
Academy did not a signature so

507
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:36,090
in Windows really nice always favor the
first date they'd get

508
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:40,740
cool fortunately we all know that UNIX
well we all know that when this has to

509
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,710
be different from the UNIX

510
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:47,730
cuz I'm not gonna plane you next to this
I believe this that was here first

511
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:51,600
I'm not susceptible to talking not to
UTPA and falling over

512
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,460
that's a different story so and inlets
well to start UNIX world

513
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:00,390
up new data his favorite

514
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:04,340
so it is just two stops burning Mike how
many

515
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,289
by IP stocks are out there this just to
him and I D S has to work out I think

516
00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:10,730
it's fair to say that I guess maybe

517
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:14,929
in some way she cherry-picked in some
ways if is defending all known to tops

518
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:17,710
then maybe you need to kinda man up

519
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:21,030
well so what we could do here is

520
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:26,450
I'm with seven looking a combinations of
the top 10 some bipartisan moment

521
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:31,950
is week send a my almost like an old
truck when in the TCP stream

522
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:35,919
I'm and what we can do is we can get it
to you

523
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,760
if we talking out windows and point
between very well possibly could have

524
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,408
control over the endpoint

525
00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:44,830
it could be a command control center we
could be very much all we know is going

526
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,080
to an ISO

527
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,129
for a while you know we could notice

528
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:53,470
so we descended on fragment I

529
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:56,830
first and depending on I

530
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:01,010
depending what he said to laughter
really depending on the endpoint

531
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:05,169
the the IDS will have to make a decision
if that no fragment plays it doesn't

532
00:32:05,169 --> 00:32:05,740
play

533
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:10,039
is in session I make a decision on those
things that you can do here

534
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:13,390
I'm we could use to check that it was
doing the reps

535
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:18,720
text to the wrong I'm Disney have to be
no problem so we could put in data

536
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,909
this is one thing and depending on the
endpoint

537
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:25,280
will depend on the processing plant and
I'm a sampling are

538
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,059
for IDS in the middle somehow people
play nicely

539
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:33,399
and it's just too stocks and don't even
get me started about

540
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,710
okay overlapping fragments with data

541
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,890
which flock takes precedence over to

542
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:44,100
pockets cuz you bet it is
inconsistencies again

543
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,919
is no universal months it's a gray area

544
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,100
this is where things get really about
per score normalization

545
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:56,760
yet you know what that there is a real
good place for that and it's important

546
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,530
book to get protocol normalization on
the breast to the Internet

547
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:05,539
that's what the problem is not it's not
but it's not per se the IDS is for

548
00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:09,490
it won't be in control the reenactment
you know any content around say

549
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:13,880
useful RFC a little bit more stricter
I'm

550
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,390
so unity these are some the issues which
are not poor

551
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:22,419
because one to five minutes left and I
know that there are often enough gonzo

552
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:26,350
or anything like that no and got

553
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:29,450
so in summer you've hurt me throughout
the time

554
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:33,679
saying poor ideas poor IDS I don't
actually mean

555
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,140
I'm button-down IDS you TM whatever you
want to call it

556
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:42,350
okay long story short is if you keep on
telling everyone that we can defend you

557
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,440
your family

558
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,299
and you keep on getting Tom as some
point

559
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:50,340
we're gonna start asking questions and
this nearly happened to us at the low

560
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,740
setting

561
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,950
because all these vendors also this deep
all this equipment to people people

562
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,730
forget the Sony

563
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:59,770
did have security teams in place and
stuff like okay not very good

564
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:03,070
but this still the had products

565
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:07,418
and failed and at some point this keeps
on happening we gonna have to us

566
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:11,159
on system pretty heavy questions so
please please please please if you're a

567
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:11,990
Banda

568
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:15,609
I think most people would respect you
start talking about the challenges that

569
00:34:15,609 --> 00:34:16,799
your boxes face

570
00:34:16,799 --> 00:34:20,489
and how it goes against that I'm as I
said earlier on

571
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:23,889
it is not this is the issue when you say
that ninety asked us to be like

572
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:28,019
web server no remember has to be like
every web server

573
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:31,419
like every DNS server like every email
server

574
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:34,469
you cannot get one box to do all

575
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:38,369
and you should maybe look at
segmentation if using ideas and say

576
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:41,710
you know what I want an ideal spot that
just looks of three male

577
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:46,059
I'm attack everson ounce of everything
all is going to do is pack inspecting a

578
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:50,769
that's it I'm you can't analyze what you
don't know

579
00:34:50,769 --> 00:34:53,829
and that's why they should techniques
work I'm

580
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:57,489
deep packet inspection bringing I mean
is this this this

581
00:34:57,489 --> 00:35:01,069
that this is really point meanwhile you
look in a pocket and it tells you

582
00:35:01,069 --> 00:35:02,058
something

583
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:05,479
actually thought that was the whole
point pockets behaving

584
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:11,219
a so if you get someone who's throwing
the whole deepok inspection at you

585
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:14,329
maybe call them on it you know you might
get you hot

586
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:18,339
ass handed to you ten times out of 100
but I much cynicism is using that time

587
00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:18,969
the No

588
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:22,710
because really deep packet inspection is
packet inspection

589
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:27,729
you know how can go any deeper then a
hard look at the pocket

590
00:35:27,729 --> 00:35:32,009
and this is up lovely time where you are

591
00:35:32,009 --> 00:35:35,630
asking me questions you don't really
have to I how

592
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:38,809
lots of interesting material I'm to

593
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:42,229
I find interesting who probably deal
with your

594
00:35:42,229 --> 00:35:46,089
sedative requirements if you haven't jet
like a problem sleeping or anything like

595
00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:46,650
that

596
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:50,989
and caught with or some books to the PDS
are available

597
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:55,700
place I'm if you have any questions get
me fix it for next to protect you K
