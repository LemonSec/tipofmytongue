1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,100
you all know at form well as long as

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,030
online banking system basically we have
attacks against individual users

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,610
we read about that

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,220
lot of cases you probably get email
every day trying someone

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,210
trying to hustle you into giving them
your a Barclays bank account

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,369
account which you never use you don't
even

7
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:27,600
you're not even customer of the bank

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,430
but services like you something that's
been going on and it's really

9
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,780
past present thing the present think
maybe you noticed that

10
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,020
we get more and more attacks against
corporate users

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,510
because that's more interesting has more
money back now

12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,720
it's not just a future so already am
present

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,470
attacks against direct against online
banking service

14
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,430
and in the future we can expect

15
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,850
attacks against the back end systems
because that's where we need the money

16
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,229
yes

17
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:03,150
now individual users

18
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,450
so the massive methods are known the
goal is to

19
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,000
steal the user's identity right so the
attackers using many methods like her

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,010
fishing process scripting sissy serve

21
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,100
the install malware uses computers

22
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,610
we're not going to be talking about
today this is just like an intro

23
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,719
so detectors have many problems because
banks and users are fighting back and

24
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,729
they're making this more and more
difficult

25
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:31,390
next thing corporate users

26
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,759
more interesting because this more money
there

27
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,409
it won't be a surprise to bank to see

28
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:41,560
problem million euros being drink being

29
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,000
send from the bank account on the
corporation

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,770
to another corporation because that's
just a business it would be

31
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,750
suspicious if an individual use it did
that

32
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,939
but not to come company so the organized
crime

33
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,070
is now going after the corporations as
well

34
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,320
and they have another problem because

35
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,030
if you want to attack individual users
just spam everyone

36
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,179
just by email is the 1,000,000 emails

37
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:13,590
just spam everyone so I get spammed

38
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,230
with the an attack that is aimed against
uses them specific bank that I never

39
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,200
even heard of

40
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,670
but they don't care with the to
corporate users you wanna be more

41
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,450
targeted

42
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,590
so how do they find that targets you
have to know who to attack in it in

43
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,290
specific

44
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,980
company who is the person doing the
online banking

45
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,760
well one thing that is very useful for
the attackers

46
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,250
are the online publishing a public
directories

47
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,170
issued digital certificates I don't know
about the whole world

48
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:48,300
but in Europe I'm digital certificates
are being

49
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,320
mainly used for online banking for
corporations

50
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,579
sojourner our corporation you are going
to be using

51
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,390
a smart card did too stiff gait to

52
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,750
do the online banking now these online
this

53
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,130
in a digital certificates are published
in

54
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,380
online directories so anyone can find

55
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,850
information on crew in a specific
company

56
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,430
is has been issued certificates by

57
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,520
wanna the certificated authorities

58
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,070
there are being used for online banking
I'm sure an example in

59
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:27,150
our country so yeah we found a lot of

60
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,970
a public directories of issued digital
certificates

61
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,880
and in specific in our country if you
want to attack

62
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,329
the company that's listed below I

63
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:42,630
you can find the name of the person
having

64
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,340
issued a digital certificates for

65
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,180
that company company and also his email
address and that's all you need

66
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,440
if you want to attack the company just
don't think these guys

67
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,060
if you want to attack accompany you can
get this information you know exactly

68
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,700
who to target inside that

69
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,940
company but that's not to talk to our
talk the topic over talk is here

70
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,750
some online banking service no

71
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,940
in contrast to attacking users

72
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,870
and corporations where the goal was to
steal their identity

73
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,649
and then do whatever the application the
banking application allows

74
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,250
any legitimate users to do sheer

75
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,090
the attackers interested in finding
vulnerabilities and exploiting them

76
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,110
in the in the online banking server

77
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,180
so the method is hacking and

78
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,700
them there is additional problem here
detected does not know

79
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,880
of the phone abilities yet so he has to
try to find them

80
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,610
so there's an additional stage where the
attacker can be detected

81
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,980
now the advantages are obvious

82
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,570
I'm there's well basically all the money
is in the bank

83
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:56,550
right and not just all the money even
more money than all the money what I

84
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,230
mean what I mean by that

85
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,730
you can actually create new money
because banks do that all the time banks

86
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,540
create new money

87
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,310
every day and destroy money every day we
just concede

88
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,440
any since the money is digital it's just
a matter of a couple of bits and bytes

89
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,990
in databases

90
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,420
and big advantage for the attacker is
that there is no social engineering

91
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,580
required here

92
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,060
you don't have to hustle trick anyone
into doing something you're just

93
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,160
attacking the server directly

94
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,560
now let's just move on to a couple of
couple of

95
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,030
vulnerability types in attack types that
are prepared for you

96
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,460
this would be somewhat simplified to
make them more generic

97
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,900
buddy if you're familiar with I how
banks work

98
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,720
you will you will be it would be easy
for you to just translate that to

99
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,330
to real case a direct resource access
windows

100
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:50,300
all West everyone probably well this is
one of the

101
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,660
top vulnerabilities in all web
applications

102
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:58,690
and online banking is mostly web-based
even if you have a thick client

103
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,380
there's usually HTTP going in the
background

104
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,800
so let's see what can happen here this
is a really lame example

105
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,360
you wouldn't believe that this would
really exist in the real world

106
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,180
so we have a bank have a URL and the
user ID

107
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,450
in New York I'll so when I log into the
bank and I'm

108
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,800
practicum this URL I get my on balance
data

109
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,470
but if I changed the ID to something
else I get someone else's

110
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,580
account balance data who doesn't believe
that this

111
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:33,330
actually exist in real world well this
really happened in Citibank

112
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,919
this exacting whole aim status so this
is the actual

113
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:40,500
state of security today in the largest
banks

114
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,389
was solemn not not those that we've been
tested

115
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:48,320
are some

116
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,130
but not usually the case unity arguments
are

117
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,409
base64 incumbent is that

118
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,460
real yeah re

119
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,480
so can when you do the pen testing can
you see this

120
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,370
of course when you see the typical
characters a base64

121
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,430
of course first thing you do you decode
this

122
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,540
and find something like this just

123
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:16,740
base64 encode something else and
requested and you get some honest

124
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,220
week actually see this in Greensboro

125
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,800
but the better banks

126
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,290
have gone further they're using your own
trips

127
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,290
so we see something like this it again
Bay 64 encoded so

128
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,480
it's not a problem per se if if it's in
cryptid I

129
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,900
or you have pics including so when we
see something like this the first

130
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,169
instinct for hackers let's try to decode
this first and see

131
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:45,240
was hiding behind so what's usually
hiding behind

132
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,460
is a code like this: so we have the the
same types of parent

133
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,820
that be used in in the previous lights
and then we're encrypting

134
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,389
this with some encryption key

135
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:59,580
and then we add that to the URL so the
application gives us

136
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,659
link that is encrypt it and when you
click on the link it received a request

137
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,669
and decrypts the link it's much better
than but be so before because

138
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:10,690
we would need to know the key to to be
able to

139
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,880
encrypt something that the sarin will
understand

140
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,650
but it still happens that its easy to
guess

141
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,360
the code if you do you really motivated
and the second problem is

142
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,680
that some people actually know the key
the people

143
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,110
in the bank the developers those who
have quit

144
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,750
actually selected to key know the key

145
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,059
so it's not not a really good idea if
that guy who knows the key leaves the

146
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:35,990
bank

147
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,260
and then still knows the key he can
still

148
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:44,208
get access to other people's accounts

149
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:49,709
I'm sorry

150
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:54,709
now well it can be it can be

151
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:58,550
affected I'm not naming anyone
specifically

152
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,618
some the developers being aware of this
problem

153
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:05,980
I'm usually make it lynn be more
difficult for you to

154
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,410
on to guess what's going on in
background so

155
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,949
they at some some sold to the original

156
00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:17,248
arguments and they even at some random
which is a good idea if you had some

157
00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:18,529
random data

158
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:21,779
then it will be more difficult to guess

159
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,559
what's happening in the background if
you don't know the code but we still

160
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,050
have that guy who knows

161
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,319
this code in knows this ski so doing
this

162
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,628
is not a good substitute for actual

163
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:36,189
server-side authorization on the receipt
to request

164
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:39,939
so whenever you see something like this
into your L you know there's something

165
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:42,699
fishy going in the background

166
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:47,008
now we're not here to steal other
people's data

167
00:09:47,009 --> 00:09:50,730
the bank robber wants to actually steal
money

168
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:55,339
so we can apply this knowledge to
stealing money

169
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:58,939
we have a similar case we have a
transfer URL here we can source account

170
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:02,059
destination in town animate right so

171
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:06,969
this is like what I want what I would do
if I want to transfer money from my comp

172
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,160
to someone else

173
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,449
and of course by the same token if we
change the source account

174
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:16,589
the the application does not allow me to
do this through the gooey so I have to

175
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:17,490
do it manually

176
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,279
but if I do this and there's no service
i'd validation re:

177
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,290
or should if you can be bypassed then
money can be taken from someone else's

178
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,579
account instead of mine

179
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:32,149
so how does it this work this money
transaction

180
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:35,959
as good go a little bit deeper into that
so we have the user with the browser

181
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:40,040
and a the online making sir

182
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,069
first of all the user decides that he
wants to make a

183
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:46,809
a transfer office funds so the server
provides an empty

184
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:51,559
transaction for is there anyone who
doesn't use online banking

185
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:54,969
we have who have two guys were really
secure here okay

186
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,240
to I can go really really quickly
through that see getting into

187
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,499
transection form

188
00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:03,110
and but you can fill out so you select
your account select the other count

189
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,339
and and the amount %uh money want to
transfer and a few other data that

190
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:08,999
that's not important here

191
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:13,540
so the server than persons you a filled
out form

192
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,759
just for the confirmation so that you
don't mistakenly send money to someone

193
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:19,999
else into

194
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:24,100
it allows you to confirm what you
decided to to do

195
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,369
now the validation updating

196
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:31,389
first can be done here on the client
side right

197
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:34,459
and it you know it always is if you want
to enter

198
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:37,809
a negative number into im amount you
want to transfer

199
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:41,339
the the JavaScript probably won't let
you right

200
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:45,079
so-and-so the browser will not let you
do that you can just type it in

201
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:49,779
an issue you cannot even select someone
else's account from the drop-down box

202
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:53,389
them they're only your accounts there so
that that's kind of like

203
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:57,920
more user-friendly validation than
anything security-related

204
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,569
so that week we all know that you can
pack this so you can on

205
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:05,579
real I'm back now there's a server-side
validation

206
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:09,420
in this step so whenever I provide some
data I want to do this and that but my

207
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,498
money

208
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:13,959
the service and validates my data and
and looks at it and says

209
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:17,360
okay this guy's trying to do something
can she do that

210
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,889
does have a the have authorization for
this account

211
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:25,239
is the amount okay and so on and then
the server

212
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:29,199
returns that foreign to me and when I
conferment

213
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:32,209
it can validate it again well d

214
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:35,569
most important validation is the third
while because

215
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:40,149
after that's been done the server is
going to say okay this validation is OK

216
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:43,920
I'm going to send it back and and back
and just does everything

217
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,040
it's ever tells you to do with frequent
frequent security error here is

218
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,879
that the server only does by this number
two

219
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,009
so if you change your data in the
confirmation form

220
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,110
you can bypass that validation and

221
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:05,249
give the back-end server whatever you
want to get

222
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:08,470
next cases negative numbers would you
believe

223
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,369
that you can actually use negative
numbers in online banking systems

224
00:13:13,369 --> 00:13:20,300
yes I would too okay these guys from the
bank he knows what he's talking about

225
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,369
ok it negative numbers are surprisingly
often

226
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:27,869
0 overlooked let's see

227
00:13:27,869 --> 00:13:32,279
this is typical line of code the does
the validation of the amount

228
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:36,089
that we selected so we want to transfer
100 euros

229
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:39,160
and this is a the line of code that says

230
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,379
is he is it okay does he have 100 euros

231
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:48,029
so if I want to transfer three thousand
euros and I have only 2009.com

232
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:51,319
this line is going to block my attempt

233
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:56,269
but if I do this if I want to transfer
minus 100 euros

234
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,410
miss line will have no problem with that

235
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,999
so checking for negative numbers is very
often overlooked

236
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:06,139
maybe not in the entire online banking
application but if you

237
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:09,389
if you can find one place where it's
overlooked you can do some funny things

238
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:12,730
with that

239
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:17,059
so this is the actual case the attacker
has an empty account balance

240
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:22,269
victim has 100 euros detector transfers
minus 100 euros

241
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:25,899
to the victim very generous up right

242
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:29,589
so the end result is the detector has
100

243
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:32,869
and victim has a zero so it was it its

244
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:36,399
the same as a transection from the
victim to the attacker

245
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,679
on the triggered by the attacker this is
really cool this is 'em

246
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,730
very little known problem

247
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,949
if you if you try to browse Google if
you if you

248
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:50,230
the search Google for for this specific
problem its really not easy to find

249
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,170
references I only found found a couple
but in the banking sector

250
00:14:54,170 --> 00:15:01,170
they're very well aware of that after my
pen test

251
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:20,230
yeah the yet but but

252
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,529
not the

253
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:27,120
the business logic behind this is
whatever the is the amount to transfer

254
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,240
this amount will be subtracted from my
account and added to his account

255
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,329
right some if -100 is subtracted from my
count

256
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:39,959
it's like ending adding 101

257
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:43,470
so I yeah

258
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:49,290
mines mines so again I get a plus now
let's see

259
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,300
something that we once

260
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:57,730
came across a similar case for going to
transfer minus 100 euros

261
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:03,040
but not another person's account but to
our own savings account a savings

262
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:03,779
accounts

263
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:07,290
are just like any other comment they
have a specific property

264
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,759
but they don't cannot have a negative
balance well at least those that we see

265
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,310
and the problem on the problem this is
actually an advantage for the attacker

266
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:20,550
if you want to transfer minus 100 euros
from a normal calm to savings account

267
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,839
this is what we get we get one hundred
euros

268
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,740
but we do not get minus 100 euros on the
savings account because it cannot have a

269
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,559
negative value

270
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,730
not the business logic said that is not
OK I'm not going to do that part of the

271
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,490
transaction

272
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,480
is national case and what's what's fun
with this

273
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,809
is that you can actually create new
money before

274
00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:44,889
we had a total of 20 euros now we have a
total of 100

275
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:47,990
so this actually more money in existence
because a

276
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:53,449
this failed transaction next thing

277
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:57,110
bypassing ima checks banks like to
impose limits on us

278
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:01,399
they don't like us to to transfer one
million euros from our account with free

279
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,379
don't happen

280
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:05,900
and I understand them I wouldn't do that
either but

281
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,199
due to aris in business logic

282
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,079
there you can possibly find ways to
bypass that

283
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,799
because maybe there's insufficient
validation on the server

284
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,260
any other and the other thing any other
reason let me just show you what can

285
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:21,970
happen

286
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,470
if if you do if you find that so you
have two accounts

287
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:30,500
one with one hundred euros the other one
empty if you can link

288
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,240
bypass the limitations it can be
possible because

289
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,360
code is written by people and we make
errors right

290
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,510
this is the case no extra money

291
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:44,750
is in existence now because the total is
the same as before

292
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,399
but you actually have a huge minus
someone account

293
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:52,659
and a huge plus in the other comp now if
you're an honest guy

294
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:55,750
you'd at those two together and say yup

295
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,070
I old I owe the bank you probably be be

296
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:02,210
worse off because you would be paying a
lot of interest

297
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:05,649
for the for the overdraft buddy if
you're a criminal you would just take

298
00:18:05,649 --> 00:18:06,200
those

299
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,000
million euros go to the Y right you
forget about the debt to the back

300
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,169
some that is why the bank does not want
you

301
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:17,530
to make larger overdressed than those
that

302
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,809
the authorized to you this can this was
actually a case in

303
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:24,559
in one hour contest next

304
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,059
to HTP primer pollution this is the

305
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:31,490
a class of HDP vulnerabilities

306
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,760
I discovered by yucatan and Stephanie
power

307
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,539
the day pronounce that correctly X it's
a

308
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:43,830
very good idea actually let me show you

309
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:47,199
what this means in in the banking system

310
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,240
so we have a communication between the
user

311
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,309
and the online banking server which is
running a JSP

312
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:58,139
code at this time and back-end server
running a PHP code

313
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,600
it's not very usual for backend and
service the run PHP code but for our

314
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,789
for our example here but suppose it's el

315
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:09,950
so the user wants to transfer 100 euros
from

316
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:15,340
account want to count to now the code on
this JSP server

317
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,939
reads the arguments from the URL and
does some validation

318
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,030
you see if not use our authorized for
source account

319
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,510
than an hour or so I cannot actually
provide

320
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:30,669
another persons account to to the server

321
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,780
they would reject that and also it makes
a test that if the

322
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,020
if I do don't do not have enough
disposable

323
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:42,309
funds on my account also

324
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:46,220
I get an error so this is this is a
typical validation of the user data

325
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:50,179
now the code says if those checks were
okay

326
00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:53,360
and I'm going 2-4 with that request to
the back answer

327
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,909
and he does that in another post
transactions so just for was

328
00:19:56,909 --> 00:20:00,309
the same record same parameters that
were used before

329
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:04,040
to the back in summer the backend server
reads those parameters

330
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:09,500
and does the transaction that's it now
the HTTP parameter pollution

331
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:14,480
is this we at another argument to the
URL

332
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,760
it doesn't have to be your only can be
in imposed a to swell

333
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,549
so we have to source arguments here know
what happens

334
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:25,559
the guys who were were research in age
to get parameters

335
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,770
pollution they analyzed various servers

336
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:33,549
various frameworks in terms of what they
do if they encounter

337
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:36,809
to primers with the same name

338
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:40,850
now it turns out then JSP

339
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:46,139
takes the first parameter so we have the
same situation as before

340
00:20:46,139 --> 00:20:49,190
now when the request is forwarded to the
back end

341
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,610
PHP takes the second parameter

342
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:55,649
you can see this can be used for
bypassing

343
00:20:55,649 --> 00:20:59,540
validation on on first server

344
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:03,129
but of course no ones that silly so we
have another layer

345
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:06,590
or of authorization in the back and

346
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,830
so we say if users not authorized for
the source account for not going to do

347
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,080
the transaction

348
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,889
we can still do something else

349
00:21:15,889 --> 00:21:20,480
we can change the amount so now we have
to amount arguments

350
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,210
and all the validation will pass
correctly

351
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:28,280
although the back and we'll have the
amount of 100,000 euros

352
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,330
which I do not have on my a comp so this
is

353
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,289
a perfect example of a vulnerability
that allows you to do some other things

354
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:41,770
that image before some bypassing limit
checks

355
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,330
signage action well it's pretty boring
but you still have it

356
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:50,520
everywhere and of course you also have
it in online banking systems

357
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,330
it's funny that when we talk to to the
bank's and

358
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:58,629
before the pen test we always get

359
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:02,460
skeptical looks and they say now sequins
action would be possible

360
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,289
markets now and they have hundreds of
reasons

361
00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:09,830
but we always find at least one case
working do it

362
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,689
so it's really and an important
vulnerability banking system as well

363
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,830
so you're familiar with is this would be
a typical to be the case

364
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:21,629
if someone tact the a sequel Crary for

365
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:25,169
forgetting the exchange rates for a
specific currency

366
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:30,639
and then replace the on validated
argument with something like this

367
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:35,520
this is a classic example but again bank
robber is not here to steal

368
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,530
data is here to steal money

369
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:44,049
how it's still money this is difficult
simplified version of what happens

370
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:47,179
when someone transfers money from one
account to another

371
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:50,549
so we have an actual sequel transaction
which means that

372
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:54,210
either all sequel craters will be
successful or none of them

373
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:59,080
this is the basic hygiene of banking
industry

374
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,100
but we have to update query so whenever
i transfer money from my account another

375
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,799
the balance in my account has to be
changed and balance on the other

376
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:11,299
tom has to be changed accordingly make
sense so these are to updates

377
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:16,039
inquiries so my count is going to be
changed 20

378
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:20,080
and Mike on balancing the the other cons
balance is going to be changed one

379
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,049
hundred

380
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:25,059
by the if these arguments are not proper
invalidated

381
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:29,610
well this is a case how it would
actually work in a in a normal case

382
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,780
this would be a sequel injection so even
though we have

383
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,299
a transaction single transaction

384
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:39,510
the first query will actually said my
account number

385
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:42,760
my account balance to 0 but the second
one

386
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,830
was said the other cons and my icons

387
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,240
balance back to 100 so we again created
money

388
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,530
I did nothing

389
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:56,590
this is something completely different
banking signatures

390
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:00,070
are you when you using online banking do
you do your bank's

391
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:04,350
provide an option for you too to make an
online deposit

392
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:08,260
so that you can then digitally sign

393
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,669
deposits agreement you have that

394
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:15,169
anyone okay weary from

395
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:19,080
Austria icing we have that in our
country as well so

396
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,119
what banks are doing they are really
enthusiastic about this

397
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:27,770
digital certificates and digital
signatures because we have

398
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,770
the the loss that we need to make this

399
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:35,010
this signatures rallied in the court and
we have the technology

400
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:38,220
and the users are already have to
digital certificates

401
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:43,250
so why not automate some of these
processes so let's see how that works

402
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,440
if the user wants to deposit 100 euros
for 31 days

403
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,740
he makes a request to the banking server
and sever says

404
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,040
okay this is the deposit agreement but
you need to sign

405
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,590
and his its dynamically generated from
the data that user has

406
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,840
has provided and the server also decides

407
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,980
what the interest rate would be for your
deposit

408
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,020
and this is all the data that you get
when you're supposed to sign

409
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,050
so these are signs the deposit agreement
and send it to the server and the sarah

410
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,440
connor signs it

411
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,450
with the banking certificate which is on
server

412
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,559
now this is a legal document enforceable

413
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:23,040
in court if you go to the court can take
this

414
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,418
digitally signed document the court will
say you are right

415
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:29,770
this is true this is a real agreement
between you and the bank even though

416
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:33,190
there was no person on the other side
now

417
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:37,369
would you see the problem here well a
malicious user

418
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:42,540
can modify the agreement and if the
server is not careful

419
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,710
it was signed the modified Agreement but
the modified Agreement

420
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:50,590
can be anything not just increasing the
interest rate for

421
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,899
from 2 percent annually to $2 million
per cent annually which would be

422
00:25:54,899 --> 00:25:58,369
like nice way to earn money

423
00:25:58,369 --> 00:26:01,730
but the text up the agreement can also
be changed

424
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:04,740
so it it it may no longer be

425
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,530
deposit agreement it can be a statement
from the bank

426
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:11,668
that all their a real estate is now
yours

427
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:15,299
hypothetically that not work with your
day anything can be changed not just

428
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:17,820
numbers

429
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,399
and then of course the classic it's a
recycled execution

430
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:24,720
as you can see everything i'm talking
about here requires

431
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,990
0 user interaction so these attacks
against

432
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:32,570
the banking servers you don't have to
social engineer anyone

433
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:35,790
so the server side code execution is
nothing special in

434
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:39,399
in the banking industry so I wanna go

435
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:42,960
through this in into much detail buddy

436
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,369
the impact what detector would like to
do if he manages to

437
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:50,950
to execute code on the server is to
change the banking application code of

438
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:51,770
course

439
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:55,869
is that code includes business logic
that prevents you from doing some nasty

440
00:26:55,869 --> 00:26:57,530
things and you can if you can

441
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,960
remove that logic from the application

442
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,419
you can attack the system and

443
00:27:04,419 --> 00:27:07,429
what the Holy Grail

444
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:10,460
for the attacker would be to get the

445
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,690
opportunity and credentials to send
direct

446
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:17,540
requests to the back end because back
and

447
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:22,320
trusts the server the the online banking
server

448
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,109
that it has done some validation before
so whatever the on my server

449
00:27:26,109 --> 00:27:29,379
says to the backhand the back and can
provide some

450
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:32,419
can execute some additional validations
but

451
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:37,179
it essentially has to trust that there
was the user behind this request

452
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:41,649
even though the attacker was actually
behind the request

453
00:27:41,649 --> 00:27:45,720
now I know you all came because in this

454
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,299
because you know you like the
vulnerabilities you you you would like

455
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,139
have a 32 pack banks

456
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:53,740
but you don't want to go to jail now

457
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,780
I'll give you a way to do that

458
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:02,470
this attack is about rounding and
currency exchange

459
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,750
now suppose you have an exchange rates

460
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:10,080
such that for 1 Euro you get 1.36 four
dollars

461
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,840
it's pretty much there today now if you
exchange one

462
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,909
euro cent you will you should get

463
00:28:16,909 --> 00:28:21,030
this much dollars but because %uh the
rounding

464
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:27,129
you will get less right so you make a
nice the loss

465
00:28:27,129 --> 00:28:30,139
so what should be do

466
00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:35,669
yeah make it the other way around

467
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:39,049
if we exchange one dollars and for 1
Euro send

468
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:42,570
because at the rounding you yes you will
get one euro cent

469
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,470
you sorry will not work

470
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:52,389
method sorry

471
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:59,389
now no the rounding is specified by
European Union

472
00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:06,980
yes they do my bank doubts

473
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,130
my bank us

474
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:13,330
I tested it works sorry

475
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:20,330
okay

476
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:37,170
there

477
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:46,230
are you have a bad bank because all the
banks

478
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:51,970
i've seen are doing their own thing like
this okay let's talk about it later so

479
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,940
let me just see what you can do with
this and we'll take a look at your bank

480
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,380
later

481
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:01,380
it's funny that this has been known

482
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,630
for a decade there's even a paper out
there with the URL

483
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:08,970
here guys were writing about this they
were

484
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:12,510
thinking about ways to counter this
problem and has been known for a long

485
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,690
time and still

486
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:17,390
many banks allowed to do that accept his
back

487
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:21,490
so what would be the the algorithm the
to use

488
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:24,900
you start for with 100 euros for example

489
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:29,280
and you and exchange that two dollars so
you get 126 points

490
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,379
forty dollars and then you make a loop

491
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,640
you repeat 13640 times

492
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,590
convert that once and are sent to one
your sanity and you get thirty six point

493
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,430
for neuro

494
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:44,890
of profit and go to one

495
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:49,720
so you do it as long as they let you now

496
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,760
how fast can you get rich doing that

497
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,760
if we assume tax changes per second

498
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,550
because the that they can pick some some
throttling on the server side

499
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:02,580
which prevented from doing it too fast
to have to

500
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,760
join with your friends to you all do it
at the same time

501
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,930
you can have a about the profit of the

502
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:14,230
over 2,000 euros and a nice monthly
profit which lets you leave your job

503
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:14,930
immediately

504
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:18,470
but you you probably your bank will
probably notice it

505
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:22,560
and we'll do something about it so we'll
have to pop banks and eventually no bank

506
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,040
will be

507
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:27,389
doing this anymore so what can be
improved here

508
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:30,440
Khoza doing this for a month

509
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,520
by takes a long time into probably
someone will notice that something's

510
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,160
happening

511
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,100
and whoever is is in charge of your
account in Bank

512
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,270
they will see that you have hundreds of
thousands of transactions

513
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:45,400
it could trigger some some suspicion

514
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,550
but if you want to optimize this

515
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:51,680
you should have because %uh the rounding
you should get as close

516
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,600
as possible to 0.005 because that's
where the rounding

517
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,010
provides the biggest difference but
remember that

518
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:02,650
you and less than one cent in each
transaction since

519
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:06,100
really low-profit in corporate banking

520
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:11,460
banks are making it easier for you well
of course companies can do that as well

521
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:14,540
banks make it easier for you because you
can you can use

522
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:18,780
the the provide an option for you too 22

523
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:24,050
a package the requests in sing the
Pakistan sign goes back to send us back

524
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:24,800
to the bank

525
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,010
22 you can do more offline

526
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:31,010
and just sending as a single packet to
the bank

527
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:34,390
and yeah it works on my personal bank

528
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:38,980
and also our corporate bank allows us to
do that we just

529
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:42,700
stole once and so yeah and i think im

530
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:48,130
take their mind but the color measure is
really simple

531
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:51,650
and that's what we tell our customers
just don't let users

532
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:55,210
exchange less than one whole unit up the
larger currency

533
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:59,170
so if if you prevent making exchanges

534
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,970
of less than one euro for instance all
this goes away

535
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:07,200
because every everything you learned
with surrounding their

536
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,320
you lose with the with a different
exchange rates

537
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,659
the buy and sell exchange rates so use
everything back

538
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:20,660
this is very simple kinda mention
question no

539
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:28,879
at

540
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,940
yeah exactly but it but if in this
attack actual you call requires you to

541
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,270
to make exchanged another country come
come currency

542
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:40,540
and then back right and and you have
different exchange rates

543
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:44,129
for differ from for and you use
everything

544
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:47,620
everything you earn you lose when you
exchange

545
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:50,940
back because they have a quite a
difference between seller and buyer 8

546
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:57,940
yeah

547
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,739
me

548
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:20,630
no it doesn't but we can we can do the
math later

549
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:24,750
okay no getting away with it

550
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:28,320
would you want to

551
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,190
why should we even care

552
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:36,360
for not actual bank robbers question
even learn about

553
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,490
getting away with it well we shouldn't

554
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:43,500
we should learn much about it because we
don't need that kind of

555
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,230
knowledge but we should Noah at least a
bit about it because

556
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:51,460
I when you're talking to a bank and you
show them their phone abilities

557
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,070
at some point some guy would tell you
that you have a key you can get away

558
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,250
with it can swim

559
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,860
we would someone catch you to need you
to have an answer to that

560
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:04,540
because if the conversation stops that
point it may even need to do to their

561
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:08,080
wrong for understanding that the
vulnerabilities that they have

562
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,610
don't really matter so you want me you
want to make sure that they fix those

563
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,320
wanna birdies

564
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,340
in if in order to do that they have to
believe that someone

565
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,170
could actually exploit them so

566
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:23,560
first thing to do the attacker would
have to avoid detection

567
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,660
when when he wants to attack a bank you
first has to find

568
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,940
some vulnerabilities in backpack and in
the process of finding these

569
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,960
vulnerabilities

570
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,820
she would create some noise and he might
get noticed

571
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:40,730
and to access most of the box that be

572
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:44,360
that be covered here the attacker would
have to actually

573
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:48,100
login to the bank first aren't you want
to log into the

574
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:52,110
to to the bank to clear the bank account
you would have to have one

575
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:55,430
so it means you had to come to the bank

576
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:59,080
present your ID which means that you can
be traced back

577
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:03,230
if they notice that user 123 374 is
doing something funny

578
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:07,400
like looks like cross-site scripting or
buffer overflow exploitation

579
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,340
and let's send someone from the police
to their home and see what they're doing

580
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,830
so the attacker would have to

581
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:19,279
height behind someone and we call this
user in the middle

582
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,920
its like men in the middle brother
middle detectors using the same

583
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,530
technique

584
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:25,730
user in the middle he hacks

585
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:29,260
some legitimate user's account and does

586
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,580
all the hacking through that account

587
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:39,580
no it's not a new concept but it's a way
to hide the attacker's identity

588
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:43,330
now the most important thing that is not
specific to

589
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:46,640
to hacking banks directly the the

590
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,390
I'm criminals that are now stealing
money from users in corporations

591
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:53,930
are already having this problem and
solving its really well

592
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:58,069
is hard to break the money trail so as
long as you can transfer money from one

593
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,120
bank to another

594
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:02,740
but it still traceable it still digital
money still in the system

595
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:06,630
so their goal is to extracted from the

596
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:10,190
from the this digital banking system and
they were the

597
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:13,410
their employing money mules you're
probably getting emails like this all

598
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:13,980
the time

599
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:17,870
trying to recruit you they give you 10
percent of the proceeds

600
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:21,130
if you just cashing some checks or a few

601
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:25,570
a receive some money in your account
then withdraw the cash

602
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:31,170
and give it to someone so this is really
classic

603
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:36,570
but also digital money in all sorts that
exists today

604
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:40,350
can be used to to cover your tracks

605
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:44,110
right and the this is what the attackers
are doing today and and they were

606
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:48,680
continue doing your and one thing that
we haven't seen

607
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,799
yet or haven't read it yet about but can

608
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,050
possibly happen in the future is
changing

609
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:58,440
the users in the middle so went with
someone when the attacker

610
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,650
steal some money from the bank he

611
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:06,430
transfer that money not to his own
account but to someone else's account

612
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:09,480
which has or already been hacked

613
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,910
in another country and from that account
yet another

614
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:16,560
hacked account to another country so
this means that he's buying a lot of

615
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,170
time

616
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,340
to actually extracted money from the
system

617
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,380
before the police comes

618
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,720
now the perfect crime would be to

619
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,480
create new money so that nobody loses
anything

620
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,570
if you steal money from the user

621
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:37,920
the user will eventually noticed that
and

622
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,970
he was say alright the bank someone took
my money

623
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:46,450
take a look into this but we've seen
cases where money can be actually

624
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,210
created

625
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:51,880
other nothing its less likely that
someone would notice that

626
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,850
because no one has lost anything the one
with Wil complaints was just new money

627
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:00,549
and this can be done either by I'm with

628
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:04,100
types of attacks that I described before
or

629
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:08,380
if you remember for slight in the future
future 2.0

630
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:14,250
there's the in the back and d/b/a for
instance database admin

631
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:18,380
can actually do that today he has all
the access

632
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:22,590
to change numbers in the database

633
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:27,610
not in a transsexual away intersection
away but in a way that creates new money

634
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:30,680
so this can be really hard to track if
he knows what he's doing and he knows

635
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,450
what the

636
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:34,490
forty controls are for

637
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:38,060
validation controls and Senate checks
are in the bank

638
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:42,680
he can actually create new money without
anyone ever noticing

639
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,839
now the attackers best friend this this
is what we hear all the time

640
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,950
and and probably some you are thinking
to right now

641
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:52,330
now this would not work on my system
because of this and that reason

642
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:55,590
and it probably wouldn't not not
everything would work

643
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:58,870
on every system obviously but for a for
a bank

644
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:02,380
it's really critical if anything works
anywhere

645
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,630
in their system and that is why testing
is

646
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:08,630
better than believing

647
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:12,330
now for the attacker it's very good that
banks are adopting new technologies

648
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:15,740
are trying to automate more and more
processes

649
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:20,090
so we've seen automated deposits and the
new threats that they bring

650
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:24,160
we will see automated small loans in the
future that's for sure

651
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,480
because right now the bank banks don't
want to automate loans because they have

652
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,350
these complex procedures in the
background the 12

653
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:35,759
they want to see whether you're worthy

654
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,920
to get along but for small loans there
was start doing that at some point and

655
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,690
11 bank starts doing that

656
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:45,270
the other others to follow quickly and
this will just expand

657
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:48,330
the attack surface

658
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:51,610
many banks also love you too trading
stocks

659
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:54,790
now think about it can you actually buy

660
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:58,060
-300 Apple shares

661
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:02,320
does makes them does make sense to to
human but to computer this is just a

662
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,720
number

663
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:08,880
so it is just a number many interesting
things can happen

664
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,180
thank you this was all I had for you I
hope you will behave well

665
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,690
please don't if you use this Don't Tell
anyone you heard it from me
