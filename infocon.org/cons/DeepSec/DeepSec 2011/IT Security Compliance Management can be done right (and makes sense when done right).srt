1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,780
thanks and hello and thank you for

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,070
talk and

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,300
we'll talk a little bit about IT
security compliance

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,850
Aurion about complaints management and

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:22,390
what's possible to do there in 10

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,890
mostly how to do it right because Sam
money

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,060
see what I don't like about how it's
done

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,190
usual an a little bit about me

9
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:38,390
canonization reason am emerging as an IT
security office in a Swiss financial

10
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:39,030
institute

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,330
am and here

12
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,239
I'd like to impostor and and I think am
at like 2am

13
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,769
help part in making things more secure
p.m.

14
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:55,320
the agenda of my speech

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,000
first I like overturned the problems
receives a complaint management and I am

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,080
willem introduce some in solving
strategies how we do it

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,479
am how I think it should be done am few
solutions

18
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,610
and what could be done as well if there
would be some more resources to it

19
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:19,300
empties the trust issue

20
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,300
hurts about a multi-nation why I'm doing
this talk when I'm doing and compliance

21
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,420
management at all

22
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,159
am

23
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:29,870
I think and

24
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:35,080
we should do sing sing doing my daytime
having

25
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,860
quite many things to do and I'm not
having that much time

26
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,240
and tooling around exacting

27
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,310
dunno make things smart complicated
Standish

28
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,229
p cell my main motivation is still

29
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:57,229
to you to move to: loans to make things
simple but let's say that I think to DM

30
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:06,580
problems with complaints management
problem number one for me is

31
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,489
the amount of controls which means am

32
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:14,790
you have that asset owner art at
custodian

33
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,640
anti has to follow him some controls and

34
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,290
usually it's my experience

35
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,329
acetone this don't really know what to
have to do

36
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,570
to run to the peace and security office
and ask him or her

37
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,450
am so it's a usually just saying

38
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,410
too much for them and

39
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,690
director also I am more questions like
cam

40
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,400
controls are written in authority
documents

41
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,209
and link authority documents means an
authorised document is a document which

42
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:50,390
contends controls

43
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,850
which tell you what to do so um

44
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,220
their very many authority documents

45
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:02,150
and usually you don't know which ones
are elements for you and usually

46
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,720
from you don't know which ones a
relevant

47
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,930
your current situation usually and you
don't know how

48
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,650
these controls text you in your current
environment or your company

49
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,650
and usually these a change

50
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,930
and you don't really get it meant a
change and so

51
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,290
who lack behind version 2 or whatever so

52
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:31,290
am it's just too much the second problem
I see is sent disorder and you have T's

53
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:38,320
many an authority documents you have
these controls

54
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,220
unsteady sometimes a.m.

55
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,340
have some insert them some overlaps you
have some controls

56
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,470
which new lease in the same don't really

57
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,340
and which from

58
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,400
home completely state different things
am

59
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,840
and and again you don't really know

60
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,410
what does this mean for my environment
what does this mean for my assets I do

61
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:04,820
have

62
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,090
if you know what assets you have am

63
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:12,630
to access to a two tier companies which
don't even have a network maps i'll

64
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,738
not that I'm surprised but it's all a
sense surprising to hear it that it's

65
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:17,470
really true

66
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,150
am there's also the question

67
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,770
if you know what assets you have was
responsible for him within its

68
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,219
networks can usually see me with which
machine to have

69
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,270
not was responsible for them am

70
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,549
song disorders about them

71
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,729
you have his controls have your assets
but you don't really know

72
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:44,570
home this matches together den Akker
authority document changes the version

73
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:49,070
to controls change you have some
overlaps you do his thing Streisand you

74
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,750
don't really a recognized that you do it
twice

75
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,419
and you need an internal document
management system area

76
00:04:55,419 --> 00:05:00,490
tracks T-cell sorry to documents
essentially sector am

77
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,280
yet usually this means that there's just
one guy

78
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,600
and traction just that stuff and we
don't

79
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,169
at least the company I work for we don't
really have time

80
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:15,210
to to have one person only doing that

81
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:19,030
and one of the big problems is

82
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,050
complaints isn't call am

83
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:28,020
that's at least what school boys say you
probably am

84
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:34,030
seen am from receipt that

85
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:38,970
film and idk I SM sitting on a motorbike
chance 10

86
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,130
I am his footing altered 11 wrong

87
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,920
the cost that's what's making him secure
song supports

88
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,680
check TSN helmet and stuff and 10 is
sitting on ter

89
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,080
on the bike and says went okay
non-secure

90
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,880
about them what's to a really needs to
wear and that TNT's only wearing

91
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,750
as you see on the right side a helmet
and sunglasses and some shorts

92
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,770
so I the what they say is some

93
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,789
for what it is few modern movie says is
and

94
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:14,830
right thing is compliance selecting
security and compliance isn't really

95
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,800
what you usually wear on a motorbike
accept American I guess

96
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,240
but them over here usually wear to the
left

97
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,080
am thing and term

98
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,300
what they really think this AM many are
laughing about this

99
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,680
posed to say movie but today

100
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,250
day actually missed the point am

101
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:42,080
of course her complaints management from

102
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,000
you can do compliance management just
assets written in the book

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,020
just to X weiss et whatever

104
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,080
and don't even think about it just do it
am

105
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,349
many companies do it like that to your
arm

106
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,810
PCI complained company sandwich cracked
so long

107
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,000
complaints doesn't really help you there
am

108
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,070
but I think compliance management should
be about more tensions

109
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,909
for long-term to let us in in the book
signed authority documents

110
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,100
and to complaints management correctly
you should know

111
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:19,810
I'm what's your company about and my
heart a speech recently I which sent

112
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,190
you should know I am if you don't know

113
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,410
potsdam and houses home

114
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:31,460
TM mmm aunt

115
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,980
descends which states with two companies

116
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,130
just don't get it right now so if you
don't know

117
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,450
the descendants of your company you
don't really know what your company

118
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,360
about

119
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,260
ed don't really think that's true but at
least you should know

120
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,500
what does your company what's important
for your company which

121
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,220
assets are really important for your
company and

122
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,850
what issuer environment about what this
is company about

123
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:03,600
am as a sippy for what tests do you have
why do you have them

124
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,630
perhaps you have them but you don't
really need them and damn

125
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:13,020
much more important to him how to play
210

126
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,360
and term the problem number forests

127
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,210
at least a and that'll stand the flaming
am

128
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,419
a slight edge just recently am

129
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:26,580
promised have many missed the point

130
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,599
if you look at literature and white
papers

131
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,820
and all the documents sources am

132
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,130
nothing much has changed in the last few
years if at all

133
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,770
and you you do it

134
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,360
you take TL source documents it would
like

135
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,880
like state's deer but don't really think
about

136
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,140
how you can I make it simpler you could
make it

137
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,340
so that your company really kind profit
from this

138
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,520
and term

139
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,069
reset their

140
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:04,270
and thought about this and noticed that
its actually at time to change

141
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:07,460
and we started the project which is
thought

142
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,660
okay didn't we have some kind of thing

143
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,060
organization American put in everything
we do

144
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,230
and and when I say we am

145
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:23,790
this mean saying so my so make this an
open source project in which

146
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,829
mean said security offices management
and analyze this project

147
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,840
and we started dis because the

148
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:36,230
merged from and not only worked as you
suspend all system a locksmith tools

149
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,370
which to risk and compliance management
and it just noticed

150
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:44,730
am without naming names but this German
pro text image

151
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,400
Mary model your whole environment and
everything and

152
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,560
a.m. you weren't that happy 50 stores

153
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:57,060
and so we thought okay am we start our
own project and try to work from

154
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:03,040
on that topic two main goals

155
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,800
we had when he started DM

156
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,380
two-goal one was me didn't want to
reinvent the wheel

157
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,390
so we want to just focused on what has
to be changed

158
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,560
and leave everything else and dong the

159
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,280
reinvent any software which is already
there just am

160
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:29,280
as I mentioned in the beginning keep it
simple which is also

161
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,000
to call to simple simple simple

162
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,130
make it easy to use make it easy to add
to follow make it

163
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:44,230
less complicated still man action et
cetera and

164
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,040
very important am you want to make

165
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,589
and you want to think outside of the box
so we didn't really am

166
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:56,510
follow-up of which are were already
unlocked

167
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,150
the authors we want to 2m try to find

168
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:03,500
somehow some way around stand

169
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,070
two main parts: and

170
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,080
and are approached if you strong

171
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,890
and we had a few strategies and

172
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:18,949
let's talk about titties few strategies
am

173
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:24,910
renew at right software because he
wanted to automate things we wanted to

174
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,930
take a weighted loads to work load from
from ourselves

175
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:32,280
and put into software so um

176
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,449
firstly I thought about a data model

177
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:41,040
and it was Sen right at the beginning it
was quite clear that we had to work with

178
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,089
aggregation

179
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:46,270
or am you could also college Teek Shin
and

180
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,819
am if you look at this a slight sheen

181
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:55,330
on the top you have t say is a trust
stamp stick with the many

182
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:00,260
many else are many more am you see Decem

183
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,470
authority documents like I so 27,000
cope it

184
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,170
PCI DSS and of teas content controls

185
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,750
and what you wanted to do is am

186
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,490
take these controls and just aggregate
them so TN to have some aggregated

187
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,240
controls

188
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,720
as I mentioned before no complicates

189
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,350
and to do so am

190
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,680
there are quite a few strategies or am

191
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,080
wastes do so and at the beginning

192
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,590
we thought it's much more easy and it
once

193
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,980
at the end but let's first talk about it

194
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:45,980
strategies if the FTC catalogs at the
beginning

195
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,660
you see that's directed p.m. at double
naming spurts

196
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,610
for said she was if you have catalogs
which don't have

197
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,660
any double many and doubles and

198
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:02,000
just removed the suffocates and at the
end you have an aggregate to catalog

199
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,440
that's the easiest way but unfortunately
it doesn't work all of the time

200
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,550
because to cut the locks initially have
some

201
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:14,030
sections so um did the second strategy
was

202
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:17,050
you take a massacre at a low and then
you just

203
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,730
that's the stuff you which is not
already in there

204
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:26,140
Monday 28th in aggregate catalog

205
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:30,350
unfortunately this doesn't work that
straight to swell

206
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,550
because some

207
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,620
there's some waiting at and his
catalogue some catalogs have

208
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,950
controls which is stronger time now

209
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:47,000
other controls from other catalogs which
means am

210
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,310
if you look into a PCI DSS it states
that what you need to

211
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,430
to law example and I so doesn't state

212
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,950
what xx you have to look so you have to
you have to look up to descend waiting

213
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:00,030
since I'll

214
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:03,140
that the next threat to Chi a.m. came to
mind

215
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:08,160
which mmm still waiting strategy so take
that capital

216
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,890
on these catalogues you remove
duplicates you to a team which control

217
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:16,060
is stronger than the other ones who take
the strongest

218
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,440
and at the end you have an aggregate
cattle am

219
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,450
friend of mine did this for seed
catalogues

220
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:28,680
am yet quite some time to do so

221
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,880
and problem is for release it's doesn't
scare me

222
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,360
which means if you're 4567 catalogs and
a half into sections

223
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,870
and doesn't really work so um

224
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,330
or well it does work but this repeater
attend

225
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:51,770
am so they say luckily

226
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,730
set even a new strategy you trying to
Copan

227
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,790
company which dusty segregation and

228
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,329
them it's called unified compliance
framework

229
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:07,530
and dating nothing else than them the
just take an authority documents

230
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:11,410
a.m. do that aggregation order to adapt

231
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,699
mapping stuff and act against a half
their aggregate capital come to sell it

232
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,290
am the thing dairies am

233
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,459
to have about three or four hundred
authority documents

234
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,060
am that the real you're able to do it

235
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,260
22 bill to an aggregate catalog day
hacks to reinvent

236
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,730
their own so Dennis 410

237
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:40,530
first from catalog which contains all of
the other swish

238
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:45,180
cross-references but the cool thing is
you have to stress references so if you

239
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,020
follow their catalog

240
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,560
you have all and to controls aggregated

241
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,620
and Steve appliqued as he would like it

242
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,360
but am first he thought okay that could
work

243
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,430
we could just fight at catalog from UCF

244
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:03,950
and to import it into our tool and just
use it as it is

245
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:07,290
and unfortunately you even need

246
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,860
there's some handler XO am at the end
you need to know

247
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,950
what are you doing which of these
controls really relevant for you

248
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,980
and how do you Mack bids to to your
controls

249
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,190
century and dad to first of all if you
have some internal catalogs

250
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,330
or authority documents and they're not
in there

251
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:30,290
course selling one of our stretches

252
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:35,260
lost to just throw internal months out
and only use external months because

253
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,370
then now we don't have to track too many
margin to anyone's

254
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,410
or two map them or him

255
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,709
am yeah and yousef's this really cool
info to

256
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:51,950
doing too much commercial for them and
to have them

257
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,930
defunct the Sephora descent there are
also European ones

258
00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:00,660
even they are american company and damn

259
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,709
am to have to you CA all the things
indira catalog will

260
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:09,810
with TUF to which I will come back later

261
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:14,629
so our second strategy am hmm was
self-assessments

262
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,800
DM he thought about

263
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,760
am we had to to to to look

264
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,060
after de a complaints level of our
company and damn

265
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:30,168
strategy 1 who lost them doing
interviews

266
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:35,900
and literature literature normally says
two interviews go to every acetone

267
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,340
or custodian and ask him about
compliance level of his

268
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,720
asset and we have about to 134

269
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,710
TM company over Jeff about 1:30 40m

270
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:54,080
assets this mean suppressants you will
usually have two hours of interview

271
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,600
and which makes about them two hundred
dollars of

272
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,080
into use on interviews you didn't

273
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,460
you haven't stung and %um

274
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,980
you haven't worked on today on the
results you to didn't do any am

275
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:13,040
reporting on it it it's just launched
our spot

276
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:18,010
interviews which isn't really solution
which wasn't really a solution for us

277
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:22,120
so self-assessment even beanie in you
are we still know

278
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,580
that self-assessments aren't that

279
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,000
am perfect am

280
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,360
acetone is usually rates data suspended
and they are

281
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,150
to if you know it it doesn't really and
mentoring

282
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,300
song week again and when the same you
again

283
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,370
and which song op we looked again at mmm

284
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,810
our data model we had already and he
said okay

285
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:53,260
soviets audit questions and assets to
the model we already have

286
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:59,390
ants TM the all the questions are just
want one mappings to control so every

287
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,250
control has

288
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,580
has a question to it and likes to you
all

289
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,689
example or do you write locks and

290
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:11,060
and the also mapped decontrol Strasse
sets which means

291
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,340
and if you take yes its web server you
can

292
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:17,740
mister with simply create lookup which
controls

293
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,230
relevant for that asset so an asset
owner

294
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:25,560
only sees his relevant questions

295
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,750
and that the last time we did
self-assessments disorder about 30

296
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,580
questions for insisting on

297
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:35,260
such a forty questions instead of having
120

298
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,000
3110 which reduces timing

299
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,510
packed that sector strategy

300
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:47,780
a is to meta data model

301
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:51,460
solamente and a.m. its debt

302
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:55,560
model which is cell I was you

303
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,480
and desert actually to separate them

304
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,470
like sector something the upper one is
called the Model T A

305
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:06,560
lower one is called instance

306
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,110
and that the modern party or two

307
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,100
miss this actually like you know it from

308
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,299
developing the up to one is to class to
lower one st instance

309
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:19,840
am saw

310
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,918
DD opera one put p.m. she axed from
amongst

311
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,480
different companies wants to lower one
is said

312
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,799
contains today tough from UN Women
environment

313
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,789
which usually 12 cheap safe and not
change anyone's

314
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:39,820
at let's look at st. says several and

315
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:45,239
objects oh dear that standard object
different object effective date is

316
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:48,169
stated to stop we already had talked
about before

317
00:20:48,169 --> 00:20:51,619
and let's just say hola an authority
documents

318
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:55,309
and controls in there I was dotted
questions

319
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:58,928
and what you call the assets template
and in assets templates actually

320
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:02,690
just the model of a nascent like Wexham
it doesn't say

321
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,869
which one but it says Linzer and on the
instance part

322
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:10,730
we have to assessment and complaints
contain stand

323
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,429
the answers to the questions and and at
the end

324
00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:19,509
on the right side this innocent yes it
is too real instances its

325
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:22,929
thats web server found there be launched
a compartment

326
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:26,409
mary had am Daniels

327
00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:30,419
also mapped the subject controls and
stuff just to make sure to tell you know

328
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:31,549
who said I am

329
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:35,190
was the acetone and and who has to fill
out St

330
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:39,999
assessment this entry and what we also
have his invention because he said okay

331
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:44,070
am usually a company has an asset
management system in place

332
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:47,658
and we don't want to remodel a tear like
you mister chairman

333
00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:51,129
softer mentioned before and let's use

334
00:21:51,129 --> 00:21:54,570
what's already there just import it into
our tool and

335
00:21:54,570 --> 00:22:00,359
them use it from there them

336
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:04,960
what you then thought the world

337
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,989
lost that their actually

338
00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:11,960
if you have to state the model more tats
metamodel you could use it for

339
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,859
on things as well and the first thing
which came into mind while Sam

340
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:22,499
risk assessment let's look up

341
00:22:22,499 --> 00:22:26,429
again at that the model we have this
time a little bit

342
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:29,840
with some changes in it on her

343
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,970
up left side again you see objective
safeguard

344
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:38,649
am or objective at least and removed the
other it aids

345
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:42,169
and want to add it was just a threat
safeguard

346
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:45,539
the scenario and back in an ass a
template which means

347
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:48,730
an ass a template and a threat to get it
gives you an REO

348
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,059
and attacks in RFC if you want so

349
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:55,928
and damn every object if has some
safeguards

350
00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:00,419
and if you map this together and and to
you and to some

351
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:04,909
and the fishbone and used it to table
some

352
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:08,690
on the lower side and futures clock come
to your am

353
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,919
miscalculations on your assets wish to
controls

354
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,019
already know am you can nap safeguards

355
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:18,690
cetron you have which the same or nearly
the same data model

356
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,779
you can do some quite nifty risks

357
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:26,499
which is also great because some

358
00:23:26,499 --> 00:23:30,570
that informations you have from the risk
assessment you can reuse on the

359
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:31,600
self-assessment

360
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,820
am and data model is a field so that you
can am

361
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,139
from to some history

362
00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:43,669
locate to lost assessments and do some

363
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:47,039
comparisons to to see if tape can better
are immersed

364
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,990
have used to complain slim and but you
also said

365
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,039
is Sam he wants to any

366
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:58,859
we don't want to do any silly
calculations and if you say and no silly

367
00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:00,369
calculations I mean

368
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:05,009
am there some tools which two percent is
and percentages for am

369
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:08,220
2m track to am

370
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,159
to any situation of controls I'm not
sure but

371
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,230
and don't know what it means i lock 50
percent

372
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,639
I really have no idea what this means

373
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:21,940
so what he said is okay am either you

374
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,580
do the locking you plan to do it re: you
don't

375
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,740
anything else doesn't really matter if
you have

376
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,419
30 percent a few long or 40 I don't
really care

377
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:36,429
if you have injury you don't and if you
don't you know complaint and

378
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:41,039
that song am we don't do anything

379
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,629
on that so-called best practice and

380
00:24:44,629 --> 00:24:48,559
orkut practice well was practice okay
not best practice

381
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,809
am usually best practices something
which if you guys can together and wrote

382
00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:53,450
it down

383
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,820
am me think km it could make sense

384
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,759
somewhere but usually not enough your
environment or your company

385
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:04,669
because day don't know your company day
don't know what to do

386
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:09,009
and want to compensate thought so you
can take this practice

387
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:12,409
but then you have to adapt it to the
company

388
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:16,619
song one of our goals and strategies
system not

389
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:21,299
do anything on best practice and what
your city and wanted to do was say

390
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:23,710
anything and matching

391
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,809
just am

392
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:31,059
like I said fifties miscalculations
magic for me is Sam

393
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:34,389
my am mmm

394
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:37,799
my risk factor is five and I have a5

395
00:25:37,799 --> 00:25:40,899
Picasa account to twice one and a half
or something

396
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:44,119
twice 20 of am

397
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:48,169
what does this really mean have no idea
and

398
00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:51,289
you say the likelihood is to and

399
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:54,330
d impact is the three okay

400
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:58,769
but you don't really know what this
means and if somebody else does it

401
00:25:58,769 --> 00:26:03,109
probably has the likelihood of one and
you don't really know

402
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:07,529
less difference am

403
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:11,139
so I'm we played around or I play their
own to share

404
00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:15,230
we share that aspect agent landry from
mine to where you have to like to see

405
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:15,609
the

406
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:19,080
yes a system you have some factors which
I am NOT

407
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,330
based on numbers and so you really do
trite

408
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,658
to things result matching and

409
00:26:25,659 --> 00:26:29,409
and SA actually a at complaints
management tool which has a solitary

410
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:30,779
came in it

411
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:34,440
we think it's okay solitaire game I
liked

412
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,669
attack my phone but they don't really
like

413
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:41,509
to have it in my complaints to because I
don't really

414
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:44,539
needs to do so solitaire and

415
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:47,950
travnik with two solitary could do to
risk calculations

416
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:52,179
if I win its to it's a long season 1i
something

417
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:55,779
any am

418
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:59,399
what they talked about this things the
currently do

419
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:04,159
which p.m. its for the company I I work
for

420
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:09,919
that financial institute which am be
used since the you status December we

421
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,159
will use its

422
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:14,960
the fourth time and them I'm taking to

423
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,549
did know how from there and trying to
apply it somehow

424
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:22,190
or to refinance 222 so much so it's not

425
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:25,470
something the I just invented cheering
to presenting here

426
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,499
three something some guys and lurching
on

427
00:27:28,499 --> 00:27:33,539
and already used am

428
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:37,429
drum where we are and where we want to
go to

429
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:40,570
as a set before I want to make things
simple

430
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:45,559
and one of the and the things which week
what makes increase

431
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:48,730
a self-assessment this actually
answering something

432
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:52,649
most of the cases you know the answer
already are you putting know the answer

433
00:27:52,649 --> 00:27:53,960
already

434
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,279
am abroad appear at metrics

435
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,659
that the screenshot half here he said
from

436
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:04,769
metric center dot net an

437
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:08,909
what they do there is they had fair on
the left side to have his authority

438
00:28:08,909 --> 00:28:11,249
documents were some authority documents

439
00:28:11,249 --> 00:28:15,210
and for some of the controls they Hashim

440
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:18,409
metrics Indian so we don't really have
to reinvent the wheel

441
00:28:18,409 --> 00:28:22,700
just and look in there and apply Tim to
to your environment

442
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:28,029
or ship first find out if it makes sense
to apply them

443
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:32,159
am that you can't act is stacked them

444
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,980
questions you ask on the assessment or
self-assessment

445
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:40,669
Qatar actually be on site already by a
clever metrics management system

446
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:44,419
or horn ORAC questions click the onset

447
00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:48,639
by metrics you already have one party
quote easily kept

448
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:51,669
and tell you idea behind that is to just
remove

449
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:56,509
even more weird from the acetone so they
don't have to answer things

450
00:28:56,509 --> 00:29:01,649
which actually what's cool about the UCF
I mentioned before is

451
00:29:01,649 --> 00:29:05,659
a half metrics and stay already mapped
these metrics

452
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:08,869
2 a.m. their controls and what's best of
it

453
00:29:08,869 --> 00:29:13,470
they also have some examples how 2m
represents those metrics

454
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:17,779
graphics so you don't even have to think
dear chance to play it

455
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:23,569
find out if it makes sense for you and
if it does take it over

456
00:29:23,569 --> 00:29:27,079
am this is one of fact that the ideas
you have and which

457
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:30,289
you would like to integrate in our tool

458
00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:36,960
some automated Demetric important what
im in often

459
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,700
and nothing we want to teach or we would
like to lattice

460
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,349
evidence and evidence is actually am

461
00:29:45,349 --> 00:29:49,289
something which DS adonis asked about

462
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:53,240
10 a.m. the field out the
self-assessment

463
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,349
and set mmm you would like to ask store
documents he would like to store

464
00:29:58,349 --> 00:30:03,569
references links whatever and am

465
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:06,740
at least fisheye so from

466
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:11,169
authority document its M

467
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:14,679
have peace a swell you are a client to

468
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:17,789
to proof that you did something so you
have to have

469
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:22,039
from like shit heartening at document

470
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:25,908
or whatever and am

471
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:29,799
they really like each am yes it owns
really would like

472
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:32,918
at least fast to to axe these documents
to

473
00:30:32,919 --> 00:30:36,079
at yet application somewhere

474
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:39,529
and the problem there is have equal to
actually build up

475
00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:44,659
and %um and document management system
or something and

476
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:48,210
link everything or we could just
outsource it to a tool which the state

477
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:52,700
much much more red and them

478
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,149
I'm not sure where to go there so if you
have an idea

479
00:30:56,149 --> 00:30:59,730
please come up later and tell me you're
a perfect idea

480
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:03,480
its am it make sense to store

481
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,859
actual snapshot documents to proof that
you did it

482
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:11,089
but it doesn't make sense to store it
intact

483
00:31:11,089 --> 00:31:13,389
from and that hat

484
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:17,190
told because it's not a document
management system

485
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:22,190
so um that would actually be

486
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,690
and the some help for TSA bonuses

487
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:30,250
well someday if the auditor to real
external auditor at comes to them and

488
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:33,460
asked them for improved that they had

489
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,820
stay am are complained to share control
X Y

490
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:40,408
and pictures can can for it Im

491
00:31:40,409 --> 00:31:43,429
her too tall and say its meeting how we
do it

492
00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:47,200
and to have everything ready to show TM

493
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,140
you wanted to text am

494
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,260
actually that's about it

495
00:31:55,260 --> 00:32:00,190
