1
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:08,620
hello everybody what comes up to me and
to never talk about

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,510
human factor of engineering for IT
security I'm

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,410
human-computer interaction researcher
IDC your what I will talk about to be

4
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,150
I will give you should keep in touch but
curators center for usability research

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,250
and engineering

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,480
we are located here in grandma I will
give

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,940
and introduction to usability in
relation to

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,529
IT security system the same so from my
point of you

9
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:36,320
pockets more involved than design
security systems

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,140
especially of course design of graphical
user interfaces

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,640
for security systems are I knew

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,730
touchdown top government models because
this is a very important issue

13
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,520
for each day research and security

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,610
I will talk about user experience and
get some

15
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,850
example how to utilize it in the design

16
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,820
of anti security I would then go through
the challenges

17
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,000
me please from designing such systems
and

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,070
them I'm going to design the design
process

19
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,200
and hope I can show you how to take on
the challenges

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,710
we face and I once a month

21
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,880
some conclusions a kick your

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,990
the scent of usability research and
engineering I come from

23
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,798
is a non-profit resort organization
million spinoff of team isn't your

24
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,110
friend since nineteen

25
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,729
98 we have industrial consumption
popcorn

26
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:35,700
you scum internally be on Team oh well
25 people

27
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,080
up we are not technological deep and so
on team comes

28
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,229
from companies psychology social
sciences

29
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:45,770
and song the shy security team

30
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:51,250
you one direction arm oh and security we
are five people

31
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,930
and cure is very experienced and
national and international research

32
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:55,710
projects

33
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,170
where on one of the biggest record in
eight tomorrow

34
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,570
is you trusted project I will give you a
shot of you as a reference to project

35
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,220
leader Aung

36
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,459
in 73 yes project funded by the European
Commission

37
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,870
they've already on YouTube cure is to
coordinate I'm on the right side

38
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,550
you see or apartments there okie

39
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,610
usability arm

40
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,890
especially usability and nineties
security

41
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,480
we know the human behavior when it comes
to securing this instance

42
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,738
are candies some are kind very
demotivating for us

43
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,220
when you're looking for security this
picture only

44
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,140
shows long effect people invest a lot of
money in security technology

45
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,280
and and users just circumvent this is in
fact

46
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,260
are not the only reason my we want
usability for security assistance

47
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:51,879
because

48
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:54,959
I'll re in general do not only

49
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,860
want to avoid that we'd spend money on
technologies be brutal abuse

50
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,440
for example in the company boss 1-yard
company

51
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,510
which develops security systems we of
course

52
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,319
also want to invite damage we don't want
or the use of are

53
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:14,010
new super fire more products to call the
hotline every 10 minutes because Stacy

54
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,730
hastens iPod Obama nothing does work
anymore armed

55
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:22,760
what I'll its on about his

56
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,929
to maintain what went wrong holistic
security

57
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,780
security which includes the end user and
is not only limited

58
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,830
to the technology technological pop song

59
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,150
for IT security systems terry's

60
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,550
become the principle of arm
psychological acceptance

61
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,920
you can read it I want me to drop them
right

62
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,940
more in stone arm that

63
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,269
if you design your IT security systems

64
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:53,330
in a way that its I'm using uses I don't
want to use it

65
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,879
or we use it's the wrong way which Ben
of course

66
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,040
many of them no comments the security of
the system and

67
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,069
we noticed since 1975 for me

68
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:09,629
as you see in the reference there is a
very abstract definition

69
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:13,950
by the nicest and that month usability
is a baby

70
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,109
see it's the effectiveness efficiency
and satisfaction

71
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:20,839
Mitch specified uses achieved specified

72
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,559
goals unspecified context there

73
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:28,550
stunned the does not really talk about
the metal it's very abstract

74
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,759
and mean much really help are when you
are

75
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,559
designing eighty security systems but
not really help in concrete design

76
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:36,270
decisions

77
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,460
this is why I will make the break home
are this definition

78
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:44,198
in on usability principles now I will
give examples than

79
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:47,689
from perform I we give an insight in

80
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:52,020
to all our practical experience so
helping people reach this stand

81
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,279
sadly enough most people read it's the
first me

82
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:00,490
are H rights to do it with the fun
science tools see hall

83
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,689
people emphasize if this its Angie his
mom

84
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:07,029
of the usability principles over most of
the on us

85
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:10,259
especially through menopause who really

86
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,930
in the classic game program combining
tests

87
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,559
reengineer citing tends to maximize

88
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:21,509
efficiency or or other aspects because
it makes them

89
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:25,490
development work easier this is from
danger because

90
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,899
are me we will need to see that we have
a lot of principles

91
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:34,949
and it's not always the best to maximize
this

92
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:38,069
okie I will come up

93
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:41,169
with up twelve principles arm

94
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:44,479
this principles are wrong

95
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,818
they enable usability

96
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:52,050
the when both principals I will explain
outweighed

97
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,669
softwere you produce is our honeymoon
its

98
00:05:55,669 --> 00:06:00,659
efficient its effective and in
satisfying and fun to use

99
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:05,479
would be the best the first principle

100
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:10,339
consistency soul arm

101
00:06:10,339 --> 00:06:13,659
one example of consistency if you drive
a car

102
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:17,639
gonna messages for example and you
changed Porsche

103
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,210
Houston will be able to operate it be
cast user interface

104
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,529
elements are inconsistent even if the
the same

105
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:28,009
is very distinct arm

106
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:31,259
when it comes to the IT security two
main one positive example for this

107
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:32,960
consistency is

108
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,800
as far as I have seen that the lock for
a secure connections is consistently you

109
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,860
stole a different applications

110
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,909
so it's not the bath maine well one
application uses

111
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:47,259
lock to symbolize a secure connection
%uh

112
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:51,020
another application uses maybe a chain
for and

113
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:55,438
secure connection awesome this month
introduced inconsistency

114
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,619
Hans lower his ability and we want to
move

115
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:01,949
visibility

116
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:05,289
an extensive list feedback ask you

117
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:08,550
pain Hong are you today

118
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,610
ya and the system does not react because
the

119
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:15,869
makes me crazy because I don't get
feedback I as and use I do not know

120
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:19,830
did my ex she do something to the system
or not

121
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:23,959
very classic example is are Walmart
informer

122
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:28,219
times-mirror you have these mice
infected people who puts

123
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:32,089
with a click on the search button are
restart the search process

124
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:35,520
so they clicked on the search button no
feedback happened

125
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,318
they think nobody nothing happens in the
background big league again

126
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:46,319
and sold the book themselves and the
never-ending

127
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:51,279
arm I already have been talking about
the efficiency and principal

128
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,959
I which developers can to maximize and
General Orders principles

129
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:00,610
are have to be I'll a combined and
trade-offs

130
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,879
so you need to know who you are and you
since

131
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:07,879
and then you can see okay but this and
use a group I have to maximize

132
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:11,869
this on that principle for another and
as a group for Tampa if you

133
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:15,110
developed for your own community for
developers

134
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:19,789
then maybe rocky to boost the efficiency
printable

135
00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:23,209
is a very good idea if you want to

136
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:26,919
personal file more for the on and his of
the world

137
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:29,979
then maybe learnability which

138
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:35,218
be the thing to maximize and not
efficiency

139
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:39,159
an expensive ring flexibility

140
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,708
just succumb example from the security
two main are

141
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:46,839
flexibility could mean you build a
laptop and you provide to more than one

142
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:47,649
meaning

143
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:52,019
for authentication for example of my
laptop only has USB and

144
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:56,019
password and user ID authentication I
don't have as much

145
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:59,399
100 in their eye on settlement have
fingerprint reader in there

146
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:03,569
but such system looked at to the
principle of flexibility

147
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:06,680
as the user moves have more can one be

148
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,250
to accomplish the task authentication
and this is flexibility

149
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,990
and the small countries ability

150
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,329
arm all of the principles I'll

151
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:21,769
braided equally as I already sent and
some

152
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,170
of them I'm very discussion able and the
area of

153
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,529
IT security clearly marked exit

154
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:33,740
I'll aren't just means to not provide
stands for users just don't let them

155
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,220
drive

156
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,180
into one way streets up the me to come
back

157
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,860
if you imagine now are much to do with
me for example

158
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,680
and invalid certificate you want to use
them to have a long meeting because

159
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,860
members certificate is invalid

160
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,360
earned the user should maintain security
and not go to the site

161
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,480
so one could not discuss from a security
point of you

162
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,810
is providing the button you can or for
example

163
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,839
if this would be a good idea maybe it
would be a good idea from usability

164
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,579
standpoint but maybe it would not be
that good of an

165
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:07,769
and you from a security standpoint

166
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:11,189
but as the usability definition always
talks

167
00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:14,339
the ball also specified contexts

168
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:17,670
we have to look at the constant a
complex maybe in one context it is a

169
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,089
pain

170
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:24,509
to provides this in another context
maybe not

171
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:27,750
my home this principle is one bitch

172
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,360
I am would really keep an eye on run I
design

173
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,759
IT security systems why because
experience

174
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:38,930
have shown that this is one of the
greatest sources of problems

175
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,660
I will show an example a drum so I will
not talk reliable

176
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:47,100
few among the next principle his task
orientation

177
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,500
build system supports them past of deals

178
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,930
as far as I have seen in my private life

179
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,199
are my I don't and song

180
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:02,750
the never did Spec Ops I almost from
them back up your mate are

181
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,980
and of course they never do the tools
I'm not really

182
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,240
in premies I'll the I'm not task for
rent

183
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,579
but I know some people who do it own the

184
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:16,899
used time machine so security technology

185
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:21,050
can be sexy and that can be designed to
me that this very instant the gay and

186
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,189
very pleasing

187
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:27,389
and them people also like to use it

188
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:30,519
controlling means more the feeling of
control

189
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:33,759
so uses need to have to feeling

190
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,170
of control and sitting in front of the
machine if it's the other way around

191
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,310
then we have a big usability problem and
people I'll

192
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:48,310
likely to changed your system or 12
months you should be wary

193
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:52,149
recovery and forgive min forgiveness is
the expensive room

194
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:56,660
humans there so good Softail and good
general systems

195
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,829
my palms of France also happens long are

196
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:05,800
they a built-in the me that humans can
recover from a roster for

197
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,949
the next principal is minimize memory
notes which

198
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:12,040
can be born home tonight don't rely on
knowledge

199
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,480
in the users had too much it's not the
balding

200
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,850
authentication knowledge like a pen its
amount

201
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,100
Hall things wrong

202
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,660
and for example don't rely arm

203
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:31,730
the user having reps the 300-page many

204
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,149
and I'm our principal iight world

205
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:39,279
very similarly to running in uses
language keep the focus on

206
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,720
when designing at the security system
systems is transparency

207
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,999
the problem here is that the users have
to do security decisions

208
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:52,930
and in the best raised these are
informed just security decisions

209
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,430
so the system has to be in the range
from Spherion uses

210
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,910
half a chance to recognize

211
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,860
which decision the should take

212
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,860
last but not least every artifact humans

213
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,889
built have some statically and emotional
effect

214
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:14,769
if you want it or not so if you built
for example and

215
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:17,839
the rice min has the the statics of a
break

216
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,249
than people will have to use a
experience a that's just the brick

217
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:25,860
so you build and erase the has been very
sexy and sleek

218
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,889
are as tactic and emotional effect

219
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:34,180
rich crude be for example are boosted by
using expensive materials

220
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,100
I'll and song arming

221
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,569
sore arm this principle is everything
you build

222
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:45,480
if you build it is that the county in
but the positive emotion and effect

223
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,360
we'll have more success in terms of IT
security systems

224
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,279
it will be used better and be more
correct me

225
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,439
okay markets more example maybe you know
are

226
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:01,469
the CE need to know little security

227
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:05,620
technology arm

228
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,689
from a real Angeles point of you know

229
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:12,139
let's began talking about their on
pandisc the bar

230
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:16,740
so my own can is sitting in front of the
computer and some leads to connect to

231
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,360
the bpm Metro

232
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,490
but many she sees on such as being

233
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,350
she thinks modest Open VPN bomb

234
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,649
exit because she clicked on VPN
connections on them

235
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:34,699
is no explicit relationship I'll

236
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:38,550
by the way she does not even distinguish
much between an operating system and the

237
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,249
binary

238
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:44,209
but this is information Mitch confuses
her and does not hamper

239
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:47,339
and it goes on like this as has sent the
problem

240
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:51,850
in IT security systems is the its field
up with Varitek market

241
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:56,129
technologically are acronyms very
technologically speech

242
00:14:56,129 --> 00:15:01,129
and are there man on the street will
never ever have a chance to

243
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:04,889
are understand what is a destination IP

244
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:08,230
arm of taos this team so

245
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:12,579
maybe some users already have very nice
cue about problem domain names are

246
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:13,620
constructed

247
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:20,499
up most usual still do not get in
contact with be addressed

248
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:23,980
I have been talking about transparency
already some information

249
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,990
are is given here

250
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,180
which does awesome really help to end
user to make

251
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,680
on the final decision because the final
decision has to be should I click on the

252
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,600
law or denying

253
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,029
Morris

254
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:41,850
and other thing are as more issue is arm

255
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,640
if you provide such

256
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,439
checkbox and it's more or less mum

257
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,440
way he ask a ban users

258
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,180
of course only stopped how can I am
check indifferent to the game

259
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:59,040
I'll alderdice more questions popping up
in the heads of an end-user

260
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,469
are very small compared to the main long

261
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,180
1000 implying

262
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,390
when angling mom when I click mom

263
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,800
of the buttons song if you look at the
picture now

264
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,450
Howard era and lot of open questions in
the head of the end-user

265
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:20,770
me know the human brain

266
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,040
is designed to make sends all those
things

267
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,050
song man

268
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:30,910
man from the street passing is not even
to answer these questions

269
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:34,719
the human brain makes sense of the peace
it sees

270
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,340
so what importance song is the using the
fees just

271
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,060
tells me if you want to proceed clicking
all

272
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,460
if you also do not want to be bothered
in the future also

273
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,240
next to me to remember something so this
is more or less what the user sees

274
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,710
and this is what we should the point
because as you see

275
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:58,420
what we have reached his exactly the
opposite

276
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:03,780
of models to go there are some people
are having

277
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,879
the done some investigations arm

278
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:13,020
are this issue adjustable Regus more
example how things can get better also

279
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,010
this is a screenshot from my research
prototypes what happens here

280
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:20,609
I'm sorry it's always been chopped
animation would be better are

281
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:25,830
worked this guy is implemented is
instead of just having a pop-up

282
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:29,110
like amount tonight for a connection

283
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,600
arm the left are blue plain

284
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,230
is the best stop slipped in a 3d effects
recite

285
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,640
use made recognized but also means

286
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,540
and your mobile browser vendors because
they have connections to

287
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,720
are arm machines and Internet

288
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,970
so you see what's your computer you see
machines

289
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,140
mara other things are connected you get
more information about the machine

290
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,210
and this usually much are more clear
that

291
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,260
connections are happening where they are
happening and in fact

292
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,280
and what you do here is just our
drag-and-drop the cables

293
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,040
are I'm John and rectum from the
destination so you forbid

294
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,460
the connection still distant

295
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,130
does not a source for the problems
because he always have spectrum

296
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,410
processes running

297
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:19,690
this on the green boxes are below and
and you since

298
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:22,860
and the usability test interest on with
this problem by

299
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,390
the have not been really sure what this
game boxes & bins

300
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:30,790
are all about cast a half mo rocking
mental model

301
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:35,100
about background processes which brings
me already to the next topic

302
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:41,210
mental models what happens

303
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:44,370
when IT security systems Rd Saint

304
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:50,080
we have at the Royal Palm the developer
has a mental model of the implication

305
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,020
are here she wants to build here she
thinking in classes and functions

306
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,230
in database models on the opposite end
user

307
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,520
the end user has the end user's mental
model in the Hat

308
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,600
and this uses mental model is
constructed

309
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,820
by what we card system image way

310
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,919
because the rental car implements his
mental model

311
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,100
in the system the system has only the
graphic user interface

312
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,150
and an audio interface supports the

313
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,950
to the end-user to explain the mental
model of the developers

314
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:27,500
as he does not have a connection from
the hat off to develop into to head off

315
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:27,910
to use

316
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:31,150
which would be very convenient because
then if you use a month see

317
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:35,050
I'll this is my the developer named the
puppy

318
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:40,190
idem X coroner behind this is my
instrument should you be

319
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,540
s and my page to be and song

320
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:47,620
so the use of this thinking in past

321
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,030
and Goldstein feelings the user does not
thinkin security

322
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:57,120
so long what is

323
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,790
a mental model in concrete I again don't
read the whole definition but im porn

324
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,649
star and

325
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,880
mining humans see something the

326
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,840
build a mental model be costly have some
into a model of

327
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,379
Hall the world rocks why is this so
important

328
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,870
human-computer interaction and usability

329
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:22,530
engineers or receive when it comes to
you the design of user root systems

330
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:27,250
know we are and use our include your and
use that as the early as possible in the

331
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:27,870
project

332
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:32,140
but when it comes to the sign IT
security systems

333
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,850
I would extend its to not only

334
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,860
know your user I would extend into and
the Spaniards

335
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,840
wrong there is a marriage SAT

336
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,000
each day security people car are right
on the camping trip

337
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,100
meant appalled the

338
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,480
his ability of pgp 250

339
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,780
where it should be by 50 most on bill

340
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:01,420
on me I'll stamberg's the usability
design guidelines for graphical user

341
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,430
interface design

342
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:06,090
so on from a classically usability point
a few

343
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,340
this application %uh would have been
very good

344
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,580
but the usability tests have shown that
a

345
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,090
people did not understand the complex

346
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,510
mechanisms in the back from the did not
really understand

347
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:24,020
the gonna keep hearing and for example
the

348
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,110
were given a task up to sendawal

349
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,620
they are public keys and on opponents

350
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:35,950
I think don't beat me I remember forty
percent of them send up the private key

351
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:41,770
and so arm in fact the usability of the
implication was great but the

352
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,350
what was missing most understands the
mental model of the end-user

353
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:49,830
which is very important because you need
to know hope people thank the Lord is

354
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,490
rocking

355
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:53,679
that you can't assign an application
which

356
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,830
for Phils the principle of past
orientation and were given

357
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,570
shot example from cue else research

358
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,860
cure has been very active in the prime
Life Project

359
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:11,510
we'd come true privacy enhancing
technologies we wanted to know

360
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:15,100
I'll what is the mental model

361
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,470
of end users when it comes to how the
update on travels to the rep

362
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,140
what's did you do the task lost

363
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,429
you are sitting in random you are

364
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,570
opening your Facebook account and you

365
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:33,649
are typing in the message and

366
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:38,870
your friend in Paris region them

367
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:41,970
we gave our disposition guns the map

368
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:46,070
and sent okay your own sitting here

369
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,250
this is Paris now here's to Pam

370
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,380
draw for us how do you think then they

371
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,100
the is mongering drooling frankly
speaking

372
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,980
I took the most extreme example here
because this user

373
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,070
really sent oh yeah I use Microsoft so

374
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:08,050
microsoft knows everything and do some
it has to be the case that

375
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:13,120
from my computer maybe and this is not
the bed in former times who's at fault

376
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,600
are already called Google Reader have a
direct connection to grooming

377
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,420
Mitch would completely undermine every
explanation of a man in the middle

378
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,060
attack

379
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:26,030
as you see they already know that it's
not really direct from the Skye has mom

380
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:26,530
pop

381
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,720
in Spain or something okay it's an all
aluminum

382
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,780
dress up the thing and I think it's not
really that funny

383
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,830
is that hip-hop Microsoft with
everything and

384
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:43,720
this is also the conclusion from the
study meeting you need it

385
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,590
because most of the people small the
date that is some home stuff but he was

386
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,199
me

387
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,720
and just pick the Microsoft example
because it's the funnest Bob

388
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,040
I'll arm r6 having succumbed 6 of 10
people in our study

389
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,200
had some very similar idea of arm

390
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,060
the data is always some home rule dude
drilled a US

391
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:09,310
so arming

392
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:12,928
now we know I'll what

393
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:16,600
is their formation foreign security
decisions

394
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,050
when it comes onto they'd traveling
throughout

395
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:24,879
if you would my own want to enhance I am

396
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,510
IT security application maybe

397
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:31,730
its sorry maybe it's I'll

398
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:36,260
simply enough that maybe Michelle I S

399
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,440
some hold the traffic to me bring up the
Rams

400
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,580
that the deed done is not always going
through the US

401
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,760
the next comes up

402
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,660
rich is brought out the usability is
user experience

403
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,780
user experiences ahead and

404
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,660
property psychological concept where
it's imma

405
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,830
you money I'll lot of different factors
like primacy trust

406
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,909
fun but also his ability is a user
experience spectrum

407
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:09,830
I've been a long just

408
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:15,310
19 alt home two examples rarely use that
experience can be used in a positive

409
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:21,100
also negatively impact the security the
first example the positive long

410
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:26,070
is appalled authentication in this study

411
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:29,770
3 authentication tokens commemorated

412
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,980
okay once my path wrong

413
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,060
authentication poking and mom
authentication token

414
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:42,530
with some storage facility I picked

415
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:46,020
ok learnability and security in
direction

416
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,440
with the program growth since the
program

417
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,330
blast storage when you look at learn
ability

418
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:58,310
Missy of course tent about the little
bit more

419
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:01,440
technical complexity its for writing to
talk and

420
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,400
the storage arm Hindustan ability and
elements

421
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,580
up the interesting thing really is on
their

422
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,260
right side the security and direction

423
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:17,240
so from a technical point of view at the
program versus the token

424
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,250
with some storage is nearly identical

425
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:27,130
from the user experience point of you
what happened

426
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:30,159
then start the setup Moss tent a

427
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,460
different user groups got this
authentication

428
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:38,250
up towards for some time and then a few
are filled of the question

429
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:43,230
so one is arranging for born seven is a
meeting for excellent so

430
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:48,260
two points a difference in security
interaction is rather a good result

431
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:52,169
and this only because we have storage
and the background is

432
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:55,810
not that storage for itself is stepped
wrong

433
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:59,010
but what happened Boston during the
study

434
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:03,030
the study participants private material
on the storage

435
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:07,290
so this small piece of the rice Moss not
only growth

436
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:10,980
a token for authentication and it was
not only growth

437
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,120
ten megabytes of storage something it
most from

438
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,980
growth private phone calls and therefore
I

439
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,970
this user experience spectrum next to
the fact that stent opens branch

440
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:28,060
succeeded really great compared to the
aisle authentication mechanisms

441
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:31,139
some I think this is really a very good
example

442
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,179
on how to utilize user experience

443
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:38,659
for positive security

444
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:44,060
of parts this human behavior can also be
utilized for

445
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:48,389
militias attacks you might notice right
hepatectomy are you

446
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:52,470
extension the you loose prepared USB
sticks

447
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,360
are which I am prepared with militias
stuff

448
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,080
are the pictures I took technically

449
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,350
in both cases terrorist the same
militias

450
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,800
stuff in there from the outside we have
two devices

451
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,820
Murray different user experience

452
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,950
are you might not see arm

453
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:18,050
yeah it's are maybe

454
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:24,460
somebody hates hockey's so I'm want like
to use the USB stick because it looks

455
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:28,360
more standardized but if its the park at
the back

456
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,620
maybe have done some research to your
target and

457
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:37,250
then you might already see my you can
utilize the user experience factors also

458
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,040
for such attacks because

459
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,760
of parts hypothesis is that issue to the
back it back

460
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,810
with this Khaliq then it would be much
more are

461
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:50,240
the chance would be much more high have
to succeed than

462
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:57,169
when using the stand up to the USB
storage looking like she writes

463
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:00,590
so what are the challenges I N the same

464
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,929
one of the first very big challenges
that

465
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:07,350
armed security is not the primary task
fuels

466
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:10,690
no ordinary user goes home at 7o clock

467
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:14,700
in the evening and says hey what do i do
today evening islands to two hours of

468
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,480
family configuration

469
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,500
arm security is always a secondary das
because

470
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,220
and uses always having an apostle in
mind

471
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,380
and yes they want to

472
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:32,040
complete the task in a secure me but
they expected from the system that's the

473
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,290
I'm a pound so what some

474
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:39,560
the fact is is that use a focus on the
primary task

475
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,629
there for a might not solve the
secondary task of

476
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:48,280
usability d I you will be very likely to

477
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,060
seeking or Mr see if are connection

478
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:56,800
if this is the only shop mayor against
this my main runs

479
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,149
so I'm really good morning security task
here

480
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:06,310
and I'm appointees and are especially
when we look at your web 20

481
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:09,790
that the security concept and the
general concept

482
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:14,780
skip much much more complex as I already
said we only have two graphical user

483
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,610
interface

484
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:18,950
are primary to communicate

485
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,840
I'm the end user this is really am big
challenge

486
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,100
are imagine for example are

487
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,750
home blacks drain on C I'll stop Frank

488
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:34,560
anonymous credentials Mitch are not very

489
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,600
make this bread until now all but which
is a very complex concepts

490
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,429
concept and it will be very hard to
build applications

491
00:30:42,429 --> 00:30:46,899
which communicates this are complex
concept according

492
00:30:46,899 --> 00:30:50,940
I also have already been talking about
informed decisions and they are really

493
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,340
helps 280

494
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,800
because uses as we have seen very often

495
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,760
miss the ranking member models and
another problem is that graphic user

496
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,350
interface is often support the wrong man
for more like the lady on that

497
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:06,830
right side are it's a piece of people
making the dangerous

498
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:11,889
so this i cum does not reveal that in
actually could be a very dangerous piece

499
00:31:11,889 --> 00:31:13,639
of paper

500
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:18,960
and also for armed graphic user
interface elements are very often how to

501
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,090
interpret

502
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:24,790
as it already most of the time you do
Ameritech you do reading

503
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:29,330
on beyond the technique in running and
repeating it very often because

504
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:32,850
this is really one of the greatest
problems with the technical language

505
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:37,649
it's very hard to understand I

506
00:31:37,649 --> 00:31:41,830
the thing is also that the uses a
section of trust

507
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:47,260
we very often CL lack of transparency of
the underlying security properties

508
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:51,960
so users cannot really build up trust
and the security and solutions

509
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,570
so the solution for the immune system

510
00:31:55,570 --> 00:32:00,439
just do not use it

511
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,200
we have of course very big problem

512
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,330
because of the lack of possible
consequences

513
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:12,300
most users are as are the Greeks before
already sent

514
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,950
arm I have no money in my bank

515
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:19,970
my am I at risk and such thanks

516
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:23,050
and and I'm a big challenge

517
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:26,710
is them re as humans maybe we think

518
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:31,730
me very rational when we do decisions

519
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:35,590
but in fact the you man resched analyzes

520
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:40,050
is harvesting in most very appropriates
to escape

521
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:43,230
saber tooth tiger and former times up

522
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:47,320
it might not really be D appropriate
approached forum

523
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,280
online security decisions

524
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,760
so we have had a lot of challenges Mon
so how to solve them

525
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,810
I saw in general States a you sent the
same process

526
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:03,070
which is defined to be /c he among
hydration

527
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:07,840
it is more or less arm identifying the
need for Human Centipede

528
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,540
signing to some specification Tucson
specified in the Grauman's

529
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,470
produce some prototypes for the same
solutions I remember mainstream

530
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:21,940
and then paid to read it again I accuse
experience and the last year's

531
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,460
especially minutes on security and
privacy enhancing technologies

532
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:29,389
is that at least five 82 rations

533
00:33:29,389 --> 00:33:32,830
are needed for most of

534
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:36,000
the dialogue screens are we built

535
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,190
the girls

536
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:42,960
especially in the privacy the main lot
of new things are happening

537
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,419
and this is x2 the problem that

538
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:49,720
and uses cannot have long-term or

539
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,630
even shopping experience with new things
so

540
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,090
this of course opens up the discussion
for our

541
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:00,179
where and how should be training mom

542
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:03,220
only ourselves upon song on children

543
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,340
in IT security

544
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:12,060
arm again the ice definition is like the
definition for usability very abstract

545
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,100
and does not really tell you how to
completely the

546
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,060
are approach to things I only have three

547
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,969
iterations on this light moments

548
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:27,839
the thing is 3 suggests to pick in this
changes

549
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:31,839
re half be apply and mix

550
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,560
of classic a age sang a methodology make

551
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:40,350
the song or retrospective testing but we
also know

552
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:44,009
ants new research trip

553
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:47,830
I already stressed the importance of
mental model research

554
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:53,020
classic usability information is more
bees on pastimes and generates marinus

555
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:56,800
age CIA security and relations are based
on the deep understanding

556
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,100
of what has happened

557
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,790
arm

558
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:07,819
I will monk or through and example
process

559
00:35:07,819 --> 00:35:11,220
I already mentioned you trust the
project in the beginning

560
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:15,290
and the atrocity project restock with
classic upon us

561
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:19,630
personas are not Alison Paul and some
pop on stereotypes

562
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:22,870
personas are based on Bay tower

563
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,009
and they are more are less prompted to
do

564
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:30,569
persons they are archetypes monster
attacks

565
00:35:30,569 --> 00:35:33,940
boss personas a ban used to bring some
areas life

566
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:39,260
so and the idea is a as we know that's
the personality of different people

567
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,610
influences

568
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:43,530
usage and the interaction with a

569
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:46,530
at: security implications are wrong

570
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:49,610
v know that that use a as

571
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:54,000
that long definition of what he wants to
build the system for

572
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,690
is not enough so we have I multitude of
performance in see them on the right

573
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:01,990
and theory percent more or less
different

574
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:06,940
use a group and discos back again today
the finishing of usability

575
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:11,620
specified people's Bahamas is from our
point of view a very efficient

576
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:15,529
very light right and very and and juices
metal

577
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:21,590
on hold the chief this across to be
altered to use a stance besides the

578
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:24,870
classically laboratory evaluations of
different prototypes are hot

579
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:29,560
prototypes we do dismantlement research
for

580
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,310
you trust the project as I said it's
very hot to Iran Wade

581
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:36,700
things which are not in place we try to
do some

582
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:41,300
RM unleashing in virtual reality
environments and bong

583
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:45,430
important point is that of course me
yours the same guidelines

584
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:49,830
I in the project these the same
guidelines you might know for operating

585
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,580
systems

586
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:54,060
in our case be I to rate them

587
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,799
and are focus them on the application
domain

588
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,490
which is in turn into things in the you
trust to protect but the idea is spent

589
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:07,750
are you have generating graphical user
interface design guidelines for

590
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:12,070
doing producing general publications
like each of its implications

591
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:17,600
or something but for the same IT
security systems are we need to go I'll

592
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:22,049
deeper me needs to better define for
example running as a stressed already a

593
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:22,310
lot

594
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:25,330
and across me on so

595
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:29,450
go and had three different roads should
with this design guidelines are based on

596
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,630
our user studies

597
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:35,480
are we arm we come up with basic design
guidelines and then

598
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,200
Martin based on ongoing studies me i
three also the guidelines

599
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,260
to be then able to provide a simple
guidelines when the project is finished

600
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,310
before finishing a project we have
crossed also have and use the trials

601
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:50,470
the classic game on speech are which
then

602
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:54,440
already include hopefully working
prototypes it will be in one and a half

603
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,030
years

604
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:58,500
just to give you

605
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,590
the brief introduction two-term nope
that's on us

606
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:07,120
I picked out on some purpose on a
stretcher classy we have a whole family

607
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,319
the classes and arm

608
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,360
this guy has dyslexia he uses assistive
technologies

609
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:19,620
when he has to read them up on the
screen I'll still he likes technology

610
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:24,060
arm and he of course is the young kinda
family who supports their

611
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,259
holtzman thinks don't work

612
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:31,370
yeah as a based on his dyslexia he

613
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:35,500
tries to avoid reading but is still or
mishandling

614
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,170
arm this is just the one of the personas

615
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:43,250
are you see already from their short
descriptions in the original governor

616
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:44,120
long descriptions

617
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,400
but you can already are anticipate that
there are a lot of

618
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,990
implications for user interface the same
on this bus on instructions

619
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:55,110
and when you have a sec of those persona
descriptions

620
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:58,460
you have already and not of the same
implications so

621
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:03,940
you can the song was not only see as the
definition tour for European Music Group

622
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,210
popcorn saw

623
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:09,790
armor as a design tool and you also can
use them for innovation leader Aung

624
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:15,000
to complete my talk

625
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,220
I will some my do we need usability

626
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:22,030
he said we want to maintain ballistic
our security we want

627
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:25,330
that the usuals use 00 security
implications

628
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:28,890
and ran the use if we want to you but
the use them in the right to me and

629
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:29,700
bones

630
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,620
and the main security by using it the
wrong way I think nothing is more open

631
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:39,910
believing to be secure in actual not be
secure home

632
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:43,990
use real and use don't base your
decisions on

633
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:47,760
been young base your decisions on real
and use the paper

634
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,770
specified heels introduced the hospital
a very nice strongly recommend its

635
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:57,030
up there are different ones I recommend
to

636
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:00,660
warrants to talk about that user if

637
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:05,080
I ask you what do you think is the user
and if I ask you what you think is the

638
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,560
user

639
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,609
I we kept to totally different pictures
of that User

640
00:40:09,609 --> 00:40:12,640
this is my it's a very good idea to
define them

641
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,330
and as you or humans via and public to
other humans

642
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:20,500
them metal suggests to using for tolls
and

643
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:24,880
this is my I'm rocks in the area is some
bases because it grants

644
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:31,100
because humans I'm nothing to us in the
home

645
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,450
is I really recommend to

646
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:37,480
introduced the engines were as

647
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,540
early as possible in the project maybe
even before .0

648
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:45,170
it would be nice to 4.0 to already know

649
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:48,570
Hall is my user group talking about
technology

650
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:51,930
all his might use a drum talking about
own security

651
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:54,990
Richmond other using what will the

652
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:58,400
be lunch but when they understand icon
thinks

653
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,740
X myself or something

654
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:06,490
I also stressed the mental model
mismatch it's very important to me know

655
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:10,420
hello that people think that things work

656
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,560
because only man we can analyze

657
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:18,799
why things monger called if we
experience for example news I'll send

658
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,530
private and not the public key part to
me

659
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:29,870
and of course a to reduce and do some
testing and reengineering

660
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:33,100
5 6 7 iterations expects

661
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,570
I am really recommend this because
awning on

662
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:39,870
its mop appalled security versus his
ability

663
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:44,490
its vaults the same thing usable
security systems

664
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:48,390
because are you still stay are not the
enemy

665
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:48,640
thank you
