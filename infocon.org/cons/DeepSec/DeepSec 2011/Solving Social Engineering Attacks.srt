1
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:08,840
back leaving everyone thank you for
staying

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,370
awake and alive long enough to hear me
as

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,710
as only seven talkback

4
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,270
nearing attacks which is a project I'm
working on at the moment

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,509
and Honda chief it through modeling
categorizing

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,420
and conversing the attacks am seeking a
bit more detail

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,939
first interview pat pat myself and this
the first time i present its conference

8
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,200
sour to get it back on the myself this
in words in each night their subsequent

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,880
terminology insights engineering
something which is generic and if you've

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,190
done it before you might know I'm

11
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,649
and some of which I have to come up with
to explain concepts

12
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:46,870
we can look at the Y why do we actually
need a site

13
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:51,329
a solution to social engineering and
chase models

14
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,839
the hope for checks type built around
models is quite a few doing different

15
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:55,339
things

16
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:58,649
and we can look at what they do how we
can model section change back to how

17
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,219
they work to help us solve it

18
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:03,329
we can categorize the models

19
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,830
so we can to be defensive categories for
different types of sections near an

20
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:07,340
attack

21
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,940
we can convert the idea is to get a
solution to do that

22
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,200
we convert the attacks from stations
near attacks

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,610
and something else and that allows us to
find a solution a man of a shot by

24
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,540
looking briefly towards the future

25
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,750
what you can do to improve or expand to
full time to show you here

26
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,829
so I first saw her mine I'm not going to
give you my hoe see

27
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,950
day and as always I'm a finally a
student at the University York

28
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,860
in the UK I'm studying computer science
and this project actually my final year

29
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,640
project

30
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,560
doctorate plus sizes negatives on the
goods

31
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,890
night it means you can ship their
athletes just one saying is being packed

32
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:47,590
and neck

33
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,509
scientific everything I've done has got
justifications behind it

34
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,829
I'm not gonna show you these
justifications if you ask me about it

35
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:59,280
the and/or after with a happy explain
them on the downside mean special

36
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,320
project

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,869
I've only been working on this for a
month filter 23

38
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:07,219
and part-time I've only gone a month
foresight to guide

39
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:11,240
and has an awful lot more that could be
done in future for this

40
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,850
went fine on your side the entire for
first tent information security

41
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,950
which is a pen testing social
engineering up

42
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,450
two things each night the the dictionary
is it worth my talk

43
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,690
I will start by looking at what what you
mean by solving

44
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,130
and Sykes engineering and then is more
than this

45
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,049
social engineering generic stuff like
attack and knock and finally some

46
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,220
projects to fix stuff

47
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,140
attacks and stories what I mean myself
like

48
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,020
as the picture shows superbly that is
not a solution

49
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,460
in the proper sense there's a number of
problems with it

50
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,930
if the bottle breaks if you can't read
English

51
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,310
of person Seikon hey when the shaking it
the solution is incomplete

52
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,910
as time trying to use academically I'm
looking very much for us

53
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:02,230
scientific definition of the absolving
I'm trying to find something that always

54
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:02,920
works

55
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,450
I will all will solve everything now
obviously

56
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,160
so all sections mary has its limitations
is not necessary possible welcome back

57
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,070
that the aim is to find something it
sold all sections and tax

58
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,180
what I mean by station generic

59
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,310
I'm not talking about computer viruses
infecting humans

60
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,340
have awesome that might be I me talking
about us ko kaise deception

61
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,610
session from a session sneering boils
down to this action

62
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,780
and South any view hearing it from basin
you have seen the BBC program possible

63
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,960
all the wheel muscle japan's I get here
k

64
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,070
you make your you be in the ship the
show is all about confidence tricks and

65
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,090
confidence our test I contracts conning
people

66
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,680
hustling them to get money usually I
don't we make it

67
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,890
a distinction between contract con
artist in contracts and social

68
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:54,560
engineering

69
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,650
and because at the end the day that both
doing same thing that both receiving

70
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,240
somebody

71
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,540
to achieve a goal and sluts at last pic
effectively the definition I'm going

72
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:03,929
with

73
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,170
using deception to achieve a goal
whatever the girl may Bay

74
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,630
then some sections your genetic stuff

75
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:16,060
the mock miss the person who's being the
same the victim

76
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:21,690
in the attack as you as it were the mark
is always a single person

77
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,440
certain attacks you might be off
thinking some have multiple not

78
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,370
example phishing attack I could send out
one email to a million different people

79
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,689
for this purpose is my models I'm
consider each mark to be a separate

80
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:34,430
model

81
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,169
to the you consider individual marks the
reason for this is we're looking for

82
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:40,479
solutions that will position the marks
point

83
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,500
yet we can't be most marked the same
time

84
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,229
attack a is this is the section
geneticist the person actually doing the

85
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:49,990
deception

86
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,620
companies that have attacked a most the
time like me to play safe engineer a few

87
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,280
seconds

88
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,289
this can be plural again as you'll see
later on

89
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:02,159
it doesn't matter whether it's a single
percent a whole group of people doing

90
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:03,139
the deceiving

91
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:10,039
you can just consider is one person some
very project specific stuff

92
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:13,050
if you consider social engineering let's
take an example

93
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,810
the attack has this girl he wants to
achieve less to do that is to make three

94
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,939
phone calls

95
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:21,419
is gathering person I and ask this
question is gonna ring

96
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:25,780
person pay and get this that information
he's thinking person's say

97
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,449
and use the first two pieces of
information chief the girl

98
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:32,499
that whole thing I just described is the
story

99
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:36,530
it's the entire incident from the
attackers point to VA

100
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:42,759
we've reached in March 20 so each of the
individual phone calls individual attack

101
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,189
because each one has an individual mock
and so what we're trying to look at the

102
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:47,699
individual elements

103
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,949
the reason for this is obviously if you
can stop one at the attacks

104
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:55,580
the overall story but work anymore and
so to solve

105
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,229
sections Mary attacks as long as you can
so one of the best one of the things

106
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:00,128
that make up

107
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:04,539
the overrule the overall story the
attacker gets uses to get to install

108
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:07,740
you can stop station engineering

109
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,139
what's the point there is the very
famous quite

110
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:14,979
that no one's quite sure who started
because there is no catch for human

111
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:16,659
stupidity

112
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:20,498
and it's very apt uses a general's as
general thing

113
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:23,789
all very naive they tend to be an
experienced

114
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:27,229
and the usual ignorant the correct
things today

115
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:31,449
this training out there some great
training either sections in a ring

116
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:34,629
but it can't be perfect know how could
the training is it will never achieve

117
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:36,050
perfection

118
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,389
because what you're affected joint day
is make people aware of their own

119
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:40,360
weaknesses

120
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,729
how to fight them that's not really a
solution that's trying to fill in the

121
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:44,998
blanks as it were

122
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:48,860
well we're looking at you look at the
diagram thing done so software engineer

123
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,229
sure some people have you recognize this
is the sort of problem she faxed

124
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:56,998
trainings ever gonna be bottom right it
works it does its job

125
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:00,650
as in the has brought your issues with
it I we're aiming very much for bottom

126
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,860
left we want something that's cast on

127
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,059
the will do the job how we gonna do this

128
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:11,900
we can ignore psychology if you've ever
read a book on social engineering

129
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,770
look from any website talk 21 account
when talks conferences

130
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:20,099
people talk nonstop about psych the
psychology behind it

131
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:24,370
you should take advantage of this motion
use this witness in human behavior

132
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:28,129
if you read something body language like
this you can achieve this

133
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:32,740
put on this fancy costume you become
someone else entirely and alleviate

134
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,499
I'm sure if you've done it alcohol haha
Yellow Jacket

135
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:40,580
in a city with a briefcase on the side p
you can use psychology to Chi session

136
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,090
generic

137
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,229
the problem is is too complex it's
almost impossible to model sites

138
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:46,919
engineering

139
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,308
including the psychology because there
is not take when the world

140
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:54,650
put it down the reason I can ignore
psychology K

141
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,150
is because we cannot make the assumption
that it will work not

142
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:02,120
after certain amount of psychology after
a certain amount of social engineering

143
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,029
the attack will succeed if we assume
success

144
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:09,430
then we can black box the psychology 8
books were gonna assume that it will

145
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,319
work

146
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,969
and we can certainly something on much
simpler model I'm so that's then

147
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:16,529
something we can and soul

148
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,800
so how much gonna go back to its remedy
these models from

149
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,080
Russ not war stories I went to the
library

150
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,180
which is a BS issued is a scary place

151
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,150
I read books I look on web sites I
started reading all the stories

152
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:33,770
actual social engineers have been out
that you've done it and written down

153
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,809
their exploits in a book

154
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:40,229
and I started documenting the documents
about a hundred Saif up

155
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:45,120
I'm going to undertake take to these
attacks the model up

156
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,270
when I model these attacks and remove
psychology day

157
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,310
and ended up in obstruction it turns out

158
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:56,760
this fall models the couple or the
social engineering attacks

159
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,790
now amazing enough for mothers is
reasonably so lovable

160
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,250
and so that's what I proceeded today but
first

161
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,350
a bit of a disclaimer if I if in the 100
model

162
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,770
if the 100 attacks the night document
I've missed something

163
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:14,069
than anything i show you from here on in
if the beginning as opposed to a

164
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,360
complete solution

165
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,350
which is as I said at the start what
we're aiming for

166
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,650
let's continue on the assumption that
I'm I've got it right and we haven't

167
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,939
missed anything

168
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,940
and as you say I don't think I have and
if you can think many examples a social

169
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,670
engineering attacks

170
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,810
are isn't shown in my model please yell
it out all set to be and

171
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,080
I really don't think you will says that
took models

172
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,460
and which doctor we removed all the
stuff we took into the relevant stuff

173
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,740
but has backed the picture and Einstein
very wise inside we didn't get a file

174
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,230
there is still enough detail in done for
them to be relevant and

175
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,520
important the good news is it meant
because you move psychology

176
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,620
you can strip at a lot of detailed
otherwise would be important

177
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,660
for example if a social engineer cop
tries to contact the mock

178
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,689
on the south side or in person on the
street

179
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:09,310
all fire email in each nation army as
the marks going to react differently

180
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,690
but week knowing cycle the day and so it
doesn't matter

181
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,600
you can ignore how the time to actually
does the things he does

182
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,410
providing you acknowledge that he doesn
t do that

183
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,839
said it was well as looking example
first attack on che is this from

184
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:29,360
due to do with information bill is the
Micronauts peacock

185
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,630
I'll

186
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,780
you're right attack

187
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:40,870
this model shows information the mark is
trying to that the attackers joins get

188
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,580
information off the mark now the two
types information I've modeled

189
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,840
public information which is not essay
published

190
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,870
but since the information that you could
get legally without necessary to any

191
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,810
section general hacking

192
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,800
a private which is everything else now
obviously in a company or in the

193
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,620
military

194
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,470
privates going to be broken up into
different levels confidentiality

195
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:07,720
but for the book the past as a model
that will encompass within private

196
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,520
at the top as augmenting only got
contacts you've got these two boxes

197
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,819
which is the attack to contact the mark

198
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,330
they stood the reason there is today

199
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,500
is because the first one is the attacker
contact the mock

200
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,580
this is fairly normal I'm bringin I
bring my speaks them on the

201
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,260
I speaking our email was hacked the
other one came about

202
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,040
when I was reading a kevin Mitnick book

203
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,349
I wanted that can mimic his dad and I
was a very famous American section

204
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:34,720
engineer

205
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,640
has been in after President and had good
guy and has written like two books

206
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,240
about that things he's done leading in
illegally

207
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,950
and wannabes but one of the stories he
ok to tell if I can switch

208
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,450
so that a number that normally went to a
place of s so that

209
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,700
police officers who came from a shed
actually went to his mobile site

210
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,160
needless to say the marks run the number
and with director is now behind

211
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,660
after psychological point you then need
sunt was a police officer he's genuine

212
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,709
we can tell this guy stuff nope in fact

213
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:10,900
station genetic has one is the second
box the attacker gets the mark to

214
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,390
contact back

215
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,050
United downside the psychology book says
mission as a set

216
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,730
black box-like ellijay we've
acknowledged that at every stage

217
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,790
we need the social engineer may have to
do something

218
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,069
may have to do some convincing Matthew
some tricks

219
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,800
but will issue we go through on the far
left you'll notice

220
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,840
in adults the next two case we're
assuming it works

221
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,100
that that the clarity see you can see
where it could fail book

222
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,060
will take them out like six we can
assume the attack works

223
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,540
the fun thing I want to mention it is at
the bottom the two boxes the mall

224
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,170
realizes they've been attacked and not
doesn't realize they've been attacked

225
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,300
those few who forced the hustle the Real
Hustle

226
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,540
will be where the turn on to burn the
mock

227
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,449
Ifans techa burns the mock in these the
market realize that they be attacks

228
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:04,110
they realize they've done something
wrong they realize the attack has

229
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,350
managed to get him to do something I
shouldn't have done

230
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,940
it is Mikey important for an attack in
nearly all the time to not

231
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,990
burn the mock the reason for this if the
market doesn't

232
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,140
Anne stakes for civil you can't use the
same attack again

233
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,400
in the future because the marks going to
be on TA second a

234
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,590
said another attack in the store a may
not work

235
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:29,090
the mark my can tell it boss I feel we
wished you could buy just tell this guy

236
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:31,270
on the final of private information

237
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,819
and again two things to fix it now
Michelly you know the statistics

238
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,970
that rarely happens people like keep
very quiet that make such a stupid

239
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,690
mistake

240
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,650
but it could potentially influence the
story answer is vitally important most

241
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,420
the time

242
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:48,850
that you end up in the market doesn't
realize that being attacked box

243
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,210
the next model is all to do with gaining
entry

244
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,610
and you'll notice the time models
identical except the two middle box on

245
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,460
the right

246
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,670
where effectively the goal has changed

247
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,310
now what I mean by gaining entry like it
mean in a physical sense

248
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,120
are you trying to break into the process
have time will tell high-tech

249
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,420
where you follow someone through it all
like hold the door open

250
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,300
always my favorites when you turn up to
adore the specs but a cardinal in space

251
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,270
but a pin number

252
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:19,040
carrying loads of stuff from tired and
somebody sees you naked

253
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,849
they take eighteen they let you in this
very peaceful

254
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,280
it doesn't however include things on
social engineering

255
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,240
for example if somebody walks through
that door when I wanna just kept it for

256
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,350
clients as

257
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,780
that's not social engineering but
catching a double unless

258
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:38,300
election but he deceived somebody to
take Advil and the city to see some

259
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,560
gonna take advantage of that weaknesses

260
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,070
it's not sanctions Marant the other
example took a knee injuries the virtual

261
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,250
site

262
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,490
getting into a system getting into a
network whatever it may Bay

263
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,550
noun the you go I'll make a very
important distinction K

264
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:58,310
if I bring someone up an awesome thank
you's and I'm for that password

265
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,270
and they give it to him and I use that
to log on that not gaining entry about

266
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,510
the previous not lots information

267
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:07,689
because they've told me what I wanted to
hear

268
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,710
if I however bring up a sysadmin and
side

269
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:15,360
I work for your company Department axe
I'm away on business and the VPN access

270
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,940
Catholic I'm look myself after that can
you create new account

271
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,950
and they did it you've got you gained
access

272
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,000
you convince someone to affect to be
opened up but rolled over into that

273
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,650
system

274
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:28,709
specially for you

275
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:32,270
next model is all to do with my life we
just had a talk on my lap

276
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,660
I'm here is actually the model that
despite the social engineering aspects

277
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,800
of it

278
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,160
the market of access the Malla is a bit
over

279
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,860
cover everything box books include not
only techniques like fun send someone a

280
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,390
an email with the malicious attachment
the techniques like by 10

281
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,640
if I stick some malware on a USB stick
leaving the car park

282
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,390
or fight before you guys who came in
dropped USB sticks with my wife this

283
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,650
room I suspect find out

284
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:03,390
lost I repeat length hair because people
were to pick them up like the man

285
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:07,300
I don't dapper that included in the
house

286
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,670
access the box you don't necessarily
need to contact the mark in order to it

287
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,650
hence why this the direct line to that
box

288
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:20,250
the market access it not much use if he
doesn't the mall i guess im still

289
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,850
now this boxed wasn't originally that
because of the the malware installs

290
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,420
itself

291
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,490
it would mark does open the attachment
to plug in the stick

292
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:30,600
and immediately get instilled that
doesn't need to be modeled

293
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,620
books is not part of the social
engineering attack

294
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:38,370
however we've all had times where we've
come up with you still come across my

295
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:38,910
lap

296
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,130
where the user has to actually do the
instill it's a job

297
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:46,650
rapidly got click Allow or instill it's
a piece it amounted to be some outlets

298
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,500
the skylight is an adjustment program
they've won first and

299
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,450
instill sister there are numerous
examples that

300
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,620
hence morning back if you've got to
convince the mock

301
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,370
to do the install you've got to be able
to not make you feel to model psychology

302
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,390
and social engineering aspects

303
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:06,609
up getting them to do the install the
final model

304
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:10,240
is pretty much everything else perform
an action

305
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,539
I ask someone to do something specific

306
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:16,619
the example the got example the court
this autos another one from kevin

307
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,409
mitnick's book

308
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:22,159
it was too big I rang up telephone
repairman and Sat

309
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:25,649
on to a new copy of your company
directory which is all that

310
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:29,529
confidential numbers that the public
that have access to it

311
00:17:29,529 --> 00:17:33,440
but I can't deliver to you and slot but
your own company directly back

312
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,759
to stick your old one out on the porch
an operatic might drop off the new one

313
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,120
needless to say the old one went and you
will never turned up

314
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,480
you call somebody to do something he's
gone and done it well she's gone and

315
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,749
done it

316
00:17:46,749 --> 00:17:50,929
so we got the four models we can
consider these categories

317
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:55,269
affectively that's what they are they
pop-up the rescue all such engineering

318
00:17:55,269 --> 00:17:56,200
attacks

319
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,789
but the real the reason they're all the
different what we would normally think

320
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:00,549
of as categories

321
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:04,700
is that the categories based on the goal
of the attack what the MOX actually got

322
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,249
to do

323
00:18:05,249 --> 00:18:09,460
let the attack sexiest as opposed to the
methodology

324
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,749
that the attack uses normally we think
things like fishing

325
00:18:13,749 --> 00:18:17,309
which is a technique that an attack use
it it's not much good for me trying to

326
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:18,918
think how do we solve this

327
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:23,419
you console fishing but thinking about
solving the malware

328
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:26,840
we now have to stop things we've never
had to stop people accessing now we know

329
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,279
house

330
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:31,639
me know how to stop malik et instill as
you'll see later on

331
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:35,210
to save the aim here with Cassie
consider his catchphrase is we're trying

332
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:35,590
to as

333
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:39,970
the the example of the analogy I'm using
is we're trying to cure

334
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,710
the course not just the symptoms

335
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,179
we can put more together and end up with
a nice big model

336
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:50,289
that is effectively what you just sayin
this to work

337
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:54,779
yep and as you've still got basically
you information model

338
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:59,340
your perform an action you gain entry
and your mouth and models

339
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,389
but you've also got a big line going
around an attack at the box that I if

340
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:05,549
you can read it has the attack it begins
the

341
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:08,820
the attack begins the story

342
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:13,259
if you think back to when I started to
talk I was talking about tax in stories

343
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:16,370
this model of them just showing love the
attacks put together

344
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,990
action shares the stories because
obviously the attacker can go through

345
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,019
one attack

346
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:25,110
look back into a different tack and so
on insightful

347
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:29,009
it is complete this is rather useful
because we can study this weekend to

348
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:33,169
work a mess because this theoretically
shows all possible social engineering

349
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:34,100
stories

350
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,350
anything an attacker could do using
social engineering

351
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:42,730
but we also love it to do that being
young and being British

352
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,249
I'm getting used something I labeled
sleepy two principal

353
00:19:46,249 --> 00:19:49,730
after they see you don't know the UK
showed lupita

354
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:54,499
it's a kid's TV had been running full
must be at least 30-40 years

355
00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:58,149
and that famous arts and crafts and
makes me feel things out plastic a piece

356
00:19:58,149 --> 00:19:59,249
of paper and I'll

357
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:03,950
egg cartons and things with the catch
find his 1 I'm a Dahlia Telstar

358
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,720
I'll tell you what today and then
they'll pull out the finish one from

359
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,679
under the table

360
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:13,090
this is exactly the philosophy I wanted
to use to South Station engineering

361
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:16,120
rather than trying to invent solutions
on the spur of the moment

362
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,029
just come up with some miraculous cure I
thought let's use what's already been

363
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:21,399
invented

364
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:25,529
what's already been invented computer
security solutions

365
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:29,909
and so was not done as you pass a is I
took security social engineering models

366
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:31,129
are shipped same day

367
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:36,909
converted done in two models compute the
corresponding computer security attack

368
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:41,129
and then researched the back the current
industry best practice solution

369
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:45,509
that to do this is Val the simple we
just can't we just a bit of translating

370
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:46,529
on the models

371
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:50,019
you don't have an attacker you have a
backup yet from all

372
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:54,389
your sister now we don't need to specify
with missus a network a web app a system

373
00:20:54,389 --> 00:20:56,350
of some description

374
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:00,240
you don't contact Mark yet complex
systems are you connect to it

375
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,440
psychology becomes hacking annual few
details so

376
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,999
reach nicely I'm hoping to go to see
this model

377
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,350
that is based on the model we just saw a
few seconds guy minus the link back

378
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:14,279
am right and everything translate it

379
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:18,330
you still got the same lane you've still
got the systems are surprised

380
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:19,480
information at

381
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:23,149
you still got the systematic gives ACA
the information

382
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:26,450
you've got the Performing Akshat for
example you think that as

383
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,440
seek rejection for example command
execute you're trying to get the system

384
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,730
to do something it shouldn't do

385
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:35,850
gay and tread happen to a network into a
web app

386
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:40,299
and now when I was pretty much till my
lap

387
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,440
so we now start looking for the best
practice solution so we look at them one

388
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,710
by one

389
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,039
if we look at information what we
usually do

390
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:51,139
if we go system and somebody asks it for
information

391
00:21:51,139 --> 00:21:54,730
had we confirm their own out the
information but we authenticate them

392
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,529
and we confirm their authorized is
something we've been doing a website

393
00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:01,080
something we be doing on network since
day one of computers

394
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,490
has white that

395
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,970
retaining entry after stops on gaining
entry into your system

396
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:11,649
we've had a fire will you can close any
unneeded polls

397
00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:15,320
you can use an access control system
again if they've got a

398
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,740
connected to your network you can
authenticate them to confirm they are

399
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,769
throwing taxes back sir

400
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:25,549
access back part is the web whatever and
if they do succeed in through a lot

401
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:30,799
you can please make sure you know about
it you can use an IDS

402
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,119
malware this is easy we will be in
protect ourselves against malware

403
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:37,379
donkeys yes you can restrict movable
media

404
00:22:37,379 --> 00:22:41,409
I know it easier said than done but
suddenly a lot technique special ones I

405
00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:42,149
was mentioning

406
00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:46,309
about USB sticks don't work the comp not
the main

407
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:49,340
you can scan traffic you can use 19 iris

408
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,340
keep the antivirus new computer
up-to-date understanding of the software

409
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,580
don't let your employees do whatever
they want ago a lot lot lot

410
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,860
lower-risk being infected with malware

411
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,860
applying to perform an action the same
thing confer authenticate

412
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,240
authorized it's the same stuff over
afghanis the same stuff we've all been

413
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,100
using

414
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,869
with a computer security the day's is
nothing new I'm showing on these key

415
00:23:11,869 --> 00:23:15,179
sites like done his research

416
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:18,519
but now want to take the solution sorry
we cite and use them for social

417
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:19,549
engineering

418
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:22,658
so we got convert them back we're going
to back to the real world

419
00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:26,419
were we get back from Pacha to attack a

420
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:29,990
backup system to mock back from connect
to contact

421
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:33,879
backpacking to psychology possibly ok if
you bet

422
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:38,259
ensure the solution still works now this
is where it gets a bit difficult tonight

423
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:40,220
you are very weakly line

424
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,970
over well I going to do what's that
might come up this point on what still

425
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,149
needs doing probably by someone in the
industry

426
00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:50,889
it's kind of the implementation of the
system

427
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:54,809
we think I can come up I come up with
the frame with a car with how you can do

428
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:55,350
it

429
00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:00,139
but actually converting those solutions
back is a really big problem

430
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:04,259
as you can see in a second Vic solutions
got to meet the

431
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:08,340
definition we came up with again it's
still got to be completed gotta sold

432
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,789
all possible cases it's not always work

433
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:15,110
it can't introduce an heiress it can't
go role

434
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:18,549
and as we all know that's exactly what
security solutions do

435
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:21,610
if this is an example if we look at with
patented

436
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:25,860
sections near information model we've
still got the same solution

437
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,440
but if we think that computer while
we've got the problem we can't we've got

438
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,039
website

439
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:33,210
networks that is secured with its a
username/password

440
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,610
I they confirm if you say you are and
that you run out again

441
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:39,879
but most the ten tests and probably most
it was everyone in the room

442
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:43,119
will have come across situations weapon
docking doesn't work

443
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:47,080
it's been implemented incorrectly some
program for got a line of code

444
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,710
vital has some minor mistake that means
you can get around it

445
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,499
implementation is pot it doesn't work
for this to work

446
00:24:55,499 --> 00:25:00,749
implementation the speakers has come
back at one of the website

447
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,789
this the prime using the using this or
Solutions Inc

448
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:07,539
information is something that the
military been doing for a very very long

449
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,090
time

450
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,269
if I rang up the US Joint Chiefs and
says hello

451
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:15,809
I'm Barack Obama I would like to launch
a nuke Russia

452
00:25:15,809 --> 00:25:20,549
vannatter let me do it unless I can
confirm I am Barack Obama

453
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:24,100
I'm allowed to launch a new now on that
now US military's want to shoot if

454
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,340
memory serves to create death

455
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,918
on something or other before was allowed
to do it

456
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:31,980
that if they're using the system while
we use me and businesses

457
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,119
we've got the solution we know it works
they use it

458
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:39,639
but we not using it nevermind

459
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:43,659
gaining entry you can't use a final you
could use a security guard

460
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:47,499
they work very well if they're
well-trained you can't close ports be

461
00:25:47,499 --> 00:25:49,610
kind close entrances and exits

462
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:53,179
how many social engineers climb into an
empty about to win that has me locked

463
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:53,649
for

464
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:58,480
like access control systems the shoot
the Metro any those trains

465
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,950
net travel networks tend to use barriers
to stop use wondering on to them

466
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,519
why don't we barry's in business make
sure that actually work

467
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:09,820
of them when we do use barriers just
like on the train systems

468
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,009
the ones that you can jump over or climb
under

469
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:16,210
or just pushed through a

470
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:19,759
finally we hit again girlfriend Kate and
all the all the old author who say they

471
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:20,029
are

472
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:23,350
all they also want to do this a 90 s
system

473
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:27,999
you mean something like CCTV a buy it
physically telling someone's doing stuff

474
00:26:27,999 --> 00:26:31,639
in your business if not no good just
having in the lobby

475
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:35,320
if sections may goes up stairs into your
server you want to know what services

476
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,820
played around with

477
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,610
is no good wondering in seeing the
unplug one cable in assuming that's it

478
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:45,919
when in fact at the back one of your
rocks is plug in USB stick with malware

479
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,340
my lap ok enough the solutions are
exactly the same

480
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,450
restricting removable media use
anti-virus

481
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:56,419
it's tough we've been doing for ages but
we don't do it very well

482
00:26:56,419 --> 00:27:00,210
now I realize I'm I'm typing very me
that he left the industry

483
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:03,450
because I'm talking theoretical as
opposed to real life

484
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:07,200
the solutions this post academic can say
that this is what you could do

485
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,409
to prevent the problem as opposed to his
something you can actually taking the

486
00:27:10,409 --> 00:27:13,080
bases and guaranteed to work

487
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:18,408
perform an action is the same stuff
authenticate non-authorized

488
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:21,600
we got to get up but this is kinda the
ok smart girl

489
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,320
to come up with a model like this that
shows all possible social engineering

490
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,249
attacks

491
00:27:26,249 --> 00:27:30,179
and more importantly shows the solutions
because we can I start using this as

492
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:31,019
policy

493
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:34,830
we can take this to a basis in sight let
let me in command is for you of you in

494
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:35,470
the business

495
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:40,009
she bosses let's implement that if we
implement all these red boxes

496
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:43,570
theoretically we not gonna we no longer
gonna be a makes concessions in a ring

497
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,428
attacks

498
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:48,049
it's much better chance at a let's send
a lot of on training

499
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:51,940
Republic to do it next year again and
the difficulty somewhere in the middle

500
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,279
but it's better than doing nothing well
let's join improve on Monday summits

501
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,460
even better than the training

502
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,279
as you probably guessed there still a
few holes to fill in this is by no means

503
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:05,879
complete my suspect it won't be for a
very long time

504
00:28:05,879 --> 00:28:09,679
you can improve on it you go back to the
beginning to look a bit more detail

505
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,450
start more tax you could put put
together models have more information

506
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,039
more detail in them

507
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,658
of state as a whole huge pressure
implementation how you actually going to

508
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:22,779
use this

509
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:26,159
against the day that's the whole point
the whole point to coming up with ideas

510
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,389
like this the whole point if trying to
improve the world

511
00:28:29,389 --> 00:28:33,330
is people to use it if you look at the
number people who

512
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,609
still wonderful to see sup to security
problems

513
00:28:36,609 --> 00:28:39,658
that was solved 5 10 15 years ago

514
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:43,909
it's shocking let's try not make that
mistake recycle engineering

515
00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:47,070
if we come up with a solution is China
getting out but let's try and get people

516
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,359
using it

517
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:55,359
even if they use it badly it's got to be
better than not using it until

518
00:28:56,029 --> 00:28:59,239
as last trying to me down we started out
once the SAR

519
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:03,179
with warm water with war stories options
so you can start with a lot more stories

520
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:04,049
than on half

521
00:29:04,049 --> 00:29:07,759
but us acting got the mall you can make
some models

522
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,149
you can model the section January
attacks you can model the conversions

523
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,649
into the site into the computer world

524
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:15,980
you can bring the conversions back you
can extract

525
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,470
it's vitally important you're struck you
don't have started never gonna succeed

526
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:23,169
but you could obstructing the mall or
less the night half

527
00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:26,940
units convert them the conversion
process on youth was a simple as I could

528
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,869
make it

529
00:29:27,869 --> 00:29:30,830
the reason for that is the simpler says
the less likely something's gonna go

530
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,470
role

531
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,759
all the conversion process is going to
introduce address you could potentially

532
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:37,769
come up with a better conversion process

533
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:41,029
and then you can solve it then you can
come up with an implementation

534
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:44,559
they can use it take it out and get
people using it

535
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,039
okay I K and I think about time
questions
