1
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,730
your hello and welcome to our
presentation my name is

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,470
low-level I'm also known as: calmer and

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,120
to introduce you to the work I did
during the last

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,820
six months but first I have to do some
light with

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,180
okay so at Newport supra

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:30,169
okay a.m. years away all of this talk

7
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:33,810
impose always start his own brief
introduction about myself

8
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,010
where r the dunno we go over to the

9
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,320
motivational sis talkin sis work why I
did it

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,310
and while think it's important the

11
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,510
from dunno we'll introduce you to some

12
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,480
back won't know little boat urges them
networks and scabies sands

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,730
thing that popped everybody might be
aware also

14
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:00,890
things back what you need to understand
his talk so will be very short and

15
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:04,239
easy to understand so

16
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,280
fought part will be a boat loans if it
was a few of the code I wrote

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,640
and when you're using some

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,320
hardware to play with Chisholm you have
to the to send

19
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,409
message in in different ways and if you
would to use it

20
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:21,850
a.m. to percent for

21
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,950
moment at work so I also it to change

22
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,900
different things in scape you to be able
to US part where which are also present

23
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,510
later on

24
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:37,380
and the last part will be the most
interesting part are things photos along

25
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,110
this part

26
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,159
and I we present my test setup

27
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,710
know within also show you some
demonstration which

28
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:49,100
hopefully will work but omits experience
that it's always working in the hotel

29
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,080
room but it's not in the conference room

30
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,729
the so maybe today we have more luck

31
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:57,740
a.m. they were start with something

32
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,920
very basic things like go to perform a
call

33
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,310
using from twila rotos I don't know we
wrote on top of the tour

34
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,330
are months since says it's not to really
do

35
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,569
security related to know more interest
into security

36
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:16,769
are also present some or attacks

37
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:19,870
was all over it start with some
well-known and

38
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,420
well understood term attacks that you
can find in the literature literature

39
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,610
from are

40
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,180
though is it simply recreates a mantra
resort to using much what it's really

41
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,010
easy to

42
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,319
to get them a said opening

43
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:39,110
that yeah the tapes researchers to

44
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,140
focus on attacks and not on all too real
a summit on

45
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,090
and the me in order to

46
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,250
well underlines the importance of 22 Loy
also

47
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,849
will present some novel attacks that
have never been done on the GSM network

48
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:57,899
when and two

49
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,520
male my to amaze it really is the
possible to

50
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,520
to create package was is for those
attacks and

51
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,819
and we also sees this but I have to say
is

52
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:13,890
I'm still a work in progress into its
very phone dependent so

53
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,440
we're we expect that at all the

54
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,349
the last part will be able to source
court long time not going

55
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:25,379
to say anything about it not also you
with state UT and I hope

56
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,890
um I think it's was it

57
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:34,420
so bozo auto yes them I'm bring security
no follow-through

58
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,670
but I know for very long so to the

59
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,569
calling my certain IT security and to
assist a

60
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:45,440
I just finish my Mustang the IT security
also

61
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,810
who only visited to go home the

62
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:52,480
since I'm from Luxembourg also did some
things that were related to

63
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,349
from security in Luxembourg for example
was cool phone of the Chaos Computer

64
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:57,480
Club in look similar

65
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,800
and as for the the

66
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,650
for my free time I'm more into Jeff
player in the legendary folksinger

67
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,900
stiffed you

68
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:11,620
which some what you might know if the
motivation of this talk

69
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,069
a from don't even know it was really
hard for independent security

70
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:18,629
researchers to 'em

71
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:23,550
didn't was a from security of urges them
networks even if it's very

72
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,349
and very overt and technology a.m.
surprises

73
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:30,460
want to put too high for any pending
people to

74
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,169
from to look at this and for CSS

75
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:37,560
change no some time ago because

76
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,100
do towards like girls are you with IP
for example we present late or

77
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,500
a it's no really possible for everybody
to play with this

78
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,560
the network and

79
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,320
everything that's related to it I mean
something was a p/e

80
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,599
cause the wrong to talk insurance and
you have a very good one

81
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,639
you can basically do everything you want
and it's also only

82
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,990
I'm hoping device that allow you to do
so plexus renso

83
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,370
plenty of wooden Morris more Kong

84
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,370
your near BTS and computers and so on

85
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,550
a.m. yes

86
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,940
as a set some time ago this in total was
started in

87
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,190
so infrastructure become affordable and
so

88
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,740
due to a and very large open source
community

89
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,680
so also open source tools available to
operate sis infrastructures and true is

90
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,220
this

91
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,530
Malo people like me you're to

92
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,540
to do some things that are related to
the security of Chisholm

93
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,190
another arm

94
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,480
you know though effect or force in with
your vision of this work was at

95
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,080
and just simply nor was it similar tool
available and

96
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,419
on before I started to do it's a I was
talking to some

97
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:58,010
persons that are working in the Chisholm
we are going to order complaining that

98
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,050
there's nothing

99
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,170
publicly available that those exactly
what this story does

100
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:07,680
and tune that's why I decided

101
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,720
to have a look at it before I have never
done anything with just them so

102
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,870
within six months you can candy

103
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,080
into it and have some fun the

104
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,659
know it count as a backbone to of love
the stuff you have to know

105
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,940
want to understand them it's very close

106
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,680
over you 100 for GSM network a.m.

107
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,170
on the left side to boxes so resemble
the

108
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:40,040
stations hazardous basically yumm or by
phone or everything that is some

109
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,420
capable of taking your Chisholm portable
so its devices

110
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,220
a reading it to a base transceiver
station

111
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,040
a was a interface own

112
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,010
and the behind sis again it's connected

113
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,940
as a as a base tan senior citizen is
connected to open a biz interface

114
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,160
to a base station controller and to
finally

115
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,380
and a interfaces connector as

116
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,820
that part to a more by switching center
or visit old good

117
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:16,320
location register of course a as I said
it's not a complete overview it's

118
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,920
we to present presented in

119
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,790
little peace to people that never have
seen anything about

120
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:29,000
jus are but all this is so way too much
already for this talk

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,480
all you have to know is this part of the
diagram

122
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,160
or so you have to know what's more
stations are

123
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,499
oren our case it will be uses phone

124
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:44,469
one-year a base transceiver station will
be the

125
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:48,689
played by my the was a plea are

126
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:51,830
in reality is that would be a was on 10
open operator

127
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,199
the stock with a this interface you can
already forget

128
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,360
long shots not interesting for what I'm
gonna

129
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,699
present no Skippy Skippy were

130
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:06,919
I'm my thing most of you will know it
because it some

131
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,150
though we know very good known in za at
the security

132
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,439
are the circles and it's a powerful
interactive

133
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:19,580
firm program that allows you to create
so the kitchen to manipulate someone

134
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,180
feared basis rate has been created by
Philip beyond your

135
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,279
think it's even seven years ago or
something

136
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,620
like this a it allows you to create

137
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:36,560
the very very very good Packers

138
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,199
I'm correct naked in a very fast ways
it's related to -ism

139
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:44,189
to the philosophy also of scape you
which

140
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,130
you also talk for my I don't know where
I am

141
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,839
dig into it late or a its easy to add
new protocols

142
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,889
which makes it possible for for people
like me to add to a protocol that has

143
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:01,190
never been implemented and

144
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,889
true this missouri also a lot of
particles that are supported no

145
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:08,980
are the my political

146
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:14,949
as a military of Chisholm a specific
means a specification or seven hundred

147
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:17,229
pages of it and it took me

148
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:22,410
certain times in terms of court so a it
was a lot of work but the complex city

149
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,959
complexity of the quote was so really
not so tired

150
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:29,240
Anders is a loss and two ebook

151
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,760
even if you don't understand to put a
cause you might find

152
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,970
arose because it's always the same so

153
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,899
my community my tape to to

154
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:44,589
from get rid of so boxer does but maybe
are still in my protocol in my

155
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:49,800
I don't know I hope of course that's
book free but you know who that is

156
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,970
a.m. yes KP takes part of the

157
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:57,540
in Python interpreter this allows you to
use restructure you know I'm from

158
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,170
programming like groups and political
conditions

159
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:05,660
so it makes it really easy to write some
scripts to react to some incoming

160
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,350
packets

161
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,890
and do some clever forcing or whatever
you want to do

162
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,880
own you can your you can write scripts
you can

163
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,250
also wish if you only want was want to
test something you can also specify

164
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,800
Dhoni indignantly

165
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,050
and so on its no I really like that too
late

166
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,279
use it often in city s but but Syrian

167
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:32,449
you in real life shit very useful if the
court no

168
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:35,930
as acetyl introduce you to the fields of
your firm

169
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,850
my the my philosophy of talk about it

170
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,199
and the philosophy of PDP on the in is
som

171
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:47,010
is suing to well one also

172
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,470
most important idea of the tourists that
you are

173
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,720
able to create Beckett very packets

174
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,800
so well as a default values match went
to correct

175
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,399
in a very fast way in order to get this

176
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:06,250
I decided to drop everything that was
hopeful

177
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,730
Chisholm you have to know that the
though a lot of pictures that I hope

178
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,269
channel

179
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:13,699
like your optional information: unknowns
and your folks in a few years

180
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:18,040
the so is a basic package you create

181
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,639
when he was mite will it's the smallest
possible

182
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:25,109
impacted a where also optional stop

183
00:11:25,109 --> 00:11:30,389
its cut orchard and two there's a loss
to be very fast

184
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:34,709
the it's not a limitation because it's
still possible to create every possible

185
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:35,529
message was

186
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:40,720
the you can simply at the the name of
your information element

187
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,329
underscore presence Sep 21 in your

188
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:48,739
function as a as a function for me to
and if you want to upset

189
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:52,859
that information element a

190
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:56,529
know why I alls already talked a lot
about a tool in the

191
00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:00,910
never said what its actually able to do
cousins a

192
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:05,379
Inc a.m. implemented so hood protocol be
you are able to quickly all three

193
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:06,720
messages on a comment like

194
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,149
and sis messages can be sent them from

195
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:15,279
basin superstation to a mobile station
says is so what I will do with your

196
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,319
wanna gold going to do some
demonstration idoney sent back its forms

197
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:19,628
a

198
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:22,919
I'm the family was upset with the phones
the

199
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:26,350
and but you could also sent messages
from

200
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,899
your mobile phone towards some teachers
and do some freezing on your own

201
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:34,919
operator's network but long I'm not
going to do this

202
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,730
those isolated to two points the first
one with the

203
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,779
the I don't want to crush a

204
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:44,799
by mistake other than network operators

205
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,459
the infrastructure you to enter for the
moment says no public

206
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:52,929
are possibility the open source
possibility old

207
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:56,089
the to do this the

208
00:12:56,089 --> 00:13:00,029
but it could be really easy reach you
quit so for example you is so awesome

209
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,329
community which is in

210
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:04,369
open source inches and thick and

211
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:07,689
the the change it in a way that you quit

212
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:10,738
sent you are prepared messages through
some operator

213
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:16,389
buttons that work but as i said i in at
the time to do it to implement this so

214
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:19,799
should be really easy to do or if your
finances

215
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,619
should take 10 yes this Google Cisco to

216
00:13:24,619 --> 00:13:27,629
to implement it so far its on the
specification

217
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:32,039
0408 which basically is a only oak tree

218
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:35,079
a.m. offer Chisholm

219
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:38,699
pic we but with o2 the services so

220
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:42,699
or on top of it like you know david for
example to

221
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:47,249
and sent as a must for the moment a I
started to implement this because I

222
00:13:47,249 --> 00:13:48,539
thought it would be some

223
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:52,819
really nice feature to have because as a
mouse could be automated in a good way

224
00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:56,509
a them and tune

225
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:59,949
yah I started to implement it but
stopped at

226
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:05,699
learning to focus more on the Chisholm
part those limitations were the

227
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:10,289
I have to admit this one limitation the
busy one limitation inserts

228
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:13,470
them that you are unable to detect
incoming packets was a moment

229
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:16,799
because this means package that

230
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,899
on social get you cannot dissects I'm
using a escape before the moment

231
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:23,909
her I do you need each

232
00:14:23,909 --> 00:14:27,029
mmm when I was doing my research are you

233
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:31,819
simply pipes or results to watch isn't
up to whale shark and so you are free

234
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:35,220
dissect it was a Leo three so this force

235
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,569
a good enough for me the during

236
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:42,179
so coding and I had some pizza testers

237
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:45,679
are and things they started to implement

238
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:50,409
that part so more I know they started to
implement it but the

239
00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:53,589
I'm not sure they will release it even
if they said so but

240
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:57,549
would be cool if they would also Lisa
dissect also equip merchant of the

241
00:14:57,549 --> 00:14:58,299
perfect would

242
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:01,889
so a.m.

243
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:06,249
know what countries apart with %uh we
want to send two messages 0

244
00:15:06,249 --> 00:15:10,600
was the hardware or choice and

245
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,939
therefore we need to matter to some
troll bites to

246
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:18,779
some of which were usually when you use
keep you simply send it over the

247
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:19,919
internet and

248
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,589
everything is done the you don't have to
bother

249
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:27,829
lots well for this case though

250
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:31,720
the I had to change something for the
whole home

251
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,819
I had to find out how all this stuff
works I was nutritious

252
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:40,269
was a pissed off and a photo tits and
use it to you this way would be to

253
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:43,339
use some open BTS functions that

254
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:47,490
opens you will you be so good and so you
can simply push the Euro

255
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:51,659
picket onto that so coach mort quite
easy to implement

256
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:55,720
the might be to test though he was using
some new features so

257
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,730
with some so he was

258
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,149
or use our open just see and to

259
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:05,959
did some looks to be able to also
injector kit

260
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:09,490
anti-war you want it in TCP socket so it
says

261
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:14,379
the same time and arms a little puzzling
lot as per latest part 2 I'm

262
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:18,039
government will see you next two men so
good since assault so its own

263
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:22,089
its relief somebody's has idea to
implement as a future

264
00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:26,269
was do so through just a minute ago
unfolding a committee be so

265
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:30,610
because said you everything was so
unit/units them into a good so far

266
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,929
a.m. you know all this two types of

267
00:16:33,929 --> 00:16:38,238
so kitsch true too low to I'm ministry
roll's most

268
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:43,289
some flexibility and users should be.
able to share the code without having to

269
00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:43,779
do

270
00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:47,919
much pitching to make it work on
different

271
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:51,649
how to restore think this best way to

272
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:56,949
to have for why to reach

273
00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:00,159
so the last part no was a boring stuff
is over

274
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,378
and two come to some some more
interesting part

275
00:17:04,379 --> 00:17:07,439
the enforceable how to do it tests

276
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,240
the test all dissent or was my test
setup

277
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,128
a photo KH in this a I was wanting my

278
00:17:15,129 --> 00:17:19,119
PC Reese my SK pitches and at all

279
00:17:19,118 --> 00:17:24,309
disconnected over US you two were those
who you was a p1

280
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:28,059
burns's again is then connected it was a
%um interface to my

281
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:33,049
mobile phones a the because it is a fun
way it was a p/e

282
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:38,059
1i of your i'm only having one daughter
border ipsum

283
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:41,309
X 900 the the

284
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:45,600
its own of for testing but if you want
to run if we network you should of

285
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,039
course

286
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:50,190
so have more you should too have toured
Autobot

287
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,570
the very important it's a clock you

288
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,869
are hoping your group monthly

289
00:17:56,869 --> 00:18:01,418
you have in your yours appear I I was
using it looked a more

290
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:05,720
the cloaked costume file for 100 you
also think

291
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,769
a but its was also a money order before
and also

292
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:12,070
and light or heat well with it a if you
have a

293
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:16,369
bet cloak or too much coke drifter the
phones are not able to adjust it to your

294
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:17,459
base station

295
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,629
you cannot you you can love you can
start will

296
00:18:21,629 --> 00:18:25,240
to send package alone so very very
important

297
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,760
the to sense a message from the user
pete was a member station

298
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:34,149
I was the user is some peach ok open BTS
which is quoted Tesco

299
00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:38,590
are the Tesco functional is the very end
the

300
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,980
its it set up channel two one more by
phone

301
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,580
and though even so we'd to use already
resso mobility management

302
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:52,168
and two gradual links tho so you only
have to concentrate on za

303
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:55,279
party so call control which also

304
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:58,649
I did sins and texts partisan XLI they
were

305
00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:03,519
sure we'll no but thats that doesn't
mean that might we would not allow you

306
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,149
to

307
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:08,669
do all that stuff since I implement its
owner protocol you able to

308
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:13,010
recreate every possible message of
earlier tree so you quit

309
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,080
the also them set up so is a

310
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,668
wagering stuff for by hand if you like
so but

311
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:22,740
it's not really fun

312
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,590
yep the in the third at the beginning I
it's a lot of trouble with my

313
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:31,678
clock so I had to find some other ways
to

314
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,889
period to validate same connotation
therefore

315
00:19:34,889 --> 00:19:38,519
I search the Internet and the phone
somewhere else or capture

316
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:42,129
which its beginnings and I simply
recreated Sam

317
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:46,299
and the if I it is at the end I had the
same

318
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:49,710
X number was happy because it just
created a Chisholm picket

319
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,990
even results ended the was

320
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,460
this is the most complex a package or a
phone

321
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,220
doing all my work Wiese this to learn to

322
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,379
superstructure a and

323
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:06,609
its measurement report message a

324
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:09,750
basically you see you people that know
we'll

325
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,599
escape the should recognize it the first
serious

326
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,250
you create a pic its own term
limitations on your sets a different

327
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,389
feuds resale value well in this case
it's a

328
00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:25,349
it's very the very viable ways but

329
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,750
are as a set its some complexes

330
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:33,399
package at fault doing all my work
mostly if you only do research report

331
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,580
controller

332
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,780
messages its local to bite or something
like that it's

333
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,399
very short messages when you

334
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:44,580
around so I compared sex them will so

335
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,820
in this package with the one of the
whale shark into

336
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:52,599
it was the same soil Sep the there was
no between implementation or

337
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:56,059
a recreated so a or

338
00:20:56,059 --> 00:21:01,200
on the package or something like this:
by and just who validates a

339
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,690
because they could not validate on your
screen phones though it did it by hand

340
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,980
so one we give you a link where you can
you can

341
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,450
have you read it if you're interested in
late or

342
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:15,270
but to all this stuff is pretty boring
so I decided it's a

343
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:19,149
ones I had a cloak no we do something
which quill

344
00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:23,879
that's before McCourt or you can you
have to know there are two different

345
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:28,770
the types of call someone is initiated
by the molestations the other one is

346
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:32,379
it said it plays a base transceiver
station so was a network

347
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:35,950
as I already set are I'm not going to

348
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:39,440
do some cause forms though the phone

349
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,919
was a network with only the other way
around are

350
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:47,429
even you forget and that's what the
limitations a messages I implement it

351
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:50,710
issue also infrastructure feel free to
test them

352
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:54,190
so you know we have basically no
focusing on the second

353
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:58,840
the message part importer or

354
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,559
a yes knows the details to put a cold
one

355
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:08,149
sperm you're sending messages they can
force until you start with some

356
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:12,669
ready willing and as a green message
when you leave messages and Sons a

357
00:22:12,669 --> 00:22:17,799
so what we're on are in message that's
related to

358
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:21,490
the mobility management and some blue
one awesome

359
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,950
report on Form I suggest so earlier in
this case or

360
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,020
really do was a call control messages
because

361
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,668
as a sets a test score function is
already taken care of the rest

362
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:35,899
so from is no you want to perform a call

363
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:39,000
you have set up your phone call with
task or function

364
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,080
you need to send set up my search and
Sun

365
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,639
collect acknowledge message to finish so
protocol running

366
00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:49,179
nice way so a

367
00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:51,970
miss gebbie woot

368
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:58,050
realizes with this way and sent you a
researcher is a letter to editor asunto

369
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:02,500
as a 10 packages over UPS workers which
were presented to

370
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,880
some size ago a and cue

371
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,390
don't you have to set an issue because
the default value is so much a perfectly

372
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,060
and

373
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:15,500
you don't have to kill particular
fantasy to score function when you set

374
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,310
it up to you up to

375
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:19,550
to given MZ so the mid

376
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:23,440
sirs the things out windows to which
phone its

377
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,610
on talking so you don't control the
clock until you don't have to specify

378
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,370
any

379
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:31,990
more than this stuff yes

380
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:36,740
don't know try to demonstrates that as I
already said to

381
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:43,740
slopes always

382
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,720
did you okay

383
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,250
you know the left side to the you have
firm

384
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,250
skippy Chisholm the was its

385
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,340
my own owns a whiteside

386
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,429
from to call or ummmm some look for
sandal

387
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:22,650
was a prompt for on

388
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:25,970
open BTS personal

389
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:32,970
coming

390
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:44,630
cocaine know anymore

391
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:48,070
search for so station on my phone

392
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:55,070
and hopefully all find it will

393
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,260
so the meantime or create a package here
tool

394
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,310
as a set to have some

395
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:22,000
corrects a portable 1i need to pick it
just the first one was on the

396
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,540
set up mobile will originated from a
search

397
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:31,830
know if you want to see the

398
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,990
what sir content of the packets a

399
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:38,070
its the since to more

400
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:41,750
basically tree information element
suppose persona City

401
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,070
tier in San you have into deep and Sun

402
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:52,070
as a message type so it's a very short
for package

403
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:58,120
sorry to bite I'm world

404
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,790
the saw the pic it was only collect
acknowledge picket

405
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:07,399
again

406
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,480
not too long or very big

407
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:17,480
pickard

408
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:32,840
okay North phones and networks on
connecting to the network okay

409
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,350
okay great I'm connected to the network
no for

410
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:40,809
let's try to worm

411
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:44,580
to set up the test good functional

412
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:51,580
are which

413
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,139
hopefully working yes it's working so
you know I'm going to a center

414
00:26:58,139 --> 00:27:05,139
as a first picket don't know my phone

415
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:09,379
it's raining issue you no to

416
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:12,799
and terminated sewing collector run

417
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,590
I'm selling the second package know it's
nomas that it still earn

418
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:20,749
running her phone ringing a

419
00:27:20,749 --> 00:27:27,580
I'm and if a census

420
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,418
its killings a connection so from there

421
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:38,019
there

422
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:41,659
thank you so impressive what you can do
with four but

423
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:45,809
I reported the

424
00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:49,739
the think it's the first time this team
will really work so

425
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:53,539
can be happy good pro

426
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:57,379
the first time it was in a demonstration
because I did or Wat complex things at

427
00:27:57,379 --> 00:27:58,330
home wit

428
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:03,399
okay so no let's focus on some different
stuff

429
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:07,830
the on classical attacks as I already
explained at the beginning classical

430
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,549
attacks

431
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:12,090
home a texted oh well known and
understood

432
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,389
taunt you can find some literature um

433
00:28:15,389 --> 00:28:18,869
the first 1 I'm going to X into present
a.m.

434
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:22,710
its name to detach indication message
that you sent

435
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:27,169
the this time you were sending it forms
a mobile station presuming

436
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:30,169
base transceiver stations or only the

437
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:33,980
presenting this interior sins are not
sending messages to

438
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,490
network a but just to show you

439
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:41,279
or is it is this a techno can be
realized a

440
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,230
the specification of SIS picket was this
message

441
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,659
are represented in this table all year

442
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:51,909
you see also information elements

443
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:54,919
on mandatory arms or legs

444
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:59,070
or fixed except for them more by the
density where you have her own

445
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,600
a sizable for depending was from 229
bytes

446
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,679
the just so

447
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,399
a graphical representation of this
Pegasus looks or

448
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:12,539
good looks like this is no more
representation

449
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:17,799
a as he sees a different values are set
by default so

450
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:21,009
you don't have to care take care of it
if you create no one

451
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:24,549
in the due to education message

452
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:30,059
sowwy the blue parts a great part so
what part in seattle part already set

453
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,480
so the default value so the specified

454
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,600
in this particular action so you do not
have to

455
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,950
take care of this no of course if you
want to do some fuzzy rawrs

456
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:46,210
or the send some broken package you can
of course use escape you can chase

457
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:49,490
fields but the secure so she also

458
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:52,490
what's the to list to is

459
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,580
to have the smallest value picket are

460
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:59,039
asserts a deferred for going to correct
place we do not have to take killed

461
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,749
so anything you have to take it is so
nobody tentative are

462
00:30:03,749 --> 00:30:08,419
you have to set this 9.9 bytes tupelo
invites the correct way

463
00:30:08,419 --> 00:30:12,499
are was the first one is still a mess
the first but it's

464
00:30:12,499 --> 00:30:15,519
computed buys a as it were

465
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:19,070
through this would know if you set

466
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:23,369
the for packet the it will look like
something like this

467
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:28,159
creates a the the package in certain
under certain values

468
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,590
into in interval

469
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:34,899
rooms or packages extremity and a.m.

470
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:38,389
and you can send it are the result of
such an attack

471
00:30:38,389 --> 00:30:42,599
would be that say you though would not
be able anymore to receive any SMS

472
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:46,059
ok all the active cause sweet

473
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:50,499
get killed and two for the user
everything looks normal his students use

474
00:30:50,499 --> 00:30:55,330
on his phone that is connected to it was
a network and he has no indications that

475
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,168
the

476
00:30:56,169 --> 00:30:59,720
stuff things that not working anymore
the

477
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:03,099
the was this is the

478
00:31:03,099 --> 00:31:06,379
what's the literature says so to talk to
some

479
00:31:06,379 --> 00:31:11,580
persons we said it depends on the phones
operator or sometimes you don't see that

480
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,279
you're connected anymore and stuff like
this

481
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,960
the in no imagine

482
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,529
music if you could sense that every
second so you quit

483
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:25,950
love disconnect so old buildings if you
want would like to

484
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:30,820
so the it's really easy to do stuff like
this no

485
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:35,158
if it's good for another question what
you'll real secret 17

486
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:41,429
according to wield yes and no and second
the turquoise its

487
00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:46,070
I i quoted attacker words something
iPhones a specific asians

488
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,879
it simply notification reject the
messages

489
00:31:49,879 --> 00:31:52,950
a your when you sent this one the

490
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,379
use is a use a good texting this gets
disconnected from zo

491
00:31:56,379 --> 00:31:59,580
Network Chris has an inscription is so

492
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,820
displays a says a SIM card registration
failed

493
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,389
and his unable to connect with this or
twenty also

494
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:11,089
inches on that we're going to his
restarting his mobile phone

495
00:32:11,089 --> 00:32:16,019
experience is also quite the very
annoying

496
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:19,639
if you pretend to be a real operator
hands-on

497
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:24,320
people log in to your cell and Sun News
was docked would you stop Lexus

498
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,220
or could be really annoyed and

499
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:32,149
you know it try to demonstrate this
phone as well

500
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:35,409
but for the war sure you were

501
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:40,019
budget issue of support Picasa or create
it

502
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:43,950
before the the

503
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:47,240
because this picket has so

504
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,509
its that has a different letter Tess

505
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:53,909
its enormous package with him so far you
could set

506
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:57,460
the all despite SpiceJet glow stick

507
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,980
who the room so even is the default pic
it is very

508
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,220
but we shot you could have a packet to
test some

509
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,950
some some bites virtual it it was a
information element

510
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:12,529
cost close to show you that not every

511
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:16,980
packages reach Beitzel

512
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,349
okay that's the trying to get

513
00:33:20,349 --> 00:33:23,609
the a demonstration

514
00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:27,629
again it's not always yes my no

515
00:33:27,629 --> 00:33:28,850
the on

516
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:34,830
therefore have to reconnect to my for

517
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:38,740
first search again puzzle

518
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:42,410
base stations i connect with guns are

519
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:46,400
we start some movements or so during the
last post:

520
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,330
a six months waiting was one of more
favorite

521
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:57,330
proper operations audit maybe

522
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:04,370
country to invest some time to 'em and

523
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:09,429
to fix the go to patch the task or
function of hoping to just to make it

524
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:16,429
little bit clever more clever her

525
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,690
up for this affected I want to say

526
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:32,340
sounded again only very very short
packard

527
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,840
or drano

528
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:42,580
make it work usually it rates %um

529
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:49,580
it was two terms one of those your

530
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,920
okay or room they're basically the same

531
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,030
accept or send another pic but the

532
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:08,040
a a toilet or not well I don't think it
will work again

533
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,410
the said it's it's very strange
sometimes

534
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:14,940
and so no best part of this talk

535
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:20,690
from some not gonna text analytics on
attacks that have never been done on the

536
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:21,790
Chisholm network

537
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:25,120
owns the texts I'm not really new but as
a

538
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:29,560
never been done on such as a network my
eye and decided to

539
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:32,610
through some research on the state
machines

540
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:36,720
a.m. with them my focus on the

541
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,840
runs a institutions ok so no but it's
quite Birmingham or station side

542
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,960
of course again that's not limitation
you could also

543
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,010
thought to play wrong place or the

544
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:51,340
state machine a few 30 operator or from
the

545
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:55,650
no all or openly features and stuff like
this

546
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:59,610
the but I own it its a mover subscriber
side in

547
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:03,080
its you have so many possibilities

548
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,970
its or loan if you want to do with this
ideal

549
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:11,290
clever way in a good way it will take
you you know

550
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:14,960
I think yes a the user ID

551
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,440
the year behind is this normal attack is
into test the correct behavior of the

552
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,470
implementation

553
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,630
percent incorrect messages but the

554
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:30,290
maraldo so this would be a really easy
to do with this KB since you could do

555
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,590
some programming

556
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,750
or and as a default pic issue or using

557
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:37,950
already value packages so you could
start

558
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:42,930
for example by sending the basic package
tourists and

559
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:46,299
this more respected than try to its the

560
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:51,330
more information elements and and change
so all of the picket so which will

561
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:54,490
the said so so much so many
possibilities

562
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:57,890
it for if you're not reverse engineering
is a

563
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:03,319
mmm the basements take on the other side
at the same time

564
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:08,020
some black box testing will take you
very very very old

565
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:12,020
yes and no for the persons out of there
with you know

566
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,640
state machine I think it was a few
furious with know what it is

567
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:20,470
a its own illustration your own that's a
subgraph or so

568
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:23,520
more posts station state machine your

569
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,349
your was the state's insanity want
action and suddenly

570
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:32,690
get to the next eight and so on and no
one's idea would be for example to

571
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:37,119
in to you join State won the US you sent
in

572
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,829
event the and trees at the event

573
00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:44,130
you try to reach in states that it's not
some next stage but

574
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:47,369
so one that comes at sea and two or
something like this:

575
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:50,780
a.m. yes

576
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:55,810
as I said how does this work in progress
them given the complexity and

577
00:37:55,810 --> 00:38:00,130
bull to you should too try it on
different phones and solar

578
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:03,160
are its a lot of work

579
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,210
so your I will present knows it a quiz
some recall clearer

580
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:11,369
example a court hearing this from your
stone

581
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:14,810
your your you're finished in

582
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:18,779
your call 02 you disconnect and to
release a

583
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:24,329
linking to channel and so on the to
support the room call one how it

584
00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:28,230
is the defining the specifications and

585
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:31,460
your the idea is no your

586
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:35,839
one idea I heard I think that's why I
picked his example because I tried to

587
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:36,200
lot

588
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,210
a.m. I think it's easy to understand

589
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:43,710
or what what you quick to reach you miss
you no managed to somehow

590
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:47,349
reach a state where instead of loan

591
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:51,270
releasing the the the channel you manage
to

592
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:57,009
the to makes use only things that you
and help but in reality you're still

593
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:02,900
somewhere somewhere you you we created a
link and your use propping or something

594
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:03,500
like this:

595
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,950
on the composition arms that was
suddenly I at

596
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:12,220
I'm to illustrates this stuff for
example you're calling the

597
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:16,040
director or something bank and you're
talking to him and off to you or

598
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,109
hanging up but in reality you're still
listening

599
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:23,000
what's happening on the other side so
you quit gather some information on

600
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,319
but I know some confidential information
results also knowing that was one of the

601
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:27,880
idea

602
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,930
a the I

603
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:33,990
trite to to

604
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:38,339
to reach our noses sonya to test case
with it so

605
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:42,319
it was like gophers are all you set up
the phone call but instead of for

606
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:45,410
finishing the mccall

607
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:48,920
like it's specified here with on general
release

608
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,280
the your sanity you're sending her into
doping by originated

609
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,160
was the package we use to set up the
phone call for example so

610
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,529
maybe depending on holes implementation
is

611
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:04,520
it his quickly it to the fact that the
phone would

612
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,630
said up again as a phone call or
something like this:

613
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:13,190
well at least that was my idea winter so
contest was basically the same thing I

614
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,750
did but instead of

615
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,790
assembly room set up mobile originated
you're sending some

616
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:22,099
connect acknowledge or something like
that so you hope that

617
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:25,380
phone we're weary

618
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,480
connects you or we create a link it was
a

619
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,829
for but area this through example didn't
work or at least not on my first

620
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:38,140
are well I only had much more careful so

621
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,450
which is not very very the clever for

622
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:45,430
testing since the I

623
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:48,649
guess state machinery is a most part we
use

624
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:52,079
used to say we're even support of for PS

625
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:57,579
the age difference but I phoned other
things that look over we pour my there

626
00:40:57,579 --> 00:40:58,530
are

627
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:01,849
still looking into it but its

628
00:41:01,849 --> 00:41:05,450
it's like always issue only is this
phone still you cannot do much was it

629
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:06,930
you should tell for some

630
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:10,169
developer phone solely for it some or
all of them

631
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:13,640
they spent stick to reverse engineer and
than you would

632
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,859
term to ensure you would find it

633
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:19,680
serious

634
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,020
the in

635
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,590
really easy way because I'm pretty sure
there's plenty of stuff to find

636
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:30,710
yep from so that was basically
everything that

637
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:34,230
to present to your I only

638
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:38,360
some words for the source code the

639
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,480
I was standing there looking just over
my own

640
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,600
repository and are I

641
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:49,240

has it and maybe the

643
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,430
