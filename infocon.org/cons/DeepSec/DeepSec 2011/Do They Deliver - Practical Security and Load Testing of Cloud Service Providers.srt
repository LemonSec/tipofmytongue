1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,050
but I love my talk is to deliver
practical note and Security testing of

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,320
blood service providers

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,480
and as it is okay this is

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,480
short introduction of my company

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,529
well walk BMW which is located in
Heidelberg we are sure a small

6
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:26,090
a security consulting company in ali
also organizes another conference

7
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,029
on of focuses on corporate security in
Bariloche

8
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,190
international environments and in these
environments the ozone

9
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:39,339
came to do some research on cloud
security and we're giving workshops

10
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,420
and on stuff like that and

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,399
in the cause of this home activities
disc

12
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,300
to stalk kind of developed and as it is
stated here

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,780
arm we have some war stories to tell arm

14
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,460
the first part is mom presentation of
flow testing results

15
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,910
so people kept asking us during the
workshops I what are the real benefits

16
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,000
of cloud computing

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,250
and today to leave I'll what they
promise

18
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,010
someone speaking of cloud service
providers and the second part

19
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:16,390
yes some results of penetration tests of
cloud service providers

20
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,860
applications hosted yeltsin's price arm

21
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,200
you fall on this main part on of course
I want to give a

22
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,229
shot definition of cloud computing arm

23
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:31,140
I will come back way this is important
and of course what motivation

24
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,090
why to stop against I'll to deliver and

25
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,460
even though it's arm collection of war
stories

26
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,220
on iraq what some lessons to learn when
you want to use cloud-based services

27
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,390
on deploy IT infrastructure in a cloud
computing environment so

28
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,170
arm we always try to abstract from

29
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,110
concrete stories to more channels let
channel lessons that can be

30
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,930
applied on a broader scale so I want to
start

31
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:04,350
with the definition of cloud computing
arm this is usually a slight just seein

32
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,380
any talk on cloud computing about
security in because it's

33
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,880
arm buying all the only was it which are
they say Shin of the most accepted

34
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,720
definition of cloud computing

35
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,989
understand finishing is given by Dennis
I think most of you guys will be

36
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:20,180
familiar with the newest

37
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,410
on their guidelines and I'm actually not
that happy

38
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,400
with the muzah which relies Asian which
is provided by our cloud security that I

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:28,780
like

40
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,610
which is not stated on the slide and
unwind arm

41
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,680
but anyhow this is a robber on formal
definition

42
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,890
kind of academic approach so I usually

43
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,940
go another way arm who of you who this
arm

44
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,400
already started any instances

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,230
in any cloud service and okay

46
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:54,268
for people okay and I mean these are

47
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:57,700
Fife okay still not that impressive arm

48
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,180
and I mean basically most of us are
using any kind of

49
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,860
what is called cloud-based services like
I i assume almost anybody has a

50
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,420
a Google Mail account home whether you
use it on lot

51
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,580
arm but still I want you arm

52
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,450
comes as a more concrete examples what
cloud computing needs

53
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,709
actually means on besides this
definition and then I will come back to

54
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:21,500
this definition

55
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,690
the sister a user interface after Amazon

56
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,650
easy to web interface the management
interface where you can

57
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,799
click on this button and then eight
weeks later you have a fully functional

58
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,980
versions of a running and those eight
clicks take you

59
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,190
maybe thirty seconds and another 20
seconds and two instances running

60
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:47,019
the public IP address full-blown Linux
or Windows installation we can look in

61
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,830
and I'm by the same it clicks you can
also start

62
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,730
20 instances of the same machine so this
is one example

63
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,010
how cloud computing books and I usually
get this example

64
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,069
because many people arm on the Familia

65
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:05,640
with the term cloud computing anybody
else about it when we asked during our

66
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,290
luck sucks

67
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,569
from bookshelves forgiven cloud
computing we have stuff like oh yeah

68
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:14,030
on cloud computing that stirs our stuff
on image processing on editing

69
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,190
on the Internet on because they are
referring to

70
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,969
home commercial Microsoft I guess wait a

71
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,300
offer such a service all even more
interesting than laws and services like

72
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:25,669
gold

73
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:29,849
cloud Girlfriend alike on you can
register their on Form

74
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,479
I don't know how many books among ago
keeps posting to your Facebook wall

75
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,900
albright's message us on Twitter and
pretends to be a girlfriend so

76
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,190
this is obviously not really related to
cloud computing

77
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,930
even though arm for some people this
might be interesting song I dunno

78
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,580
um actually a hard on this on the radio

79
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,620
so don't get wrong ideas him um

80
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,449
questions II

81
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:01,060
and I don't know if it's blood culture
and the like that's what I heard

82
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,710
so on I'm not sure this comic but I
think will be without you

83
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:11,060
if you're in need alright these examples
why it is important to define

84
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,060
cloud computing on before we talk about
security implications of it

85
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,720
so basically im does a shot shots by not
putting the finishing

86
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,509
arm what amazon is offering here in this
Elastic Compute Cloud ec2

87
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:27,880
arm is Infrastructure as a Service such
as infrastructure you get 'em

88
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,659
muscles all the digicam completely
completely operate by yourself

89
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,240
you can look in you have root access
administrative access

90
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,020
and you can do whatever you want arm
with this instance

91
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,359
arm another cloud offering is to Google
App Engine

92
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,220
the Google App Engine so-called platform
as a service environment

93
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,539
and to develop applications on using a
well-defined API which is

94
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:54,669
provided by Google into in terms of
Google

95
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:58,409
its typically job all piping
applications

96
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,729
with some on special API cost that you
can use

97
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:05,130
on to access the User authentication
service all

98
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:08,370
on the day just saw and when you've
developed an application

99
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,660
you upload it and your application is
hosted in the same environment

100
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,750
us Google Mail Google calendars host

101
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,690
arm you don't have to do %um with the
operation

102
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,690
system-level arm it's just important

103
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:27,180
that you developed application and could
be take scale all of the other stuff

104
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,490
so these into a typical a cloud service
offerings

105
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,669
and based on these all okay

106
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:37,659
seems like there is a slight missing so
I go back arm

107
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,889
based on these two examples arm I want
to explain this definition a little bit

108
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:43,389
more in detail

109
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:47,330
so on the dawn mostly on show some
deployment models

110
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,120
on basically done to on the left are
important for us

111
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,259
which is public and private cloud
environments

112
00:06:54,259 --> 00:06:57,440
so public cloud computing home as what
Google

113
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,840
all Amazon of a sauce a platform where
anybody can look in

114
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,919
and use the resources home as long as
they kept

115
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:09,880
pay for it arm all customers a soft on
the same hardware

116
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,430
Hong every be customized street at equal
to other customers

117
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:18,000
and you get the sense of it as any other
custom

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,120
and its the most important thing it's
open for anybody in and you have no idea

119
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,569
arm whether you US officers are on the
same heartworm

120
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:30,630
services a market competitor I'll on
your data's host

121
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,680
next to the date of my cat compared

122
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,560
arm the opposite as a private cloud
computing environment

123
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,770
private a means to cloud computing us
environments operator

124
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,630
exclusively for one custom this does not
necessarily

125
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,280
necessarily mean that its operated by
one custom

126
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,330
they're all also cloud service provider
which

127
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,419
of a sophist a rage private cloud for
long

128
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,919
custom us and then use a hotly
exclusively

129
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:03,960
if you own storage and nobody else is
using

130
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,660
home your computing sauces I will

131
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,770
come back to this why private clouds a
pretty interesting

132
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:15,199
I'm from usability perspective I mean
you've already seen

133
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,770
summed up in the face I think it's
Brianna quite arm

134
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,810
comfortable to have such a functionality
like doing a clicks

135
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,080
I'm than having I'll full-blown Linux

136
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,099
running arm

137
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:31,509
I said I don't like to switch less Asian
that much because it's

138
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:35,469
arm supposing that there are real ales
technical meaning

139
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:38,959
which day on so this laos just was alert
was a nice Asian

140
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,159
of different characteristics of cloud
computing so

141
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,100
arm the middle a.m. chose to serve as
models which offered by cloud service

142
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,070
providers

143
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,310
which Infrastructure as a Service
Platform as a Service & Software as a

144
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:51,970
Service

145
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,130
I think most of you have heard about
this so infrastructure

146
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:58,600
as a service is providing arm much its
almost

147
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,930
muscle writings that operating systems
that you can use

148
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,149
that run as a service is providing an
API you develop your own application

149
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:10,440
uploaded to the cloud service provider
withstanding running this application

150
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,720
no environment by his choice you cannot
influence this environment

151
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,800
and Software as a Service on Thomas

152
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,500
just using software which is hosted on
arm

153
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,769
infrastructure on a platform as a
Service lien this is are

154
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:29,839
importance effects usually arm

155
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,269
actually display of miss layup by itself
so

156
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:36,839
arm any platform as a Service Cloud
Service Provider users

157
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,480
Infrastructure as a Service services to
host/has

158
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,089
on offering and all Software as a
Service

159
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:48,149
arm almost Software as a Service
offerings are based on

160
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:52,459
platform as a service which again space
and Infrastructure as a Service

161
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:56,220
so within this middle layer we have are
indeed

162
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,880
layout architectural

163
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,160
um any of these offerings can be

164
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,680
of art in a private law or a public lot
so they can be arbitrary combination

165
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,959
of between DC friendly us arm it's not

166
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,089
like long as a strict signed

167
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:18,019
of service models to deployment models
of the most interesting part

168
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:21,350
are the essential characteristics which
%uh proposed finest for cloud computing

169
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,690
environments

170
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,370
we have five characteristic
characteristics with her which have to

171
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,170
be fulfilled by any cloud computing
provider

172
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:34,390
wants to be called all not provide all
anything was clouding

173
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,410
some on the left side with prop excess

174
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,949
on I think this is pretty obvious your
data is hosted on

175
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,050
in a foreign data center so both the
data center and decline

176
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:49,320
need to brought not network connection
to be able to excesses stayed and usable

177
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,170
way

178
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:54,479
then yes rapid elasticity this is one of
two

179
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,620
more important points rapid elasticity
means you can scale up your resources

180
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,120
quickly up and down like launching
another $20 Amazon instances

181
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,180
with them seconds if you needed and

182
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,260
if you don't need it you can scale it
all desis

183
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,519
I'm close to you related to 2-2 on
pay-as-you-go

184
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,910
which is also often cited when talking
about cloud computing environments

185
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,990
which is not included in the sense that
you characteristics

186
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,019
on the next one is measured service
across the globe trotters provider must

187
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,250
be able to measure

188
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,839
the resources you have used to be able
to pin you

189
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,070
I and tong this provides quite good
feedback

190
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:37,350
home about the recert resource you you
such a plot services have

191
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,800
so arm disguises kind of win-win
situation

192
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,940
lot service provider on a toss appealing
and

193
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,970
the clubhouse to mark gets quite good
statistics about

194
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,209
resource usage like Hong processing

195
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:54,269
pol bank then we have on the man says
service

196
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:58,560
arm all of these other parts also
applied to classic

197
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,769
hosting provide us maybe sewed on the
month so sellers

198
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:07,260
quite important just management
interfaces like the one of a Muslim

199
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,300
you can do it clicks by yourself you
don't have to call

200
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,290
any operator in the data center on on
you don't need human interaction

201
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,500
you don't need to click you can also run
a script

202
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,720
and you can configure your cloud
computing

203
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,769
environment just the way you want it

204
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:27,230
and the most interesting part is
resource pooling

205
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,170
arm this is related to the economies of
scale cloud service providers

206
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:35,449
able on to provide a good of us on
computing capacity in

207
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:39,000
because on the pool their resources
together on and off

208
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,089
and us i increase the

209
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:45,290
utilisation of the hardware and

210
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:50,069
bus last spare capacity which is a
coasted one-touch

211
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:54,709
or at least often cited cost advantage
related to this resource pooling is the

212
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:56,370
concept of multi-tenancy

213
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,470
I was also already talking about this
when

214
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,769
talking about public lot service
providers multi-tenancy means

215
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:07,019
that on the same hardware different
custom us operated

216
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,240
so arm this different custom us I'll

217
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,130
on isolated by different controls like
much less Asian

218
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,820
on the storage system long

219
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,930
different access control mechanisms
access control systems

220
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:25,450
on the network layer using kinda
privately Lance or something like that

221
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,760
so this resource pooling s are closely
related

222
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,950
onto isolation and to the multi-tenancy
concept

223
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,320
saw arm given this definition arm

224
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,050
I also launched talk about shot
motivation might important to deal with

225
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,600
cloud computing across cloud computing
is a much

226
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,269
new technology and introduces kind of
venue central computing paradigm

227
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:51,269
I refuse cloud computing of degrees
coast and improved availability

228
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:54,470
at least this is what we're sales guys
tell you when they

229
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,750
I want to convince you to move just saw
this is to the clout

230
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,949
and this book's quite well arm

231
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:05,990
I mean during our cloud security book
shops home

232
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,510
we would like to say okay don't use the
cloud for sensitive data

233
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,550
home because it's would be a good advice
many

234
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,019
on cases because it depends on the
concrete situation

235
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:19,620
but usually arm some managers already
decided today

236
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,160
how to save spoken ants then oh okay we
can

237
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,209
reduce law it. coast when we go to the
clout so

238
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:30,589
let's do this arm almost the same for
any new technology

239
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:33,760
saw arm the main motivation to do you

240
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,160
cloud security of cloud computing is to
deliver

241
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,560
all of these promises and

242
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,620
that's why we performed some more tests
home

243
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,079
partly be on behalf of customers because
they were interested what I did

244
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,139
real benefits and of course we want it
to be able

245
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:54,180
arm to give our customers millet
feedback on

246
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,230
about scalability possibilities

247
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,310
of cloud computing environments and

248
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,699
arm holiday performed usually

249
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:08,589
other sister arm first part

250
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:11,690
as I do they deliver to scalability
promising

251
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:16,510
I mean when we think about um the
central characteristic scale ability is

252
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,329
not part

253
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:21,420
of it so still our customers usually

254
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,209
are referred to and the scalability of
availability in

255
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:30,339
all when they talk about cloud computing
and what they want to get out of it

256
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:33,680
so arm the first question is home

257
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,820
do they deliver scalable computing
environment

258
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:40,070
in doing so arm I evaluated

259
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,070
three major lots of other service
providers which Google App Engine

260
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,829
Amazon Elastic Beanstalk and Salesforce
foster com

261
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:51,730
these %uh platform as a service
providers and from up on the few

262
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,060
arm that from a song it is a very
interesting offering

263
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,889
because it abstracts from a lot of

264
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:02,389
icon sets for high-availability you
don't have to deal with load balancing

265
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:03,360
anymore

266
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,279
you don't have to deal with on data
storage done in C&A does cost

267
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,810
data store scalability anymore on and
even more important

268
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,959
and has not been in the valuation
platform as a Service

269
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,410
arm performance yet there have been some
heavy

270
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,000
evaluation of infrastructure as a
service performance like

271
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,470
a whole world dude on a months-long
instances per phone compared to

272
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,480
as a instances even though asians
platform as a service and moment

273
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,820
arm but there is no from evaluation be a

274
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,040
be performed platform as a service on
mints soul

275
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,500
arm coming from the attack upon

276
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,660
perspective home I thought okay that's
low test

277
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,269
these platforms and let's see when they
on break down

278
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:50,730
so the first serve was to develop an
application

279
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:55,050
on which allowed the load testing on
this application

280
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:59,290
arm must be able to run on these
different lot from so

281
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:03,149
it was necessary to develop in abstract
idea of a lawful

282
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:06,800
small publication am small batch of
publication

283
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,178
which of a basic customer functionality
like

284
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:14,539
buying products such infrastructure on
stuff like that

285
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:18,679
soem arm of cost these applications had
to be developed

286
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:22,260
following let on scalability best
practices otherwise

287
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,500
on the results but if not being
meaningful because it is a okay

288
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,590
you're a bad cold are you did not follow
our guidelines so

289
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,110
arm this results do not really apply to
all

290
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,799
platform from apart from the clubs
provide a point maybe

291
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,230
and cause I wanted to provide a
comparison arm

292
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:44,340
to the old world so also deployed this
application on a

293
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,750
old on physical saw I'll come back

294
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,080
to pump itself later soul

295
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,750
arm doing different challenges in doing
so of Kos

296
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:00,130
as a penetration test and studies for go
to its not thats

297
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:04,429
easy to implement applications on all of
these platforms following

298
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:07,900
best practices it was kind of a tough
work

299
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,380
when you're not used to developing and
it was important

300
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:16,150
on but to develop platform put lower
than any component of the platform as a

301
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,400
service tech

302
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,350
I mean infrastructure as a service
usually of us you i watch the system

303
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,799
but platform as a service and monument
utilize different components like load

304
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:26,730
balancers the

305
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,220
underlying data store application some
itself and of course

306
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,289
network infrastructure so the
application was developed in a way

307
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:38,419
which allow what arm the generation of
malt

308
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:41,480
on any of these different components

309
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:46,260
bang home cause it was necessary to
develop stay below testing framework

310
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,030
I mean there are a lot of low testing
from us available arm

311
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:53,230
but I think you know that when you're
developing something on your own on the

312
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,570
time to adopt

313
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,070
a framework or developed you all on set
of scripts which

314
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:02,530
same arm almost whole sequel

315
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:06,730
so I'm using this great book I was
evaluating different lot service

316
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,330
provider

317
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,730
I already introduced on in terms of
latency

318
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,740
so which time does it take for them

319
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,289
like thomas also environment two hosts

320
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:21,330
to softer requests of increasing number
of concurrent users

321
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:25,260
solo testing framework simulated William
valid users

322
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,820
one user for example dos five products
such as SPICE

323
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,178
örebro ducts delete this on shopping
cart

324
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:36,799
for one-time I don't have to concrete
numbers in my hand

325
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,360
but something like that this is one
simulated user and the No testing

326
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,200
framework

327
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,500
arm simulates on concurrent user dang

328
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,840
two concurrent users and so on arm

329
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,600
for defiant maximum number of users
across these

330
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,260
users assimilate in peril her alone so

331
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,789
it was possible to measure the overall
overall time

332
00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:01,850
which blood from the Society's
environment

333
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:05,559
took to arms soft all of these requests

334
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:09,350
some coming to them first results

335
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,520
arm first result is of Google App Engine

336
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,720
Google App Engine provides you on
environment on

337
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,650
to deploy your Java piping application
directly into

338
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,480
a scaleable hosting environment
comprising of a not balance on

339
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,900
applications almost and the Big Data
storm

340
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,500
arm they give you feedback how many

341
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,049
budgets of us are running at the moment
to host you about application

342
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:38,639
but you have no way to influence the
number of applications

343
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,400
this is the way how platform as a
service environments usually book

344
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,179
the host your application them and then
take care of all the stuff to provide it

345
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:51,200
in a available and reliable way

346
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,260
so arm assimilated up to 50 users

347
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,370
arm on the Google App Engine lot from

348
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,940
and we see acts to development of the
latency

349
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,700
home up to fifty use on arm increases a
little bit more than Danielle

350
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,309
still is a smart abet footprint for
application

351
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:15,629
more interesting yes that's me can see
that there are some areas

352
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,820
whether latency decreases again

353
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,590
and all of these areas can be directly

354
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,549
I'm compared to the time work will start
at this number two instances

355
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:30,320
if I remember correctly at the point
when fifty

356
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,668
concurrent users who access and
application I think Google you something

357
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:35,570
like sixteen instances

358
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:39,620
arm to hosted applications still

359
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:45,280
in are acceptable time so we all see
that the time is increasing

360
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,110
this would have been arm morning will

361
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:53,309
the same number of users would have been
running for a longer time

362
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:58,139
because spawning instance us would have
been finished and instances would have

363
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,820
been available to host

364
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,020
the application but still development
it's not that bad

365
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,770
so on this one result it's not that
interesting to talk about it

366
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:13,039
when we have no comparison so the Nexus
August of the Amazon Elastic Beanstalk

367
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,879
at a short introduction of Amazon ec2

368
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,390
Elastic Compute lot am which is
infrastructure-as-a-service offering

369
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:25,799
awesome so lasting in stock as a
platform as a Service

370
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:29,520
million well which uses all of the
components

371
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,309
which offer Amazon so artistic Beanstalk
compile

372
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:36,480
combines applications of us and database
of us

373
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,380
hosted in the c2 and arm load balancing
cellmark's others

374
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,650
of Amazon which load balancers HTTP
requests between

375
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:49,330
applications

376
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:52,350
so in case of an awesome it is possible
to define

377
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:57,830
thresholds like arm on the CPU
utilization utilization eighty percent

378
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,840
please Amazon spawn more instances

379
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:06,199
tells my application and home you can
also configure load balancing service

380
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,289
so I was mainly interests arm

381
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:13,900
I would Amazon be performing when we
only have one instance running

382
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,539
so I used to the biggest available
instance at that time

383
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:20,590
arm which was a I think it was called

384
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:24,370
home four-time extra-large instance with
like something

385
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:29,080
something like 72 gigabyte wrong and 16
Cebu cost

386
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,309
I don't remember the correct number last
part we have to Steve element

387
00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:36,500
this development cost a basically better

388
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,690
anyone of the Google App Engine busy we
help

389
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:43,650
lo awm arm response times arm

390
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:48,419
overall response times for increasing
number of users almost no increase up to

391
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:52,700
like 27 of 30 users then we have a long

392
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:57,080
lit each Erdem and the lead and zinc
roof increases to

393
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,830
60 milliseconds 60 seconds fall off to
use us

394
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:05,360
arm just was would be okay we have
experienced some

395
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,900
performance chip us and watch list
environments before long they're all the

396
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,870
papers on it

397
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:13,130
which described as she does but more
interesting is

398
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:16,190
arm the shop basically to drop home

399
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:20,620
when wrong simulating more than 57
concurrent users

400
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:25,220
armpit was reproducible that when a
simulated more than 57 concurrent users

401
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,590
on Amazon sons became unavailable

402
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:32,260
so the load balancer on-site with a HTTP
503

403
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:36,179
so I was unavailable wrong and this was
reproducible any

404
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:41,190
anytime I simulated modern 57 users
audience and became unavailable

405
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,230
arm which is not a big deal I mean on

406
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:49,110
to months of fifty use of Google App
Engine was using

407
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:52,659
arm 16 instances so just begin stands

408
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:56,840
almost doing quite well up to 50 users

409
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,610
but still arm simulating modern 57 users

410
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:03,710
home it was possible to crash the

411
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,409
application audubon arm when I stop a
test

412
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:11,299
took on five to six minutes and and and
the environment recovered and became

413
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:13,049
responsible again

414
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:16,820
so I will not make any overall complete
conclusion cm

415
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:20,000
arm let's see how foster Kong story

416
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,000
on yeah

417
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:32,870
what do you mean kind of a and to deny
love song as much on

418
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:37,270
when they see that the Lord is too high
I mean that would mean

419
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:41,920
arm when I customize hosting

420
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:45,850
high-traffic application in the cloud an
awesome but on of

421
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:49,850
this instance because there's too much
traffic that's not ideal for

422
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:55,430
okay

423
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,760
arm still I do not get really the point
um

424
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,770
you was you will see later why I don't
think this is true I have another

425
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:06,600
nother story in this and basically I
don't think that got service provider

426
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,020
who you pay on to host application
available way

427
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,429
arm shit on a few instances just

428
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:17,090
traffic on them yeah

429
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:22,450
I read what

430
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,730
like what are you referring to a
concrete paragraph

431
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:30,190
arm

432
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:33,910
drew I mean they they have something in
the Tom condition like

433
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:37,020
we protect against denial-of-service
only

434
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:43,090
yeah I mean that that would mean

435
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:46,170
um you all you want to host your
application at Amazon

436
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:50,580
and you're not knowledge to perform load
testing of applications

437
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:56,639
a mean basically diesel notice of my
application

438
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,330
so not a Muslim don't get me wrong here

439
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,320
um we'll

440
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,220
I mean I will come back to this and did
not sell the stuff we have another funny

441
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:08,840
story

442
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:14,480
so arm yeah the results are fostered
calm I'm not really happy with them

443
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,000
I mean basically this is work in
progress on faucet.com of us

444
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,280
user interface which is heavily relying
on chavis'

445
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,330
John Oscar so it's not possible on to
use my pretty lightweight

446
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:29,530
I called based arm no testing framework

447
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:32,580
so I had to use and then %um may be in
order to its own

448
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,710
on but the education test environment
which utilizes brawls us

449
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:41,200
I follow testing there also commercials
all sounds like a problem all

450
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,809
which das you so then you might fall
cloud-based

451
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:49,040
Lotus thing so I dot II adopt that this
approach

452
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,480
and due to my limited so the site

453
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,280
arm a client sites on computing capacity
I was only able to simulate up to 14

454
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:57,940
users

455
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:02,460
on before the client-side limitations
what punchan I mean this is an important

456
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,429
part i

457
00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:06,470
always monitored decline sides arm

458
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,750
system utilization to make sure I am
thats those drop is not because my

459
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,919
client cannot handle

460
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:17,210
more concurrent users 10:57 the time saw

461
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:20,500
we have two results of Awesome Kong
which arm

462
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,830
also interesting boston.com has very
poor response times

463
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,840
and we see that even on from to

464
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,309
to are something like six user last song

465
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:34,580
response times almost doubled by effect
of

466
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:39,678
home two-and-a-half so these results are
definitely not compatible

467
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,720
to the other ones because it is worse
using the call

468
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,280
other base load testing from bargains
based on the selenium results which is

469
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,570
complete different thing but also here
we can see

470
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:54,220
some decreases maybe when additional
instances are spawned

471
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,700
arm and there was some other problems
but still

472
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,120
on foster Thomas long pretty bad follow
testing

473
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,010
you should have that in mind when you
think about are using foster com

474
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:09,390
armed a more interesting result your
stuff to physical saw

475
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:14,700
I was using physical solo 1 gigabyte
from and like to CPU cost

476
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,770
arm hosting I think it was the same time
cuts

477
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:21,639
I know it was the same tomcat server
version which was running at Amazon

478
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,530
and I noticed it exactly same

479
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:29,240
arm application that was running on
Amazon

480
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,360
and this is the result I mean this
application

481
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,360
this self I was able to handle seventy
concurrent users

482
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,750
at the same time arm I mean one can say
my applications poorly developed

483
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:45,770
have cost but still we have to direct
comparison from the Amazon and stuns

484
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:50,210
arm to dis local on server instance
which is

485
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,590
way less powerful than that and the
Amazon's

486
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:57,179
level awaaz scalability on development

487
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:00,409
it's not a bad it's still polonium but

488
00:30:00,409 --> 00:30:03,610
if your room remember to call for I'm us
on

489
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:07,700
it was way better so this is arm
interesting results

490
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:11,940
on that you have to consider when you
want to use cloud-based services

491
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,830
muscle might not on BS powerful for your
processing

492
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:19,480
arm as local instances maybe some

493
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,600
arm this is where this point comes

494
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,270
horizontal wells is watching the
scalability you can get from

495
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:29,710
on these results that I'm saying OK
should not use and was on because they

496
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,090
deliver poor performance

497
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:34,250
arm this is partly true as we saw

498
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,600
it depends on to use that scenario arm

499
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,010
botched in case of a months-long you do
eight clicks and then you have not one

500
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:42,940
instance but

501
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,350
five instances and an automatic load
balancer

502
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:49,740
so this is way easier to scaling when
you go

503
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,320
beyond the limitations that you have fun
for your physical soleus

504
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,510
and when you have to physically celosa
cannot just okay

505
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:00,610
you can turn them off but you don't get
the money initial investment back

506
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:05,049
saw arm this is a pretty important point
I want to make

507
00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:08,389
on cloud computing environments rely
heavily on

508
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:11,400
what I call horizontal scalability like

509
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,500
many instances which host application
and not want to go

510
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,669
on scalability make the system bigger
and bigger

511
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:22,809
I mean doesn't lament we all know that
other for Amazon even though you can get

512
00:31:22,809 --> 00:31:26,210
I'm pretty big instance astaire so

513
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:29,600
and its cloud service providers
different characteristics

514
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,270
and your to address them I went to
develop the application

515
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:37,000
arm if on so long to have to use

516
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,640
some characteristics in mind when you
want to plan for you know testing

517
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,750
cloud computing environments but I will
come back to this late in my overall

518
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,620
summary

519
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,230
arm speaking with Amazon and

520
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:52,450
ability to a txt scare you environment
from

521
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:56,120
one instance which hosts 50 users
through 20 instances

522
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,790
which self 20 users arm Stinson's be
nice

523
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:04,928
but I guess you on her art arm about
security concerns in cloud computing

524
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:08,980
so arm the scalability at one touch

525
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:12,540
home by management in the faces which
allow quick scalability

526
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:17,300
in a horizontal away us wanted one touch
of cloud computing

527
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:23,860
arm for me the Tom security concerns as
way to channel so I was

528
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,960
thinking be how could re refine security
concerns

529
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,710
in cloud computing environments arm we
cannot have a structured

530
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:35,409
discussion about this when you're not
even clear about to concerns that we

531
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:36,500
have so

532
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,980
arm when I think often evaluation we did

533
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,980
arm his concerns become a little bit
more euro

534
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,210
are we had any valuation of them
Software as a Service Cloud Service

535
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,559
Provider

536
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:51,270
on they offered some kind of a human
resources management solution

537
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:55,000
and custom of us arm wanted to know from

538
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,659
ass became with these 3 cloud service
providers

539
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:02,429
which is the most secure one so on
whether to arm

540
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:06,179
evaluation of the cloud service
providers and one of two

541
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:10,960
3 cloud service providers Creech home
that we were allowed to perform a pen

542
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,700
test

543
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:16,260
I mean this is all so related to Terms
of Use oMG another large

544
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:20,540
to do penetration testing arm of you
have lots of instances

545
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:25,620
a muscle on you have two from request

546
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:29,290
you have to fill in the request but it's
almost song

547
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:32,850
right using about formula hosted an
awesome

548
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:36,460
and you submit a request and animals
incest okay and you have three days

549
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:42,250
you allowed Japan to stay on
applications and the clock

550
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:46,640
so this is I'm pretty true for all adult
service providers you don't have much

551
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,049
room for contract negotiations

552
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:52,309
so it was quite surprising which

553
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:55,760
at least one cloud service provider
agreed me

554
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,230
upon the pen test so arm

555
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:02,640
the target Wilson on human resources
were publication

556
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,030
on I don't want to tell much about the
details it's not important

557
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:11,820
so our penetration test hatch to be
enough cause it to be but publication

558
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:12,399
dentist

559
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:16,270
including and testing of the solvent for
infrastructure and pantry

560
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:19,310
interest pension pen testing the clout
home

561
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:24,239
infrastructure like automatic scaling
mechanisms to management interfaces

562
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,460
arm network separation a separation of a
custom us

563
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:31,270
on this would have been the second step
of the test so

564
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:35,790
unfortunately there was no needs to put
wrong cloud-based load testing

565
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:39,730
of the one day we stopped the tests
because we had more secure findings

566
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:42,830
done in moles a pen tests

567
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,830
arm last 20 days mall

568
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,929
so on there wasn't a need to you

569
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:52,720
perform any club bass testing so arm
Monastir

570
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,339
main findings foster's it should be HTTP
port

571
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:59,640
to the bathroom as possible so we were
able to upload our

572
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,259
I think it well Jul 05 they were
executed and we were able to compromise

573
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,990
on to complete application saw arm

574
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:11,550
I'm not sure when you've seen HDB put
enabled

575
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:15,060
online but solid last time but Ross this
is

576
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:20,109
something like arm years ago arm

577
00:35:20,109 --> 00:35:23,430
such a finding home was on last in the
nineties or something like that but

578
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,379
usually

579
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,910
people on that I City which

580
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:33,299
is a bad thing and actually I don't know
how much as possible to enable it should

581
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,000
be put on

582
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,140
pitching that's all I mean on Oct
applications on the softest

583
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,850
disabled by default I can only imagine
that there was some

584
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:44,319
REST style sums running which usually
usually

585
00:35:44,319 --> 00:35:47,759
are utilized alternate HTTP methods but
still

586
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,819
arm this is a horrible security
footprint

587
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:54,540
arm another reason for this being
enabled might be

588
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:58,950
that other shot time to market and any
body wants to do clout

589
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:02,700
and clubs kind of extracted from the
technical concepts I mean you do

590
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:07,150
eight legs and you have 'em on but
instance in the internet running

591
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,760
with the public IP address are you up to
applaud your application

592
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,930
and it is hosted in arm lot built
environment so

593
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:18,649
no need to deal with the technical
concept this

594
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:22,160
I'm still this is a pretty bad a bad
idea arm to have

595
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,359
it should be put in a bit and it was a
horrible finding Ross

596
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:30,710
so um I was talking about structuring
the security concerns boss

597
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:33,930
dismantle arm we have to find another
way

598
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:38,279
to ensure security i mean arm the cloud
service provider was willing to address

599
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,210
decisions

600
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:43,480
on this is maybe interesting side note
arm I think two months later

601
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,790
or something like that where the retest
and

602
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:49,870
guess what ideas to close the findings
that we had

603
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:54,900
any guesses

604
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:01,760
okay I mean that that would have helped
um at least ball pen test

605
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,250
at this modern would also be interesting
choice here good idea no

606
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:08,890
of caustic what about publication file
one in front of it so

607
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:13,180
all we had to do to must to & Co to put
another way and we still have the same

608
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:13,819
finding

609
00:37:13,819 --> 00:37:17,120
buttons on the short side note arm

610
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,839
across these findings arm can be
extracted

611
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,140
too much general conclusions um we have

612
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,350
typical arm controllers to be

613
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:31,600
I recommend custom us when they have to
do you outsourcing providers

614
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,890
party when those whatever and risk
analysis

615
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:38,109
and trust evaluations usually a part of
this

616
00:37:38,109 --> 00:37:42,880
saw um I want to introduce a system
operation like psych

617
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,640
the system operation liked life cycle
home

618
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,900
elaborates the steps mission which
necessary to operate the system

619
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,890
on for example arm you have hardware
which is operated by employees

620
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:59,069
yes you're operating system installed
home by your own employees and to use

621
00:37:59,069 --> 00:37:59,740
you can hop

622
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:03,510
operating system and um based on a
different color us

623
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:07,839
home the Zonda areas of responsibility
which you can influence

624
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,770
other black ones a basically

625
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:15,300
steps and operation life cycle you
cannot influence the cloud service

626
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,080
provider

627
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,850
is responsible for the steps and you
have to trust the cloud service provider

628
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:20,650
that he

629
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:24,819
are would perform these in a secure way
there is no other way

630
00:38:24,819 --> 00:38:28,810
on the new control the steps you can a
controlled please of the cloud service

631
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:29,759
provider

632
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,640
on you have no costume contracts which
can address the

633
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,350
these issues and Jim Tomsula platform as
a service provider

634
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:40,859
on you cannot harm the operating system
which is on which is

635
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:43,990
on in this used in this platform as a
stylistic

636
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:48,010
saw um I think I have to hurry up a
little bit

637
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:52,530
arm water system operation life cycle is
telling us

638
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:57,000
it's not possible to secured a cloud by
all aspects

639
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,240
just simply no possibility because these
arias

640
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,720
at least these areas the yellow ones
also

641
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,460
on under control of the cloud service
provider in leaped onto something

642
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,470
men's it's just impossible to secure the
clout

643
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:15,150
so arm when you look at several risks
which are provided by Nizam

644
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:20,330
and comprehensive risk analysis document
on these are the main risks

645
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:23,940
arm in cloud computing environments and
these risks can be

646
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,460
directly mapped two steps in the system
operation live sighting

647
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,880
so arm for example of governments I mean

648
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,580
the governance of your day job you can
influence themselves 12 30

649
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,980
at least 129 arm you cannot influence

650
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:41,859
lots on same violation failure when you
think about

651
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:47,380
home patch much less Asian appropriate
Networks Inc separation mechanisms

652
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:51,619
all that stuff arm the network is
definitely not under your control

653
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:55,010
anita is the storage which is used by
the cloud service provider to hosted

654
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:56,460
data

655
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,440
arm and of cost militias inside a as the
classical inside example

656
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,190
even though law I would not home
consider this to be a high-risk

657
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:07,490
Altos environment on there are other
ones which

658
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:10,680
more elements from my point of view but
still

659
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:15,020
arm you cannot mitigate those risks
because you cannot tell the clouds but

660
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,660
OK to do not hire this guy you only have
this guy

661
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:21,368
that's not possible so this is what arm

662
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:25,770
system operation live sighting wants to
provide on shot how to structure

663
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:28,790
security concerns this is a key security
concerns

664
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:31,910
which me can address or do we have to
trust

665
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:35,740
arm the cloud service provider and trust
is another important concept

666
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:40,109
arm which we usually use at the NW

667
00:40:40,109 --> 00:40:43,779
arm when we cannot control something
home you have to

668
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:46,890
trust some something to be confident

669
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:51,150
at the end and distrust is usually are
based on SunTrust

670
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:54,339
just affect us on which you can assess

671
00:40:54,339 --> 00:40:57,549
on for cloud service providers well

672
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:00,839
arm distrust picked us mean different
things

673
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:05,319
on we have to just checked just symmetry
and transparency symmetry basically

674
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:05,890
means

675
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:10,049
home just got us the cloud service
provider trust us

676
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:13,359
and transparency eyes process is
transparent

677
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,480
on the sea provide documentation and
Paul about his

678
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,600
security operations and stuff like that
soul

679
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,830
basically transparency and symmetry
would be on the trust to perform pen

680
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:25,880
test

681
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,170
if they do not trust us enough on to
allow us to perform

682
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:33,160
contest on this directly affect our
trust that we are putting

683
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,390
into the clouds arm

684
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:40,359
another I relevant trust factor is
consistency

685
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:44,029
so what happened in the past how did the
cloud service provider perform

686
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:47,069
in the past security incidents where to
alter touch

687
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:51,830
out at just like the Amazon all touch us
and I guess April and June

688
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:55,150
arm and

689
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:59,600
also home past pen test results so

690
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,800
adult service provider we evaluate its
home

691
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,680
way transparent was transparent and as a
trusted us but

692
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,868
are the results from this consistency
from from the stem

693
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:13,069
transparency and symmetry directly
effected

694
00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:16,759
consistency of the clout and

695
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,950
last part is to buy your free what what
do we get a lot of

696
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:24,250
trusting the cloud service provider and
this can be partly evaluated

697
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,410
i'm following introduced no testing
approach

698
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:32,080
that I opera post so these are basically

699
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,720
arm prospectors arm and

700
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:40,250
I am 10 that's to puts high trust in a
Muslim

701
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:43,859
at the beginning of 2011 arm

702
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:46,970
because doing they had 'em

703
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:51,440
they have no relevant security incidents
by the time they had not altered just

704
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,750
they be a very transparent that had the
best security documentation

705
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:58,520
all clubs provide us and onto prices

706
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,220
really good so we also had a value-free
what so it tended to trust

707
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:06,600
an offer Amazon at least onto the
beginning of 2011

708
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,619
soul um the other had some

709
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:13,350
projects home which did not process
confidential data on

710
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:17,790
and we use to not on a lot and most of
our customers were interested in the use

711
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:19,119
such a fan us on

712
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,619
so are we have a Panasonic on and in

713
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:25,730
and the cause of our regular in Tonopah
swat out its

714
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:31,190
we also audited quality of our and us on
the palm possible

715
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:34,890
which is pushing which just wondered to
see what is and isn't doing

716
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:38,930
when we try to put us all on the comp
but still this was kind of to

717
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:41,950
official statement we had a regular
password

718
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:45,140
so what we're doing was are brute
forcing

719
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:49,000
default and the song arm looking
interface

720
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,819
arm fun fact: by the way this is the
same login interface that you use

721
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:57,930
on to put chase DVD's or CDs whatever
you autonomous

722
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:02,190
so the same user Collins use for DVDs
you can on so used to on a budget

723
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:03,000
solvents

724
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,549
much left themselves saw arm

725
00:44:06,549 --> 00:44:10,020
you know it was a tricky said up the
minimum password requirements

726
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:15,150
Amazon well home six characters no other
restrictions over settle a possible up

727
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:15,940
to

728
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:19,779
a sex 6 um wrong number possible ot

729
00:44:19,779 --> 00:44:23,160
six numbers home no other characters

730
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,799
and we try to Bruce for utah State stuff
it was not an easy to brute-force

731
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:32,170
I was quite surprised didn't have been
forcing for a long time before that

732
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:35,650
I'm most current brute forcing to
instant cope well

733
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:40,270
modern abdication authentication
mechanisms like a lot of cookies

734
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:45,009
different scopes and redirect and stuff
like that so I used to box you'd

735
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:49,180
I think but some speakers mentioned of
our approach was in progress

736
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:52,529
and even though it's not a tool for
brute forcing

737
00:44:52,529 --> 00:44:55,549
on did quite well on we performed

738
00:44:55,549 --> 00:44:59,120
on our peak times 80,000 request to all

739
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,839
and we had including some dry runs long
over two days

740
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:06,790
some Alexia for million requests from
one IP address

741
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:10,210
the setup was set up in about 20 minutes

742
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,330
it's described in more detailed blog
entry

743
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:16,410
and basically for some hours be
performed eighty

744
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:20,029
thousand request to all flower Colin
Farrell all

745
00:45:20,029 --> 00:45:23,799
arm passport reiterated through

746
00:45:23,799 --> 00:45:26,980
0001 to nine and on and on

747
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:30,790
saw basically it was possible to boutros
are possible what

748
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:34,410
which is of course intellectual on do
not use on the six numbers

749
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:37,850
even though it's not a productive
account arm

750
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:40,900
I mean it's also not hard to anticipate

751
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:45,040
wants to put roast us what lost and hell

752
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,350
so it was possible to boutros a possible
I think it's not that surprising that

753
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:52,370
it's possible to brute-force passport in
2011

754
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:57,080
under more interesting results boss home
that there was no a conflict alt

755
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,160
no connection throttling no capture
solutions and

756
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,089
um no reaction from another saw no he
made for us

757
00:46:04,089 --> 00:46:07,120
hey it seems like your account is being
abused or something like that

758
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:10,970
no reaction at all saw are following a
responsible

759
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:14,580
on disclosure approach we contacted
Amazon told them hey

760
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:17,580
on we perform the regular password out

761
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:22,370
and there was no response from your site
and this lost what I was getting so

762
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:26,279
elements yes thanks for contacting us
it's great to hear from customers who

763
00:46:26,279 --> 00:46:27,330
are passionate

764
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:30,440
about security just like we are arm and
then

765
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:34,799
we have noticed that your account has a
difficulty in authenticating probably in

766
00:46:34,799 --> 00:46:39,430
and we actually about to contact you so

767
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:43,200
this is a funny side note I mean there's
a does along part of demand which

768
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,370
escaped because

769
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:48,049
on it's more funny when it's put that
way and also

770
00:46:48,049 --> 00:46:51,950
I wrote that he met on Saturday on this
was the response on Monday

771
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:55,040
so they were actually about to contact
us

772
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,650
arm still to be fair besides laughing

773
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:02,100
on we had a very good response of a
months-long

774
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:05,350
on Wareham interesting our conversation

775
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:09,440
be implemented to capture solution
within two weeks or something like that

776
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,730
and we reevaluated at least up you try
to take was not possible anymore

777
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:17,510
so basically to Amazon security team did
a very good job

778
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:20,960
at least on we thought Tom

779
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,240
but this was to distrust thing which
affected my trust in him

780
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,600
on the next long on Sundays of them I
think it was im

781
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,069
on mid-october 2011 some research us

782
00:47:31,069 --> 00:47:34,910
from the who only visited ball home
Germany

783
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:39,040
presented a paper which is called on
your clout took lots of belonging to us

784
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,140
and basically they were able to bypass
any

785
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:45,620
Amazon of indications so this is

786
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:50,480
all way more interesting research team
doing simple an awesome food for slogan

787
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,680
arm still this was kind of a grey zone

788
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:58,180
for lead raise on fall

789
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:01,560
okay a company like us and

790
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:06,609
distrust at this results arm completely
destroyed my trust in Amazon I mean

791
00:48:06,609 --> 00:48:10,150
the complexity of the web interfaces s
in almost

792
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:13,670
and basically develop interfaces
nowadays are the keys

793
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:17,190
keys to our data center if you host a
lot of applications um

794
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:20,500
another long on the web interfaces all

795
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,180
key to our data center so arm

796
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:28,450
overall security posture publications
not that good from our point of view

797
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:32,359
and i'm out of time so I have to skip
this and in bed but at least

798
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:35,370
I am was tempted to believe that's

799
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:38,390
someone look at Amazon interface

800
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:41,460
if you perform 10 to Penn tests we would
def recommend the damn

801
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:45,400
arm use implement fruit was mechanisms
and please do not implement

802
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,650
trip to by yourself which makes such
tough possible so

803
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:52,920
arm distrust was destroyed and

804
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:57,970
one minute of conclusions arm to load
testing of you got something bowman's

805
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:01,190
to be sure the day perform as expected

806
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:05,830
and adopts necessary changes in your
infrastructures like using the

807
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:07,609
horizontal scalability

808
00:49:07,609 --> 00:49:11,940
not relying begun big a system I mean
this is the way how cloud computing box

809
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:15,920
and arm across protection management
interfaces

810
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,020
and evaluate a cult some thank you
