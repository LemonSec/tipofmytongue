1
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:07,620
okay us

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,930
I mean we talking about evil software
today the

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:15,049
this isn't viruses this is an hour this
is this offer from the from the brand

4
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:15,879
that we know

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,950
and trust in love the microsofts the
Facebook's the googles the world

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,060
me arguing these companies are
intentionally screwing us

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,340
up with the default settings in the user
interface is that the

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,450
designing there's not going to be a for
a very technical talk but I hopefully

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:32,390
it'll be interesting for you:

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,489
so a little bit about me first

11
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,190
I'm a researcher and activist based in
Washington DC I

12
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,879
I do privacy and security I mainly I
interact with lawyers

13
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,039
I try and bully companies into doing the
right thing I in the area privacy

14
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,170
I'm PhD candidate right now also follow
the Open Society foundation

15
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,559
and until last year was the first-ever
technologist at the Federal Trade

16
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,339
Commission

17
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:58,359
which the US privacy regulator in that

18
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,679
position I investigated companies
including Twitter

19
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,839
I Netflix for violating consumers
privacy

20
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:08,979
I and/or having really bad security so

21
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:12,660
someone you may know about me release my
work already in 2006

22
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,830
I created a website make big boarding
passes are to demonstrate how about the

23
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,220
no fly list was in this led to the FBI
reading my home at two in the morning

24
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,929
and then upon achieving sense and then

25
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,110
this year actually father Federal Trade
Commission complaint against robots

26
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,830
because they've been telling our
customers

27
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:33,510
there in crafting their data when in
fact well I guess they are getting her

28
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:33,970
data

29
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,990
infirmities in the senate version key
for every user's data

30
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,870
which doesn't seem like a very good
matter so in general

31
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,970
I try and get companies to do the right
thing I lost them politely

32
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,260
to do the right thing and if they decide
they don't want to do that an hour

33
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,150
dragged through the mud

34
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:56,120
sumitomo almost gonna be a character
they'll be seeing a little bit today

35
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,470
this is all know when she is a graduate
student I'm

36
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,160
in the late 90's all morrow really
fantastic research paper called why

37
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,300
johnnie concrete

38
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,490
I was studying the usability issues that
prevented

39
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,800
regular consumers regular users not
people like us

40
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,150
from successfully I and effectively

41
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:19,579
using pgp it's almost like 10 to the
interface and found out

42
00:02:19,579 --> 00:02:23,340
that it turns out that the interface on
his back then you can see from the a

43
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,629
a picture here this is this is a few
years old at

44
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:30,069
the user interface was so bad that no
one can figure out how to use

45
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:33,150
this is a major problem if we r

46
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,749
engineers and we are designers and
systems and we won users to be secure

47
00:02:37,749 --> 00:02:41,670
I if they can't figure how to use it
then we failed our jobs

48
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,219
and so this was really the first in a
series of papers

49
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:50,170
in what has now become a community adn
focused on security and usability

50
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,790
arm but this was a serve the

51
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,450
critical work in that it really helped
to focus the faults

52
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,049
not on the user but on the designer and
on the engineer

53
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:05,159
price fifty interface office

54
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:10,409
users will make mistakes and maybe
that's fine for a

55
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:14,200
for peace a mapping software bet on
security and privacy we don't want the

56
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,450
user to make mistakes

57
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,010
we don't want the user to screw up
accidentally make phone calls without

58
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:19,540
interruption

59
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,129
when when the user's axe on the screw up
and how they're the credit card number

60
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:28,510
over the network in plain text I so user
interface design

61
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,999
is important at least when it comes to
security privacy but the faults

62
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:37,739
also matter and when I say the false
what I mean to do is the contrast is

63
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:38,409
between

64
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:42,439
it's one thing to have in your face is
confusing to use but it's also important

65
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,719
to recognize that

66
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:47,279
they're going to default settings with
an interface right when you have a check

67
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:49,540
box if there's two options the yes and
no

68
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,578
depending on which option is selected
first

69
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:57,419
that could impact the privacy and
security the user so this is a slice of

70
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:57,909
pizza

71
00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:01,129
I realize that most people here our
European

72
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:04,519
but this is actually what they serve for
lunch in American schools

73
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,629
arm this is a this is

74
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:10,829
school pizza you can tell it's cool
because it's cut a square shape and

75
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:11,559
comes from %ah

76
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:14,790
long sheets and as you can imagine if
students

77
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,858
the this every day they end up looking
like this at a pretty

78
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:22,950
early age if it's it's probably not a
good idea

79
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,449
from a public health standpoint to have
students eating pizza every day but we

80
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:28,979
live in a libertarian country where
people have the right to choose what

81
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:29,680
they want to do

82
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,660
and kids have the right to to pick at
different new items from the menu

83
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,289
though we really want kids to be eating
these kinda things because this leads to

84
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:40,199
overall healthier society

85
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,199
and so there's been a surprising amount

86
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,069
really good research in the area
behavioral economics I'm here for

87
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:48,620
psychology to figure out

88
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,289
how do you get people to eat the right
thing

89
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:56,419
and turns out that what you want to do I
is make it easy for people to make the

90
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:57,330
right choices

91
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,520
to the in studies analyzing cafeteria

92
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,180
our choices and it turns out the
children a really lazy

93
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,240
and they will pick the food that I level

94
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,129
rights at the pizza is on the top shelf
and the solid as an eye-level

95
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:15,069
most kids will pick South

96
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:19,060
since this actually sort of make sense
and so that there's a move to try and

97
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:19,629
make it

98
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:22,849
so that the the fall option in the
cafeteria

99
00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:26,690
is the healthy one that way kids can
still choose pizza really want to

100
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:31,259
but if they just go with faults they get
the whole thing

101
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,090
from and so there's a there's a great
book that his serve

102
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,259
on that's why these pop science books

103
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:41,430
%uh that makes it accessible to the
average person

104
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,849
called knowledge that really focuses on
the importance

105
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:49,900
up default settings it talks about organ
donation the faults in some countries

106
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,110
you have too often turning into donating
an organ in other countries your opt out

107
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,569
in the countries where you have to opt
out organ donation more people are

108
00:05:57,569 --> 00:05:58,940
signed up for organ donation

109
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,229
and some countries you have to select
the pension plan

110
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:05,409
by the fall in other countries one is
cited for you

111
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:09,060
and those countries people save more
money for their retirement

112
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,080
I this is this is %uh a lot of work in
this area

113
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,948
um but there's always a default option

114
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:20,280
in any system right unless you wanna
harass the user

115
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,909
with constant questions just a begin the
process

116
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:27,550
there's always the fall option and that
the guys who wrote this book

117
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,639
not broadcast Cass Sunstein Richard
Baylor they describe the people who

118
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,389
picked up the phone

119
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:36,490
options as choice architect's

120
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,370
write a whoever decides what check box
will be set by the fall

121
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,990
they are choice architect's I well
nowhere to tech conference from us was

122
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,319
we talking about Pizza

123
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,720
I'm so how does this apply the
technology industry

124
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,009
right so in the soccer field we tend to
think of someone

125
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:57,280
looking like this as being the choice
architect's by an ant bites

126
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,520
in almost paper about why johnnie
couldn't crips

127
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,180
probably the interface for PGP was
designed by someone who looked a little

128
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,659
bit like this

129
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:08,810
arm but in fact in the software industry

130
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:14,629
the default settings are not pick by
that guy

131
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:19,030
the pic by that guy the lawyer

132
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,150
right the business guy and so as a
result

133
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:27,389
we end up with systems I that are
designed to drive sales

134
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:31,310
or designed to drive a particular
business line

135
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,580
run some specially if you examples of
this I'm sure you want your

136
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,698
you'll be familiar with these right so
you buy plane ticket

137
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:42,949
and and the travel insurance selected
yes by the fall

138
00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:45,650
most people don't want to travel
insurance but some percentage of

139
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,719
consumers are gonna not notice this is

140
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:52,340
selected as the clicking Next Next Next
to book the airplane ticket

141
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:57,030
they're gonna have signed up for
something at $19.95

142
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,620
right how many consumers have tried to
download Java

143
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,030
and install the toolbar in the process
now our consumers looking for the young

144
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:05,909
to a bar

145
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:10,188
now they want Java the on a job well or
they wanted the PDF reader

146
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:13,889
are they wanted some other PC software
and this proper

147
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:17,340
get shipped along with it and of course
whoever is

148
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,689
is providing the underlying software in
this case on

149
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:24,219
I'm they're gonna get a commission from
Yahoo for every consumer

150
00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:28,169
who doesn't uncheck the Yahoo yahoo
toolbar option

151
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:32,120
let's be clear here know consumers going
out of their way to download the Yahoo

152
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,950
Toolbar

153
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,950
if they were they would go straight to
the other side instead of getting it

154
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,030
through wannabes

155
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,728
additional partner deals

156
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,839
same thing goes for Adobe Reader to
shipping our

157
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,110
Google Toolbar in this case right these
are all examples its officer

158
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,320
piggybacking

159
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,130
on installation process and taking
advantage of poor

160
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,980
softer the faults and of course when we
go visit our family members

161
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,820
on the holidays were met with things
that look like this

162
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,070
right at this is this is something that
happens to me every year

163
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,600
I and it's my job as as a good sign to
remove

164
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,420
the dozens of tow bars from my family
members computers

165
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,649
that they didn't want in the first place
and they don't even know how they got

166
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:15,420
there

167
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,139
they know that they downloaded the game
where they don't they know they

168
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:20,529
downloaded some Pisa software and
suddenly this

169
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:24,279
other thing shows up they don't know how
to get it how to get rid of it

170
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:27,589
you know where it came from an even
tougher to play

171
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:31,040
red even though this is a little bit
problematic and even though we can joke

172
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,579
about this

173
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:37,500
these things don't really impact the
privacy and security users

174
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,579
but as the night since

175
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:45,010
I but there is another this this is
sorta brought the for this happened and

176
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:49,550
these defaults and the stuff that comes
along with the software in

177
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:54,269
the there's a name for these things the
coat dark patterns

178
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:58,370
these are user interfaces that are
designed to trick people

179
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,120
these are not bad user interfaces it's
not that the person who designed it was

180
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,380
a summer intern

181
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,420
would never got user interfaces for
these have been optimized for specific

182
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,910
use case not use cases to get the user
to do something

183
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,680
probably something that the user didn't
wanna do to the deaf and there's

184
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,250
actually a website that collects all
these dark patterns

185
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,399
it's really fun to go through a reason
and the definition they have on the

186
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,630
website for this

187
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:24,699
I is a dark patterns are not poor
usability or design mistakes

188
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:28,360
their carefully crafted with a solid
understanding of human psychology

189
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:33,139
I think they did not have the user's
interests in mind

190
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:36,269
right default settings

191
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,690
matter even more and security and
privacy

192
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,220
and art patterns in the area secured
privacy

193
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,389
mean far more in the travel insurance
the ice on a sign up for

194
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:50,959
right or the toolbar that you actually
install

195
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,860
so let's I'm gonna give you these are
three examples to walk through this and

196
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,639
highlight

197
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,350
why this is a problem and why we really
need to store all insects

198
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,899
these companies account for these so
first first point

199
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:05,660
default settings and a steep yes

200
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,959
people have been packets nothing for
years by their signs

201
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,970
posted on this conference study you know
that the WiFi network

202
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,709
eyes open and in fact dangerous

203
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:19,740
I'm as a result it's very very easy to
sniff

204
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,389
someone's communications on an open WiFi
network I do to the

205
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:27,329
HTTP authentication cookies that are
used a set critique and then later be

206
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:29,459
used to hijack an account

207
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:32,990
people have been doing this Lee since
2007

208
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:37,430
about Pakistan prison have existed long
before that

209
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,519
so I was a problem but turns out that
although we know that we're using

210
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,050
open WiFi networks and we know that
there's no security most consumers done

211
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,240
so this is a a usability study that was
conducted in 2009

212
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,339
quote despite living in a tent logically
sophisticated area the US

213
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:55,850
the participants in the study were not
aware the information sent over wifi

214
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,730
could be seen by others

215
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,800
most consumers don't realize the risk
they're taking one may check their email

216
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,949
a Starbucks

217
00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:07,740
when they log in to facebook from public
place

218
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,820
an additional study that was then a year
later show that

219
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:16,290
when I website does not have the lock
icon present the HTTPS icon

220
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:21,089
users don't notice even though we tell
consumers look for the lock icon

221
00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:24,959
when it's absent they just don't know

222
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,579
as this is important I'm so Google is
actually one of the better companies in

223
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:30,839
the space and

224
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,949
ever since gmail launched Google offered

225
00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:37,000
a HTTPS option

226
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,300
but it was disabled by the fall so we
were fairly tech-savvy audience in here

227
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,850
people who break into computers for a
living I'm anyone who is using

228
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:52,029
gmail prior to johnnie of 2010 raise
your hand and hold it up

229
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:55,720
ice and most other room I up those who
have your hand up

230
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,339
how many have you had turned on the SSL
option leader hand up if you

231
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:06,339
if you did not have a cell turned on
before Jan 2010

232
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,449
as some people the act the average user
you can put your hand on a

233
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:14,480
I'm the average user has never heard

234
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,009
up as a cell and the average user had
never protect themselves

235
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:23,540
frightened so as a result we have things
like the wall of sheep but def on

236
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:28,149
and other other ways that users can have
their contact center

237
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:31,810
I sent two thousand a there was a blog
post on Google's public blog much they

238
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,430
were

239
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:37,160
I defending their composition and said
the HTTPS can make your mail slower

240
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,850
your computer has to do extra work the
crypt all that data anchor today that

241
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:43,060
doesn't travel across the Internet has
officially

242
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,290
as I think today to that's why we leave
the choice up to you

243
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,469
she was a Google being kind they were
looking out for your poor computer

244
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,670
they don't have to slow it down burden
the poor little CPU with encryption

245
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,050
I and so Google took the position just
three years ago

246
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,470
the encryption was something that
consumers should have to choose

247
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,769
to enable but of course as i just
described

248
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:09,389
three slides before most most consumers

249
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:12,389
don't even know their information is
going over the wire and I think that

250
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:14,399
form to begin with

251
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,810
so how would they know to choose this
thing they don't know that the runnable

252
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,660
ice a prior to 2010 in the Gmail
settings

253
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,430
HCPs was the lost up thirteen options

254
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,790
below unico de keyboard shortcuts

255
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,230
and vacation autoresponders I sewed

256
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,970
HCPs was clearly a high priority
configuration option

257
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,360
for Google and brother couldn't have
been anything

258
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,940
with a lower priority in Google's eyes
at least

259
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,380
the way the interface was laid out

260
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:53,720
remember all mom the grad student I
talked about before

261
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,259
she's now Google's director privacy for
a tensioner

262
00:14:57,259 --> 00:15:00,860
she's been there for several years the
woman who

263
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:05,160
first wrote fifteen years ago about how
poor user interface designs

264
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,569
would lead to users not being secure

265
00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:13,250
was responsible for the group that had
this user interface

266
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,029
this is all a testifying before Congress
last year arm

267
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:20,110
that's actually Facebook's have
engineering right next to her

268
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,000
who told members of congress that every
Facebook employees work some privacy

269
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,880
I'm clear lie think

270
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,560
I so in January 2010 Google completely
flips

271
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,980
their policy right prior to that date
but that said that

272
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,589
encryption was on the consumers have to
choose to to to enable

273
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:42,430
in Jan 8 2010 google said that
encryption will be the fall

274
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:47,620
all gmail traffic all Google Docs or
Google Spreadsheets calendars

275
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:50,779
it would all being courted by the fall
consumers wouldn't have to play with an

276
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:52,319
option

277
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:56,019
what happens why they do this two things

278
00:15:56,019 --> 00:16:01,329
the first about six months before arm 38
experts wrote public letter to Google

279
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:04,379
piling on that they needed to turn on
captions runner vastus

280
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:07,800
the R&R essay Bruce Schneier punch a big
members

281
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,740
photographers all wrote Eric Schmidt and
set stuff up protect our USERs

282
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:16,339
you think happens that was announced the
same day that Google turned on a song by

283
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:17,519
the fall

284
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,540
was a Chinese broke into them now the
Chinese didn't use

285
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,969
unlocking captions a break in but this
seems like a good time

286
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,620
for Google to to make the switch

287
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,190
I so what's happened since and the year
and a half since Google turned on as a

288
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,060
sub by the fall

289
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,050
a few things that happens Firesheep

290
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,180
I'm so as I said tools that exist in

291
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,610
for at least five years to enable the
automated hijacking a uninterrupted

292
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,110
WiFi connections but I am fire she made
it easy

293
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:54,120
this was released in October 2010 at the
dollar to two million times now

294
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,629
I'm omit 11.6 wanna make the slides on

295
00:16:57,629 --> 00:17:01,079
and this really does serve the point
click hijacking

296
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:04,260
in so far as the previous tools required
to come online in a little bit

297
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,869
acknowledge

298
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,920
there you don't have to be I an expert
to do this in fact you know have to even

299
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,280
really know how to use a computer

300
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,849
its you literally start the Firefox
plugin

301
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:17,879
and double-click on some naming her in
their account doesn't get any easier

302
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,650
than this

303
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:22,839
and so you have to ask yourself post
partially

304
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:27,849
12 million consumers now I have a tool
at their fingertips so much they can

305
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:31,639
easily happen to anyone else account
wire web sites

306
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,820
by the other web sites out there still
not been cutting their data

307
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,090
by the fall so i'd G

308
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,280
a late last year ARM it made last year
Google start offering integrated search

309
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,220
service and then just a few weeks ago

310
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,640
Google announced they will be using the
search service by the fall

311
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,500
think that search for all signed in
users but anyone not signed into Google

312
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,600
still has their search terms going over
the wire

313
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,260
to form I'm some other developments that
were interesting

314
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,730
in January this year the Tunisian
government was call

315
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:07,100
actively hacking into Facebook accounts
if its citizens

316
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,049
they were injecting malicious JavaScript
into this into the stream now they

317
00:18:10,049 --> 00:18:10,860
weren't

318
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:14,549
arm you know engage in any kind of
certificate authority shenanigans

319
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:17,200
because they didn't need to because
Facebook wasn't using

320
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,570
cell shortly after this happened
Facebook turned on SSL by the fall

321
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,658
just for people in Tunisia at the rest
of us

322
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:29,340
don't have that luxury just yet I'm
Facebook

323
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,129
like Google before 2010 I has a solemn

324
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:37,390
of in option now consumers who wish to

325
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:41,270
be protected against Firesheep have to
know this option exists and have to go

326
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,389
and seek it out

327
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:46,280
and then figure out how to turn it on
I'm

328
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,928
in March of this year Ashton Kutcher
celebrity had his Twitter account

329
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:50,580
hijacked

330
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,189
at a conference you can see what the
other tweets that were sent by the

331
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,960
personal height of the tower

332
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,159
you've been punked this account is not
secure dude where's my

333
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:04,260
SSL I'm and so shortly after that I
think a week after that whether or not

334
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,590
that they too

335
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:09,110
would be offering an HTTPS option for
their users

336
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:14,190
but again naw enabled by the fall

337
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,679
Microsoft in November last year started
offering

338
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,059
an HTTPS encryption option for hotmail
again

339
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:24,678
you have to choose to use it I Microsoft
seems outdone

340
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:28,750
everyone else in the industry in making
this as unusable as possible

341
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,799
to the steps required to turn on this
option up

342
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:35,820
from within your Hotmail Inbox click on
Options took on more options

343
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,908
click on account details click on
Connect way should be us

344
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:42,100
click on it uses GPS on my plea and
click Save

345
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:47,950
just six simple clicks to protect your
email from hackers

346
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:52,080
I so why this HTTPS remain often option

347
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,059
many be services they really expect
consumers

348
00:19:56,059 --> 00:19:59,678
there expect the millions of consumers
are gonna sit this out now

349
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,740
they know that millions of consumers and
on a stick this out and in fact many

350
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,600
services

351
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,860
have publicly admitted they're not ready
to support

352
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:11,860
HCPs by the fall the CPU load on our
servers would be too high

353
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,400
they don't have enough troops
accelerators whatever the reason they

354
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,390
believe

355
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:19,510
is stopping them the way they think they
can both offer encryption

356
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,150
but not be overwhelmed is to offer on
often basis

357
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,890
but of course what this means is that
the vast majority their users are going

358
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,510
to remain viable

359
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,700
to hijack I

360
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,010
as a result these options are hidden

361
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:39,450
I intentionally right Facebook could
very easily have a link on the front

362
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,520
page 2

363
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:46,690
sign in using HTTPS with a doc

364
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:50,510
we have to ask is a civil

365
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:54,260
in an era where anyone can break into
your account

366
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,640
on a public network without knowing
really anything about technology

367
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,059
to these companies have a responsibility
to protect their customers

368
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:05,629
and is a sufficient for them to offer an
option

369
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:10,490
Amanda's point2 in cell of people really
wanted it they would protect themselves

370
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:15,409
it is is that a reasonable thing in this
day and age

371
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:18,460
my second example relates to disk
encryption

372
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:24,600
and softer defaults

373
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,919
we live also in an era now where people
are very concerned

374
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,679
about data breaches and data thefts
laptops get stolen all the time

375
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:36,429
I get left in taxis anyone who finds
them gets all your data

376
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:40,169
but these criminals are not the only
threat or data

377
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:45,000
the government has also threats are they
to and so if you cross the border

378
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,529
or just get stopped by the police the
government can open up your device in

379
00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:51,779
or solution to both of these threats

380
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:54,950
you there seizure by the government or
loss

381
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:59,140
and access by criminal as description

382
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:03,760
but the situation is not so great and
this place answer either

383
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,879
Microsoft rate Dennis Lee offers many
different versions of their operating

384
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,730
system

385
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:11,580
have Home Premium Professional ultimate
may even have some

386
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:16,689
slimmed-down version for the developing
world I'm

387
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,520
the unfortunate thing is that Microsoft
doesn't include description

388
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,309
for many bees these versions so you can
see this chart for a while but they are

389
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:28,350
there's all these different features and
summer turned on summer disabled

390
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,470
for different versions important thing
is that to get

391
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:34,960
the disk encryption the BitLocker
encryptions after that Microsoft

392
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,929
has has created in fact very good
descriptions after

393
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:42,320
I'm you have to buy the ultimate version
OS

394
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,840
now if you go to a PC retailer and you
buy in new laptop

395
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,139
as a consumer I nine times out and it
will come

396
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,809
with premium or professional if you're
really lucky

397
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:56,678
no computers are so with ultimate in the
store so what this means of course

398
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:59,950
is that no laptops are being sold

399
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:04,380
with the capability to have description
for consumers who want to use Microsoft

400
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,159
disk encryption software

401
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,179
on a new PC they've purchased they need
to give microsoft an additional 150

402
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:11,860
dollars

403
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:16,100
no insurance it's a how many consumers

404
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,150
are gonna go out by Ultima nominee

405
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,460
and whatever small soft money that
Microsoft is making

406
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:29,010
writing up selling you know five or ten
thousand consumers a year to upsman

407
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:33,379
that's a really really high price for
them millions of consumers are hundreds

408
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,130
a militant

409
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:39,070
consumers who are not gonna get this
contraption softer as a result

410
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:42,970
what about Apple Sopel very famously
only has a single

411
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:46,370
version though us whether you have the
cheapest

412
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,419
appliance or the most expensive laptop

413
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:53,360
and every version A Mac OS includes
description

414
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,470
but it's not turned on by the fall Ryan
so you have to go into the settings

415
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,539
enable file ball

416
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:03,899
and again although the distance for
consumers ago

417
00:24:03,899 --> 00:24:08,130
from getting a new computer to having
this corruption is much shorter

418
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,690
on Mac OS rather have to pull out the
credit card that after spending money

419
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:15,029
it's still not enabled by the fall as I
suspect the vast majority

420
00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:18,700
of consumer Mac users are not encrypting
the data

421
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,700
by the fall

422
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,059
this is my opportunity say something
nice about Google as a Google

423
00:24:25,059 --> 00:24:28,510
I'm actually uses description by the
fall

424
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:32,289
for their prime alas operating system

425
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:35,799
every Google Chrome OS laptop at Salt

426
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:39,279
has all your data imported by the fall
the consumer doesn't have to do anything

427
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,500
there's no check boxes to play with

428
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,390
this is great your data is protected
from anything leaves from hackers

429
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:50,110
from the government I except for the
fact that is not get that on Google

430
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,169
servers

431
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:54,380
us a the government can just go to going
out for but it's still better than

432
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,029
nothing

433
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:58,350
I'm

434
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:01,860
I live in washington and Dom

435
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:05,100
I'm heavily involved in politics there
and trying to

436
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,390
stop my government from spying on my
data and your data

437
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:12,950
and so there's a hearing earlier this
year um focused on the issue encryption

438
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,390
the government and back long for
centrist would like to get

439
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,710
back doors in Skype and RAM hands

440
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,450
several the communication services and
so this is a fairly long but interesting

441
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,279
quote

442
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,230
from the van general counsel the top
lawyer the FBI

443
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:31,590
from criminals tend to be somewhat lazy
and a lot of times they will resort to

444
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:32,750
it as easy

445
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,880
so long as we have a solution that will
get us the bulk of our targets

446
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,929
both criminals the bulk of terrorists
the Boca spies

447
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:41,960
will be ahead of the game we cannot have
to design

448
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,279
individualized solutions as though they
were sophisticated targets

449
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,870
who is self inflicting putting very
difficult encryption are the lawn

450
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:52,840
for every target we find because not
every target is not using such as the

451
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,100
telecommunications

452
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,980
now that's not the most eloquent
statement here on but really what she's

453
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,539
trying to say

454
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:02,710
is that the FBI knows that they're gonna
be

455
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,390
people who are really smart ever going
to use sophisticated disk encryption

456
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:07,100
tools

457
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,460
with a really don't want is the dumb
criminals to have

458
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,419
encryption right we hear a lot right now
in Brussels

459
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:18,190
about privacy by design this is a really
big topic in privacy circles

460
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,789
regulators in Europe really want
companies to start building privacy and

461
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:22,658
security solutions

462
00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:26,240
into their products enabled by the fall
something a great thing the FBI doesn't

463
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,360
wanna

464
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,409
quiero so when they say criminals tend
to be somewhat lazy

465
00:26:30,409 --> 00:26:34,500
and a lot of time there was a it was
easy take other criminals and is

466
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,090
replaced with consumers

467
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:39,610
all users tend to be somewhat lazy

468
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:43,710
and will resort to what is easy answer
for the FBI to be successful in what

469
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,380
they want

470
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,840
all consumers I Argos I'll by because
there's not going to be some special

471
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,200
laptop its only sought to criminals

472
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,240
as over the FBI to be happy all laptops
are not have to have an abortion

473
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,630
alt Alfa all talk phones are gonna have
to have the data sort an honor to form

474
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:04,640
to this is gonna be a debate that's
gonna keep going on for the next few

475
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,029
months or years

476
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:09,970
I you're too as the FBI and other
regulators or duke it out

477
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:14,659
and fight over this issue arm but the
FBI doesn't want

478
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:18,419
companies turning on action by the fall
it's not clear

479
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:22,850
why Microsoft has chosen to make
encryption a value-added

480
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:26,779
feature for their Premium Suite you know

481
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:32,059
argue with Microsoft a place please tell
us

482
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:39,059
so I'm

483
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:44,899
I said the gentleman said that that I'm
consumer grade

484
00:27:44,899 --> 00:27:49,740
computers do not have it a TPM chip and
and BitLocker relies on T ketchup

485
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,510
my understanding is that you can use
BitLocker weatherman movable USB key

486
00:27:53,510 --> 00:28:00,140
you don't need a TPM chip

487
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,370
so that the gentleman saying that that
becomes impractical for the interview

488
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:07,039
I'd love to have this this discussion
over lunch but I'm there certainly ways

489
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,340
that Microsoft could provide

490
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:15,340
some for encryption functionality yeah

491
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:21,120
up

492
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,279
is not a nomination right so again there

493
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:27,429
is some encryption functionality but you
still have to buy

494
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:32,299
a fancier version when this together

495
00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:37,269
so let's talk a little bit about
incentives quickly

496
00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:41,519
hmm what happens when the incentive

497
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,779
on the software vendor and the user's
incentives are not aligned

498
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:50,640
when in fact what happens when your
privacy and security incentives

499
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,429
directly contradicts the incentives and
the business model

500
00:28:54,429 --> 00:28:57,690
a company providing technology

501
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:01,669
so the example issues here based on
tracking

502
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:05,929
so there are several companies on the
web that his first parties

503
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:09,210
return are and and the track in space
for the first part is that the website

504
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,279
that you visit

505
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:15,169
you choose the visit these are at the
new york times is it the world the BBC's

506
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:18,620
the right it's these %uh the website the
consumers know

507
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:23,010
and trust and then there are the third
parties

508
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:26,408
these are the double click to the world
that analysis which is Microsoft be able

509
00:29:26,409 --> 00:29:27,370
to make it work

510
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:31,289
the blue guys the low to means there are
hundreds behavior at networks and he's

511
00:29:31,289 --> 00:29:31,710
all

512
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:35,620
out this third parties and what I mean
by that is the consumers never visiting

513
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,549
the front page

514
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:41,539
Alice never typing in the URL be ever at
work

515
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:45,070
I into their browser and so the way
these companies track you

516
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:48,129
is by being present on a page either via

517
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,240
image is being loaded some javascripts

518
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,799
I and that allows them to give your
browser cookie

519
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:58,000
I will and if you see the same ad
network for multiple sites

520
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,299
than that ad network in track and all
the dossier on you

521
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:06,440
so this is the the user interface for
turkey I'm sure everyone's

522
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:11,159
c'mon but I have to include this as for
Firefox

523
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:14,809
I'm and so every browser house cookie
settings

524
00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:18,330
the browser settings very and the
default settings and those browsers very

525
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,330
to

526
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:22,820
arm the important thing for this
discussion relates to a sighting

527
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:27,789
about third-party cookies so all
browsers will allow consumers to

528
00:30:27,789 --> 00:30:31,799
arm the French shaped cookies and in
fact block just those cookies that come

529
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:32,960
from third parties

530
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,620
from the web sites the consumers are not
knowingly president

531
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:40,450
I'm so Apple Safari browser which is
WebKit browser

532
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:44,669
arm chooses by the fall to block
third-party cookies

533
00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:50,809
if you are using arm a Mac laptop for
using an iPhone or an iPod

534
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:54,059
third parties will not be able to answer
keys and your browser

535
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:56,889
by the thought now there are tricks they
can get around it by opening the windows

536
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,500
and a few other things but

537
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:03,210
by and large their parties don't get too
drop cookies in your browser

538
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:06,620
now Google Chrome is also market browser
and it was for

539
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,730
originate from the same Corps Base as

540
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:13,010
as Apple's browser Google's also has

541
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:16,950
one of these settings but Google has
chosen to allow

542
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,000
third-party cookies by the fall

543
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,710
from there's no notice that this when
you start the browser Nzimande

544
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:29,220
advertised feature on of course
consumers can choose to go into the

545
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,100
settings

546
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,460
for the browser and thus able to switch
or other two to block the third party

547
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,080
cookies

548
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,418
the very few microsoft also has

549
00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:42,880
arm wannabes settings and Microsoft like
google has chosen to allow third-party

550
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,220
is by the fall as I think it's
interesting to contrast this

551
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,799
so Apple user goes into a store someone
who just

552
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,940
once the fanciest most expensive laptop
they can get

553
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,970
spans two thousand euros gets lots of

554
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:59,190
they come out of the store with the
browser all and in fact blah

555
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:02,769
up its a block some cookies and protect
their privacy online

556
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:06,539
even though are poison competing on its
privacy features

557
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:10,250
whereas a consumer he doesn't have as
much money and goes into a store

558
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:14,240
and buys a three hundred dollars I'll
there comes a Windows

559
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,480
any deposit then explore are already
downloaded

560
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:21,190
from they don't get this then I get the
benefit to this privacy features

561
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:25,159
at least by the fall well

562
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:28,440
the browser vendors are also add
networks Google

563
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,620
is both an art network and a bra
surrender Microsoft is both an ad

564
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,080
network browser vendor

565
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,760
mazzola in fact is funded almost
entirely I money from

566
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,919
ad network and

567
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:44,000
you know we have some evidence to
suggest that

568
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,299
the business decisions or a business
interests one unit

569
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:53,658
I can fax impact the product features in
other units products

570
00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:57,080
so again remember from home a

571
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,289
what happens when almost conflicted I
what happens if she's the director

572
00:33:00,289 --> 00:33:03,200
privacy for the whole company

573
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,870
does that mean that she puts the privacy
interests from users first

574
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:10,090
does that mean that she puts the
business interests up the

575
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:13,230
I team the division action makes all who
was money

576
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:16,440
first now I don't know what happened

577
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,490
ago I don't know why they've chosen the
phone so that that they've chosen

578
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:24,049
but there's a great quote I'm from been
served

579
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:28,240
who is mother father TCPIP who has great
photo

580
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,010
really like as i dropping I'm and serve
it was on a panel with me

581
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:37,690
a couple weeks ago in Nairobi in Kenya
and he said this

582
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:41,110
we couldn't run our system everything in
it were recruited

583
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:44,740
because then we wouldn't know which has
to show you

584
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,899
this is a system that was designed
around a particular business model

585
00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:51,820
to the question on that led to this
quote with the same

586
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:55,158
Google doesn't encrypt your data they
store their servers the things that

587
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:56,220
Google Docs

588
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,639
your emails those things and vent
truthfully

589
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:03,139
acknowledged that they could encrypt
your data

590
00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:06,590
in fact there are competing services to
Google's arm

591
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:11,570
like SpiderOak that is an online backup
service but do in fact temperature data

592
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:15,360
but Google is an at supported products
they offer I supported

593
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,940
products and for those two function

594
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:22,350
need to see the contents of your data
and this is great I think it's great

595
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:25,960
Venezuelan to publicly acknowledge this
but I'm the rest at this company

596
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,580
a dozen in many cases so I don't know

597
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:33,210
a what raw almond always a play in the

598
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:37,900
park features offer from but you know
what's happening Microsoft

599
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,960
and so Microsoft has some really
innovative features in the browser

600
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,139
come in ie7 there was brand new feature
called

601
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:48,580
in private browsing and InPrivate
Filtering mode

602
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,610
and what this with this is really really
cool very innovative and so what about

603
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:51,990
the

604
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:55,560
the browser which would do is it would
serve keep track in which the parties

605
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,630
were showing up

606
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,630
when you browse the web and it's all the
same third-party

607
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:03,080
over and over again realize that was
probably talking at work

608
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,580
ever start to block it and so in the
betas

609
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:10,410
above the eyebrows or the speech was
turned on by the fall

610
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:13,420
II Men when the products when life

611
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,920
out to users not only was it disabled by
the fall

612
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,290
but each time you started the browser if
you want to use that you had to re

613
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,650
enable

614
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:25,690
that is the the feature about that with
was not persistent

615
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:29,260
a cross-browser restarts I'm now many
people

616
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:32,300
were really worried is too and and and
the other suspects as to why this

617
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,600
happened there was some

618
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,680
the rumors going around for a long time
and then finally

619
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:41,230
up last year the Wall Street Journal
broke a story

620
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:45,120
I showing in fact that I'm Microsoft's

621
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,609
pit business units the advertising side
had pulled away

622
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:52,330
and going all the way up the executive
chart and manage to

623
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:56,069
to to force the brother team to change
the product features into the quote from

624
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,010
missus

625
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:00,400
in the end the product line is lost the
key part of the bay

626
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,280
the winners executives who argued that
giving automatic privacy to consumers

627
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,320
would make it tougher for Microsoft to
profit from selling online ads

628
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,580
Microsoft got its browser so that users
must have literally turn on privacy

629
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,420
settings

630
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:18,830
each time they start up the software

631
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:22,340
to me this is evil right this isn't

632
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,360
a user interface design mistake

633
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,800
this is an summer intern who screwed up

634
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,260
this is a product feature dictated

635
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:35,610
by lawyers and dictated by business
folks

636
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,460
not engineers this is an approx feature
that is designed to help users

637
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:44,460
is in fact one that is designed to
expose your private activities online

638
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,660
so they can be monitored by Microsoft
and other companies as you browse the

639
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,080
web

640
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,660
and you wouldn't find out about this by
visiting Microsoft's website

641
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,750
right so that privacy policies have all
these companies say that

642
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:59,530
Microsoft cares and values are pro cares
about values your privacy

643
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:02,750
Google is committed to protecting your
privacy up a Google

644
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,890
privacy is a general everything we do by
all these companies

645
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,549
have the sort of bogus statements they
make but none of them will tell you that

646
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:10,330
they

647
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:13,350
engaged in what they believe is a a
reasonable balance

648
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:18,020
interests right over your privacy and
their business model

649
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:21,620
I'm so my my favor quote from Microsoft

650
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:25,220
section 1 that happened when I was
working at the government

651
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:29,170
and a bunch of Microsoft lawyers came in
to talk about

652
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:33,540
some other browser features and this
article I just come out maybe a few

653
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:33,870
months

654
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:37,589
for and I asked them about and initially

655
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:42,100
they said no no you know we we we choose
our the faults based on the functional

656
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,400
products

657
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,930
you know we got negative feedback during
the beta period and I said really

658
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:51,080
you know is that really what happens and
eventually one of the

659
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:56,500
one of the lawyers turns me into Chris
were not a charity

660
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:01,490
by I respect that but they don't tell
you that on the website

661
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:04,770
they don't tell you that the browser is
being given away for free

662
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:08,960
so there are networking track you ever
lost you go it would be too obvious

663
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,550
to have the browser tracking right now
be don't be silly everyone went with the

664
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,170
tag that

665
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:16,210
seems that your browser despues your
private data everywhere you go on the

666
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:16,830
web

667
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:21,670
and then they follow up right like a
like a fish following up to right now

668
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:25,530
are following a another item on the
winner in the river

669
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:28,690
I'm anyway

670
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:32,040
I tomorrow story here is that these
companies are not doing things in your

671
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,390
best interest

672
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:36,450
I'm it is fine but again they need to be
up front

673
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:40,640
about is companies are not evil

674
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,430
but when their business models your
privacy conflict

675
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:48,359
only one can survive as like highlander
the can be only one

676
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:53,760
arm at and and guess which one wins

677
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,940
thank you I think I'm a little bit I'm
questions
