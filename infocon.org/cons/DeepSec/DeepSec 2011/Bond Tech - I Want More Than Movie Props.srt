1
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:08,960
doing today that was

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,790
not rhetorical I really want an answer
I'm still waking up so

3
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,240
I

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,990
alright so first and foremost I want to
apologize ahead

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,490
to come over and I had a little bit of a
layover in the UK and usually have a lot

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,599
to toys appear

7
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:28,920
for this talk but the the UK didn't like
the fact those traveling with a

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,300
miniature Predator drone

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,530
so they sent it back to the states so
I've got pictures and some movies and

10
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,989
stuff as we go through this
unfortunately I don't have my

11
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:41,660
big radio control airplane with me toe
I'll

12
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,730
well will get a list are here so first
and foremost

13
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,510
the talks can it be a little bit about
how to use like everyday items

14
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:53,989
on some toys things like that to break
through physical security technical

15
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:55,580
securities things like that

16
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,640
I'll should be a little should be fine
%uh

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,110
do a little bit of a history lesson
included are going to do some background

18
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:02,440
on

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,619
James Bond in particular just as i think
im on schools I'll are and

20
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:09,690
then we're gonna actually go into the
history a little bit about us from the

21
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,810
espionage techniques and things like
that that will actually talk about

22
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,450
I'll actually sure you know why james
bond is so cool

23
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,170
which is rhetorical question up

24
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,159
and then the we're gonna go through us
some the toys and stuff like that and

25
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,280
the ease of access and the ability to
get a haul the stuff

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,689
and they were actually gonna do hacking
demo and we're going to a live demo

27
00:01:31,689 --> 00:01:35,630
I've got my phone appear so I earlier
this year released

28
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,820
a version of Ubuntu they run to
smartphones that spent a specific so

29
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,140
it's got a lot built in tool similar to
like backtrack

30
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,649
action released before expected so I

31
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:49,299
say I what we'll have some fun so a
little bit about me

32
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:53,670
I am a pen tester at seven I've been
doing this for about two years

33
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,149
start my own security company ball IT
company lost on high school

34
00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:01,859
are so have been in the industry for a
long time I

35
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:06,359
this is my like 14 conference that i've
talked that already this year

36
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,780
so I've been doing a lot of these this
is particularly this is only the second

37
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,140
time in a bit on the stock so

38
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,630
it should be fun some more fun on it get
it

39
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,170
%uh so James Bond a little bit

40
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:24,659
obviously 007 I'll fictional create a
character created in 1953

41
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:29,629
by informing I'm sure most you guys have
at the scene 1 James Bond movie or read

42
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:30,599
a novel or something

43
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,709
throughout your lies I yeah I

44
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:37,190
if you notice he never ages. like Ian
Fleming made

45
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,620
in the stories that he will leverage
they say his

46
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,159
birthday was roughly 1921 1921 ish

47
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,150
so depends on which book actually go
away I'll

48
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,510
the more history teacher but son over
and around

49
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,230
and so he's I good

50
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,849
you know UK mmm resident and

51
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:02,109
was a 11:01 his parents actually

52
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,849
lower killed in a mountain climbing
accidents funnest

53
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:09,349
I guess that is I have never been
mountain climbing so

54
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:13,209
I by family model

55
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:16,650
I is actually what are the names of the
films so

56
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:21,019
it's just kinda call fun little fact
that you guys can

57
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:24,209
play with later something that you might
you get some

58
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,629
bar trivia someone up so and then going
to a little bit about the real stuff

59
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:34,060
so obviously she a lot of things to come
up in movies in a lot of things that

60
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,110
and you note look fences felt like
fancier fiction

61
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,920
things like that but a lot of stuff is
actually being used out there

62
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,319
are not only does the movies take stuff
from rate in real life but

63
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,680
real life takes things movies a lifetime
so I

64
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,379
for formosa the ever gets why did you
know about that drop

65
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:57,219
basically it's the active Mayo hiding
something

66
00:03:57,219 --> 00:04:00,549
where someone else can retrieve it I'll

67
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:03,629
with without I what they are learning
anyone else for having an

68
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:07,879
anyone else I notice that they aren't
needed

69
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:10,879
the russians actually accused Britain

70
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,920
%uh using a radio I

71
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,340
drop who de dropped what they did was
actually built a radio transmitter

72
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,740
into a fake rock so if you if you're
familiar with like the key hides

73
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,820
that you can put your iraq's in her put
the key in

74
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,200
looks like a rock thrown in front lawn
in the Reno said all

75
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,370
the the Brits actually decided to put a
radio transmitter

76
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,700
and receiver in there so they would
somebody would be able to walk by with

77
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,770
just a IR transmitter put the
information into the Rock

78
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,229
and then somebody can come by later in
pick it up I

79
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,880
and no longer do they need necessitate
ability actually walk over and pick

80
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,969
anything up physically

81
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,140
you could simply walk by look like
you're on your phone and got the

82
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,039
information that way

83
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:57,880
so our botch

84
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,020
obviously formed wiretapping things like
that

85
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,909
are still used pretty much for
surveillance in

86
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:09,240
everyday life I'll in particular in 2003

87
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,110
the US FBI decided that the wanted
access to everybody's car

88
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,110
systems so they actually went after your

89
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,820
in car GPS I on star systems and things
like that

90
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,659
and we're using it for a little bit I'm
for a surveillance on people without

91
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,000
anybody knowing

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,180
there was they actually turn that over
and

93
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,150
said that they couldn't do it because it
was actually disabling security function

94
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,900
up

95
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:38,270
so know if you if they were actually
listening to you and you got into a car

96
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,750
accident or whatever

97
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,020
the guys that were supposed to call when
able to actually send them

98
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,570
so they decided that was bad adventure

99
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,640
and they reverse that so they can no
longer do it

100
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,719
so they say I'll and then I

101
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,550
today with the ability in use of
smartphones and everything like that

102
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,660
I use and some have your Android rootkit
San things like that you can actually

103
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,350
turn those on for monitoring devices
recording devices phone

104
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:08,160
are for video whatever you need and it's
a nice way to

105
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,760
be on detected when you're actually
connecting to someone and

106
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,760
listening that whatever the conversation
is and things like that

107
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,210
steak knife am sure a good number you
guys know what that is

108
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,659
I'll the first time there was actually
i've referred to stay can actually was

109
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,520
in 1499

110
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,990
and on because it was again he was
trying again to hide it

111
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,990
the author actually put in a book that
was are listed under magic

112
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,250
so it was a it was and

113
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,370
even the book about steganography was
hidden

114
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,750
I which I thought was kinda fun

115
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,370
and then surveillance obviously this
this is a big thing no matter whether

116
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,810
its electronic with bugs

117
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:54,110
or video or person human and type stuff

118
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,230
this stuff is always I a huge thing for
on

119
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,980
organizations whether it's going to be
something that china dish in social

120
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,350
engineering physically

121
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,010
or whether it's a a government-run want
somebody in particular

122
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:09,570
so some other different kinds I love by

123
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,050
Ste surveillance spying if you will I

124
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:16,920
is obviously a computer chip telephones
social media things like that

125
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,060
I could even just somebody sitting
watching and

126
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,440
performing human and operations global
positioning if they wanna listen look

127
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,900
and find out where your

128
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,120
I you know your Garmin devices are your
phone or whatever that

129
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,540
you're carrying on you it makes it very
easy with the

130
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:38,050
if the connections and everything that
everybody has with them every day

131
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,670
so why it would make James Bond SoCal so
this is this where we start have

132
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,810
actually have a little fun

133
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,990
so watched yards in as why Jim

its it's never wrinkle I have you ever
noticed

142
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,740

the water doesn't matter whatever

143
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,420

signed mike tyson stuff

154
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,009
but I really 80 its it's what
everybody's here to talk about

155
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:13,560
are what really makes one score accords
it's all the toys and stuff that he

156
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,959
actually gets to play with

157
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,009
so are when it when I was actually doing
this are

158
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:21,300
I started playing with a lot of everyday
stuff in

159
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,269
really wanted to have some other really
cool toy so I I'll study looking at

160
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:29,079
what's available out there that you can
actually just go on the internet and

161
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:30,009
ordered

162
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:34,279
and and pretend to be James Bond so

163
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:38,149
first thing was you know to take a look
at what were the

164
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:41,199
he I like buying toys

165
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:45,310
that were I you know the ones that I
really want in now obviously you know

166
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:49,439
the first one up that I thought about
was up the jetpack

167
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:52,829
now I'm sure that everybody hears at the
scene Rocket Man

168
00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:56,540
you know the the guy that flies around
and a look at that and that's like three

169
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,990
hundred fifty grand for those

170
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,939
like this is not feasible so I just
started looking a little bit further

171
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:07,009
and I'm gonna cut out here because the
video that I put in there

172
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:11,290
isn't as great and and actually found
something pretty awesome

173
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:18,290
and hot if this loads up without issue
here

174
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:27,680
those you one second

175
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:34,680
we're ok news

176
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:36,950
this

177
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:43,650
we did it with the douchey video yes

178
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:50,650
a

179
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,800
so I I started looking and I was like
well you know every

180
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,310
really awesome if I could find something
they actually had one of the sayings

181
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:02,080
you can actually fire on I said sorry
but that passion

182
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:09,080
conversion

183
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,420
yeah there's water

184
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:19,420
show yet there there's a good couple
guys that actually decided make

185
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,010
I jetpack out a player hoses central so

186
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:28,370
unfortunately they only made seventy the
same thing they're already sold out

187
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,820
I tried to get on the waiting list but
I'll but

188
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,220
I was like no this would be absolutely
awesome I don't care who's got the best

189
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,459
wave runner out there

190
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:41,470
nothing beats the jetpack I think about
so others it's an awesome video I I

191
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,070
obviously don't work for any these
companies

192
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,850
so good now promo video any sort but but

193
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,910
it was one of those things I just
thought that you know if you're gonna

194
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,490
have what it can be James Bond you got
to have some kind of a jetpack

195
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,180
so this thing actually flies at like 35
feet of the water

196
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,959
I its that the big black holes on the
back is what's actually pumping and

197
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:03,070
there's like this little

198
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,389
wear anything that file so it's itsk
limited water but

199
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:09,529
you can actually you know become
Submariner

200
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:15,610
whatever you want I'll

201
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,890
yet it just goes like this is an awesome
toy

202
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:24,540
so up it if anybody was less stress the
video can check it out on YouTube its

203
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,540
called jet life

204
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,469
I am they they they sell for about a
hundred grand which is

205
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,070
you know a third of the cost to the the
other one but the

206
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,390
we have I i thought i right you know if
your gonna if you gonna be gentle on you

207
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,769
you seriously gotta have

208
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:42,750
what are these toys goes without it it's
just not the same

209
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,949
so up to acquit the videos as its

210
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:52,949
kinda chubby butter

211
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,400
so than I i think you know II

212
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,820
you know I was thinking okay we'll you
know I'm one

213
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,260
you know something that I could actually
that you know play with maybe

214
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,890
see if I can get more information
intelligence of so

215
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,360
up actually if so I'm really wish you
was here but

216
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,070
I decided to build a remote control
airplane so I i do

217
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,080
been doing actually suffer a lot and
inside here

218
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,600
I with a actually has a and if you

219
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,310
if anybody was at da Def Con they had no
one other guys out there with my UAB's

220
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,230
that had adhered to 11 stuff in there

221
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,840
well I had to be able to 11 stuff I
eventually got

222
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,690
one of these phones in their I'll which
supports GSM

223
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:45,680
as well as GPS and everything else so
they actually sent me back its ultimate

224
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,810
altitude and everything I'll wirelessly

225
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,430
and actually put in autopilot

226
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:57,170
and GPS a basically

227
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:01,420
open source kind of actual UAV controls
to this

228
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,230
and I but the model for about 200 bucks
online so

229
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,320
is this isn't even like something that
you know you gotta go on spending QT

230
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,500
and it even came with a remote control
after that obviously but

231
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,930
I'll so CI its its

232
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:19,370
it's a cool little toy

233
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:23,510
I like I said unfortunately that they
didn't really like the fact that I had

234
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:28,290
this with me so that's the camera that's
mounted on front

235
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,420
so

236
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,810
the cameras actually controlled up by
Sir role on their

237
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,540
up from us from another channel that on
the radio so you can rotate the

238
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,050
our camera 360 degrees just like on the
real one

239
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,400
I it's also got like you said the GPS
and everything

240
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,980
so for like two or three hundred books
including all the

241
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,500
a the GPS the autopilot everything else
I was actually have my able to have

242
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,050
myself

243
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:57,450
they Predator drone unfortunately it
wasn't one at the

244
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,620
ones that fired anything but it was
still pretty cool

245
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,860
so I actually use this

246
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,300
I during a physical social engineering
engagement and i'd

247
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:12,010
did a video which was pretty similar to
this because they had security guards

248
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:12,490
and stuff

249
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,760
that way and their defense then I am

250
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,060
physical parameter and if even if you
were actually using this against

251
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,180
are some you know it for testing
purposes only

252
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,440
I love some of the larger organizations

253
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,690
%uh it's got such a small cross-section
that it's not even really show up

254
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:37,980
other than like a bird so plus it's all
made out of like got home balsa wood

255
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,330
saw your United it's not really can be
picked up too well

256
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,120
other than the sound of an electric
motor I the

257
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,380
the flight time is dependent upon the
battery that you actually put in its all

258
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,560
run of electric

259
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,500
others no gas or anything like that that
you have to worry about they come in

260
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,710
you can leave the dock defender you can
have just natural prop on their

261
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:01,130
so yet elsa I was like yeah this is this
is a pretty cool thing

262
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,600
it actually stands about this tall in
the wings are

263
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,980
about as wide as my arm span so and it
floats

264
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,340
Lake this thing can stay up in the air
pro for probably about

265
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,150
for hours on a single charge just
because if you set it up

266
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,890
where you at intellectually Clyde and
actually have a little bit of a drop in

267
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:20,580
the other two

268
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,150
it'll then only fire the engine up when
he actually is the game left so

269
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,699
pretty cool little toy up but I was like

270
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,080
alright the stuff on mister school but
there's gotta be something better

271
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,140
you know what what's that next that even
better you know bond

272
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,290
toy thing they're really make some you
know

273
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,360
James Bond and up my thought was

274
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,490
it's got to be the car right you know

275
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:49,220
%ah what about you know the ability to
go under water in your car

276
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,860
and in there there's always been some
weird you know

277
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,720
crazy you pursue the decided didn't make
a car that went under water but

278
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,110
nothing really cool enough to be
considered bonds car

279
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,510
so I did a little bit a research and

280
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:08,020
decided that I you know if I was going
to do it I needed to do it right

281
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:13,900
so iPhone this and this is actually
their video

282
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,380
at but I'll and if there's an app for
that by the way

283
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:24,380
CSU's actually controlling scarred by
his phone

284
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:28,630
eyes got a a camera on the front some
lasers that actually reads the road in

285
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,560
front of them such

286
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,460
and its kinda got that cool you know
sports car you look can look at it when

287
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,230
the tassels

288
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:38,630
as I alright this is pretty cool I'm
alright with this so I i dis more

289
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:39,930
research in such an that's

290
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:43,700
this thing actually is sports its it's
got sports car speeding

291
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,100
everything out so as I alright this this
could be bonds car

292
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:54,100
let's see if the same actually performs
I underwater

293
00:17:54,130 --> 00:18:00,380
yeah yeah

294
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,510
it's got two built-in oxygen tanks

295
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:10,510
so I

296
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:20,710
but CIA

297
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,730
its job everything in it is all electric
it's all zero-emission so for your green

298
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,690
people out there that

299
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:29,309
you know he you can be done by me going
at the same time I'll

300
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:33,668
but yeah I mean it's actually got a top
speed is like 120

301
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:36,840
miles an hour and forty miles an hour
right in between there depending on who

302
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,360
you ask

303
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,549
I'll hey and a

304
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:44,340
it actually performed pretty well and
just like James Bond as we get a little

305
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,149
bit towards here

306
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,820
somehow this guy's parks again dry

307
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:54,649
and a any drinking martini army

308
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:58,140
yeah as far as I know the they've only
produced like five of them

309
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,669
so I don't know if they're going to
actually move these into a production or

310
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:06,270
there if you have if it's like when this
injury have the money you can have one

311
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,730
show up again I'm trying to find that
waiting list

312
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:13,210
if anybody knows anybody from min your

313
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:18,770
it but like I said there is an app for
it so

314
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,610
depending on independent security they
help you may get one for free

315
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:26,429
up

316
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:30,990
so you know basically with all those two
as those are I like alright so I can

317
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,010
bypass a lot of the physical security I
can you know

318
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:38,408
I can get away I can drive in the water
and get away

319
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:42,580
you know but you know those are still
awsome and feasible as

320
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,678
for purchase saying in a little bit
about my budget and

321
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,809
really couldn't get my employer to back
in your the jet packs or anything

322
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:53,620
so so you know then

323
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,980
I decided to look at some the smaller
stuff I there's

324
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:02,159
obviously if your spy pen and yeah ever
every good spies gonna have a way to

325
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,799
you know will watch what's going on
record video audio things like that

326
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:09,990
so I found this one on line it's a it's
actually a USB

327
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,350
I connector on the bottom a bit and

328
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:18,159
you can record about a the I think it's
like 37 minutes

329
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,710
thirty-some minutes above film on here
internally

330
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,380
and i'd again I mean your talkin
minuscule

331
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,380
and the sing sell for 30 bucks online so

332
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:33,080
like alright cool now night night record
everything that I'm doing after I get

333
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,030
into my jetpack

334
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:37,850
and you know started looking at the
phone

335
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:41,940
obviously we just saw that you can
control your phone

336
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,330
controller summers' book are with your
phone just like a

337
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,520
James then and the which was a tomorrow
never dies

338
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:56,200
think it was I'll and quit

339
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:02,510
and then of course she had the

340
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:06,629
always Quantum of Solace where he had
hidden not camera his phone and things

341
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,140
like that

342
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,539
nowadays everybody knows that the
scammers on its own I

343
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:13,710
had some satellite imaging and things
like that you could do with that

344
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,730
so as I are well does it actually

345
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,799
have anything to do with InfoSec and

346
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,179
you know as much as it's cool you know
it's close it is to the James Bond

347
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:28,350
if you're not able to really do anything
other than you know disc in the

348
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,750
intelligence because you're obviously

349
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,100
you don't have a license to kill are

350
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:38,570
then I you know what's the deal so when
it was actually put together the WMD

351
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,689
project which

352
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:43,559
is again a for pen testing distribution

353
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:47,389
Ubuntu are made for smartphones so

354
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,059
and the one about I actually have
sitting up here is the old rhodium

355
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,510
its online Union for about 60 70 bucks
US

356
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:58,158
and I can have a full distribution over
bring to running

357
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,740
I've got Metasploit built and it's got
which used

358
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,020
social engineers took a pill then and
Matt a whole other utilities all pre

359
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,830
built into it

360
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,970
I its open source they can freely
download everything everything is

361
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:11,890
available online

362
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:16,020
and then the newest version actually
runs on Android as well

363
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,490
thanks to the market you can actually go
on and on Mon

364
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:23,809
Android Linux installer and you can now
push button install Linux

365
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:27,220
are you Ubuntu or Debian under 40

366
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,870
so moving forward I no longer actually
had a prepackaged allow this stuff so

367
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,270
now

368
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:36,470
the latest revision of the WMD package
is an install script

369
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:39,649
so by everything runs out from

370
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,929
a installer script and you get a full
distribution

371
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:46,340
have Ubuntu on their and

372
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:49,809
in particular even if you do use on the
older ones you still get

373
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:52,860
blue to teach to get GPS is still get 3G
service

374
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,630
are you can actually use your phone
while you're also in the Ubuntu

375
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,919
environment get your text messages and
everything

376
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,360
import your contacts things like that
say connection stay connected we need to

377
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,870
do it

378
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:06,760
so up a actually said you know at the
beginning that we're gonna

379
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:13,760
do some Live hacking so that brings them
all up here

380
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,360
and what I have saddam never go

381
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,860
VNC session actually set up to my phone
right here so

382
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,159
this is the phone sitting on the stage
when we gonna watch the whitewater upper

383
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:30,760
whatever you guys think come see it but
the

384
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,440
you it works just like any other the
plan to

385
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:40,250
build

386
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,909
so you get useful information you get
for scripted got happens to install

387
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:44,740
they've got

388
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,600
everything that's run in the background
so what they did was actually

389
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,770
turkey

390
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:55,970
a couple love when those VM's here

391
00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:00,790
just join them they're actually on my
screen you don't leap

392
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:04,139
and a we're gonna do is racially and run
Metasploit

393
00:24:04,139 --> 00:24:09,090
from the phone against the serbians so I
like any good cooking show

394
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:12,360
let me take much what are the other

395
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:18,149
lessons there we go so we've got we've
got framework setup it

396
00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:22,750
and because I'm going over BNC can go
bare with me here

397
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,899
the clipboard and stuff isn't

398
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:32,899
greatest but

399
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,179
so if first things first that most

400
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:40,760
love times that you're gonna do is your
obvious gonna run and maps can

401
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,580
I am I'm I'm gonna cheat a little bit
because I can actually run this

402
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,809
but I'll I'm not II know what up the IP
is ongoing answer

403
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:53,158
I'm thinks I'm cheating a little bit but
a

404
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,529
with new one oh this can't against 192

405
00:24:56,529 --> 00:25:03,529
16 unit and 73

406
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,659
so re again like I said I know I know
the IP address and i'm looking at so

407
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:14,620
for demo purposes normally if you can
run this you can runs against I

408
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:17,669
you know your network or whatever and so
they were getting

409
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:20,760
we've got managed interesting
information showing obviously got a

410
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,840
Windows machine on

411
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,480
and with looks like the number one go to

412
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,779
mostly package for going to try to get
something running a Windows machine

413
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:32,760
anybody I miss 080 67 and another on

414
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,129
clan so

415
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:39,279
up and I saw it 00 267 I

416
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,559
if you're unfamiliar I wasn't kinda made
famous by the Conficker worm

417
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:46,649
other have nasty little spread

418
00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:53,649
and

419
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:19,450
so to go ahead and paces in here so
we're going to set this exploit here

420
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:23,090
everybody hears at least familiar with
Metasploit somewhat yes

421
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:26,260
no yes yes no yes

422
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,890
there you go answer yes up

423
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:34,510
so we're gonna use the MS 08 exploit
we're going to

424
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:41,510
use a Center payload here

425
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,900
so we're gonna we're using a buying
Taylor in the user bind

426
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,030
TCP and we're gonna try to set up an
interpreter session

427
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:09,649
I if anybody Sean from a worm interpret
urge really nice

428
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:12,930
you tell you that you can you know
basically runnin round

429
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:17,020
use it for all your connections runs
lots of fun little tools and things like

430
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,440
that

431
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:24,400
so if we do our show options weird to
see what we're able to set some

432
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,770
again no I know what machine that we
wanna go after from doing our

433
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:32,389
and maps can hear so we will we wanna go
after this I dot 73 machine right

434
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:39,390
see if we get anything on so if we do

435
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,370
shoulda our house which is going to be
our target to that

436
00:27:55,370 --> 00:28:02,370
73 address happens we'll fast on the
phone

437
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:07,170
I and then we're we already know that
we're going on

438
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:10,760
you use that same poor obvious you're
going to connect over for forty three

439
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,510
things like that

440
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:14,950
and because we're using a binary don't
actually said are

441
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:18,300
local address so if everything works

442
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,410
should be able to run

443
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:24,680
exploit and actually have the same
connect

444
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,790
so why this is runnin I

445
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:31,290
a this can be for free I V actually use
this setup

446
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:34,460
as a proof of concept for one my clients
I when I first

447
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,670
release this and couple years ago

448
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:42,330
you got some more inspiration from one
of the four of previous Def Con talks

449
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:46,370
and what he did was the basically sent a
iPhone in with the battery

450
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:49,910
I backup and was able to get access

451
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:53,480
so like very cool so there was a
actually put

452
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,520
the my phone into a box

453
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,560
had a battery are back up on their and
mailed it to my client

454
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,800
because the previous day while I was
doing my life a walk around for a

455
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,950
physical engagement

456
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:09,470
I found out that they still had wept
deployed within their

457
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:14,070
I loading dock and in the loading dock
the reason the iPhone after which

458
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,610
position scanners worse

459
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:19,230
so bad be there so so all that there are
only supported what

460
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,250
so cracked that pre-populated

461
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:26,160
the information into the phone mail that
out and mailed it on

462
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,810
a Thursday overnight it with UPS so that
it would sit there on Friday email that

463
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,540
myself

464
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,850
obviously I didn't work there nobody
else knew that I was an aide myself

465
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:38,210
so what are they gonna do its gonna sit
there until they figure out that I don't

466
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:39,110
actually work that

467
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:43,650
so it's set in their loading dock for
about 18 hours while I connected to it

468
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,660
sitting in my lazyboy in my boxers
playing Call of Duty

469
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,340
running Metasploit packages against
their server environment because their

470
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:50,900
scanners

471
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:55,010
they were connected to their inventory
control system which was in their server

472
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:55,770
environment

473
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:59,680
so but I was actually able to start
doing

474
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,930
are some up the term runs on the
utilities and such

475
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:06,750
right from the right from my

476
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:12,930
lazy boy sitting at home and if we get
the matter for consul

477
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:17,660
set up here we got we already got the
sessions under stairwell

478
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:21,190
so first and we're gonna do is we're
gonna run

479
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:26,080
has tumbled from my with that script I
rip

480
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,570
so we can use that we're gonna actually
don't those local hashes for

481
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:33,350
the hopefully an administrator account
now one thing that I found

482
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:36,560
and not a lot of the pen test that I've
done I

483
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:41,560
was that their more a lot of
organizations use a standard local

484
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,500
administrator

485
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:49,500
I'll so I'll

486
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:54,730
way fun is a lot of organizations use a
standard build with because it cuts down

487
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,430
on the

488
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:59,330
amount of time and effort money and
things like that that I

489
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:02,780
organizations have to spend on their are
I put now machines

490
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:06,149
and when they do that generally they
have a shared local administrator

491
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:06,600
account

492
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,360
so they can see our we've got our
administrator account or Windows 500

493
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,190
account here

494
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:15,410
and here's our hash not

495
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,980
anybody here familiar with past the hash
yes

496
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:23,750
ir so we're all what I've got is
eventually got a second

497
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:27,150
a VM setup

498
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:31,540
and we're gonna see if we can do is

499
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,879
so on a normal engagement what others
are just if I can get access to one in

500
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,240
these

501
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,770
all take the module are the

502
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:45,290
we can action under this and if I use
the PS exact module

503
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:52,290
to in Metasploit 17

504
00:31:55,070 --> 00:32:00,350
phase 2 p.s exact module

505
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:05,860
this no too many X's

506
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:10,830
other

507
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:15,330
I so if we if we use this we actually do
show options

508
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:20,310
we can see everything that we need to
set here and you can actually use this

509
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:20,980
against

510
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,770
I'll a single host if you use summer the
new /url

511
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:28,850
let's play once I got most boy community
and some the other free versions with

512
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:29,480
the gooey

513
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,070
on that rapid7 is released you can runs
against

514
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,919
RC cider our ranges you can run this
against multiple

515
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,070
wilentz network segments things like
that seeking actually

516
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,370
while run this utility through a whole
lot up different machines

517
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:47,700
so Fri Sat are

518
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,370
we share hash her actions may our
password

519
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:54,430
sewing center SMB

520
00:32:54,430 --> 00:33:01,430
pass

521
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:11,530
to to that hash wherever the great right
here

522
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:24,200
%um area moving

523
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,650
so if we can if we take that action
which is grad offer

524
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:32,179
the one host and we pace that down

525
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:36,820
to the one below

526
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:43,820
free school if they're real

527
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:48,440
so said that and they were in a satire
SMB user

528
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:55,440
as administrator

529
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:10,980
have shifted under and then we're going
to senator

530
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:17,980
user to administer here

531
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:24,590
refreshes itself and

532
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:28,440
not normally again if you would run and
laughter and doing your discovery were

533
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,880
known that there's more machines out
there

534
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:36,880
but again I'm gonna change here show we
have a second target that I set up

535
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:43,830
and

536
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:48,000
if if you don't be makin Sharia with

537
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,270
take to here

538
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:55,310
which is again secured knows what was
your username/password

539
00:34:55,310 --> 00:35:02,020
on so secure username and password
secure everything

540
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,280
and if we do a show options again

541
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,470
well we'll actually see that the hash
was populated into the S&P passwords

542
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,660
action and the

543
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:15,250
administrator username is set up in the
end SMB use

544
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:19,590
so if we do a set our host for other
machine

545
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:23,980
which in this case is going to be a 192
168

546
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:29,650
one died 136 address and if everything
works because we did we used again

547
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:33,180
a standard build that now we should be
able to

548
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:40,180
get another interpreter's session out
how to set up

549
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:04,860
so again renewed interpreter on I use
interpreter every time that I possibly

550
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,800
can discuss

551
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,310
it's a really good utility gotta lotta
scripts and things like that aging

552
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:14,049
natively used and if everything

553
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:18,240
works properly we should be able to get
a connection on a second machine

554
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,300
so all we're doing is we're overtake we
no longer have to if you're unfamiliar

555
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,650
with past has no longer actually have to
crack passwords anymore

556
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,790
see as long as you get access to that
hash thank you

557
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:32,360
to Windows for making PS executive able
arm

558
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:36,100
we can actually do pass a hash using one
at the Microsoft utilities

559
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:41,069
I and if it all works should be able to
get a session with the

560
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:44,530
with just that hash so nitsa

561
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:48,300
the refresh rate on BNC sessions a
little bit slow

562
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:52,750
I later on if anybody wants it PLO the
phone tested out see what it does

563
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:56,040
need you know kinda muck around with
that you're more than welcome to try

564
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,560
need

565
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,380
summer otherwise you can again you can
download the stuff online so

566
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:07,380
if this thing refreshes sometimes in

567
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:19,870
stinking never go

568
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:23,029
so we we just died near

569
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:26,820
ended up setting up the connection to
that secondary machine using that

570
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:31,240
password hash it's a Jennings church
count

571
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:35,210
and we should have a mentor procession
coming up in just a second

572
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:39,730
and again this is this is all running of
a phone

573
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:42,940
so anywhere they have I

574
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,960
abuses also for other social engineering
gauge menswear

575
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,470
I if you can actually gain access any
plugging into the wall

576
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:52,550
you have power for as long as the
building is power

577
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:55,840
I police and you don't need to use a SIM
card in there for you if you don't want

578
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,390
to you can still use the wireless
connection on their

579
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:02,500
but if you use the SIM card and have 3G
access and there we've got a mature

580
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,190
British Asian

581
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:08,520
so again you can do this across an
entire domain you can do this across

582
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,570
almost unchanged

583
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:12,750
any other normal scripts services things
like that they're built in the Match

584
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,650
Play Framework

585
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,770
are available here you can run up are
you can actually run

586
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:20,360
social engineers took it to do some wet

587
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:25,400
I had actual web packing things like
that because apaches built in as well

588
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,120
so I you can also do some the as a mass

589
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,720
attacks that are now built under set as
well up from your phone

590
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,240
so there we go there's an interpreter
session

591
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,740
and we can run but everyone from the

592
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:45,710
next one that I would normally be would
be

593
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:49,990
run cried collect and that's good how to
get your domain tokens and things like

594
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,390
that so you can again do

595
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:54,670
a I talking impersonation

596
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:59,240
a session a with your domain users and
everything also from your phone so

597
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,830
are well that's running kinda skip
backing

598
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:09,830
go back to the actual slides so

599
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,170
up else we're

600
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:17,180
was fun so on

601
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:20,470
really i mean this type thing it if
these

602
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:24,400
whether it's use in a remote-controlled
wrong whether it's

603
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,520
deciding to you have the expenditure
budget pact to get over somebody spends

604
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:33,680
or its to use up your phone I wanted to
leverage the ability to

605
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,779
take everyday items the effects
everybody's organization

606
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,900
their security policy procedure and
things like that but

607
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,690
I you know having these outside om

608
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:46,960
ways entry and and ideas aren't your
normal

609

our support team things like that don't

610
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,860

it

614
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,220

thousands and hundreds of thousands of
dollars every year

626
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,750
care policies and procedures render only
sit on top of somebody's file can they

but a lot of stuff is really available
out there arm

641
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:30,530

and some other context then it's just
the phone

649
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:58,790
