1
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:12,299
basically on the talk structure me

2
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:20,719
home

3
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,609
automated machine learning and data
mining techniques a problem

4
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,060
the you see Hong

5
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:40,730
him

6
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,160
me Hong ball

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,560
you know Miami being

8
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,830
some top then I'll

9
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:57,680
I'll conclude that with some some
examples of Hall

10
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,150
in a bit of mining and machine learning
is probably not the only answer

11
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:04,400
and if and when it has to be applied it
has to be applied with some gonna domain

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,949
knowledge

13
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:09,350
are and you know it has to be combined
with all went up other approaches in

14
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,100
order to make

15
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,259
up for a holistic solution solution okay

16
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:19,119
so let's look at the threat landscape
arm in the last 12 to 18 months

17
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,920
I'll again I'll targeted attacks have
gained

18
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,770
the tragedy I'll you know thanks to
attacks like

19
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,798
RR all you know stops that

20
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:33,619
social networking that Holmes provide

21
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:37,139
manage source of information for wage up

22
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:40,949
attacks can be targeted I'll even to

23
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,759
most sophisticated users because the
attacks cat a whole lot of context

24
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,020
packets are definitely

25
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,649
learning from all the techniques used in
targeted tax

26
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,479
and we expect many of those techniques
to land up in a packet

27
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,700
to make a make up for the attacks to be

28
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,729
extremely sophisticated I and yet seen
more and more

29
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:06,920
are that a attacks are using

30
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,530
arm stealth techniques in order to
remain Dahlman

31
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,739
arm and hidden in enterprises for a long
period of time

32
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,870
are specially as they are becoming more
and more targeted were specific

33
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,670
enterprise and have a very specific

34
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,290
aim in mind unlike before it was about
martz infection

35
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,319
getting users I'll is uses

36
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,340
information across the Internet are have

37
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,489
users cannot ass as me a you know all
these PC or

38
00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:38,280
are arnie via mobile so you

39
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,420
music community mobile homes you follow
and

40
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,930
are progress in the same posh you CNN
lot of

41
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,470
movements in grease or the last two
years and we expect next year to be

42
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,049
a to be innocent you know increase to be
in a similar fashion

43
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:57,480
saw I mean what has really happened or a
beautiful over the last few years is

44
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:57,980
that

45
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,500
are the attacks have up you know

46
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,790
my good enough be from of relatively few
threads

47
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,890
to a micro distribution model where arm

48
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,530
few number of billions of exactly the
same hat are spread across large number

49
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,090
of users

50
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,430
so very small stall make its way into

51
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,989
a million some machines across the globe
all with the same

52
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:24,849
anti-semitism machines Tom I mean the
same shop who was born in millions

53
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:28,000
sheens what we see now is mulatto

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,989
maidens a window and market for example
proper gonna get into millions of users

55
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:34,909
but from a five talking

56
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:37,909
fingerprint on a few we saw 10 had

57
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:42,450
close like 18 millions and harkin had
close to 1.6 million

58
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,239
so if you were to look at up from a fine
thing up in front of you would think

59
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,159
that a million

60
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:51,048
threats but they're really bored onto
you know the same time which is harkin

61
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:54,200
spread across millions of users so the
other

62
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,060
challenge for the traditional
signature-based security approaches that

63
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,739
which relies on a fingerprint which lies
in the fact that you have to have a

64
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,790
sample in hand in order to produce a
fingerprint

65
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,370
doesn't really fit this model so what
are the odds that a

66
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,249
traditional signature-based security
solution will be able to discover all

67
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:10,980
the slant

68
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,549
becomes extremely challenging K arm

69
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:18,519
so when I talk about tracks I'm and
threats being unique at the

70
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,380
at the byte level what really goes on I
in a simple animated step is

71
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,100
arm haggadah basically the look that fat
they used to

72
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,310
which are effortless produce in order
produce

73
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,620
up by Moody's which differ data byte
level are

74
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,690
in order evade a signature be security
engine

75
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,860
and most of the attackers these days
come in with built-in functionality

76
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,990
to muted the file to appointment this

77
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,539
security engine is no longer picking up
the threat it so that no one has

78
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:49,349
produced one

79
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,430
and and give it back but they would
trade and they have a whole bunch of

80
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,560
security engines

81
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,380
against was there checking the five up
and military Italy

82
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,069
can find a million which pretty much
have aids as many security engines as

83
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:02,710
possible

84
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,508
again so all this is automated again
because this is a city they're trying to

85
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:08,590
do anything is amiss technology all it
takes is

86
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,039
install a product I'll obey the product
called on the leaders of nations muted

87
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,150
the five best in

88
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,190
if it is detected then you're really
into is not good enough you needed it

89
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,599
again and again and again and

90
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:21,590
you can do that an automated fashion
they could be ginning abide adding a

91
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,130
bailar adding a section

92
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,250
I wanna arm and the

93
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,539
attack in 10 producer Martin pretty
sophisticated

94
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:32,780
arm you know these are some examples be
in charge here you know

95
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,009
pointedly couldn't you know kids you
really don't have to know a lot about

96
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:36,639
them

97
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,099
but you can use them in a very powerful
fashion here's an example with their

98
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:43,219
asking the user to supply at the the
attackers

99
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,389
be happens by the FTP account details or
gmail account details for the keylogger

100
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,250
would start sending information

101
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,490
arm you know they are attacked its rich

102
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,440
have a specific ups which is built an
hour

103
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,300
I'll in often spilled into made specific
security vendors

104
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,389
I and again you know depending on the
capabilities of the

105
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:06,560
a in on kids the price will ease

106
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,460
and they are migrating to the cloud
model of course the whole industry is

107
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,060
migrating to was about so

108
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,470
why dollars of agents have been a file
are any can

109
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,729
pretty much up take advantage of their
pricing

110
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:20,840
all models like you know for a dollar
you can use 24 hours

111
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,270
summit as many files and get as many
minutes as possible

112
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,330
I that are again guaranteed to invade

113
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:31,310
are you know security engines and then
on the base to the pricing bill

114
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,490
unless a whole bunch of security vendors
was the investigations and guarantee

115
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,690
that image those

116
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,910
engines are missing out which has

117
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,039
gained a lot of attention on the last
are arm

118
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:45,159
18 months up is you know we've seen

119
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,440
examples of these rare all that is going
on is

120
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,919
basically just the skating on the binary
again so

121
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,460
these are whole bunch of misleading ups
concedes minnows

122
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,550
connection and does express help experts
settings

123
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,789
they all come with different names but
as you can see there just

124
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:04,840
skins on top of the basic same
misleading at

125
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,759
ARB so all that is going on as the
template for the UI is changing

126
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,050
but the basic functionality of the a the
matter remains the same

127
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:17,400
I'm so in this case if be seen I you
know for example for this particular

128
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,430
are missing out we saw forty nine
different clones

129
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:25,280
for exactly the same arm attack that was
going on

130
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,620
arm on pretty much what I mean an motors
most with me

131
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,110
on the way from having a back page which
supports the

132
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,150
product me you have a 24 by 7 helpline

133
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,479
one Asian on number and everything set
up nobody automated fashion

134
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:43,349
so you know is the point being that the
bites change

135
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:47,139
but beavis on the sides really don't
change password stealers will continue

136
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:48,449
to steal passwords

137
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:52,729
spam bottle can you imagine it spans and
rogue anti-virus will continue to pop up

138
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:54,740
the synapse for the user to

139
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,620
taken download on so in a sense the by
to changing

140
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,699
the signatures have been committed but
the Beavers don't change

141
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:06,139
so hence beard based detection dans

142
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:09,669
are basically take advantage of this
basic fact

143
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:12,810
a it is an engine that ignores for the
thread looks like

144
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,449
but the tax what on the missile what the
trend us

145
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:19,729
okay so that's the whole point to be
here based detection

146
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:22,550
engines and they've been around for more
than two decades there's nothing new

147
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,689
about it

148
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:27,360
arm saw before I go into more details

149
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,900
one thing I would like to clarify arm
over the last couple decades

150
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,320
we have progressed from a detection
based industry to a production base

151
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,320
industry

152
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,760
our prevention base industry but there's
a whole lot of confusion on these

153
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,809
Thompson to Marty's detection proudly
implies

154
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:47,810
at least in my mind arm detecting a
threat after the fact that it has done

155
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,500
something malicious on the system

156
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,209
and the product has to then take an open
meeting at fat

157
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:56,390
as well as appearing the system to
restore the settings if

158
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,980
a registry setting was modified it has
to be restored to the usual state

159
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,339
in the fine was modified it has released
or to the ozone state

160
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:07,420
if you are for example its sequels file
was modified on the militias entries in

161
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,660
the atty was positively apparently so do
the usual state

162
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,399
say so it is challenging to offer
protection to the end users

163
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,550
for detection base model because you are
not always guaranteed to be able to

164
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,260
repair the state in the usual state

165
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,110
and I'm gonna be fine modification is
extremely hard unless you have a copy on

166
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,329
a very smart engine it can be worth

167
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:29,959
the bunny level changes prevention is
before the back

168
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:33,149
right so before the sample runs on the
system

169
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:36,480
and does anything militias you should be
able to detect it right

170
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,269
arm and and Prevention becomes extremely
challenging especially in terms of being

171
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:41,930
able to pay system because

172
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:46,329
how do you detective threat before it
runs yet to claim it to be ruthless

173
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:49,500
right so up its its

174
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,180
pretty challenging but again there are
I'll ways in which

175
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,200
even that model becomes viable so
protection in

176
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,860
in all could be both I the detection
based on prevention based

177
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,089
I and an users can take advantage of

178
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:07,230
either those morons a security you know
engines can implement both the models

179
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,070
and Palin

180
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:13,060
on as a as a mention challenges are of
course you know can all the changes that

181
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,160
it was if you have a ditch

182
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,910
nation is mourning and you know
prevention based approaches

183
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:22,510
bitch action do you block you know how
much do you monitor how invisible you

184
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,189
get

185
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,060
and what is the performance or head of
such a model it

186
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,079
arm here's here's something that you
need to think about

187
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,230
right if if a man is doing 6 actions

188
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,200
and you are monitoring all those six
actions but you conclude that it is

189
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,350
malicious in the fifth action in ISE

190
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,810
at prevented the sixth-most most
malicious action that it was about to

191
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,600
take

192
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,720
you know does it are doesn't convince
your the fact that it is a prevention

193
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,740
base engine

194
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,910
arm I think only if the force 5 action
to talk with completely reversible

195
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,209
by the security engine and I think it
would for the Prevention baseball

196
00:10:57,209 --> 00:11:00,720
and and i think thats that's the more
realistic stance

197
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,910
and that is how it should be I a really
dollar if that accrue

198
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:09,019
up in all be here a bit attention
engines which can block

199
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:12,440
and conclude with you know good success
rate on the poster in that there was a

200
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,079
because

201
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:16,149
there's not much context that they have
green or

202
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:19,570
home an insult to those other I mean I
think

203
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:23,510
I'll the all all these mornings can fit
in a security

204
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,550
arm engine in Palo so let's look at the
liggett legacy

205
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,420
rules bisbee be able security arm
they're basically lose weight and

206
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,560
publishers activity

207
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,240
they could be as simple as things like a
finance from a temp folder

208
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,760
rights to run one ski creates a file in
sequel in Windows

209
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,920
and martha is a browser homepage on
analyst would write such a rule

210
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,099
is pretty confident that there is no
legit software that runs from the temp

211
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,870
folder

212
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,940
mario has a brother home page right to
fight a Windows key and so on so forth

213
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,980
are and hence it is malicious arm

214
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,540
another example would be a file on from
the temp folder there's an open process

215
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,790
to another vendor service processors

216
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,050
up rights into the process memory and
create a more threat

217
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:08,339
again if you believe that this is up
very unlikely to be here for tweens

218
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:09,050
offer

219
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,339
any of those this behavior across a lot
large population of malware

220
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:15,680
he could be lighting such rules amps

221
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,649
so legacy systems are simple and
intuitive expert systems

222
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:23,290
they require dormant domain exports to
know how to distinguish between good and

223
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,060
bad

224
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,610
the allies amendment this part the
trends and denied the rules

225
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,399
arm and the product may have an ability
to let you can let the administrator so

226
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,410
the user's

227
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:36,939
are you know interface with the I'll be
here in June and write rules if they

228
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,649
think

229
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:41,269
up they can arm design they they can
design rules

230
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:45,820
many specifically is to in tailored was
the environment

231
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,350
arm in an enterprise on the
applicability of course is

232
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,970
many security products specially in
enterprise products been administrators

233
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,160
do one such inability I'm and in some
cases this may be the only answer

234
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,949
are you know there might be some touch
which can be very easily

235
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:05,519
detected and re mediated through a
simple rules we don't need

236
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,370
whole lot of arm complex specification
or the traders

237
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,519
arm the benefits of course of this model
is that it provides

238
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,910
Bronica written in simple signature be
security arm

239
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,130
it can provide a precise reason for why
a detection

240
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:24,630
happen and out why a pretty good thing
was identified as much is because

241
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,630
it it is backed up by the rule that
trigger right take a look at the ruling

242
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,600
and say okay this is one on that that's
why

243
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,810
this thing was malicious arm you can
name a threat

244
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:36,300
and so it could be again many contextual
and you can take relevant actions

245
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,730
because now you can say

246
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,829
up it these are the actions undertaken
it is this type of fat

247
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:44,610
and so in order to remediate I need to
take this action that you could be

248
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:47,730
come in a process delete a file repair
industry

249
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,399
are simply coming to file and that would
be good enough they can take

250
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:54,980
are or you can this has been a process
that could be ma commandos political

251
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,389
process in this case if you try to shut
down its gonna reboot machine

252
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:02,199
are you can simply suspend the process
and taking off on the side effects

253
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:04,220
before you go about terminating the
process

254
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,759
arm to the gonna advantages so you get
lot lot more contextual in writing

255
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:12,250
this kind of rules of course the
disadvantages skill ability rating of

256
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,269
skill because

257
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,660
you require human experts we looking at
these threats day in day out writing

258
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,930
rules

259
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:22,209
right and and replies domain expertise
more importantly

260
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:26,449
does it really imply lower rates you
know it's really up to the analyst for

261
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,320
the quality that lets you have

262
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,730
it's mostly based on the gut feeling
that the feeling that this is not gonna

263
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,690
trigger on

264
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,720
police officer up but that's not true I
mean

265
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,920
people I don't consequences of their
even example that border before

266
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,370
running from a temp folder right into
run key

267
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:46,509
up dropping a filing system for you can
imagine I

268
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:50,779
an installer dropping its child
processes up in the tempo run taking all

269
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:51,570
these actions

270
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:55,529
on admission is trying to distribute a
patch are trying to do something in an

271
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:57,579
enterprise environment and we've seen
that happen

272
00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:01,509
okay so so to say that one model
provides lower rates compared to the

273
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:02,120
other

274
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,190
is merely an illusion because are he

275
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:10,029
even domain experts don't really can
capture the two behavioral diversity of

276
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:11,000
peace offer

277
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,259
across the globe in a slaughter of
creative talent out there was going to

278
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:17,529
let love create a program in

279
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:21,279
arm so back to scalability are Sophie

280
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,410
conclude that in appearance are far less
than five innings and being able to

281
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,829
carry model is a good way to address the
problem

282
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:30,660
I then what happens when you getting
your shot too hard to conclude whether

283
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,279
it's a new $5 million to really a new
malware

284
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,420
and the same out maybe pat differently
that same Alan maybe skin differently

285
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,490
arm so is the answer to analyze the
thread I guess

286
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,360
know it should not be the only answer
maybe one of the answers

287
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,779
arm I think it has to be augmented with
automation

288
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:51,019
you can collect that Iran you can mind
that it and create models which can

289
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:55,810
offset far the scale of the problem that
we're trying to deal

290
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,829
so I'll quickly got was a machine
learning basics I'll

291
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:02,740
and thence show how we can apply machine
learning to solve this problem

292
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,839
and how that is not the complete
solutions well okay so

293
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,800
machine learning is basically I'll an
approach to artificial intelligence to

294
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,480
get the computer tool on

295
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,690
arm by showing it lots of examples okay

296
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:19,190
arm so he in this case up in a given the
face

297
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:23,300
up in the machine learning are Martin
should be able to pick up the fact

298
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,319
that the name the pollen that I'm okay I

299
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:30,649
in some cases arm hand programming is
not possible in machine learning may be

300
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:32,959
the only solution for example like this
election

301
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,790
think about writing a piece action
program by hand right i mean we're gonna

302
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,519
ride

303
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:39,649
up a SoCal are on lips which has

304
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:42,870
to round circles with white and black in

305
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:46,300
a nose and a mouth you know i mean that
definition could even fit the

306
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,560
piece of human was the monkey it so are

307
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,009
the hand programming may not be the
answer in

308
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:56,920
many in the cases handwriting detection
is another example a machine learning is

309
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,279
probably the best answer

310
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,420
so from the central question machine
learning is how can we build computer

311
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,100
systems that

312
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,230
automatically improve with experience
and water the fundamental laws that one

313
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,910
on learning processes

314
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:12,570
arm and it can be best described as a
process which tries to improve

315
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:15,849
its performance at a party about to
experience

316
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:18,899
the arm and and by that experience i
mean

317
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,870
examples of the data that would show and
it will try to figure out

318
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:26,300
are hard to are detect are

319
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:30,230
the example are by the features of the
example that it has been shown

320
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:34,460
so this was to predict what the are lay
below the Cactus League of

321
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,070
the data that is van you given on
example twin

322
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,320
and public about how that more with
examples as a move forward okay

323
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,860
so it's basically discovering
relationship between the variables the

324
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,000
system input

325
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,650
and the output arm and trying to the
deck for the hidden relationships are

326
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,840
you giving an

327
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,399
and you say this is the obscene intense
in

328
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,520
when you're trying to train the model
what you giving it is

329
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,980
leaving one basic some feel machine
learning

330
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:03,110
machine learning that you're doing
labeling and you're saying

331
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,630
here's the data usually and try to
discover

332
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,310
what is the relationship between the
data and the label such that

333
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:13,330
be given an unknown example it can
predict want to label all

334
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,389
known example is on the base load modern
has loaned

335
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:20,140
many bed in the living examples so the
billing bought a machine learning a

336
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,230
computer science

337
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:24,380
statistics cognitive science and
information theory

338
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,820
are and they all ask a very distinctive
question

339
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,570
and machine learning basically up built
on all these questions

340
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,159
and but poses a very different question
I'm gonna move on

341
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,280
to more I'll more

342
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,570
in for me the problem domain that

343
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,919
this into a time machine learning but
arm

344
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,610
one thing that is important to I'll note
that there are basically fourth

345
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:52,150
for I'll top-level categories a machine
learning

346
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,990
one is supervised machine learning which
is as I mentioned armed supervised

347
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,410
machine learning is very given labeled
it up

348
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,560
and a given examples and tries to build
tomorrow in order to predict what the

349
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,409
label oven on examples

350
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,680
and on supplies machine learning problem
is very good lot of examples

351
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,350
they are not labeled and the system
tries to figure out what relationship

352
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,750
exists between those examples are trying
to build clusters

353
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,780
so plus occasion would be a classic
supplies machine learning

354
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,780
oMG thats clustering would be I would be
an example up on supplies machine

355
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,300
okay semi supplies machine learning is
where you have a mix of labeled and

356
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,260
unlabeled data

357
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:31,180
you might have very little label it a
and you could have lots of unlabeled

358
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:31,660
data

359
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,830
and you're trying to build Martin's ARB
oh and trying to improve the models on

360
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,120
the basis of the label Leah

361
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,280
because very few of them arm you try to

362
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,810
a measure the entire of the model that
you build on the label it and try to

363
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,409
improve it

364
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,500
reinforcement learning is is you know
classic

365
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,920
example is robotics very kind of I'll

366
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,390
give it it has a sequence of input on
actions that can perform

367
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,970
and there is a rewarding to know the
model but if it takes a wrong decision

368
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,130
it is by National Grid makes the night
decision then it has awarded and tries

369
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:03,760
to

370
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,010
improve the decision-making process
because the price maximize

371
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,720
up its behavior towards an expected to
war so the foreign

372
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,290
basic categories and um out bro and
emphasize and follow this will talk

373
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:18,000
about problems as in most in supervised
machine learning

374
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,560
but and that is up fish in a pond
supplies as well

375
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,800
to the basic sensible she learning
involved to pick up that feature a

376
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,290
presentation free to ask

377
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:30,560
arm you have input and output in your
trying to figure out what features

378
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,500
relayed mostly up to for to the examples
and how they help you distinguish

379
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,280
between

380
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,399
one class or the other again and in in
our case

381
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,960
what we're really talking about is
matter samples right so does the clean

382
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,710
sample

383
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,850
on it is a militia sample if I give you
a whole lot of cleaning

384
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:51,280
clean samples and militia samples are
what machine learning significant orders

385
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,440
what other distinct characteristics that
has been dismissing wooden bat

386
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,690
and those cactus 60 something that we
10+2 up

387
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:02,120
use our domain expertise and tell that
you know maybe this is one of the

388
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,100
features maybe this is gonna be just
maybe this'll all the features

389
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,220
and it tries to use those features in
conjunction to the best extent possible

390
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,590
on the missile examples to build a model
in on those

391
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,959
features such are trying to been
features on its owner tries to

392
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,960
leverage in apply up those features in
order to come up with the most accurate

393
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,610
models

394
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,820
and I've examples to go about trying how
haha I will be

395
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,070
doing that so you you do that you
compile it enough by compiling that it i

396
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,600
mean you collect the data

397
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,900
arm armed and in the new to the machine
running out and they don't

398
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,990
because it went awesome machine learning
algorithms arm

399
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:39,320
you train the algorithm you value the
resulting in trades that process over

400
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,300
and over again

401
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,760
jill is targetting models which perform
than expected

402
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,970
advocacy level the many choices have
tools available

403
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:50,990
up many free ones back has one that I'll
be

404
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,490
in using in my devil armed

405
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,750
the only problem is it's a dollar beers
application is not scale well to large

406
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,040
scale data

407
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,159
arm you have long I mean it's

408
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,390
got many fancy you are you can look at
the data sets and how

409
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,540
that is said split across various
features and so on so forth

410
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:13,190
arm then you have orange which is native
see

411
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:16,280
base application has very nice Python
interface is again

412
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,720
has I can drop are you I as well so we
can talk

413
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,030
using command line using pipe are you
can use I can drop

414
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:27,470
in order to evaluate and are loaded and
a valid response

415
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:31,000
and then put 54 more you know for most
of these

416
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,010
the colors not very on showing a very
well

417
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:37,870
but I think shining example the so the
input file formats are usually

418
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:42,100
you know of five letters a file format a
very simple text file format where it

419
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:42,920
has a header

420
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,580
but just ice for the features are and
then comma-separated values

421
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,790
all each and every example that you
might want to cap represent

422
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:53,010
using those features arm MTSU palaces

423
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:56,110
tab separated or CSV files arm any of
those

424
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:59,420
would be the type of tubulin provides K

425
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,880
so now let's see how we can apply
machine learning to be able to guarantee

426
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,880
so the goal here is to train tomorrow
and provide are made and meaningful

427
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,800
information about unknown samples that's
really what the goal is right

428
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,940
see getting inundated with a lot more to
samples coming in

429
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,200
and you want to not treat them all in
order to I'll a

430
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,470
you know offset the demand for two main
exports to be looking at each and every

431
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,780
sample right to you want to

432
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,040
are offered that work a little bit too a

433
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:28,230
in automated machine learning-based
systems arm

434
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:32,570
22 goals that you may want to fulfill
one could be just identify a class or

435
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,250
label you might want to say this is
gonna this is bad

436
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,800
are you might want to identify an
association so you might have a

437
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,780
collection of

438
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:42,480
threats office families are and you
might want to know whether

439
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,100
this new incoming sample closely
resembles Mitchell the various

440
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,250
touch families that you might have an
inflection

441
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,520
so one would be a prosecution problem
the other would be a clustering problem

442
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,040
the so so basically I application of

443
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,180
arm in information extracted implies we
hear that

444
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,930
the that we want to pass by the sample
provide information to the analysts

445
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:06,950
for the purpose of labeling all writing
definitions

446
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,980
arm so either they can just use that
information

447
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:13,800
and improve the quality of the engine
are you could send directly use the

448
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,310
Marlin order been a real-time prediction
engine

449
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:20,290
both the up applications are up
something that is going on in the

450
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,540
industry today

451
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,879
arm so in terms of machine learning on
the steps that I talk about generally

452
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,220
machine learning now wooden wall you
collect the samples

453
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,690
and I see samples I mean labeled samples
so you note that these are

454
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:37,470
militia samples and these are a valid
samples would set up a VM

455
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:40,470
for the monitoring thing look so
monitoring thing what becomes

456
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:44,160
pretty critical to ha you would go about
using this

457
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,150
going forward because you don't want to
build a monitoring framework really want

458
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,270
a good morning X Factor to the framework

459
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:54,470
and then applied for our real-time
protection arm because you want

460
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,490
the enforcement and the collection
points to be very close to each other

461
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,810
almost the same

462
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:02,320
arm and that early cleared for example
again

463
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,139
I you wouldn't bush and on the samples
in some kind of automation system that

464
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,750
you would have built on a farm were two
machines

465
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:12,490
you would collect a sample behavior data
you of course would want to recycle 2

466
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,550
p.m. because as you know not where
they're going

467
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:17,770
make changes to the system that you
don't want to show up in the next 10 the

468
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,040
next sample

469
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,350
you extract information a format
suitable for data mining

470
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,730
ukraine the models and your test and
deploy the models and again

471
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,390
menu to buy the morning to either
deploying it merely for information

472
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:32,370
extraction are you for replying for
real-time protection

473
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:37,530
okay Sol here's a here's an example for
the monitoring framework would look like

474
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:40,550
up the it could simply be built on
something like

475
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:43,889
detours the are using use a more refined
looking

476
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:47,480
arm and it would collect information
like the pen name call on

477
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,760
rate so you could hook pretty much every
export Oracle 32

478
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,870
and log the API that was called are you
could also collect the data or

479
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:55,890
information

480
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:59,280
I could collect information like which
it a call this API

481
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,730
stayed on the process at ECA you could
extract the features

482
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:07,050
and dumb X at the pictures under the law
quite into waters

483
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:11,700
the i five right up our fight the issue
file .txt fine whatever suits are

484
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,990
up machine learning to party that you're
going to use

485
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,560
arm and the features that would extract
things like

486
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,179
has you ira vindo right doesn't happen
have you ever know

487
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,420
are I mean more to be malicious samples
for example

488
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:29,210
box may not have any user interface
element now that's something that

489
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,740
I'm expecting domain experts you come up
with are soul and

490
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:37,450
domain expert might say yeah I mean for
a person the cases I don't see

491
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:41,020
you I in trouble matter so that that is
an interesting feature

492
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,030
arm so the that's what I meant by

493
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:47,190
creating features using domain expertise
okay does

494
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:51,920
doesn't do not become a negation are the
talk or IRC doesn't talk or its GDP

495
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,070
is it registered in an all the stock
location right Solanki on one ski

496
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:00,740
service are enablement on support does
it create a Windows Task

497
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:05,140
doesn't modify a be filed on the system
does it create a be fine

498
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,570
does it inject into clustered process
and you can have a definition of just a

499
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,070
process like I'd mention

500
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:13,389
minoso this is an example of a transfer
process again so these are the kind of

501
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,070
examples of features that you might

502
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:18,210
have which you want the machine learning
system to

503
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:22,350
take advantage of and figure out what
combination of Twin Falls

504
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,960
on these various questions you want to
ask about a good what's about to happen

505
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,190
should be mine in order to come up with

506
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:31,490
I'll a model that can very accurately
predict

507
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:35,660
whether this unknown samples clean on
militias

508
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:39,050
arm not sure whether everybody can see
this

509
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:43,280
up clearly are not up but basically the
features that I have

510
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,889
up in this up are fine but I've created

511
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:50,080
things like create window sure window
find window

512
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,409
shall execute delete file will file
create file

513
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:56,960
is to be send request device happen both
with all the whole point will be this

514
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,200
API

515
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,220
up state information that I'm collecting
our

516
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,580
has a window a doesn't have a listening
port

517
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:08,800
does it create starts doesn't modify the
p5 creates a be fine

518
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:13,220
does it injected is it registered as
awful start in the last attribute is

519
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,840
how long has it been created since okay
so

520
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,620
it's a warrant thank you doing is trying
to build a model to be so these

521
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:24,730
missed out the sex of a sample are and
created since seconds as

522
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,910
is an interesting arm future you can
pretty much say that

523
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:32,080
manner is usually very interested in
taking doing a malicious activity as

524
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,370
soon as it lands in the system

525
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:37,080
okay but at least offer doesn't
necessarily have to take any action

526
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,560
it might be sitting there you'll onto
that it may not take any action on the

527
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,700
user on track to the

528
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,380
applications on support saw that itself
might be a very interesting feature that

529
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,580
you might want to use in

530
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,169
connection with all the other features
in order to distinguish between good and

531
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,960
bad soften

532
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,060
so sample that does a whole lot of
activity in a very short span of time

533
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,129
my group more malicious then it leans
offer that does very little

534
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:02,260
for a long period of time because it
requires use in traction constantly

535
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,560
get so let's a see if I can arm

536
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,389
do the demo

537
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:12,510
okay so he s mecca arm and

538
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:16,390
because one of the tools and I mention
and

539
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,970
when launched the Explorer arm and I
have bill

540
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:25,230
the of file from arm basically from the

541
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:29,930
are from around I'll its lost a fumble
that i've collected like a non

542
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:34,340
90% of those arm

543
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,220
so here's home his ear are fine

544
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,370
okay so many Lord in our file

545
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:45,070
as a short I'll hard look like pre
people to create

546
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:48,260
ob-gyn all the various features and if
you look at the

547
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:52,510
class which is you know the glass is
basically on the last line of each and

548
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,300
every

549
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:57,070
up dana point that I collected for each
and every sample at and wannabe chain

550
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,540
saying that the state is a modern
demolition sample

551
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:04,030
on a valid sample a you know I have
forty-seven good examples and body too

552
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,010
bad examples

553
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:08,500
okay I want to upload the data arm

554
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,780
I basically can use a whole bunch a
built-in

555
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:14,790
are machine learning technologies I'll

556
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:18,389
are modeling technology that are
available I'll pick one

557
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:22,750
many commonly used a 48-hour decision
trees because

558
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,750
and reason isn't reason are good is
because

559
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:29,280
you can see Howard a ride on a
particular conclusion by looking at the

560
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,000
media's

561
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,380
up you know walking on the tree and
saying okay on how did it make a

562
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,100
decision whether particular samplers

563
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,130
malicious or not and you can reason
about the morning

564
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:42,470
armed other models provide you with math
mathematical polynomial function

565
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:46,180
and it is very difficult to reason about
100 and I'm in that model and say that

566
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,010
this file its mission

567
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:53,440
so somewhere use G-forty aid leave while
the default options and on it was

568
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,580
head start and it creates a morning

569
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:00,429
agree that the efficacy of the model is
pretty bad sixty-two percent

570
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:04,100
correctness and 30 seven-percent arm
Andheri

571
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,930
I nonetheless the disciples baseball are
this is not an innocent on but you'd be

572
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,950
training a mom that you want to deploy
in production

573
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:15,690
but if you look at the Mon that was
created you know if it

574
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:19,140
look lookin the you know some some
national

575
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:22,970
decision to deny that if create if it
created a file

576
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,970
and it was created in less than six you
know six thousand

577
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:29,070
arm seconds are and if it

578
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:33,540
did ascend request then it is bad and
there are 19 examples was that

579
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,940
that bad example country good examples

580
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,010
I'll but if it did not do an HTTP
request

581
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:44,270
and it was registered as at an auto
stock and it did try to find I've been

582
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,450
on the desktop

583
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:48,690
I'm then it is malicious I V eight
examples of those which does that and

584
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:49,320
you

585
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,790
valid examples so those are the kind of
things you can observe problem on that

586
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,710
and bells

587
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:57,890
are you know again the more our dataset
you get the better quality that is that

588
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:58,720
you give

589
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,980
up you know better model to get okay

590
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:06,320
arm I i was gonna both men are in charge
them as well but

591
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,710
I don't think I have enough time for
that out so basically once you build the

592
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:12,010
classifies you wanna black los pies

593
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:15,210
I yeah I I mentioned you know that there
are whole point

594
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:18,910
on regional collect information and the
whole point on which you can enforce

595
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:22,380
the decisions that you are deny from the
models and they may or may not be the

596
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:22,780
same

597
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,720
one could be simply for collecting
information the others could be simply

598
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,220
to leverage that information

599
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,920
invalid the Marlin taken action because
not all who points

600
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,170
a suitable for taking a block action
okay the design

601
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:38,130
of up near the trying to take a block
action might depend on

602
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:41,530
modifying an outcry matter of of the
pack on

603
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:45,500
forces are turning up returning on an
opponent on support so

604
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,670
you might want to decide then Mitch API
do you want to block action on an

605
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:52,970
with you guys want to collect
information okay

606
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:56,710
I again but it has to hope you do want
to hook a high-level API which allows a

607
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,390
long black

608
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:01,850
131 hookah low-level API again
lower-level API's could be very

609
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:05,130
up chappie right because local sleepy
eyes

610
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:08,390
are fitted onto some low-level EPS

611
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:12,390
I am what kind of action you want to
take filling an API or

612
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,870
hitting a trade or process of modifying
are proud to those on the meanest choice

613
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:16,440
love

614
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,980
block action that you might want to be
so you know that is hype

615
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:23,120
use but in reality is it doesn't really
work out

616
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,940
that easily and he cannot really go
about applying at

617
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,760
without understand what's going on are
one interesting thing that

618
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,100
be absorbed was lot of samples failed to
run an automation

619
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,160
and more importantly good samples failed
running on a mission and that because

620
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,290
that samples are

621
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:41,980
fairly stand long they don't have much
dependencies the London easily

622
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,600
good samples on the other hand armed
have a lot of dependencies

623
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,160
arm they might be depending on
configuration so if you get a good

624
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,010
sample

625
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,350
but you don't have all the other
dependencies are the country Asian that

626
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,710
it expects industry

627
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:56,510
for example it may not drop the field
line right are it me

628
00:33:56,510 --> 00:34:00,920
required use in traction again if you in
automation for launching extn if it is

629
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,880
betting on a

630
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,010
arm okay Council ballot box and you'll
even running for

631
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:08,359
10 seconds until can done with our
meeting the sample it hasn't really done

632
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:12,598
anything it hasn't launched its
motivating for use in traction to happen

633
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:15,880
okay so we automation and dependency
convict would be

634
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,520
some other challenges many samples del
Malaysia samples on the other hand

635
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,690
deliberately field running on a mission
they have

636
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:25,639
the mobo capabilities rate arm a simple
instructions

637
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:29,060
in order to Dec much on my mind are they
might

638
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,350
check their own filename they might
check the bidding process for example is

639
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,529
my pin process I E R Explorer

640
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:38,550
and if it is not the infield Ron are
they might check application settings

641
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:38,990
when

642
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:43,510
since in this case they were checking
for I extensions by then able to not

643
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,720
have been ordered able to sample does
not run

644
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,750
so they getting pretty clever because
they won't be made automation to a

645
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:50,409
certain extent

646
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:55,090
K I samples may be stale if you're
running about your sample the CNT

647
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:58,210
so I might be down in the sample mean of
Rhonda's check the network connection at

648
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,400
a connection did not succeed at Exit

649
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,430
doesn't mean that it is clean because
%um really not seen its

650
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:07,370
full behavior are had it connected to
the CNT

651
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:10,730
arm and then they are the Arsenal since
eight they might be

652
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:13,900
missing dependencies the keys of termite
required of a dollar to be installed on

653
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,740
the system

654
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:18,080
militia samples might require might be
targeting a specific part by the

655
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,160
application like Adobe

656
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,509
benefit is missing from your VM set up
then the sample with federal

657
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:26,950
K arm and then there are talented and
machine learning like imbalance in a

658
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,549
sense you have lots of good examples

659
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:32,510
very few bad bad examples on my sword
you cannot be just missing

660
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:36,360
and you might try to possibly had a
fight and it might be such

661
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,500
corrupted that you might be able to
collect all the features

662
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,850
are they might be enormous features
right now

663
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:47,890
in classic machine learning what happens
is ahead an almost features are usually

664
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:52,040
considered out lives and you know mater
below to delete will be the outlet

665
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,240
but in in our case up you have to think

666
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,290
you have to stop and think whether the
enormous value is a feature that you

667
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,590
want to take advantage of

668
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:03,880
and has been deliberately put n or is it
just matter of wrong data collection

669
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,220
large me you know section size for
example is a very common technique used

670
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,530
by malware to evade

671
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:12,200
it was injuring because I don't take too
long time to Lord that fide

672
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:16,750
are and past machine learning I without
rain domain expertise is going to say oh

673
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,890
that's out i did i do on a train on it

674
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:21,799
but as 10 minutes but he's gonna say
though that is interesting because that

675
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,240
never happens and clean

676
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,280
and I have I know that it happens in
malicious files because it is a classic

677
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,250
they were active listening to me

678
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:31,320
so we should use that as a future rather
than trying to prove either data

679
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,090
so you gonna combine both domain
expertise as up who've been trying to

680
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,780
build machine learning

681
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:41,160
on and here are some examples: on the
other talent is gonna be non-profit

682
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,000
website so

683
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,510
tax which are not a process by
themselves are

684
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:50,260
Inc movie courses data a malicious PDF I
is going to make it will be to behave

685
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,170
maliciously

686
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,930
so what are you really gonna Creed as
malicious and what are you really going

687
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,830
to me didn't want to go alone

688
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:01,100
so machine learning I'll you know as I
explained as is does not really apply to

689
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,150
NPD's

690
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:05,490
arm but there are ways in which you can
getting on the problem

691
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:08,890
late lots of examples of non-core files
which

692
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:13,040
are known to be malicious on up in court
an ex parte in them help

693
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,320
link via SMS I am espy's screensaver
star pledged

694
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,770
there's a long list of such fights

695
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,770
last example there P fires but they're
running in the context of a trusted

696
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:23,550
process

697
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:27,910
like mondale who are not solve so that
some thought militias but the deal that

698
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,259
advances militias

699
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,720
and but if you absolve the behavior of
Runyon 320

700
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,460
you not been on this much is actually
enhances militias you operate that

701
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,810
to the ba'ath that it loaded on the
command line not to the process itself

702
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:40,490
and

703
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:43,710
taken spawning immediate action again

704
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:47,070
so hard you are to meet these that's
probably one of the biggest challenges

705
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:50,270
and as these in population of non
process-based that that

706
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:53,650
come across all the time arm how do you
up

707
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:56,680
hall and reinforce the protection and
what

708
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,810
what is it that should be limited in
these cases all these have to be

709
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,860
decision that you have to artwork into
the solution

710
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,370
as you try to automate okay so in terms
of

711
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:09,900
conclusion arm what I would say is you
know be

712
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,140
in a big hurry madeline is not be
wandering at as possible 5

713
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:17,660
right so BC millions and millions of
files in a very short span of time

714
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,660
but be here really the median so the
tech families another one

715
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:24,420
warning that quick and automation is
probably one of the

716
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,220
solutions not the only solution one of
the many solutions and what you can do

717
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:27,830
with the

718
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:31,779
scale of the problem are but you have to
be aware of the pitfalls of automation

719
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:35,200
you have to realize what works and what
does not work and when it doesn't work

720
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,980
up you know you have to identify the
pack

721
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,330
I'll that the it might be deliberate

722
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:46,380
in the nature the problem that the
sample is failing in our pension okay

723
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,930
saw does because the samples of Ron
doesn't mean that

724
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:54,819
arm you give up are again example that I
did for example

725
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:58,780
where it is checking the payment process
being I and how many clean sample for

726
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,230
example I want to check that

727
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:03,380
right so if I can capture that behavior
are

728
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,480
as a future even though it does not run
I'll

729
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,410
that the presence of that featured some
might be very conclusive to the fact

730
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,470
that it is malicious

731
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:13,460
I don't know of any please offer that
trying to check for the it's been

732
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,550
processed I E N

733
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:17,570
and his running if it is not funny

734
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:21,320
games maybe I could think of are so the
challenge

735
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:25,270
really is you know water the matter is
about an application with the

736
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:29,080
the configuration file are and that is
all that is right I mean if you

737
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,500
getting mad images about application and
comes on with %uh

738
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,930
condition file which causes it to be a
maliciously arm

739
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:39,640
then we're really trying to train on
what are you trying to immediate

740
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,330
I have an example of up I mean I don't
know how many are familiar with GD

741
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,040
bought

742
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,529
a DD what was an MI sea-based bought are
and

743
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,640
8 drop minimize the application to the
convict fun

744
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,779
and the country if I was able to on the
neck be a match the application to

745
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,180
connect to chat room

746
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:00,890
and take this actions are so it's a it's
not manipulated its

747
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:04,750
check some exactly matches up the reason
I'm actually and it's a convict which is

748
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,980
really driving the malicious activity on
behalf of the

749
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,040
am I see other kitchen knife you want to
automate that you might conclude the

750
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,029
fact that

751
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:14,580
and IC applications militias up but

752
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:18,080
are if if you know if a signature up

753
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,520
analysts gets for love the fact that you
conclude this file is militias

754
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,630
they might issue a signature on the
missile they might issue an AB signature

755
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,730
on the basis of the

756
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:29,370
check some other five and that is a
mistake you wonder why because

757
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:32,330
it's on the Massey aperture that
militias because then you would really

758
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,860
such a signature and we're

759
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,300
by Paul am I see across all the users
machines

760
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,700
it's a combination of beer the UMass the
application was dropped

761
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,070
very well it running as are and and arm

762
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:47,260
you know it was a grueling confirmation
information from its own so for that

763
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:50,530
minute militia duty but was running from
Windows affordable me

764
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:54,890
I'll probably post a video that in the
speakers India

765
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:58,060
so those are the meanest his arm and arm

766
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:01,770
to conclude the fact that you know blow
machine learning is one of the ways in

767
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,130
which you can do with the scale

768
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:06,910
the problem you know you have to use
machine learning with the combination

769
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:09,770
domain expertise in order to make it a
very compelling solution

770
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:13,140
but nonetheless it's not the only
solution has to be augmented with

771
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:16,230
many other approaches in any

772
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:19,190
any questions and Ivan pretty fast
