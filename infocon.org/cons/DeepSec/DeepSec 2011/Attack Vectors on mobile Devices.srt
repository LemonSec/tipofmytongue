1
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:14,119
I I'm not sure can you hear me on the
microphone

2
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:15,610
or

3
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,490
let's just use my voice but he said if I
think it's not that way

4
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:24,240
way today going speak on attack vectors
on mobile devices

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,790
anthem court Rock Chalk

6
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:32,028
you quick fine

7
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:35,230
away

8
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,489
well

9
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:45,280
who all him

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,500
lol

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,670
computing consultant clear on the left
side

12
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,890
you applications basically you name it
and

13
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,150
we do it and you might now want to

14
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:04,610
why do you need more by security who

15
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,670
you needs mobile security key piece own
phone safe

16
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,770
okay this I was struck in the back there

17
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,970
the one with the body the reason is

18
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,900
this thing here today smartphones a
given

19
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,299
not owner technical employees but
everybody gets them

20
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,880
administrators secretaries Pokemon and

21
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,199
fun many let's take a look at people
that

22
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,049
you want to perception is that the phone
is safe

23
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:36,409
and this test two reasons first the fall

24
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:39,659
there have been no lauch outbreak so far

25
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,909
and secondarily the phone always in the
pocket

26
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:46,009
and what's in my pocket it must be safe

27
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:49,250
and this issue is complicated

28
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,289
because you cannot run anti-virus
software

29
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:56,090
on the phone why country run anti-virus
software

30
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,270
on the phone who had an idea

31
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:07,270
hoop crewmen intended for you have
another one up

32
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,860
good catch because the better so it's
not possible to protect the phone using

33
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,720
anti-virus software and the next problem

34
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,510
is that you just ask you pit it was the
shoot and virus it was called Kavya

35
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,010
each displayed total of the

36
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:29,269
mornings not one not to 30

37
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,510
but the users clicked next next next

38
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,399
next and there is a nice little sentence

39
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,460
you with us trough then think peaks over

40
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,810
security every already set

41
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,740
smartphone out soft car gets because the
program if they don't know anything

42
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,350
about mobile security

43
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,390
if you've been here today in the morning
it was the guy was speaking under

44
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,590
Windows Phone 7

45
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,240
if you look at what the OEM's have been
doing it's just crazy

46
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,540
and well we've got

47
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,829
the open operating systems more
smartphone

48
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,970
and finally smartphones

49
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,410
become more attack if as a techie
packets

50
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:16,200
tonight please first applied you can
photograph me by the way if you want

51
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,390
I am all your play clyde is this

52
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,720
first the fall smartphone today has a
very fast

53
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,320
processor so it means you can really do
some brute force could do quite a bit of

54
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:29,859
junk

55
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,800
with those not she peels secondarily
smartphone to connect seamlessly to the

56
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,440
PC

57
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,570
and finally they can not only

58
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:43,489
calling perry made numbers but they can
now order deduct money

59
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:47,480
night from Mike credit cat how can they
do it

60
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,720
anyone has an idea began a deer

61
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,200
how can it not for the tech mccade it
cut

62
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,260
get in a bit

63
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,299
for example and in

64
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:10,300
at purchases

65
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,140
US ready I focus on you and people who
ask this question

66
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:21,799
you finish all at them to shut up

67
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:25,460
well now you might say

68
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,479
I bought the phone from the CATIA for
the carrier

69
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,710
should keep it safe and to some extent I
also agree

70
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,159
that yep logical thinking but the
problem is this

71
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,770
the carrier cannot partake everything
because today smartphone

72
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,490
not only has an f2 achille but the also
has Bluetooth and wireless

73
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,760
and Bluetooth doesn't go over the cap
yet

74
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,039
and the moment carry it interferes with
the wifi transmitter of the smartphone

75
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,770
people like me from the test press stock
to wade

76
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,349
me Kenya so this essentially

77
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,810
the carious can't protect the
smartphones

78
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,090
before we get into any of the more

79
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:13,570
advanced technical attack sheen's I C
one person trying to flee already

80
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:17,000
I for the question what is the most
common

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,919
way how phones disappear the most common
way

82
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,270
this guy is heard me talk before

83
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:32,520
who knows who these people are

84
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:39,030
who knows who these people are

85
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,960
they are too funny clan

86
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,930
of India who what when the prints were
still only India

87
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:53,550
when the Brits rested only India

88
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,760
they essentially did with I'm doing to
you right now but they didn't give you

89
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,409
things

90
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,550
but they took things the way and in
British

91
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,080
English still today a thug is somebody

92
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,450
who don't want to meet for a drink and

93
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,080
said own they are stolen by

94
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,000
tool group by the teenage thugs
basically people like me but five years

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,710
younger

96
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,409
they steal them for personal usage and
for resale

97
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:27,030
and it's rampant issue in Western Europe
yesterday if you read the papers

98
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:31,090
in Austria there was a huge such scandal
and now

99
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,440
I am asking you why I'm gonna gonna show
you

100
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,690
why Kenya's left who are you

101
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,719
maybe who wants to be a victim for today
the victim gets chocolate

102
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,310
who want to be killed you want me think

103
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:53,830
you would nope

104
00:06:53,830 --> 00:07:00,830
here a plus for the victim please take
as much for uploading

105
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,599
okay summers up

106
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,909
dude

107
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:14,300
this guy here he owns this beautiful

108
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,780
Samsung smartphone i buy another one if
I think it from him

109
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,969
what does he do okay

110
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:25,610
if I would be able to steal it from him
he's so fast they can

111
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,870
but what would you do if you would have
to by an unexpected

112
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,250
by area and the carrier obviously

113
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,120
charges outrageous traded for the whole
thing

114
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:44,120
hey and

115
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:47,570
the manufacturer s they also left
because

116
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,690
left fuel that it's fourteen year old
teenager

117
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:55,450
who can't afford iPhone still use an
iPhone then he

118
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:59,460
by another iPhone and now there are two
iPhones on the market

119
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,860
so the Mac Chia of Apple raises

120
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,080
and so why should Apple beyond it's true

121
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:12,630
no need to laugh it's true why should
Apple

122
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,940
be unhappy their release

123
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,320
one-way to stop these kind of cell phone
thefts

124
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,719
and this way to deem a blacklist and

125
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,500
it works extraordinarily well for
example in the UK

126
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,009
but the problem is this the government's
don't want to enforce it

127
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:35,068
because if you want the government it
meets that you've got a problem with

128
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:35,929
petty theft

129
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:39,599
who would vote for government which can
control crime

130
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,709
with you what nobody all of us. not

131
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:46,980
and honest very good and then of course

132
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,390
there's although that targeted attacks
if the person wants

133
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,709
his phone he steals his phone

134
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:58,079
get out the memory card that is usually
uncooked

135
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:02,550
and with that

136
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,920
it's time for the first up to three
platforms we look at

137
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,540
who are you know the guy I'm standing at
the bottom there it's not me

138
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,579
hint

139
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:18,720
if it would be me the company with a bit
of who knows him

140
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,520
a very like less poor man was replaced
by Mark to chill but that's another

141
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,120
story

142
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,040
she William was the first operating
system to introduce

143
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,510
some kind of security eat use the
so-called

144
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,900
shoot-on-sight coach I'm coat sign in
sheet

145
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:40,000
this meant that binaries has to be
signed and if the binary wasn't signed

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,030
then the binary wasn't allowed to do
sensitive stuff like for example

147
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:48,640
caller a penny a minute number

148
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,370
event the system the students I'm system
was broken down to process

149
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,680
level why on the process level

150
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,060
the person who own who had the phone in
his hand

151
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,089
usually is the legal owner know what you
if you see at the phone

152
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:08,420
nowadays hopefully with somebody else
who used to share the phone with

153
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,680
somebody else

154
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,839
he left the following you for three
years effort of

155
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:22,839
you third food for and the plot thickens
the fleet

156
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:37,660
he's catching picnic still hasn't
improved up

157
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,720
and so declined with this that pros the
fifth

158
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,990
where divided into tears

159
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:50,949
and every here

160
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:55,620
and head different types of Felix

161
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,490
and it is that the capability is that
okay

162
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,839
which must be prevented to gain access
to pee village service

163
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,510
you might not be by going over to get in
such detail if the operating systems

164
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,220
date

165
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:14,600
I'm going over it not up boredom but
because these terms use the concept

166
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,770
you meet them every Adamo by platform

167
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:24,050
ethically got the capability there are
three types of capabilities

168
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,220
TCB capabilities then you're a system
capabilities

169
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,949
and bender I do the capabilities which
essentially a granted

170
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:36,459
like they are granted on a j2me
application

171
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:39,569
and another thing ease batting cage Inc

172
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:43,099
shoot 'em it protects some forward us

173
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,110
for excess by other applications so it's
basically

174
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,780
like sandbox which we have today but the
difference between the sent box shift

175
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,170
today and a student that box with this

176
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,170
that today you allowed to access one
folder

177
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:01,849
in the past you a lot excess or folders
except for one

178
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:06,569
and now there was a problem people like
me develop applications

179
00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:10,140
and I have to send every application to
comply it

180
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,560
to that finding house have to pay 200
euros

181
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,620
and have to wait week my productivity

182
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,579
well it would be very very lolol

183
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:25,050
and you to this it develop the
certificates with introduced

184
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:29,780
a developer certificates allows me to
say my company to modem unlimited

185
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:34,160
has these thousand phones 48,000 phones

186
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,579
I a monument limited act is a trust

187
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:40,720
provide and

188
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,620
this developer certificates they at easy
to obtain

189
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,779
what I need to do is I need to the
capital company

190
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:53,089
like UK Limited who knows how much it
costs to open UK Limited

191
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:57,560
numbers who say that now that you're

192
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,970
key highway I cannot eat with the
chocolate on the head

193
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,640
to pick it up later there is some left
but you want to come for pick it up

194
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,850
okay you know in the past

195
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:16,850
in the past IQ on the chocolates you a
fact that nobody wanted them anymore

196
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,860
okay this limited a very

197
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,220
very very easy to get and

198
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,510
I can't use with this site essentially I
can get these developers certificates

199
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,800
I open the limited the fact that Google
banana hammock

200
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,839
phone certification and levitation

201
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:41,890
company it's basically the ban on
athletes 64 in Timbuktu

202
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:45,490
the company's house doesn't care they
get the Texas see at the plot doesn't

203
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:45,950
get

204
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,649
they get their money and have a
developer certificate

205
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:54,890
and this is the process which is used
for a very very very dangerous trillion

206
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,230
call its people

207
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:00,029
I'm not going to explain house people
works I need a victim

208
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:02,570
you see the guy in the back she was
affected by speak more though he's

209
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:03,779
fleeing

210
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:06,950
how this people work

211
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,990
speed what is a relatively simple
trillion

212
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,459
who is my victim once again

213
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:16,690
you want to be beaten back there

214
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,730
oh my goodness okay no victims for today
you people aboard a parent well

215
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,740
the pot this I am attacker I

216
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,899
sheet you people to visit eps8

217
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:31,760
on this website I ask you the bank's
website

218
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,889
you must give me the team a number to
send

219
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:38,180
security update to your phone

220
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:43,120
I collect the scheme a when I've got
1000 email is

221
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,079
adequate develop a certificate it cost a
few cents so why waste the chance that

222
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,540
then I said these files to find files

223
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,209
back to you you install them

224
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:58,240
and them I 10 when a trillion

225
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,329
Encanto Inc it an SMS comes in

226
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:08,329
I can lead this MS and continue to serve
a these attacks are used to attack banks

227
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,660
and of course I've got some improvement
ideas

228
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,689
forward if the authors in the audience
after an improvement idea for them

229
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:20,120
the improvement idea is why not in the
future

230
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,410
create smaller undersigned application

231
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,589
make unscientific Asian collect the
e-mail

232
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:30,110
sent you a pic to show up and deploy
ultimate adapted

233
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:35,730
it with a few a bit effort to make it
simpler

234
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:40,200
and with that it's time for and right
which runs and the slogan

235
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,100
Android open but it's not the only open
for development

236
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,240
but it's also open for dangerous code

237
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,130
I don't know what you have ever dealt
with and right before

238
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,970
and right essentially huge Java Virtual
Machine

239
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:00,029
as you can see here and right the core
operating system

240
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:04,110
the current yep wrong

241
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,329
call and ok runs the bunch

242
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:10,519
applications if you want more
information and its sheen

243
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:13,610
ask me later

244
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:18,250
and the problem is this the applications
our written in Java

245
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:22,470
and jab at is very very easy to
decompile

246
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:26,010
and so if you look for some popular
application you find

247
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,069
fifty persons of the same application
but different vendors

248
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:34,209
which have been cloned by CPD combined
to Java call

249
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:37,269
adding some at Colt changing the string
the at

250
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:41,149
and re applauding the application to the
upside

251
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:45,010
and even if the Google Market bans me I
don't really care

252
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,420
because we're fifty thousand other
stores work given application away for

253
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,490
free

254
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,279
and and right also have the security
model

255
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,010
but the and allied security model
differs from the sudan security model

256
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,130
in that there is not some testing house

257
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:06,720
which is responsible for granting the
certificates

258
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,939
but rather that each and every user

259
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:13,939
himself the sites if you want to grant
permission

260
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:17,030
but not so basically every person

261
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,050
decide for he said for his own phone

262
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:24,138
it yes if you dont

263
00:17:24,139 --> 00:17:28,500
he

264
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,840
what to do

265
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,389
and attack shem for attacking an Android
phone

266
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:39,510
it is always always always the same
every

267
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,820
and buoyed by Rick photos this sheen get

268
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,178
onto the phone by social engineering
usually

269
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:49,750
or by masquerading as a negative
implication

270
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,000
and then that send not the command
master

271
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,880
or call it can make number

272
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,360
and there is one pretty funny example
it's called

273
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,940
delight called for the light cone thru

274
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,139
it uses the end like security model

275
00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:12,690
and how does he do it when an update
comes that's to begin for Microsoft

276
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,240
who have you recently received the Skype
update

277
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,370
for Android for Microsoft who've you got
the update recently

278
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:26,159
okay i think is this after you got the
update

279
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:29,270
you suddenly got at

280
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:32,790
Microsoft slipped dats onto your phone

281
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,918
do an update because most people they
just see the devil

282
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:40,270
12 updates unavailability and they click
get

283
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:44,240
all I and this is what you will but
alright confort

284
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,490
you get intentionally and outdated
application

285
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:51,800
which then self update itself and during
the update process

286
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:56,340
you don't get to see the aptitude the
uptick utilities

287
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,678
end when delight could force on the
phone

288
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,380
it's basically stock sending combat to
and Knoller is too funny think

289
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,620
delight calling for contains an exploit

290
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,560
rich on some phones gets it all types

291
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,360
but thats nothing with these route
rights

292
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,550
so this is probably an unfinished
feature which would see

293
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,560
very soon

294
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:29,560
next stop is Katia I'll who are you have
to do not have carry I'll

295
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,139
okay gonna stop out little example case
though

296
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:40,139
your victim please come fort and
applauded

297
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:48,260
let's assume chase those living in the
beautiful United States of America

298
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,580
in the United States of America the
government want to keep an eye on

299
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,658
Keystone

300
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:56,050
and Sunday put is not runs after me and
I

301
00:19:56,050 --> 00:20:01,360
hit him over the head with a beer bottle
and he called the emergency services

302
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,139
exchange my ki just me with the beach
walk hey

303
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:09,730
and then estevez activated which is
called

304
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:13,179
E 9 11 the government

305
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:17,530
the police who takes the call can
interact with his phone

306
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:21,158
to see where he is and kenya oo

307
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:27,330
originally was intended as a service for
the government to

308
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:32,668
but what up

309
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:35,710
it was PA

310
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:42,030
which was which was selected as one of
the top 15 mobile companies in 2008

311
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,639
the company's also called carry I'll it
lifts

312
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:49,230
on and a lot on blackberry on Nokia

313
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:52,810
on I always on every phone you have
those bastards

314
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:57,270
night from the carrier if the free gift
to you

315
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,960
and the public is this there software in
the pot

316
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,940
quite a lot in the pot whenever you open
the application

317
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,659
when you receive an SMS if the screen is
turned on and off

318
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:12,119
if the card is received where you are
and what made you play

319
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:15,720
so for example in my case they could no
miss the have-not

320
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,800
oath turn on the phone at night so this
means is Maddie it is not so good

321
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,260
and it means he has news on your he
listens

322
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,300
not to DJ shadow so this means

323
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,389
that his DS out already getting damaged

324
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:35,139
he all police chiefs Colless from
femaleness

325
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:38,879
who have gotten his company which means
that there are too many females in his

326
00:21:38,879 --> 00:21:41,619
company and he must be issued for equal

327
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:45,668
equal distribution of the jobs its
mandate and Austin law

328
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:52,040
and this not sound crazy who think I'm
telling you is crazy

329
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:59,040
she want to chop

330
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,910
this is not crazy at all

331
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:05,340
the doctor which my phone clicked on me

332
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,750
is cents by HTTPS to central portal

333
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,470
and every carried away everyone you get
accepted sport and

334
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:17,530
can see for every Indian be good person
so we can see that

335
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:20,550
I am using my phone 2 o'clock at night
often

336
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,840
and the point is this I cannot

337
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,980
up out on this think and

338
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,840
just in case anybody if you want this
why the cat is deployed

339
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,189
they say they need the program to

340
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:39,000
better analyzed and understand myself

341
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,700
so that they can often be better
products I've got one question

342
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,130
this stuff has been around for years why

343
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:53,100
in my list less happy with every for
that next up

344
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,200
we've got the only up

345
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,870
we've got the only religious sect
immobilized

346
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,890
that church of outcall

347
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:09,800
not now you know the profit result the
diet so now they're really on the way to

348
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,770
become a church

349
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:13,920
you know most churches only when there

350
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,940
when they're found the dice they become
really crazy

351
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:20,510
so now the jobs is dead the situation to
become a unified

352
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:27,510
another from think

353
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:40,380
3

354
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:47,380
wat

355
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,860
the mall freeway to to get information

356
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:55,139
from the church is to spend them if

357
00:23:55,139 --> 00:23:58,960
I 10 mm love the Apple church but I know
something about

358
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,070
Apple they would willingly give me head
they would everything

359
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:05,470
just to know it first and so it is very
very cheap

360
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:10,019
I just open the website with some silly
picture of an iPhone

361
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:13,259
and all the believers they click kik

362
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:16,759
click 6 Steve Jobs I play to you click
click

363
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:21,000
and they click they click of them and
they get the virus

364
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,120
they don't know the buyers that you
cannot security findings

365
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:29,299
because Steve Jobs the great got okay

366
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:33,620
there is another beautiful thing because
the golf of Apple

367
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:38,200
have decided that their minions out with
Philippe the iPhone if you buy it

368
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,250
you ain't it you can't run every
happened and soul

369
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,639
there %uh jailbreaks will be used to
that site

370
00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:48,970
ended unlocks you were foale

371
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:52,250
and you a website can get who Texas

372
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,259
then also in either that tight can do so

373
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:58,299
and now my idea worth I opened a website

374
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:01,509
www thought free Google Thomas

375
00:25:01,509 --> 00:25:06,029
dot com for the for the non females in
the room lou but Arthur expended shoes

376
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:13,029
every female dreams amid in the back one
candy for breaky dreams I'm so sorry

377
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,000
and on Fleetwood times dot com

378
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,470
you click their and get exploit it all
the work with me

379
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:24,669
but with me much easier fully it blue
dot com

380
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:29,059
in a bit

381
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:32,970
okay whether

382
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:36,649
whatever you say I don't know this but
there's something better to talk before

383
00:25:36,649 --> 00:25:37,070
and

384
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:41,269
okay the next is

385
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:44,760
if you exploits which a typical to
Germany

386
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,408
Germany's a strong area for the trucks
iPhone

387
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:53,019
and so many attackers focused on the low
end with the believers up

388
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:56,379
and the wreath is think it is called

389
00:25:56,379 --> 00:25:59,940
Henan very little is known about lenin

390
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,960
except this that it Hess popped up

391
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,409
on you with us accounts shot them eighty
your host

392
00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:12,019
and that was it and they said we didn't
even downloaded many did you have an

393
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:12,620
iPhone

394
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:16,990
so this is a relatively strange nobody
knows anything about

395
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:22,210
n and everybody is that there are two
ways

396
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:25,549
either it can be socially engineered to
get the password

397
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:29,860
or can be exploiting I US but

398
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,950
me not being paid I decided

399
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:37,240
to do some research on my own and the
first thing I D

400
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,360
what I featured this the Fiji

401
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,809
to German newspaper it is not
particularly reliable

402
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:49,080
but on text the out one magnitude better

403
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:54,029
the New York Times and so I quiet said
when can leave them to some extent

404
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:57,799
and they gave us some good information
first of all

405
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:01,200
that non I US onus get attacked also

406
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,809
so this tells it could be fishing and
secondarily

407
00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:11,240
they gave us this Street no

408
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,590
this thing faith what does this string
say

409
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:21,510
it's an easy peasy truck the Chinese who
have you know the face

410
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:25,049
it's the name of the app and the name of
the app is

411
00:27:25,049 --> 00:27:28,460
the world difficult times it itself

412
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:32,279
and a Google that

413
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:35,649
and I saw this company kollek

414
00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:39,090
n is peddling the application

415
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,570
and the manufacture the string

416
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:46,149
was only even partly by this pm but it's
all

417
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:50,840
baby client young 1g and this when I
google it

418
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,429
it brings me to this tour fell I thank
him an email

419
00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:59,110
asking him my dear friend could you tell
me more

420
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:03,110
and

421
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:07,860
he thought this guy is shot glass which
means as much as

422
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,889
at fucking it yet the only road into a
Chinese

423
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:14,639
he has nothing to do with it

424
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:18,250
probably it similar to what their my way
up

425
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,510
some time ago which contained string me
call

426
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:26,389
capped you here who what he knows what
he's mean Inc

427
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:32,190
the first one who gives me the reason
get the chocolate he was meeting a

428
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:35,809
security expert from if secures got long
here it is you

429
00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:39,840
kept his here basically like I'll should
cut the eventually but it's so much work

430
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,379
it takes so much time

431
00:28:41,379 --> 00:28:45,019
so I can understand nikol fully

432
00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:48,169
but didn't next sterling then

433
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:53,450
was much more interesting kaelin is the
huge Chinese company

434
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,109
day said to be the Chinese Facebook

435
00:28:57,109 --> 00:29:01,220
and did he really funny thing was this

436
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:08,220
that

437
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,809
onon but calm

438
00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:17,299
and so what do we know inin

439
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:20,769
operate its internet website that's
another stock

440
00:29:20,769 --> 00:29:23,919
announcement they sitting on although

441
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,389
one be leon dollas in cash and Dave Cote
CEO

442
00:29:28,389 --> 00:29:31,490
Dept so this is not like some American
company

443
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:37,010
which is worth 10 billion butthead 15
beyond of Dept

444
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:42,419
these people actually have money

445
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:45,679
and so I decided I'm gonna get in touch
with them

446
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,990
I sent an email to their press
department

447
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:52,730
I all the press ID so I thought let's
send an email to them

448
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:55,779
and ice ask them just friendly

449
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:59,980

00:30:03,389 --> 00:30:06,549
is a third party product

452
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:09,658
their response came very very fast

453
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:13,210
ed he he chief Investor Relations

454
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:17,399
for the Norman peaceful question and now
comes the

455
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:20,840
unusually think there was no extra info

456
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,409
and instead she wanted to know more from
me who are you with basic understanding

457
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:28,010
of Pia

458
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:31,049
okay nobody was talking anymore real
dollar federally

459
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:34,629

460
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:38,109
ask you something short you just and
these question

461
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:42,090

think back every day in the morning

463

464
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:52,879
he might get angry him I think he
doesn't know me what an asshole

465
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:57,240
I must write bad about his company so
this was really really

466
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,379
strange but mebbe me

467
00:31:00,379 --> 00:31:05,289
I sent them another friend email I told

469
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:11,580
but has made quite the splash Germany
recently

470
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,580
due to creative use of at purchase

471
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:19,428
I didn't mention anywhere that criminal
anything

472
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:22,820
and the effect was I did never ever hear
from them again

473
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,850
the first email took them 8 hours to
answer

474
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:29,490
this one is now 96 hours with them

475
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,500
more than ninety six hours I never heard
back from them

476
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:36,029
I am NOT a lawyer so I cannot say with
this means

477
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:39,159
but I know if something smells like fish

478
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:45,389
and I really smelly fish

479
00:31:45,389 --> 00:31:49,330
if anyone give you a explanations please
come up to me afterwards

480
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:54,080

481
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,230
minutes

482
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:59,039
that brings us to the walk scam

483
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,109
today especially with Nokia people

484
00:32:02,109 --> 00:32:05,659

490
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:39,440
on the cell phone that browsers opened

okay if I click on this

499
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:16,029

500
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:19,539
opens walk URL and when they walk

501
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,908
URL strength open you get the so-called

502
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:26,099
M s ISDN number and this

503
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:29,510
n its ISBN number is worth gold because

504
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:35,408
I have your MS ISBN number I can try out
your money by a you can't buy you carry

505
00:33:35,409 --> 00:33:35,859
a

506
00:33:35,859 --> 00:33:40,099
and I get the money deducted of your
phone bill

507
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:43,520
and this brings us a pretty complex

508
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,158
economy off cuz I'm on the top

509
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:50,289
we have the scammer this camera

510
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:53,700
pay at how two runs in at

511
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:57,339
and in addition complex the Kenya

512
00:33:57,339 --> 00:34:01,980
to get the right to be from in this ISDN

513
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,619
that how both then

514
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:09,210
get you contact the developer who shoals

515
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,690
the and shove the add hosting his ap

516
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:16,639
the user you with the tap of the active
in Upper

517
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,069
who get ad from the ad how clips

518
00:34:20,069 --> 00:34:24,699
on the at that Ceglia charges the money
and the scammer gets paid

519
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,830
so we've got the total of five parties
involved

520
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:32,060
and only one of them acting community

521
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:36,609
all good

522
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:43,609
power up

523
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,739
and every already said you with the
click yeah

524
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,010
what request sent the MSI interpreted

525
00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:00,569
at the carrier charges and this is where
the client gets here only

526
00:35:00,569 --> 00:35:04,130
because the carrier had pic to pay

527
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:07,690
the MIS ISDN charge within less

528
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:12,560
than 24 hours so by the time you get the
bid

529
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,770
and you complain if I'm the scammer

530
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:19,640
I'm releasing a panel with six females
so I am

531
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,960
long disappeared they're probably top me
to death

532
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,810
anyways but it's different story well

533
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:29,819
with that we're almost done it's time to
look at

534
00:35:29,819 --> 00:35:32,900
that stop who are working in

535
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:37,339
mobile first the law most mobile program
s

536
00:35:37,339 --> 00:35:40,609
still not completely I'm aware

537
00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:43,740
of security their is no

538
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,760
he could change and this means there is
a huge

539
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,869
amount of and found exploitable

540
00:35:49,869 --> 00:35:53,520
analyst in operating systems currently

541
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,520
any for this was the HTC Bluetooth FTP

542
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,270
it was cava thinking some detail a day
to day in the morning by the Windows

543
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,460
Phone 7 guy

544
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,839
in case it worth HTC Bluetooth FTP

545
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:10,190
is the bonus gift to snap some users

546
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:13,510
which is given out from HTC and

547
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:17,290
allow you to accept five hits in out
books folder

548
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:21,580
of the phone and awaited men that client

549
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,640
he sees I am in the outbox folder

550
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,830
I'm not allowed to go up anymore and
even a client

551
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,990
sense the dot dot com in the root folder

552
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:35,950
and then you can access slash Windows
and the moment you can access

553
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:39,330
slash Windows on the classic Windows
Mobile device

554
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:45,150
the device is down

555
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:48,279
but why HTC Bluetooth FTP

556
00:36:48,279 --> 00:36:51,400
didn't become too much of a problem
what's this

557
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,200
that Bluetooth FTP the quietest pair Inc

558
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,430
and if I would today pay with anyone
with you

559
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:02,310
would you accept appeared process Noel

560
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:06,819
the average user wouldn't you understand
what it means to pare

561
00:37:06,819 --> 00:37:11,220
so the practica risk with relatively low

562
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,380
emmitt we've got another benefit

563
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:18,460
the attackers if there is anyone any
attack India please don't beat me up

564
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,490
after talk

565
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:23,740
attacked us currently am NOT
particularly smart

566
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:27,839
every more by computing Pokemon 1088

567
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:32,390
cutting-edge mobile via today I develop
mobile applications

568
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:35,680
for to make money with them for filling
and I

569
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,109
could replicate any of the attack of
that

570
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:42,290
enjoyed by its credit and market with
ease

571
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:46,390
if my pupil with training could
replicate most of them with ease

572
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:49,740
so we are not seeing any kind of the
Iliad once my via

573
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:54,240
just yet but attackers asocial is not

574
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,970
because they need to get the people to
accept installation request

575
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:03,369
and secondarily the attackers I

576
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:06,750
giddy there and all viruses like the
famous

577
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:09,940
then took which brought to the nice
pictures day

578
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:13,529
beautifully rendered graphics and there
are no viruses like

579
00:38:13,529 --> 00:38:16,940
I love you which I've been getting warm
and which only

580
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,160
causes havoc the attack today

581
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:25,410
I agree D and David will know what
technical development

582
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:29,990
unless it is needed to make money and as
they currently can make good money with

583
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:31,260
social engineering

584
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:36,130
why should they do more effort

585
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:40,000
and finally I've got a spring of new
ideas

586
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,390
for all those are you who are looking
for new ways 228

587
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:46,790
better more by the virus the last time
when I head

588
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:50,460
such that the flight with confidence
2010

589
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,630
and I told the people how to bypass the

590
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,779
they the quality assurance for iPhone

591
00:38:56,779 --> 00:39:01,380
Android and all the stores two months
later

592
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,549
the first attacks researcher facing
using my

593
00:39:04,549 --> 00:39:08,400
next to a so if anybody have you
developed by love them I want my money

594
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,799
and they wanted now people

595
00:39:12,799 --> 00:39:15,869
the first idea which I suggest is

596
00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:20,670
mobilized then somewhere on a day-to-day
Therese products like flexes

597
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:24,099
by I snowflakes to spy on my wife's
phone

598
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:28,690
and then I can lead to SMS is your phone
call and if she keeps calling

599
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,760
the National feed the National male

600
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:36,210
cardioid event service with free
secretaries medical diseases

601
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:40,410
waited then I better get my freak on
with you this from my left

602
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,810
and I suggest in the future

603
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:46,869
doctor theft which attacks the kit kat
number

604
00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:50,980
it seems to think that if that a on the
phone to tend to identity theft

605
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,109
at the funny things

606
00:39:54,109 --> 00:39:57,930
the next thing is there a pond exploits
still open like wrote today in the

607
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:58,819
morning

608
00:39:58,819 --> 00:40:02,950
the question is who finds one first

609
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:06,660
and then this is something which I
personally

610
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,220
expect to see after talking about this
definitely

611
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:13,790
it attack which bridges from

612
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:17,410
the foam to the PC

613
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:21,000
in the past the peace the PC in the
phone the student

614
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,170
HotSync ActiveSync into on today it

615
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:28,069
even yet because this phone can act as a
USB to

616
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:31,480
life and I could make to my PC

617
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,350
the all to start making his move Windows
stops deprecation which

618
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:39,230
up certification so all I would have to
do is hit by a bus

619
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:42,369
East I would have to place in all to
start application

620
00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:47,640
in tonight for that and profit

621
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:51,350
and finally another very very funny
thing I want to suggest

622
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:54,950
is the mobile scam essential you sent
the person

623
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:58,779
one or the other kind of email and he
then

624
00:40:58,779 --> 00:41:03,440
response and you get a scam him off or
are you sending an SMS

625
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,869
he called he responds to Penn you might
numbers is to pay

626
00:41:06,869 --> 00:41:10,130
there are 50,000 possibilities for that
and I predict lot

627
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:14,109
of new think this will come up to us as
well

628
00:41:14,109 --> 00:41:17,420
and with that I'm very thankful to all
of you
