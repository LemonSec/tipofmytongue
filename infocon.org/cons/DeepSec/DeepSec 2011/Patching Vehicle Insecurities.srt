1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,309
what the store this too

2
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:14,130
let's see if veto

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,700
this is a

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,320
cars for for all those who are not aware
of these

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,610
videos can find it on you its

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,040
I think there

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,930
nightlies 3 inventive ways to break into
cars

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:34,930
its

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:44,500
just a minute I played with PNC

10
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:05,250
think it's it looks better so

11
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,140
the whole idea is that the physical
layer with the car can

12
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:17,140
easy be breached and what will happen
next

13
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,670
some recount

14
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:31,670
and in you go

15
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:38,199
a 10-day just pop it in

16
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:45,200
there you go

17
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:54,340
his petition YouTube for about two or
three years

18
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,600
this runaway national

19
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:31,910
and the last one

20
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,600
which

21
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,310
so

22
00:02:54,310 --> 00:03:01,310
home

23
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,920
this happened this is what happens in
the physical a

24
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,840
so one may scratch your car break the
window enter a car

25
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,570
as we've seen and st. the partial would
fire in your car or

26
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,380
damaged in any way the big question is

27
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,440
how can she still the whole cock if he
hasn't day

28
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,440
tow truck the at the obvious answer is

29
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,550
by starting the engine so what does

30
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,590
stop someone from starting the engine

31
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:37,420
must view all assay

32
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,820
the key let's try to see what happens

33
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,320
inside saw to iraq dinar this stalker
status

34
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,930
will first talk about the automotive
technology

35
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,260
the woohoo compare vehicle and computers

36
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,829
we will talk about the network inside a
vehicle

37
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,120
and talk about the main security

38
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,890
aspecto the car which is its immobilizer

39
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,990
then we will talk about someone and
abilities

40
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,210
like this runs and some

41
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,580
problems that they mobilize and
technology helps has

42
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,190
some richer some back research that has
been done

43
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,298
from several researchers and some

44
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:25,010
concerns then we would talk about and
what we can do in order to but some of

45
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:25,630
these things

46
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,700
so on a money

47
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,650
automotive industry has four main axes
Avengers

48
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,930
the body of the car powertrain

49
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,630
the safety when we're talking about the
safety we're talking about passengers

50
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:46,219
mostly and four is that in car
communication and

51
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,990
cart car communication things like that
this

52
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,970
even has to do with me committee into
the Matix there's

53
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,050
then escalated activism Thames a system
approach

54
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:01,720
towards automotive control systems it
has to do a lot of with

55
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,440
performance safety function and have the
car

56
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,620
and the network and even

57
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,290
distributed embedded systems that are
inside the car

58
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,580
the big truth is that the

59
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,940
current vehicles are turning more and
more

60
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,800
into computers and we don't see this
trend

61
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,160
two or so there technology in the base

62
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,970
saw the

63
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,710
what we want to see in dating vehicles

64
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:41,190
is there information she's and 40 from
the eyes

65
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:46,050
from for the attack or the defense there
are multiple network issues

66
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,370
drunken don't modules and there are

67
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:54,330
and information networks inside the car
there are some time to get products that

68
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,280
are being used

69
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,630
and there are some are on network
protocols

70
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,909
like can mean most that are

71
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:06,479
inside the car there are numbers
electronics

72
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,870
very complex

73
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,840
next sensors and actuators that they
give us

74
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,060
measurements about the car of yours

75
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,950
and to things like that and there's the
immobilizer

76
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,070
you need that its Korea's

77
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:27,440
RFID technology and will have the
real-time diagnostics port

78
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,090
that too can get can program the car

79
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,550
for many things and am

80
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,210
moreover vendors are trying to post

81
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,720
green technology and the so-called green
$2 K

82
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,870
green technology and put the car on the
clout

83
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:49,200
it's a the new high saw

84
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,580
let's compare vehicles in computers so

85
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,639
the visual from first part and its

86
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,639
parties it's hard its I hard

87
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:06,460
part is designed to perform a specific
task and I'll have her

88
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,210
CPU memory a power supply

89
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:13,919
manifold from the battery which is
charts

90
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,419
from bedrooms things like that other
times

91
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:19,460
we have a

92
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,930
who use it in order to control the
briefer so

93
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,380
but for us and a will have several
communication

94
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,409
protocols and sometimes to

95
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,889
talk to the

96
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:35,180
electronic control models what we're
trying to do is say

97
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,190
to maintain the visual stability

98
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:43,090
to and have a good performance

99
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,280
the vehicle and to keep passengers say

100
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,960
what were your days the wanted to a
result

101
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,720
mainly to control the mechanic part

102
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,160
visoko and

103
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,639
to make a gluten network black platform

104
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:04,930
we'll talk about it later and a

105
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,930
afterwards and making it more
computerized

106
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:14,550
so let's the computer is consistent
motherboard CPU memory

107
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,120
some media some storage devices and its
operating system

108
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,700
both cases will help

109
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,660
logic circlet air physical
implementation

110
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,730
overall this arts and which are

111
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,900
interconnected between them and a it's a

112
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,720
artists and performers Pacific sort of
dust

113
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,650
and the tasks are are described through
ever seen

114
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,010
language program even if its assembly or
anything like that

115
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:48,370
and their main differences he said
between the complexity of the task

116
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,820
they are performing and inning their
design

117
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,760
will have to

118
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,760
make another big difference between
computer parts and

119
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,160
or vehicle parts because

120
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,380
vehicle parts I'll heavy-duty

121
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,480
will take it on the road and lot of
bombs

122
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,490
and you make russia legal your car

123
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,260
things like that solar parts have to be
have you the rain and

124
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,030
not pleased so

125
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:28,760
its move to the network layer of the car

126
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,110
saw in most cases we can refer Ridge

127
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,850
in OC tasaday local area network and
will have

128
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:41,480
bone to bone wearing a centralized
networks and which are being

129
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,250
and replaced forcibly with distributed
networks

130
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,920
and a I'll have some serial protocols
for

131
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,430
reduced visual muscle wearing there's
even now

132
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:58,250
optical fiber inside the car in order to
have

133
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,490
had fun with

134
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,450
publications stored in the car mostly
about community media

135
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,560
telematics and do not have internet here

136
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,480
axis in the car because everything is
secure so wanted to put it on the

137
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:13,930
internet

138
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,600
and moreover there are awareness
application Broadcom's

139
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,750
name in order to talk works too

140
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,980
wirelessly to the car there are four
main justification

141
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:30,920
for its basses have class a Class B and
Class C networks

142
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,250
and another class for the missions and
diagnostics

143
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:40,160
home briefly

144
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,300
the most important communication
protocols

145
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,460
that are are embedded in the cars will
have lean

146
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:51,510
can didi Conn most or TB and things like
that

147
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,290
so mean

148
00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:00,969
local interconnect network psyche

149
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:05,230
IEEE 1394 can

150
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,520
will talk specifically about it and

151
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,300
t2 can and most what's com

152
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,510
in all of them even in only be to

153
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,780
on FlexRay is that day they perform

154
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,420
on their first three later or see this
means that

155
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,140
would have we don't have for example

156
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,689
complete and in the NFC of

157
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,800
can we don't have it any think about

158
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,490
security three live first names foresee

159
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,970
doesn't not to offer complete

160
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,420
security to our obligations

161
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,959
and especially about can we will talk

162
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,990
and see some pillaged can be hacked

163
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,030
so what is a mobilized them a blazer is

164
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:00,310
the main on defense mechanism is
installed in our cars

165
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,570
it said day we could say the only

166
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:08,200
authentication would have in Dakar will
have a key

167
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,380
that it has a most cases RFID installed

168
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,600
and a we take the ski

169
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,900
put it on the locker on no content if we
have

170
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,130
the right combination of the law

171
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,210
and the air RFID J

172
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,390
then we issues and

173
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,900
electronic pop and the engine goes

174
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:38,900
saw in most cases would have RFID East

175
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,890
with fixed or on court systems or
combine drones

176
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,680
should say that the past who had on
fixed goals

177
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,700
this means that we could do it have
replay attacks

178
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,970
the case so you could

179
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,040
record day radio frequency

180
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,699
and stock their dnt and

181
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,920
and I will see you can have a does

182
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,440
actions and moreover they see the

183
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,180
in most cases the use some symmetrical
algorithms

184
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,270
many of them are not known and one they
are disclosed

185
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:23,770
we can see that they have a lot of
problems so

186
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:28,560
later encryption capabilities are very
low

187
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,850
saw

188
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,980
for cyberattacks

189
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,839
the first time I've attack is breaking
the man

190
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,290
on the car you can hard wire it will
have seen it

191
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:47,250
you know the movies summoning bricks
breaking some more

192
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,450
down steering way and connect some Jay
Bruce

193
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:54,250
and the engines on and she goes if she
goes with cock

194
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,360
course they're

195
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,600
day tools that are being used or

196
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,670
pretend likes that Hamas speaker wires

197
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:07,060
and Slim Jim tool in order to

198
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:14,050
open the door something kleczka we see
that too

199
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,100
even at all technologies evolving

200
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,420
and we'll see that to the attacks are
also holding

201
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,320
the cost and if their computerized there
may be automated

202
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,960
what's the problem with immobilizer

203
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:36,870
and you knew it was indicated to your
car

204
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,339
is through your idea shed or and the key

205
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:43,480
the first problem is that

206
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,570
holds the key and what can you do for
you with your tea

207
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:52,070
you have your car and it's like a
computer

208
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,750
your computer you have a user users
group

209
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,110
and you have specific tasks that each
user can do

210
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:02,430
if you're lucky you can do everything
you want to the car

211
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,600
even if you are mechanic

212
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,209
if you wanted driver if you have a
rent-a-car

213
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:12,830
or whatever you ok you can have

214
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,880
full access to the cop that so many
problems

215
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:21,550
moreover there are there's no way to
identify the driver

216
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:27,770
through the RFID and

217
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:31,329
something that is very critical here

218
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,709
but security of power

219
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:38,459
is that day it doesn't have support
usually day i dnt

220
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:44,320
identification so

221
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,380
just a minute and there was a there's a
project

222
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,760
RFID xoxo what's

223
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,380
days making RFID tags dead

224
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,620
what if I A Center

225
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,000
what if I used the RFID supper on the
keys

226
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,520
imagine that I couldn't stop

227
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,090
hold police departments keys or

228
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:12,350
the ambulances and things like that
pretending

229
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16,520
that I'm somebody who has direct access
nobody can use the cars

230
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,490
sold have to say that

231
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:23,530
using RFID today is at least dangers

232
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:28,540
from mom

233
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,600
the Homeland Security newswire who have
that

234
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,720
the the proposed the usual biasing

235
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,030
128 beats and recently

236
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:43,520
a person known has identified some

237
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,810
has identified many vulnerabilities in
engine immobilizer

238
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:52,500
and they used appropriate arian group in

239
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,890
I'm going to mean under to trust me the
keys between

240
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,540
and the receiver in Detroit doing
transmitter

241
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,940
and a you could hack it in man few
seconds

242
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,489
and you can find it

243
00:17:06,489 --> 00:17:09,249
moroh data about shoe store

244
00:17:09,249 --> 00:17:16,249
the link is right there there's another

245
00:17:16,379 --> 00:17:20,869
attack from cryptographic for the
cryptographic hospital it

246
00:17:20,868 --> 00:17:25,168
about the keylock ongoing it was
supposed to be a very good on both my

247
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:25,749
own

248
00:17:25,749 --> 00:17:29,710
perform 100 nopes and it had a

249
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,720
64 bit key and it was used in order

250
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,389
to send a not pix TV by the Rolling

251
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:41,799
G to the car in order to identify
yourself

252
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:44,869
it was broken again at 20

253
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:51,869
to to 2008 sorry he looks finger use the
game many industries

254
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:58,649
had a slap

255
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:04,399
sorta

256
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:10,529
what other researchers have said and
there's

257
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:13,989
this is at the center of automotive
embedded system

258
00:18:13,989 --> 00:18:17,559
system security cast has a mayday

259
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:22,749
very good reasons about cars and what
the D-day

260
00:18:22,749 --> 00:18:26,019
in their first working was to evaluate
modern automobiles

261
00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:31,220
and a talk about how frightening how and
security are

262
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:35,330
their day most

263
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:38,359
the infiltrated necu

264
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:41,549
they manage to never at the ability to

265
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:46,149
complete discovered the bread a grave
safety critical system of the cock

266
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:50,190
and control arms wide range over too
many factions

267
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,210
and

268
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,850
make a card to ignore driver's actions

269
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,500
the head

270
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,360
several possible to do those stop and

271
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,300
what the

272
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:11,500
what was it their main course duration:

273
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,240
can adversely adversary with missus
Madhu

274
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,570
modified disrupt systems in

275
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,580
commercial have any below the mob's of
course

276
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,960
there there are some ways yes the
tragedies

277
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,110
to 3 to see it through the ASM hatcher
and

278
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,420
there try to find power

279
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,720
in order to communicate directly with a
cock

280
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,130
this could be done your physical access

281
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,780
lagging some devices

282
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,260
on the OLE DB port in order to program
it

283
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,850
and a using their wireless interfaces
that

284
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:55,340
are used by the cars nowadays want to
manage to do to do

285
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,149
was what they

286
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,600
and for those use was passing SNY

287
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,630
seeing trying to see the cold because in
all this case the cold is closed

288
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,780
don't have access to

289
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,950
the operating systems the vendors on

290
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,900
I'm not giving any anything away and
they tried to

291
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:25,740
connect to the can and day artist many
things

292
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,220
saw some other make conclusions

293
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:34,280
is that can hold

294
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,910
knowledge behind can has many on their
abilities

295
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:42,060
especially against DoS attacks you can

296
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,399
stop many package from

297
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,470
from receiving interest rate between

298
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:54,470
the device on the car moreover there's
no indication feeds

299
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:57,850
as I said can

300
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,540
has an its RC doesn't have any

301
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,030
security measures and awesome

302
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:12,030
commendation moreover everyone E

303
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:18,030
most cases can gave me easy access to
the sea you

304
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:25,030
the main processing unit of the car and
they have a

305
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:29,700
they had a second resource which there
isn't a new remote exploitation

306
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,320
on stuff and AM using day

307
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,560
wireless communications for example DBS
DVRs

308
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,040
they manage to extract

309
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,560
data from cars or even

310
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,129
send air 3 just the car for example
unlock the doors

311
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:56,130
so his work and does not reflect their
specific classes of threats

312
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,540
but in the entire platform named
automobile well-conceived up

313
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,379
the car has

314
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:14,560
very why range attacks that can be

315
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:21,300
made against it well the main aim

316
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,200
aspect is that vendors tendency

317
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,360
towards putting services double the cost

318
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,910
services that are not

319
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:36,540
law implemented on a secure platform
this means that

320
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:40,190
will have the hype to boot day car on
the cloud

321
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:45,260
to put web services in the cloud and
regardless of what is happening

322
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:49,629
down on the core saw

323
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,720
and moreover they you can gain access

324
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,030
using the OBD port and

325
00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:01,399
to the car and make a

326
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,480
Direct Taxes director commands to thank
you

327
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:11,570
to the car there are several attacks
that can be made

328
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:15,290
using blood there was talk or yesterday
if I can remember

329
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,670
bop Lute Olson bring devices think

330
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,820
a cost nowadays new cars

331
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:26,159
is are having Bluetooth devices

332
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,280
sold sensors just any sending

333
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,918
brush the tires

334
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:36,559
to ECU in order to

335
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:41,500
triggering black-tie event and it is
easy to

336
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,070
bear 50

337
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:47,409
tire cop said you have a black flat tire

338
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:51,180
and make the car the car or the driver
saw

339
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,230
it see its quite easy

340
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:59,050
as they've sold in order to make a
keyless entry gain

341
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:04,100
their attack the use they didn't
disclose the

342
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,890
the vendor they managed to to use the
GPS location

343
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:13,270
and a to be racially cation and the DBSA

344
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:17,300
in a stolen phone most of the common
isn't

345
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,440
now saying that you can install a tablet
or

346
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,910
use the phone on your cock so you have
an access point

347
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:27,150
and day using the full

348
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,320
or the tablet you can issue a trigger
event

349
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,439
saying open the door moreover they

350
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,630
they were able to wiping

351
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:42,730
to Bernard heidi's and to use their wifi

352
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:47,840
the car get the occasional the car and a

353
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,350
make a server attacks using their short
range communications

354
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:59,350
so

355
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,980
the result of the there is a source

356
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,730
that you can steal a car you may

357
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:10,030
so it puts surveillance the car

358
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:14,639
and a compromise the drive you can issue
you could issue

359
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,960
break event and a

360
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,210
hard to the car remotely because you had

361
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:28,210
full access to the cop saw

362
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:31,690
and the light of these research

363
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:35,290
the US Department of Transportation of
Transportation

364
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:39,240
issued a warning

365
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,690
next quest for information

366
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,549
more officially saying that took

367
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:49,509
Carson being we we

368
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:52,999
believe that will be the next back black
for the copters

369
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:56,089
and discourse this summer

370
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:59,279
and we have to find ways in order today

371
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,899
to defeat those attacks we may do we
need to make cooking

372
00:26:03,899 --> 00:26:07,779
cars Maureen I'm on and more safe

373
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:12,869
he got into the electronic system one of
the

374
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:16,119
praised

375
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:19,149
uses that the problems no and still is

376
00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:24,609
there's no interest orders are one of
the main

377
00:26:24,609 --> 00:26:30,760
to placing automotive industry got into
electronics

378
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,080
has issued an article issue

379
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,580
and it's pointing out the problems

380
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,850
and about ECU and how can

381
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:48,659
on can reach issue quite easily and a

382
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:51,929
what they're pointing out is that
immobilizer

383
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:55,159
isn't quite safe we thought it was

384
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:58,820
McAfee

385
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,860
again on some this year

386
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,899
has issued a white paper on

387
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:08,730
the possible dangers with

388
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:14,460
cost that can be is the bold so what do
we propose

389
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,500
what we need to

390
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,570
dues currently redefining redefined
immobilizer system

391
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:26,110
we think that

392
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:29,360
with current too many changes that can
be

393
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,680
easily applied market current age and

394
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,970
what we're trying to do is say creative
where more safe environment

395
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:40,230
for the object of much use of the car

396
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,410
and the visuals Jim

397
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:46,450
will have to creating new

398
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:50,780
except Internet policy towards almost or
prefer

399
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,290
margins but can be installed and visoko

400
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:59,530
what we mean is that most of the devices
that can be installed

401
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:02,830
on the car back in play so in many cases

402
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:05,960
one might and in the car install a new
device

403
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,430
and a go there is a

404
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:14,090
an attack that can be made through an
mp3 player

405
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:17,280
year for example there was

406
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,340
an attack that one could create minuses
mp3

407
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:24,900
plan play john Dunn player in game

408
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,640
full access to a see you so what we're
trying to say is that

409
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,960
you shouldn't allow so easily for
someone

410
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,420
to install devices on your couch yes
it's easy

411
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,910
and can be it should be easy for the
mechanics

412
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,990
bad did if someone can do it in five
minutes

413
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:48,000
without any indication commander Solomon
decision palatable

414
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,020
device cited and

415
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,770
to your own attack engaged so

416
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:58,879
we ordered rather

417
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,600
international policy towards the parts
and make him

418
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,410
or authenticate to worse car

419
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,970
vehicle generally in order to gain
access

420
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:13,430
we should enable users and groups to the
cops

421
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,910
in order to make eats user

422
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:23,910
the cow have different privileges on the
car

423
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:36,320
me

424
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:41,750
let's say anything this over

425
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:45,730
I am the owner vicap OJ

426
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:49,100
have a key orgy a

427
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,179
should AB able to install everything
that I want

428
00:29:52,179 --> 00:29:56,770
if you say yes imagine what would happen
if I lose the key

429
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,320
yet if it said the vendor

430
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,939
and if I give if I have a problem with
cock

431
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:08,980
I give you the key and you're the
technician sure you have the right

432
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:13,880
to go to from here to Germany what

433
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,980
what stops you your different user you
should

434
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,150
you should have different access show
you should have

435
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:27,150
different keys

436
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,070
currently I would say in the vendors

437
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:43,860
and

438
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:47,500
we're talking to the let's say anything

439
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,970
what I'm thinking is that a we all of us

440
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:54,780
want to have direct access and do
whatever wat to our machines

441
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,540
that's for sure but we don't want these

442
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:02,190
happened to everyone because imagine
that

443
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:06,070
everyone is a creating an administration

444
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:09,350
administrator user to their computers

445
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:14,160
and which would create many problems

446
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,310
in many cases for example I

447
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:22,389
I forgot my back on the car and I give
the keys

448
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:26,890
to my daughter not to get a should she
have

449
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:32,610
complete access to the car naw the same
happen so if you want to rent a car

450
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:35,840
and your endings in the car to someone

451
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,180
and you say that okay Europe you can use
the car

452
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:43,800
in Austria whatever you want you can
take the car

453
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,940
and leave the country so you have to
have

454
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:52,640
different actual events however
currently the cars are having to BS

455
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,300
so let's use it in order to make some
bonuses

456
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:01,310
you in some countries you can give the
car to

457
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:04,550
your she'd and a you say

458
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:08,139
you're sixteen you're not allowed to go
there okay

459
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:12,030
don't allow create a neck an account and
that makes him me

460
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,940
did designated area or if you want to

461
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,320
and forty-one

462
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,080
talk about it later so

463
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,260
won woo try to

464
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:30,390
use what we would have tried pots with
the

465
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:33,880
our proposal now

466
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:39,650
indication of the parts in her kitchen
on the user's we will create

467
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:43,940
users group would cost and monitor your
day

468
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:48,270
in vehicle traffic and try to drop
possible harm

469
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:51,290
by kids and to create a policy

470
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:57,950
that can be obtainable through the
internet more easily how can we do it

471
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:02,150
would lack to convert

472
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:06,150
the MC you to address third-party were

473
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,270
or parts of the car would be mutually
indicated

474
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:14,190
using the MC you it's part of the cop

475
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:19,230
even if it's the mp3 player or the
steering wheel should be authenticated

476
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:24,220
to the car why I don't want people

477
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:29,920
to install annual unsigned

478
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:34,050
mp3 player a new brake system

479
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:38,230
on the cob without being authenticated
we should not allow

480
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:41,620
easily hot wiring devices

481
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:47,460
and make him work on the car we should
make

482
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:50,650
the car there the parts on the car
categorized

483
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:53,660
to primary and secondary I don't have
any problem

484
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:57,490
with the power windows but if they're
broken

485
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:02,870
day the whole car should be working so
have to divide

486
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:06,960
what's right and what's not let's make
some of the parts primary in some

487
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,660
secondary

488
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,190
saw if a primary

489
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:15,149
part for example steinway

490
00:34:15,149 --> 00:34:18,388
has a problem it's not being
authenticated

491
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:22,010
the car shouldn't and stock

492
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,280
it shouldn't allow me dried

493
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,860
if its a problem with the power window

494
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:33,460
okay I can live without box I will have
to block

495
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:37,330
all the traffic from me because it isn't
of educated

496
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:41,850
either because it is malfunctioning or
because somebody has

497
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:48,480
damn something triggered saw

498
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,260
MZ you should have a and histone

499
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,419
about database with on public is from
the vendors which can be updated

500
00:34:56,418 --> 00:34:59,440
and

501
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,760
this database should be obtainable only
by the visual rental

502
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,380
all the parts should have

503
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,470
certificates and should be checked

504
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:14,380
every day and tarnished

505
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,890
trying to be ignited a stock every time

506
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:21,310
we want to start the car and moreover is

507
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:24,310
yet be used much as 10

508
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:28,070
and every to enduring

509
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:33,040
and are driving because in many cases

510
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,330
and the attack would be announced during

511
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:41,270
are driving experience so

512
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:45,270
moreover we should create record profile

513
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:48,430
for its car on the vendor

514
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:52,359
and with its fine hardware it software
provide

515
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:56,540
doing it name would create who could
create a

516
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,920
more secure environment for

517
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,460
cars we could trigger events for
southern and peculiar

518
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,800
changes we could do

519
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,780
make good

520
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,670
exchanges work

521
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:18,530
on if there's a connection directed
connection to the Internet

522
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:24,250
not get sickness certificates and things
like that the budgets of this approach

523
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,520
is that with gay

524
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,560
who can make maan can take

525
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,779
more control over their usual and
donated to the hours

526
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:35,250
who can restricted to bring the vehicles

527
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,950
from malicious entities and a restrict
people

528
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:43,680
from stoning valuable devices on the fly
hey we can

529
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,220
Ristic they are the general back to
surfers on the beach

530
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:51,040
so some examples in order to make this

531
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,560
a approach clearer and

532
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,680
why should an authenticator break

533
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,740
should stop the vehicle work today

534
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:05,230
we could install a new device

535
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:09,010
apart from the car braking system

536
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:13,780
that's not a decade should issue a break
signup

537
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:17,100
what their I

538
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,410
should be entered start if the only
thing that is receive

539
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:24,750
is the power and or and North addition
cigna and we think too hard while

540
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:27,990
because someone would

541
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:32,490
and could task break

542
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:35,820
the immobilizer system bypass

543
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,050
the whole wires and just Hotwire

544
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:45,030
the NC and going to get away with a cock

545
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,320
should we is let someone

546
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,520
in stone in you mp3 player up to

547
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,680
2 o'clock in the evening and

548
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,069
make plaything Melissa some guys I said
before

549
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:01,460
is possible

550
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,660
to install and in %um see you to the car

551
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:09,330
wherever I me park the car

552
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:13,150
outside my home and suddenly someone who
say

553
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:17,180
installing a device on the car to Hume's
you should the car start

554
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:21,740
is there a reason for letting people

555
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,740
store you claim you new devices

556
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:28,470
in the middle of nowhere someone has
used it to a

557
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:32,340
told rock in taken mccaw and

558
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:36,320
I'm seeing that someone is trying to

559
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:42,380
saint the device inside today let him
and is

560
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,620
2010 was talking about the user someone
is pretending to be the mechanic

561
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:50,130
selection

562
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:53,520
and and a

563
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,700
if we're talking about the whole thing
about letting

564
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,900
people fix my

565
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,100
car I can think that wearing

566
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:08,750
to day 211 everyone should have ended

567
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:11,770
if you have a grasp in your fixing cars

568
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:16,120
you can afford at least an internet
connection doesn't have to be

569
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:21,359
a with happen so

570
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,560
oh so you're talking about user accounts

571
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,590
and show

572
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:32,210
this for example

573
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:37,320
some user Council technician you can't
drive a car for more true than 20

574
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,640
102 kilometers if he has to do it

575
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,279
she must do using a she has mood for
more

576
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,240
she should have a daughter and you have
a young driver

577
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,380
you have a you can use the car

578
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:55,390
for for a distant me at most

579
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:59,080
20 kilometers and you can use it in
special

580
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,240
areas if you rent a car

581
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,470
OJ you can use you can use the car

582
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:10,510
here in Austria or Europe you can you
can export the car

583
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:14,650
or you have paid for the to be assisting
you gonna used

584
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:18,950
the mp3 you have used both you can black
devices and things like that

585
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:22,200
you can implement bonuses on what you're
sending

586
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:28,040
and want to rent some other measurements

587
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:33,520
and that we can use in order to make it
more secure

588
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,570
it's not in a position on gun on fire or

589
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:43,570
or a 90 S or 90 s system in the car many
packets that

590
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:46,910
as I've said are many issues there's
nobody looking them

591
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:50,430
the devices are directly talking

592
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:53,770
today see you and they see you will do

593
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:57,450
anything we should have a mechanism in
order to

594
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:01,030
Dept this packets in order to

595
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:04,050
law some devices the unauthenticated

596
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:08,380
and prevent the privilege escalation
from

597
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:14,910
devices and users this is the feedback
that we go to when we tried to send

598
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:20,580
and the proposal 20 the Accademia

599
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:24,230
these are far more since not one
motivated why does the usual fire or

600
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,540
secure communication

601
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:30,890
this is the the feedback that we got
from people to their

602
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:34,160
who have in there vehicle industry and a

603
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,220
talking about the new cars their own of
them if I was to secure communication

604
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,230
between entities

605
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:43,310
but how is exactly exceed is not K

606
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:47,660
clear from the paper this is from
someone

607
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:51,339
that will create the new bitch comes

608
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:56,780
doesn't know what all what would someone
do with fire

609
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,460
and the antenna cases that today

610
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:03,830
yes in some some people are not ready
yet

611
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:10,080
in order to implement on the stock

612
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:16,299
conclusions and the general
implementation of our approach

613
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:20,410
is not a panacea and a it's a step
towards

614
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:24,109
more secure because and a

615
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:29,410
we think that there was a dead doe more
computerized policies

616
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:32,759
because of turning to computers but we
don't read them

617
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:38,010
salons even if it say about the kitchen
but we want to stow

618
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:42,330
and our approach nemesis and run as
environment for vehicles

619
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:46,620
and social management

620
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:49,750
so we should regard to the

621
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:54,550
mother visoko such computers not just
mechanic parts

622
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:57,940
that can have a mobile computer top

623
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:02,340
and attaching devices installed
applications on computer

624
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:05,640
in is dangerous Jenny its

625
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,299
it but currently a bad idea not to have
a website

626
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,970
mixes on visuals and put a whole week on
the cloud

627
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:17,570
with civic had nowadays and everyone is
dancing

628
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:21,330
or J I want to boot no

629
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:24,840
services on the car in order to use DPS

630
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,810
ended the GPRS and stand tell you that
there's a go to store

631
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:35,810
down there very close to you should go
there and by the staff and the staff

632
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,950
whole reason is that the platform is not
secured

633
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:44,140
will have in stock yet

634
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:47,890
it's vital to redefine the role of the
mobile as a security mechanism

635
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:51,480
it's the only on that we have we should
make it more

636
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,980
clearer more sick you it should have

637
00:43:54,980 --> 00:44:01,030
other features on well and we should
reconsider the General Motors Security

638
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:04,760
godding today computer part

639
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,970
and cautioned drivers in existential
indications the visual

640
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:11,100
as an entity black and plays hi

641
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:15,250
but what happens when you plug and play
anything

642
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:18,580
and that everyone who has access

643
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:23,470
direct access to the car is putting

644
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:27,810
or this should be made without losing on
the easy operation on

645
