1
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,460
so I love it

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,580
my name's demand

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,370
and I'm here at my colleague you could I
miss that too

4
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,980
spy week ago

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,660
only about blue flossing and why you
should actually bother doing it a

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,289
so a slight story of the talk

7
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,509
wiggle first go through some test
results

8
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:29,380
and also after that look look a little
bit

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,300
into the animal is that actually work
against different types of devices

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,940
and as and and discuss

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:42,320
why they actually work and then there
says small portion of actual

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,449
Bluetooth security measures used used in
different devices

13
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:49,789
and and can do wrap-up

14
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:53,660
so little bit about the

15
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,770
us the we don't actually do exploits

16
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,340
we make false or so our primary concern
is to crash software

17
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,429
and once we actually managed to crash it

18
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:08,630
our job is pretty much done at that
point of course

19
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,270
the along the way we do find situations
for exploits could be

20
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,649
easily make because it's a not

21
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:19,740
not very hard to actually write exploits
if the target resemble something like a

22
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,940
Swiss cheese

23
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:26,119
okay so

24
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:30,080
we were basically doing this for five
years now there

25
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,670
we have at at 10 that the Bluetooth

26
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:39,310
special interest groups unblock first
which is like an industry standard

27
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,020
interop testing event its help like tree
times a year

28
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:49,119
so we being going there steadily since
2006

29
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,700
to do sup some false testing and the sad
thing is that

30
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,830
while without being doing it for such a
long time

31
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:02,569
we have haven't seen any any
improvements have happening there

32
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:06,640
so day a protocol robustness has not
increased

33
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,129
during the years so

34
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:14,970
how to know if you can actually see this
but the your some anonymous

35
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:19,060
a results from many of the UPS

36
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,079
events that we have been attending so
the green bars

37
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:25,629
basically indicate the amount of test
runs we have managed run

38
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:28,849
each event so it's something

39
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:32,709
usually like something between 30 to 50
different test runs on different

40
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:34,420
Bluetooth profiles and protocols

41
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,280
and out of those red bars actually show
the failed ones

42
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,939
so the amount of failed

43
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:46,010
test runs per event is a relatively high
I think the

44
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,780
best best one we have actually achieved
isn't like 51 percent and worst

45
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:57,010
worst this way or 90 and this this
basically consists of all time

46
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,890
all kinds of devices because it's a like
a testing haven't been to every

47
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,069
ever wonder comes in to test their
devices against each other

48
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:09,760
yeah well the

49
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,760
your bf events usually sorry yep

50
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,969
one test run it's actually because we'd
re a

51
00:03:28,969 --> 00:03:32,719
we had fathers for different Bluetooth
profiles and protocols

52
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,870
so one test run indicates one like air

53
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,950
1 testing session with one protocol or
profile

54
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,799
yeah they failed to pay legs actually

55
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,700
a outright crash because what we need to
get us fail is something that the

56
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,239
device actually cannot answer to your
anymore or

57
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,920
does a reboot outright or something like
that so

58
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:01,920
that's the that's the failed where
ticked what the

59
00:04:02,529 --> 00:04:05,969
your bf events usually have devices from

60
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:10,060
which are in development or are
prototypes we want to

61
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,290
see it the current situation is any
better

62
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,899
so we did last spring this got carpet

63
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,900
testing born into where we took 15
different car kits

64
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,380
six of those were in car targeted be
installed and

65
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,790
on the cart and then nine were
aftermarket

66
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,540
package which you can buy we found
problems with

67
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,150
13 up the car kits and there were two

68
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,490
markets which had such a complex logic
that we couldn't get any

69
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,350
meaningful results because I'm getting
the reproducible way to test them

70
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:48,630
some in car car gets dressed job at that
we actually have to send the car back to

71
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,370
the dealership

72
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:55,050
for for fixing the problem and at least
11 per week at the total

73
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,970
in for payment system you could not used
the radio play CD or

74
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,820
do anything with it they didn't press
the actual

75
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,880
logic which controls motor snapshot

76
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,890
that was accessible still but then for
them system navigation was completed

77
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:14,240
shut down they have told targets
actually cast with Delta

78
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,290
which is the lowest protocol layer test
and

79
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,080
that didn't require any bearing the ones
we were able to

80
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,130
a step he said to the connection with
Preston those

81
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,219
and we also tested HFP and a2dp profile
us it appears youthful

82
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,800
hands-free and a2dp super media
streaming

83
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,430
so those are the most commonly available
profiles on

84
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,200
on car kits

85
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,460
so the kind of testing the you do it

86
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,560
its busing I I'm for the issue everyone
here is

87
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,960
already aware of what putting its with
basically just

88
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,570
sending a anomalies data or invalid data
in large amounts to a

89
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,510
to a device and in in our case we

90
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,250
use system called intelligent busing
where we actually

91
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,560
kinda design that they that be sent but

92
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,530
it seems that random passing is also
quite effective

93
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,860
and usually the kind of

94
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,050
failures busy or crashes because it's
pretty hot too

95
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,080
instrument and and hands-free device be
gone

96
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,020
we do completely black box testing we do
not have any instrumentation indeed

97
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,169
at with just see that it doesn't work
anymore that we have sent

98
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,700
get

99
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:36,490
a Bluetooth we test every protocol a
profile from it took up a ball

100
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,120
that's because they're those pro but I
usually

101
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,460
implemented in the host that and they
are implemented in software

102
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,660
whereas the controller stockpiling
manager protocol and

103
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,680
link ultra-low they are usually done in
hardware and we don't want to use any

104
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:57,680
extra hard but we want to use just basic
both the Donald percent today

105
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,760
use a model-based putting where we
actually make a model of the protocol

106
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,360
or propyl we are testing and then we
designed the anomalies

107
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,010
tube8 feeling that brought appears in
the protocol

108
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,180
for example if the bro profile has a
lengthier

109
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,540
redesign anomalies such that they fit
the link via

110
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,540
32-bit link that has we put zeros

111
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,320
or or FF effects or something like that

112
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,730
and Polaski pits with the task in it so
we got to

113
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:30,080
random testing with pride actually
decided that get it so that they

114
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,430
will work the best work will look better
there are

115
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,570
about 25 profiles carotid be up

116
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:41,000
for which we have tools and for

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,230
broke why we have something like at
least then doesn't that this is for

118
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,550
every profile but

119
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,800
for example to at L took up the full
test one is

120
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,370
ninety thousand cases and you can go
beyond that you want to

121
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:55,470
and no special hardware issues with just
use bluetooth dongle

122
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:01,710
percent to date

123
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:07,370
okay being so during our testing
sessions we have actually managed to you

124
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,930
that a narrow down certain animal a type
stat

125
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,710
seem to work against a multitude of
devices and these are actually

126
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:18,250
life real-life examples that we have
used to crash

127
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,550
some devices we don't of course aglow
Steve exec devices that we crashed but

128
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,190
still so

129
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,990
the first first animal type: it's that
simple and field

130
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,269
the set actually really really simple
animali

131
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:37,820
we just basically lie light the I'll
linked

132
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:41,120
of the message that it's being sent

133
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,279
so we might with their that there isn't
any data coming in or

134
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,540
we might like that they're set the
maximum amount of data coming

135
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,748
while still by the last year old just
including the basic basic frame

136
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:58,550
of the protocol at they seem to be a
particle earlier

137
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,439
effective when apply to TLV structures
where you have a type unlike them while

138
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:03,379
you

139
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:10,379
but I have a although talk a bit more
but he'll be a bit later on

140
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,129
so I don't know if you can see anything
of the examples

141
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:18,199
but I will go through them so on the
left side

142
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:22,829
you will see I justice very simple l2
cap connect request

143
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:27,410
used to connect to you these serve each
service discovery protocol

144
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,149
a service so to very simple

145
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:34,180
political fray and

146
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:39,069
what actually works s just replace the
initialing field which

147
00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:42,680
indicates trip length of the whole
packet just replace it with

148
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,939
a FS

149
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:50,990
and this is set unfortunate that this is
a quite common

150
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:55,600
common fall failure mode included
devices so

151
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,220
just put up initialing and the device
crashes

152
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,790
guess obviously expecting for a lot more
day to come to coming

153
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:08,079
but it is gonna analytic anymore

154
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,079
and two up with applied the same to kill
the link

155
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,610
at here we have any a2dp set
configuration message

156
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:22,110
that is used to you pretty much just set
the values for a data audio stream

157
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,379
so you justify all all settings like
katya

158
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:29,720
a sampling rate and stuff like that

159
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,439
so here we do a it does have until the
structure

160
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:37,920
and we lie about the only which is media
codec deal the

161
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,189
and we say that there's no data coming
in but we do include today a

162
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:49,189
and but we get a crash

163
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,069
okay and a bit more but he only the

164
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:57,759
basically tell the structures are really
hard to parse because you might have you

165
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:58,050
might

166
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,670
the not have any Brey said

167
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,680
order where when they might come in you
YouTube basically have to parse the

168
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,269
whole payload because you want to search
for specific DLB

169
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:13,050
and cutest cat have to go to two of them
so you can't expect

170
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,920
most of the time you just cannot expect
that okay the first the obvious this and

171
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,128
the second is this

172
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:22,509
pay once we actually start

173
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:25,579
messing up missing the structure opting
that he'll be

174
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:28,870
the obese the a targets usually go

175
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,029
total pong curse because they just can't
handle the

176
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:35,709
data coming into the state totally lost
their sense of

177
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:39,920
place actually when you a start forcing
the TLB

178
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,229
so they don't know any they don't know
anymore particularly structures going

179
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,089
and of course you can apply more the
field animal waste at the Esso

180
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:53,249
this basically just plus at two
different fields you can fuss like

181
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:56,699
type and length field at the same time
but I haven't

182
00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:01,939
at better example of that a bit later on

183
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:05,118
so here's an example this is an the

184
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:08,839
opec's object push connect message

185
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,860
opec's itself is that quite alt

186
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,029
protocol because it actually uses to you
it has two

187
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:20,079
means to you brief item understating
until the structure

188
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,519
it has both blanked and it has an
alternator in the payload

189
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:28,300
in many of the headers so you have kind
of you two ways to

190
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,600
at that you have to check dat today days

191
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,019
a there so

192
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:38,259
what we do here smoke be just basically
send week

193
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:42,170
call click link correctly but we do said
basically send a lot of people turn in a

194
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,430
terse

195
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,920
a in the payload and

196
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,459
this seems to be a very common common
fail include devices as well because

197
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:55,339
that they just can't handle the new
Knoll among malls in there

198
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:58,629
for some reason we have not not of
course

199
00:12:58,629 --> 00:13:02,439
gone we too deep of in the code section
because we do black

200
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:05,660
black box texting basically so we don't
know what

201
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:11,449
what exactly causes but anyway

202
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:14,569
okay then we have the good old data
structure flossing

203
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:18,709
which basically means just that Inc
inserting too much or too little dating

204
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:20,689
a political fray

205
00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:25,209
and sadly it seems that like the
previous speaker AST

206
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:28,540
saying that if you do it back

207
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:33,550
buffer overflow its trade a citizen and
nothing else than it's bad but

208
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,279
it seems to be very effective in
polluted and

209
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,180
their set actually an example of that

210
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,699
so this initial message used in
hands-free when you're setting up a

211
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,709
connection with the hands free device

212
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:51,240
so you just basically at

213
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,379
a exchange the support it features
between devices

214
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:58,699
and you're supposed to have a at numeric
value

215
00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:02,119
intercom and so when we do it's just

216
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:05,509
completely erased numeric value an
answer

217
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:10,119
just insert a lot of properties in lower
case a's there

218
00:14:10,119 --> 00:14:13,809
and ok this one actually comes with a

219
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:17,279
funny story or sad if you wish there was
this surrender

220
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,410
testing with us at one of the UPS couple
of years back

221
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:26,029
so they had a hands-free unique device

222
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:29,439
we were sending this part to get a test
case and the

223
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:32,498
device crashed and a

224
00:14:32,499 --> 00:14:37,490
we had a little discussing them at the
usual you cannot do this type of

225
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,639
Bible thing because that's the mindset

226
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,730
and at and a sudden just left

227
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,959
but they came back the next day and up

228
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,509
apparently they hacked the like fix the
problem

229
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:54,089
and they want to do do a retest with us
so

230
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:58,600
of course we do that so we did the test
case senate-passed

231
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,869
but and we proceeded to the next exit
gate with its a

232
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:05,100
actually identical to that but the all

233
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,309
all the ace are uppercase and the device
crashed again

234
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:12,439
so apparently what they have had done

235
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:15,779
loss the that they had made a filtered
at fielder Inc

236
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:19,119
they a string of upper and lower case
a's and we

237
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:23,809
when we're sent in the upper case a it's
only it crashed again

238
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:27,259
I don't know the end of that story but I
hope they actually started thinking

239
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:33,290
at that situation a bit more after that

240
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:37,329
the then we have repeats

241
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:41,319
this sexually a a bit different because
it's

242
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:46,439
basically it contains only Valley data
but what we do is that we just repeat

243
00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:51,269
certain elements within a frame and many
many times

244
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:55,809
and this usually cause

245
00:15:55,809 --> 00:16:00,259
course or all consistent strange
situations where a device actually start

246
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,989
acting really slow you cannot access the
UAE anymore

247
00:16:03,989 --> 00:16:08,829
and so on so here said typical example
of that

248
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:12,129
a chick and the a2dp said conflagration
message

249
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:15,910
which has a mandatory media transport

250
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:20,170
TLB that doesn't have any value actually
by default

251
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,589
so what we actually do is we just take
that one to: the block

252
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:27,079
every repeated are on taught housing
times or so

253
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:31,220
within the one free so but probably
happens here

254
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,889
is that the at system under test just
start sparking the deal the elements

255
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:37,800
over and over and over again

256
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,839
and eventually just run south of
resources

257
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:44,850
and every team starts acting real slow
air until eventually it will

258
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:51,850
total crash in

259
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:56,189
okay so this is so fairly recent
discovery

260
00:16:56,189 --> 00:17:00,649
the that we have a scene with some
deweiss insist that

261
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:04,199
the you basically have two floss or at
all

262
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,280
you can just sent like huge book of Bali
data into the Bluetooth

263
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,379
and some cheap shit seem to be actually
just

264
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,689
stopping after that and resulting in a
situation where you

265
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:18,720
just have to do a hardware reset this
that

266
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,220
the particularly present in devices that

267
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,079
the by nature have a less resources than

268
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,678
other such just like a and headsets and
so on

269
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,279
but talk to say whole how you solve this
problem is because we have seen a couple

270
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:38,179
of devices that do this

271
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:42,279
but the it's not very widespread
hopefully

272
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:45,890
Bob if it's at actually if the problems
in the stack

273
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,659
if this if it's in the stack its gonna
spread like a wildfire

274
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:54,289
costar there are not that many start the
stack renders the people you so

275
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:57,690
to down stacked in and one thing about
this these

276
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:01,419
that this really doesn't mean any animal
issue conscious invalid data

277
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:05,610
the huge part of the an

278
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,960
me but they know the

279
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,470
one of thing is that many many pluto
implementations

280
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,929
actually that they're quite

281
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,600
cluttered because you have you might
have a different Wenders

282
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,240
working on one 1by so there might be one

283
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,720
one wonder doing one profile and another
when they're doing another profile

284
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,500
so what we have actually seen that these
Pro Plus even though many of them use

285
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,360
the same components like a

286
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,070
80 comments and opec's uses of course
opec's comments

287
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,240
the think that some of these compliment

288
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,470
profiles that I have been implemented
actually implement their own

289
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,919
a tea partyers they don't use some
common provided eighty parse error in

290
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,450
the stack but they implement their own

291
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:57,370
up and this results in situation where

292
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:01,980
where we have seen that the doing at
specific Bible family against the device

293
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,250
are considered as specific profile might
actually work

294
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,000
a on the same device eg against another
profile

295
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,429
so it's clear indication that the court
situation is that the

296
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:15,720
if you want to test in proper all you
have to do go to all the profiles

297
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,710
because the

298
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:21,309
apparently are using a lot of different
components even though there would be a

299
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:22,600
like a common

300
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:29,049
interface available one example was
actually one car be tested last spring

301
00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:33,730
it not only did have one a different
parser see it actually had

302
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:38,330
two different loot radio Senate handling
two different things so you had a

303
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,158
handsfree

304
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:42,640
hands-free profile running on the car
and you had a a deal audio streaming

305
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,470
profile in the car

306
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,990
and they were made by different lenders
and

307
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:54,990
car actually had to put radio sinking do
differently to stacks

308
00:19:57,409 --> 00:20:02,080
so what you good we do in the future

309
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,279
we have tried many of these a given that

310
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,600
looking condition channel start acting a
bit better and we cannot question

311
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,260
their simplest ones me of course could
be the

312
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:18,399
much more complicated anomalies

313
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:22,029
course there's more the field more the
field meaning that which is basically

314
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:25,769
a foss different fields in the protocol
frame

315
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:29,090
at the same time the

316
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:33,049
in their second sequence animal East the
which are basically

317
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:36,658
meant to apec state machines instead of
parsers

318
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:40,700
so you might have a step static the or

319
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,850
variable message sequence to do certain
things include

320
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:49,080
so what we've could do is just actually
switched the message isn't that

321
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,330
to send something not totally unexpected
in the state

322
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:56,908
the partisan

323
00:20:56,909 --> 00:21:01,590
the lengths of course more more like
profile Bluetooth does many things using

324
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,740
different product profiles at once

325
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,639
you might have like a car kit doing a
handsfree and a phone book

326
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:14,289
access at the same time so 11 option is
to actually for us

327
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:18,090
different profiles at once or so

328
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,230
and since the look at this constantly
evolving

329
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:25,250
a technology they come up with new stuff
all the time

330
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,340
there too recent big

331
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,820
improvement is a Bluetooth Low Energy
just basically

332
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,070
using completely new radio and old-hat

333
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:38,399
to use do up control like sensory
quickly

334
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:42,740
and using s little less power as
possible

335
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,080
so its gonna bring up much more

336
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,279
the make the blue good in general much
more complex

337
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:53,399
and hence I'll would think that there
bro please gonna be a lot of

338
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:57,409
lot of vulnerabilities over there
concerning that

339
00:21:57,409 --> 00:22:00,789
even the classic Bluetooth it took like

340
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:05,080
many years until they actually managed
to get l2 capping a condition that

341
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,428
a different devices to just
spontaneously rebooted

342
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:15,309
even though they didn't try to do any
forcing

343
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:19,480
so here so one example of the multiple
animali

344
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,669
course the up problem with the basis
that if you

345
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:26,490
want to actually catch the problem if
you want to go to your code and find

346
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:30,299
what's what's wrong in their and the for
seeing different fields

347
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:33,820
once a week can make that much more
harder issued on

348
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,350
you don't have to accept calls in hand

349
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:40,899
so this basically a the dis the same

350
00:22:40,899 --> 00:22:44,760
same example I was showing earlier video
pp pot

351
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,570
in this case we are just using no
terminators in a value

352
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:52,629
plus we are using a unknown header
attack

353
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:56,490
in the TL the so the

354
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:00,179
we have seen that one by sexually it was
able to handle

355
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:04,450
if we fought intact field we insert the
unknown head over there

356
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,610
it was able to parse that and

357
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:12,110
even you and then we try to value with
the love note for many years and it was

358
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,120
able to parse that

359
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,080
but once we actually started fussing idk
what the tax field and the Value field

360
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,620
that the bus crashed so up

361
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,779
one reason for this might be that it
actually has some predefined ways to

362
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:28,090
actually handle different the only types

363
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:32,860
so once it gets got and on on her back
it had no idea what to do with the

364
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,659
payload so

365
00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:40,340
and it a crash it seems to be a very
common way to handle errors included

366
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,820
just crash

367
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,418
and not try to do anything anything
fancy Middleton

368
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:50,700
return an error or something to splash

369
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:55,039
and that in the sequence Annalise

370
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,529
so it's basically just rearranging the
messages in a valid sequence

371
00:23:59,529 --> 00:24:03,190
so you might do a comic 1010 if you do
like a

372
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:07,240
try audio streaming you want to a clinic
than 10 try to open the

373
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,360
connect opened the audio stream heatedly
without doing the necessary audio stream

374
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,659
conflagration first

375
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,919
and things like that

376
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:20,139
of course of course this Bruce A much
more efficiently

377
00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:23,230
pro a broke laws and protocols that have

378
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,279
complex sequences and complex state
machines

379
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:30,340
because it's you so if there's a lot of
lot of states in the machine ex-gang kit

380
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,110
easily Inc

381
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:35,860
easily confused in what they state state
is sitting

382
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,210
an this usually done quick

383
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,630
perfectly perfectly normal the Valley
messages

384
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:46,159
but of course you could start analyzing
and that

385
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:51,700
and for some additional phone

386
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,130
and more the profile 1x a poll for the
profile is to just basically foss

387
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,090
different profiles

388
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:00,959
once but there said another not they're
catching it because

389
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,570
the especially when you're doing testing
client-side devices

390
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,689
plain sight devices testing them

391
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:13,720
it's pretty hard usually because he
usually contains a lot of user

392
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,980
interaction

393
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,950
you need to perform a certain operation
in the device to actually trigger

394
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,820
something

395
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:24,629
so that we can return on fast message
back to it

396
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:29,830
a their arse the we have found some
useful ways to actually automate that

397
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:33,379
because the when the more the profile
actually Conson

398
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:37,049
there are some certain cases in
Bluetooth that do all 0

399
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:40,360
opening up some automatic at the
collectors

400
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:46,130
such as using a V RCB which is pretty
much like a remote control profile

401
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:49,399
use to a remotely control audio devices
and such

402
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:53,399
you can use that to trigger audio
streams so you can pretty much just say

403
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:54,250
okay

404
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,759
I want to play something and the devices
opens open stream:

405
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:02,029
a 2tb to your at which point you already
have a not

406
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:05,559
new open attack vector up

407
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:10,309
another ex-employees handsfree and their
phone book access profile

408
00:26:10,309 --> 00:26:13,399
so there are certain use cases for you
might just

409
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:17,490
basically indicate that okay we a
hands-free that okay we have an incoming

410
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,169
call

411
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:21,779
from this number and some car kits

412
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:24,840
are actually able to do it that day

413
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,370
get the calling and they check the
number and then they start doing

414
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:33,279
phone book access to check who's number
is it

415
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,610
a yep

416
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:42,940
now now few ideas that we have gathered
from the UPS been talking to developers

417
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:49,940
about white these top of anomalies work
so well

418
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,500
jackson-lee very common response

419
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,279
when we Scholl the anomaly when we show
the case that they have

420
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,529
sent that the designer a answers back to

421
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:04,899
you cannot do that the specification
doesn't allow you to do that

422
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:08,990
in the broader spurred that its they do
a lot of interrupt this time they had

423
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,970
the your bf three times a year

424
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:16,080
and every brought device has two passed
through an internal testing

425
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,330
but they don't do any negative testing
the mind it is not that they

426
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:24,699
a lot of people have no idea about
putting or about negative testing

427
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:30,159
even though it's been the talk of the
year for HAP ten years or so

428
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,700
tell a lot of people still haven't got a
clue

429
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,149
I'll all of thinking in the in the old
ways where

430
00:27:37,149 --> 00:27:41,549
you know you cannot send anything
invalid that you have a connection and

431
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:45,700
every device is interrupted and that
just don't do that

432
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,840
so that that is definitely one of the
reasons why

433
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:54,669
a don't even think about receiving 100
ace

434
00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:57,929
and another reason is of course a lot so
what they've

435
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:01,879
I make a five dollar of %uh euro headset
so what if it

436
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:07,590
breaks down when you send invalidate not
going to be a big problem

437
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,919
well thats true to not

438
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,009
valid for that but 12 stuff to do things
in that mindset

439
00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:18,590
you don't even care about these things
and now you have

440
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:22,230
all of a sudden blow though thing in
medical devices and I

441
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:26,809
I really would like to know that the
developers have been thinking

442
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:30,889
have not been thinkin so what if if it
breaks so what it crested just

443
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:36,809
rebuilt

444
00:28:36,809 --> 00:28:40,428
and of course it's not easy its hot

445
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:43,480
to actually implement and and profile or

446
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,629
or a protocol when even if you will
pride

447
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:52,080
think about secure David if you try to
think about in bullet messages

448
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,000
I have re than my share of Paul brought
the clothes and brought by saddam has

449
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,019
been able to break every one of them

450
00:28:58,019 --> 00:29:02,559
at least once every time I have got a
chanting we actually it did a bit

451
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,299
when I didn't a tip be which is partisan
political Minton

452
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:09,658
US really we agreed that if he cannot
break

453
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:12,950
anything he would buy me a beer and up

454
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:17,490
I promise to buy him a bath he breaks in
didn't

455
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:23,309
so it's at and the new you combine this
with I'm because bit specifications

456
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:26,840
and and and Dutch get Onur 102

457
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,549
or something out that's it's actually a
wonder that devices actually worked that

458
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:32,840
well that they do

459
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,149
no especially the example with the obits
was a good one where the

460
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:40,269
there's another measure the string and
there's a link field

461
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:43,149
in the deal with structure but this
specification doesn't a which one is

462
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:44,590
right

463
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:49,169
what to do when the the length and the
now to manage do not match

464
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:56,169
so that's one other example of that
because specification

465
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,210
ok a little bit about to the security
measures this

466
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:07,360
quite common stock but pairing

467
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,200
bearing is the most common way to
product legitimizes of course

468
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,509
you have at two different types
basically a

469
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:18,519
legacy burying which the old method of
doing it it

470
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:21,870
Sep 22 2.0 on older

471
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:25,279
it uses at basically

472
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,779
usually it uses like a four digit PIN
code you can insert a 16-day to think

473
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:30,970
about I'm

474
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:35,220
ray hardly seen any devices that use
more than four

475
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:39,899
pluto 2.1 introduce something called
said simple secure pairing which fixes a

476
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:43,600
lot of problems with the old like a sick
parent thing

477
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,639
but still there's the one critical

478
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:49,649
aspect polluted by nature it

479
00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:52,970
always leaves one attack vector open
even though

480
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:57,679
you had pairing on thats a l2 cap

481
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,179
you can a pretty much always if you know
a Bluetooth device address you can

482
00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:04,320
always connect with l2 cap to the STP
PSM

483
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,379
PSN lights like a equal amount

484
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:10,690
of the part number TCP so

485
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:13,840
is set use usability requirements so

486
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,460
you need to be able to scan the device
but the can offer

487
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,700
and that's why they actually leave it
open

488
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,749
it's also at Beautiful Mind shipping

489
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:28,700
that they have never taught that it
would be a efficient at the correct or

490
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,019
so

491
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:32,399
because you don't have any negative
negative stuff coming in its

492
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:39,399
clearly specified that you ship sent
this and this

493
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:44,100
and the Holy Grail evade impairing
course we don't have any

494
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:48,330
sure shot way to do it but there are
some things some things that

495
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:51,590
work every now and then social
engineering

496
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:54,950
of course one that could be a all
different talk

497
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:58,529
in itself but I can imagine if use

498
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:02,259
are sitting in an airport airport lunch
and something that the airport lunch

499
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:03,850
once to pair with you

500
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:08,139
there it would be many people that would
accept that

501
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:11,370
a one method base actually

502
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:14,669
evading the whole improved secure simple
pairing

503
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:18,529
and that can be simple done by saying
that you're an old device

504
00:32:18,529 --> 00:32:22,139
I'm a plea to 2.0 device at which point
because

505
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:25,249
at Bluetooth 2.1 for example has to be

506
00:32:25,249 --> 00:32:30,840
pack were compatible it will go back to
be a legacy pairing at that point

507
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,200
taking just completely made all the all
the improvements

508
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,269
like that and there are some this
pairing mode

509
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:42,610
a introduced in secure simple pairing
which is basically meant for

510
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:46,090
pairing with the device that doesn't
happen the way of in putting

511
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:50,509
or any way of displaying data so its
goal Trust works

512
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:54,249
and it just works so basically what you
doing to initiate bearing and

513
00:32:54,249 --> 00:32:57,320
a and that's it this is

514
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,220
actually supposed to be used from the
host device to a client device

515
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,600
but in some cases we have seen that you
can reverse the process

516
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,999
you can't just say okay I'm a headset I
want to pair with your phone

517
00:33:07,999 --> 00:33:11,080
it just works in the coaster and
southern Europe air

518
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:18,080
and suddenly you have all the faithful
service is open

519
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,460
of course would like a cig legacy at
pairing

520
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:25,879
there's it's almost always the pain goes
sour for heroes or 1234

521
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:29,019
people are too lazy to actually go
through a changing them to use the

522
00:33:29,019 --> 00:33:30,029
default

523
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:33,289
at headsets usually have a hard-coded

524
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:36,379
pincode you can't even change that

525
00:33:36,379 --> 00:33:40,620
and 181 TV have discovered a

526
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:45,809
a wants you start sending animal is to
DL to cap

527
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:49,158
layer to TST PPS in which is always open

528
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:53,749
we have seen some device actually lost
completely a rapidly to bear

529
00:33:53,749 --> 00:33:56,929
so they don't actually request any
pairing after some

530
00:33:56,929 --> 00:34:03,929
Annalise

531
00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:09,840
than there are of course up other
security measures that are deployed in

532
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,030
devices and

533
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:15,270
computers and phones most common one is
that not discoverable mode

534
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:19,530
almost every phone nowadays it's not
discoverable but the part you have to

535
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,159
enable it and then it's

536
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:24,159
discoverable for two minutes or so

537
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,030
but you have to remember that even if
it's not discoverable it still may

538
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,450
accept connections

539
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:32,868
many devices are not shown in scan but
you still can't do

540
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:36,659
SBB query for it which means of course
that you can call it too

541
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:40,599
attica then there are dedicated pairing
mode

542
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:44,369
mostly every headset nowadays you have
to

543
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:48,089
bullet to up pairing mode where it will
accept connections by every

544
00:34:48,089 --> 00:34:52,389
everywhere and then if it's not in peril
not then it it will accept connections

545
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:57,950
only from from trusted devices on the
phone devices that you have paired with

546
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:02,578
and then dates seems to be the new trick
is that the device actually

547
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:05,930
before accepting a connection it doesn't
St bigger

548
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:09,470
STP quarterback and text what you'll are
supporting

549
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:13,089
and then enables those services so you
have to

550
00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:16,400
run in st. Peter on your own and

551
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,750
that's not a problem for devices of
course because they always have they

552
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:23,280
need to have the STP but for us it was a

553
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,280
one obstacle we have to go go through so
we have two other

554
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,250
FTP server running and then we have to
serve that correct

555
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,369
service records for that device to
enable it services

556
00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:37,730
so that made the commitment this time

557
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:40,930
and I think windows Sevendust this to
I'll

558
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,359
its blotch actually loads all the
drivers after

559
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:51,240
it looks at their devices what property
you it was

560
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,790
and then their arse there are white

561
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:58,819
imaginative ways that for example
cockpit windows have make the devices

562
00:35:58,819 --> 00:36:01,900
but you have to control certain hopes to
even

563
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,520
get your phone connected to a car and

564
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,869
the bus also one of the reasons why
there were two garbage that we couldn't

565
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:10,710
interrupt would

566
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,800
properly because we would have needed to
run

567
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,550
a number of profiles it didn't do
anything unless it connected to

568
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:23,569
be back in a HFP and and a2dp a before
it actually talk to any of those

569
00:36:23,569 --> 00:36:27,410
but this kind of tricks they make it up
it hotter

570
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:30,618
for a legitimate use its

571
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:34,859
it docks but a number of clicks you
actually get your phone patio car

572
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:39,230
nowadays and of course when you are
implementing a devices like that or

573
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,520
security matters like that you have to
make sure

574
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,950
that all the profiles used the same
mechanisms

575
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:48,480
because in bullet but a lot of the
properties are booked from

576
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,990
different when Dustin now you have to
make sure that all those profiles

577
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:55,490
used to send security measures there was
actually a one case where up

578
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:59,150
went up you could %uh download an
application to your phone

579
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:04,190
which turned on the just works bearing
on the phone

580
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:08,550
so before downloaded application it
didn't accept just works better in but

581
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,839
after downloading that because in it

582
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:17,839
accepted just worked for every proper

583
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,759
it seems to be that the focus has been

584
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,390
focus making both devices secure has
been on on

585
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:30,109
preventing their another us to access so
that is the

586
00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:34,180
line of defense that if you'll have
allowed to access a

587
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,240
activity all ball and then somebody
steals your

588
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,750
diaries it's your fault so that

589
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:43,839
seems to be the only on a defense that
is

590
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,630
the underlying implementations are still
crap but still crash them

591
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,869
once we get do that bearing pace

592
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:55,470
and unfortunately it seems that that
situation that might it is not

593
00:37:55,470 --> 00:38:00,140
changing we actually have a one of the
major operating systems nowadays we can

594
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,109
still dress but

595
00:38:01,109 --> 00:38:04,890
single Arkham bucket but since it
requires parent they didn't care that

596
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:05,328
much

597
00:38:05,329 --> 00:38:09,540
went with told him about

598
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:14,410
so we would like to see that people
implementing both the devices

599
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:18,058
spent some time actually doing some
quality testing

600
00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:21,559
goes without to to make their

601
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:26,930
implementation is more robust

602
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:30,598
we have quite a lot of experience in
testing areas I P

603
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,170
I P implementations and from there we
have seen that

604
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:37,230
sometimes when it is test the one device

605
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:40,270
at the border of the netbook or
somewhere else

606
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:44,170
the I normally sexually provocative
quite deep into the network

607
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:48,059
like when we have been testing II on
AP's

608
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:51,309
we'll sometime see Anna Maria's

609
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:55,140
data going into the authentication
server which is quite

610
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:59,049
far away from the AP itself and already
in the network

611
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:03,910
beeping deep inside the netbook so we
think that maybe a bit up like this to

612
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,220
upload both

613
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,700
for example have a car car kit
integrated into a car and its integrated

614
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,359
into the system which controls the
brakes on

615
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:16,578
allows you to tweak your car system so

616
00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:20,130
how well are those defended other
competition at birth or are they running

617
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,540
the same process or

618
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:25,829
to the share some buses and things like
that that beyond interesting

619
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:32,829
thing to actually look further into

620
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:39,140
and and violates just not about security

621
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:43,000
think about the case where you buy that
5 euro headset and

622
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,650
the hated suddenly grasses are decided
to do something

623
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:50,220
Funktion Center one analyst 1 invalid
backpack at the

624
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,540
other phone and the phone crashes

625
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:57,200
so this is not only a security problem I
think that

626
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,520
its a problem complete in in about it
you lose

627
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,250
when you have a lot of devices different
devices and when one of them fails and

628
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,680
sent invalidate and then

629
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,970
pressure system to maybe that is also
one thing that they need to be thinking

630
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,400
about

631
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,160
nowadays we have medical devices we have
insulin pumps

632
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:21,348
which are controlled using both devices
so the idea of actually

633
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:24,940
injecting into in to anomaly

634
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,660
is it's quite scary and

635
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:32,129
for help that we Pettitte are something
that people were

636
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:35,329
at all offices don't turn on anymore the
state

637
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:38,660
what they crash there's no way to
rebuild them

638
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,950
you have to tear them apart take out the
battery

639
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:48,950
and we have killed a lot of those

640
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:52,490
nope with that

641
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:55,619
I thank you and if you have any
questions feel free to ask
