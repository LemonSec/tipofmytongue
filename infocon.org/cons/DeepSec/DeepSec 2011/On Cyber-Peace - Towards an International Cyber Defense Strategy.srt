1
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,109
just one warning in the beginning of the
storm

2
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,739
I'm not going to present a plan of some
kind of 102 make

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,450
the internet secure I've just collected
some thoughts on

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,820
IT security from a more global point a
few or according to come from closing

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,430
its

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,980
the leading fused in debating walls in
peace am

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:28,439
I'm operating on the strategic level so

8
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,750
on for someone like to to introduce my
IE I'm

9
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,010
I'm interested in giving the storm point
I chose that public and

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,129
1i try to discuss security on a
strategic you

11
00:00:39,129 --> 00:00:43,539
am lost you I get to talk you into deep
sec 2010

12
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:46,789
which was titled cycle on the horizon
and there was some

13
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:50,519
others have all related talks like cyber
crimes have a warm

14
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:55,239
I'm connecting the dots and currently
there is a big hype in the media in

15
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:57,469
Europe in Germany and in other countries
to

16
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:01,199
on cybersecurity sign in security and

17
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,050
the possibility of its I'm war I'm the
German press

18
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:10,330
interested in writing articles sent the
Chinese army is trying to attack us via

19
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,130
the internet and

20
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,420
and there is a lot of long Balchin

21
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,540
been going on in the present a medium
and among we are all going down tomorrow

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,000
because of the Internet

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,530
so on my try to I'm do some kind of more
technical analyzes the first time was

24
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,920
possible and gave a talk on that last
year

25
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,650
and according to my analyzes according
to Charles Evans

26
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,520
I'm Sibel war is not possible each
because more means

27
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,710
that you able to force you enemy to do
what you want

28
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,900
by overcoming his power and that is not
possible on the internet you still have

29
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,570
to use

30
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,400
morning on me like tanks infantry
battleships and so long

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,630
so in my opinion the times time was
little bit X agreed

32
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,330
however am that the media and the
politicians and to whom other people

33
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,070
talking about I'm securities in my
opinion

34
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:01,850
I'm very good development because
several years ago

35
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,950
a securities awareness was almost
nonexistent

36
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,280
except for security professionals song

37
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,540
am if I remember correctly in 2000

38
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,459
there was an incident where a
15-year-old Canadian shot on eBay and

39
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,810
Amazon using

40
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,820
script hacked by German hackers from an
orphan

41
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:25,519
I'm he took out his own and and evening

42
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,770
he too got Amazon eBay and that was the
first time that

43
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,100
IT security was reported on a large
scale in German media

44
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:38,160
souls and Sam on and when it has been
rosy especially by media and by Obama

45
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,000
journalists

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,010
but some in my opinion

47
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,579
not anyone involved in the discussion
knows what he's talking about

48
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,819
dentists especially true for Jones
possibly surgeons

49
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:55,710
a.m. and for some glycine speaking in
the news on security incidents

50
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,490
um there's also something that is very
likely that

51
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:04,030
are politicians and lobbyists group
using the security

52
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,290
topic to push on I can go to send again
known for their political

53
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,200
point if you for example in Germany's
some political parties interested in

54
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,130
getting more regulation to the Internet

55
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,590
in in more surveillance & surveillance
technology

56
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,690
and using the time would be paid to sent

57
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,790
that again to the median Swan song

58
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,350
the discussion could be enhanced in
quality to me

59
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,890
so what does between development and IT
security or why is

60
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:36,630
IT security becoming a Morris global
problem

61
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,269
am it. information technologies emerging
too many new fields

62
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:45,190
and with and information technology
emerging to new fuels

63
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:50,800
IT security also images to new fuels
many of those fields for people looking

64
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,760
in those fields

65
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,370
on what to wear of information
technology problems and information

66
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,230
technology

67
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,060
security problems for example Electrical
and Mechanical Engineers which I have

68
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,150
already worked with have a complete
different concept of security

69
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,280
electrical engineers interested in
electrical security social security

70
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,120
means for them

71
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,080
that using of the device cannot touch
the electrical

72
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,819
contacts in the inside so the use double
shootings or something like that

73
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:22,069
this is a complete different concept of
security compared to IT security

74
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:28,259
and they do have a very static rule on
static view of security

75
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:33,139
for example in Germany there is an
organisation for standardisation which

76
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,610
is called in german teen

77
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,879
it's comparable to the american and iced
tea and

78
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,979
it publishes moves on electrical
engineering security and mechanical

79
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:42,779
security

80
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:46,749
and if any engineer developing a new
device is following those rules

81
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:50,699
he will get no problems final so if
anything happens and he followed those

82
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:51,349
rules

83
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:54,960
he's on the safe side nothing will
happen to him am

84
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,008
this does not apply to IT security you
cannot create for some reasons

85
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:02,460
such a static rooms such a list of
static routes which

86
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,638
which have to be followed

87
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,129
so from one has to change am the
mindsets

88
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:13,710
those who are working I am as electrical
or mechanical engineer with

89
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:19,568
IT security on T in general
international with IT security

90
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:24,029
I'm networking and especially the
Internet is also emerging to new fields

91
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:27,240
on for example there is the vision that
ipv6

92
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,330
and able to teach coffee maker and
church to be online

93
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,919
so smart living is a new I'm idea

94
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,758
where Joe home should be stuffed with
information technology

95
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:43,629
intelligent information technology so
you could use your smartphone controlled

96
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:45,960
heating at home millions too much
offense

97
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,460
and you could instruct your fridge to
automobile online because you're running

98
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:49,710
on

99
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:53,818
disciplines this this is some kind of my
solution for the people

100
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:58,029
something information technology it's
also my vision for the people

101
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:01,449
working in IT and building homes but

102
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:06,180
once again an those people designing
those products are not

103
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,330
having IT security on the mind the only
twelve possible IT security problems

104
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:17,330
which will definitely a rice when smart
living homes smart homes are built

105
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,998
I'm lost to head to talk to guys doing
research into smart me to field

106
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:25,619
intelligent smart meters I'm those are
using have a legal

107
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:28,999
the heavily relying on information
technology and

108
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:32,309
the welcome to come sit almost
completely of electrical engineers and

109
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,300
they have absolutely no idea

110
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,669
which aunty security problems put my sim
and

111
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:42,240
once again for the manufacturers of
those things security is expensive

112
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,520
to make something to chew costs money to
design secure in a sexual way costs

113
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,159
money

114
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:51,520
to make security checks cost money and
security is not sexy

115
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,039
people who are buying technological
products I T like

116
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,580
mobile phones computers or something
like that on mostly not

117
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:02,449
interested in security the engine
student at a computer look sexy

118
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:06,330
and behaves that they won't undertaken
to funny scenes with your computer or

119
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:08,878
mobile phone like taking photos taken
movies

120
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,659
be always on mine with Facebook for
spill something like that

121
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:18,119
so IT security is mainly completely
ignored in the design clothes and doing

122
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:19,680
closes off

123
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,379
Technology Information Technology um

124
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:27,499
the old Greek in saying of course hmm

125
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:31,300
maybe you know what to whom come from
long once some kind of profit

126
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,990
always want that the remember pretty
Trojans will go down

127
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,080
and she was completely ignored in this
is some kind of Chris Henderson miss you

128
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,818
call it in psychology talk

129
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:43,839
the people who always moaned about his
security ignored at one point in time

130
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:47,379
and that usually happens to me if I C
but you have to keep his security in

131
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:48,930
mind each and every meeting

132
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,939
people start leaking or me and or not
longer interested in what I say about

133
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,460
it. security

134
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,539
so I can stand there and talk to them
and to completely ignore me

135
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:01,729
because it doesn't have to be a a point
of view or down

136
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:06,039
interests especially I'm the guy sitting
the controlling and public relations and

137
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:06,619
marketing

138
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,899
definitely not in transit to listen to
an engineer

139
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:14,279
on IT security specialist because they
are completely unsexy

140
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:17,759
and they usually not wearing suits and
tights

141
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,089
ties um one honestly interesting point
is lost again from

142
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:26,300
short analyzes of stocks made and
there's one thing that is really

143
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,289
interesting about stocks not because

144
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:31,938
stocks not protect programmable logic
controllers in SoCal

145
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:35,610
shield sees which used on industrial
control systems

146
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,339
so it doesn't detect the normal average
Windows desktop PC or something

147
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:42,719
sometime SmartPhone mobile phone or
something like that by attacked

148
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,959
industrial control

149
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:48,370
systems am according to Symantec brought
from

150
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,910
a large paper on stocks not engage
abroad and the minds of this

151
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:55,279
nowhere and stocks not included the
first created

152
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,680
PLC Richard so started with the first
time

153
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,250
the root it was designed for
programmable logic controllers

154
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,709
or at least the first known rootkit
there may be others

155
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:10,120
which have never been discovered am
unfortunately those industrial control

156
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,480
systems for mehndi

157
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,339
again developed and operated by
electrical engineers who have the

158
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,430
different concept of security

159
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,870
am for the malicious software might
attack appeal sees

160
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,720
or industrial control systems the ones
who have been attacked by stocks and

161
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,120
women we used

162
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,560
am Indian uranium program especially in
the run

163
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,420
and there for people think that started
was due to attack the

164
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,759
uranium problem which was which is
running but the run

165
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:39,759
but one could use that rude crude

166
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:44,139
mmm to to attack different kind of
programmable logic controllers for

167
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:45,810
temple Houston traffic lights

168
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,990
or at airports for the on security
controls for the security

169
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:55,589
measurements them another interesting
thing that currently happened

170
00:09:55,589 --> 00:09:59,269
is that a car has been hacked by
americans accuse you resurgence

171
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:02,870
with a menu pleaded or do city mp3 CD

172
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:08,050
so the many pleaded CD and got control
of the computer

173
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,550
which is controlling the car many
control that computer in

174
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,540
you can of course also heck that current
change for example the petals fall break

175
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,800
and

176
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,120
gas or something like that to you to
change the steering wheel and

177
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,970
which is also interesting you could many
people like the car

178
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,000
and use a rootkit or something like that
to clean up after an accident so no one

179
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,339
will be aiming

180
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,660
in a forensic analyzes to find out that
that car has been hacked

181
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,129
in anatomical not on mechanical me

182
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:39,550
so a lot of you and protection act as a
committee opened up

183
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,649
and once again 96 out his jury duty

184
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:47,230
IT security doesn't play a role in the
design of the systems

185
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,550
I'm there will also be a talk on
automotive security home

186
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,529
tomorrow SMSing is tomorrow

187
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:59,699
am this the diagram chart not rated on
the IEEE

188
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:02,949
five years ago from a crippling am they
have

189
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:06,589
a diagram of intruding on which which
was shown by this

190
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:11,629
dotted line and they had have another
line of attack sophistication

191
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,889
and what I found most interesting in

192
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:18,440
the development of a tech surfaced
occasion and into the mountains

193
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,360
that a lot of attacks undone by intruder
Smith very very

194
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,560
in few knowledge about IT security and
computer systems and all

195
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,870
most the tech is on and well-educated
seconds people with a lot of

196
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,899
knowledgeable technology but most from

197
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:38,639
vulnerabilities and exploits the use by
script kiddies other people who just use

198
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,350
pre manufactured computer programs
scripts or

199
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:48,009
exploits that are available on the
Internet

200
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:51,660
I am I for example for this some zombies
pop dance

201
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,329
and distributed denial sons booknotes
containing usually thousands or even

202
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:57,139
millions

203
00:11:57,139 --> 00:12:01,529
of zombie computers computers which
under control point children whose rude

204
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:02,790
kid

205
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:07,560
and can be used to attack some boy but
they are usually used by Simon group to

206
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,480
extort companies like banks

207
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,910
so the blackmail them that the answer
should pay some money or they will shut

208
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,310
down their network

209
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:18,959
a website with distributed denial of
service from the service

210
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,259
am those botnets are usually created by
automated scanning of large nets

211
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:27,540
and networks and automated exploiting of
detected and already known

212
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,269
vulnerabilities

213
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:32,269
most of the software used by police have
a crime group that uses

214
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:35,709
vulnerabilities which around the old
they don't use

215
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:39,560
unknown 0 to explode like the guys who
developed Stuxnet

216
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,000
the union's exports which already known
and

217
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,709
sometimes there were even pensions are
available for them

218
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:51,779
I'm the main average use of computer
systems are still not aware

219
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:56,160
on many other jews often are still not
aware of but he's a cutie in 20 security

220
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,360
concepts on

221
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,769
they don't they are not interested in IT
security they of course not interested

222
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:03,610
in keeping the system up-to-date

223
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,660
um many young people who

224
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,920
I personally train an IT security were
sent to me by the company for training

225
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,209
say why should anyone to take me I'm
just an average user I don't have

226
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:18,050
anything special I don't have

227
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,860
much money on my banking accounts for no
one is interested in

228
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,019
taking me or is something else so from

229
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:30,649
unfortunately many people don't invest
time or knowledge in 20 security and

230
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:35,300
if they are we had of IT security they
often lacking the skills to secure

231
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,410
Honda systems and according to

232
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:42,269
report given to Microsoft about 40
percent of exploits

233
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:46,649
use my abilities were security patches
have been available for more than 12

234
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:47,790
months

235
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,430
all these security incidents

236
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,079
could have been prevented because the
security updates for Microsoft

237
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:58,620
already there and they have been there
for at least 12 months

238
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,160
some am forty-percent these explored a
very

239
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,959
easily to be prudent very very easily
but unfortunately

240
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:10,589
they are not present

241
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:13,769
I'm another problem which I'm very
interested in is

242
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:18,189
since I studied psychology do focus a
lot on social engineering and security

243
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:19,199
women's

244
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,430
and social engineering is in IT security

245
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:26,600
technique or technology to circumvent
security mechanisms by misusing human

246
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,970
behavior

247
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,180
one could say that a social engineers
taking people instead of checking

248
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,509
computers

249
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:35,810
or to sum it up in

250
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,970
some salt and why should I tricky DC
must've looked past me if I can talk to

251
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,399
use into revealing his password

252
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,889
and that social engineering um is now

253
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:49,639
combined with technological was gripped
attacks for something

254
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,009
you can use automatic scripts and
programs

255
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:56,189
to create enhanced spear phishing
attacks

256
00:14:56,189 --> 00:14:59,889
to collect data password to install
moments from a chance

257
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:04,290
for example you can on check social
networks for the name a friend's

258
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:07,529
often intended to the target to see for
example

259
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:10,970
who went to school with room and then
you can forge that identity

260
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,420
from former school comrade often
intended tyrant

261
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,810
and features identity and send mail will
Trojan horses or something like that

262
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,689
under that fake identity

263
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:25,009
and the possibility that the attack will
be successful is

264
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:28,620
much higher if you use such social
engineering and Hans

265
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,649
spear fishing methods and ten to fifteen
years ago when I

266
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:37,449
first did social engineering you had to
do a lot of research had

267
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:41,370
to work not to find information and
facts about people for example with whom

268
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,089
they went to school or

269
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:46,629
which other managers Laden or something
like that or am

270
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:50,439
which football club they are a fan of
known as you only have to go to Facebook

271
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:53,839
you find all the daughter their online
they are presenting and

272
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,990
the daughter to you and you can use them
and you can

273
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,380
do the research within a single hour
maybe even less

274
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,860
and what is another interesting you can
do this automatically

275
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,340
the astronauts the way to be which
harvest for example Facebook to collect

276
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,350
those tonton

277
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,510
and those standards and used to me great
spew phishing emails

278
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,870
and those emails a very very successful

279
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:20,250
have a much higher success rate than the
standard

280
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:25,100
a Nigerian scam email where people are
try to send money to Nigeria

281
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,450
on other African state so and this is
one of the

282
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,540
most interesting and most people me a
technique tunes

283
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:37,420
for the next yes I would say I'm
especially with

284
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,490
the combination of smart mobile phones
for people

285
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,000
telling directly whether crudely on

286
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,930
whether currently walking around his
location based services and such

287
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:51,800
and combined those starter from the
mobile phones with the data from

288
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,190
Facebook you can do a lot of

289
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:59,050
interesting social engineering things
yeah

290
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:02,690
I'm the wrist another point that came to
me

291
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,960
being a psychologist by training I'm

292
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,860
I think of IT security is not just the
technological problem

293
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,050
and psychology would say it's
multifactorial so you have multi demands

294
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,169
on the defectors of IT security

295
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,730
unfortunately most IT security
professionals

296
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:24,960
specialist just seeing of IT security
yes the technical technological problem

297
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:30,260
but IT security also has besides
technological to mention

298
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,410
a psychological dimension the social
dimension

299
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:37,490
the political dimension and of course
legal dimension I would like to give

300
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,790
some point

301
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:42,399
did I mention for the slides am

302
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,320
IT security has in my opinion to extend
its limitations to technology IT

303
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,770
security professionals

304
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:52,030
should call parade with for example
psychology social sciences education

305
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,060
signs

306
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,200
deduct X adult education law politics

307
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,180
and I would like to show why and how um

308
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,740
the human factors are also very
interesting when one speaks of IT

309
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,730
security or security in general

310
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,820
I'm human factors research as a branch

311
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,050
of psychology especially industrial
engineering psychology at least in the

312
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:14,899
german-speaking

313
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,970
the country's and human factors is

314
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,490
interested in working on man-machine
interaction for example

315
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,700
there is research project on Mon at my
university

316
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,010
on the pop into flood of complaints and
electronic assistance and toss

317
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:32,500
so is it a good idea by some a common
infections too

318
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,130
and develop electronic assistance and
give a lot of information to you

319
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,230
I'm still able to cope with that
information all my

320
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:43,180
information create some kind of denial
of service in your computer

321
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:47,760
duties and shot on your brains week on
steal the car anymore

322
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,090
am machine injection does not limited to

323
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:54,459
poppin scars and airplanes and also

324
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,620
applies to interaction between users and
computers

325
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,420
uses an operating systems and and
operating system

326
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,730
that is not usable that has poor
usability is usually an operating system

327
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,580
with a lot

328
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:12,290
of security flaws because and many users
will not be able to to get along with

329
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,740
that computer system will

330
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,610
make security fields make install
security problems

331
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:22,300
I'm another point for human factors a
psychology in general is

332
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,110
security weapons and capacity-building
the main questions

333
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:29,740
questions or problems are usually focus
when doing

334
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,870
security whens campaigns and companies
how'd we motivate people to get

335
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,670
interested in IT security

336
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,560
this is really huge problem standing in
front of the name saying

337
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:43,159
IT security is a big problem usually
doesn't work you have to find other ways

338
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,450
to motivate them

339
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,810
and to get them to get them interested
in IT security

340
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:52,010
like already said most people say I'm
not an interesting target I don't have

341
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,090
any money I don't have

342
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:58,820
security all specials but without on my
computer something like that I'm just an

343
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,429
average

344
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,610
John Doe why should I be attacked by
some

345
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:06,570
and them there has to be much more
research in in motivational and

346
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,179
educational psychology on how

347
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:12,950
tomb get to those people on how to get
those people interested in IT security

348
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,480
and once I got them interested in IT
security

349
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,870
how do I train and educate people and
that how do I change people to install

350
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:21,490
pensions

351
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,810
installing pensions is somewhat easy for
30 June

352
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:29,870
its somewhat easy to to to explain and
educate people installing patches spot

353
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,390
on

354
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,910
much more complex security missions for
temple trip to Hershey

355
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,560
I started to give talks on trip Tom
Murphy fifteen years ago

356
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,960
and it isn't really big problem to get
people

357
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,180
to know how to use for example pgp to
intrude males

358
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:48,770
and I've been in a peace deal available
from Houston I have tried to train at

359
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,960
bees the developers to use pgp which

360
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,010
I completely failed I only got two other
guys to use pgp and those guys are

361
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:57,700
developing

362
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,780
operating systems and the armed able to
get along with PGP you are not

363
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,570
interested in

364
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,379
so how do you want an average computer
users and then

365
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:10,430
and the company to be well IT security
and to be interested in IT security and

366
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,980
how do you want to educate and train
them

367
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,110
another problem I'm I'm focusing on
social engineering

368
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,400
um social engineering if you want to
prevent social engineering

369
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,180
you have a social problem and social
problems can only be solved by social

370
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:25,860
solutions

371
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:29,830
you cannot solve social problems by
technical solutions

372
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,460
so if you want to do something and
social engineering you have to use

373
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,280
psychology

374
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,610
and other sources social sciences
somebody cations

375
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:40,650
on and unfortunately the research in
social engineering

376
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:44,090
on a professional university level is
not that high

377
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:48,500
I broke my bachelor thesis on the
problem on measuring IT security and

378
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,990
on on how to develop condoms to social
engineering

379
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:56,140
and I really had to run around and ask
professes failing to supervise my fuses

380
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,130
because

381
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,680
when globe psychology or didactics
professors have the I would

382
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,480
white would like to write about IT
security information technology

383
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,800
the main we certainly got computers I
don't have any clue about them please go

384
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,060
to another going

385
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:13,700
cell there is a problem that that
psychology or social science do not

386
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,500
cooperate with technology that well

387
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,110
most people who interested in technology
study technological

388
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:23,540
cause like in the computer science
informatics electrical engineering such

389
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:27,780
and those who aren't interested in
technology usually take something else

390
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,770
like solutions

391
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:33,490
and with very hard to get those two
kinds of people to work together

392
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,910
and unfortunately they do have to work
together if they want to solve

393
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,960
if we want to solve security problems

394
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,390
so to sum it up there is a lot to do
let's get it on let's do something

395
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:50,040
am now all some problems all things that
could be enhanced

396
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,920
for the manufacturers software um
manufacturers of software have to deal

397
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,500
with security problems

398
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,880
one good example is Microsoft only
stayed

399
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,050
evolved lot during the last ten to
fifteen years fifteen years ago

400
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,300
%uh they were not interested in security
problems if you think of the user

401
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,450
management of Windows 95 Windows 98

402
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:14,390
it still sends shivers down my spine
that those computers when the Internet

403
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:18,940
the days back them unfortunately
Microsoft has evolved a lot has changed

404
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,080
a lot of politics and policy

405
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,449
within the company and they develop in
Rolla pensions

406
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:27,740
they established that patch to stand
firm imprudently

407
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,730
am to get in contact with the huge
resurgence with white had taken

408
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,830
am they work together was people
reporting security holes and flows

409
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,870
um Apple for example now has some

410
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,050
Sudan whitehat hacking who reported
security

411
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:45,669
problems and operating system and is in
my opinion not the way to treat

412
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:48,790
security experts point companies saw

413
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:52,260
manufactures a software have to be to
web security matters and they have to

414
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,160
establish

415
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,180
a strategy management method to to cope
with that

416
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:01,260
problems

417
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,560
arm another dimension I mentioned as
politics and law

418
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:07,830
of course these views on them into
germany by

419
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,060
it is very hard for me to understand
German also I'm

420
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,290
absolutely not be able to understand
american ring usual french laws

421
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:17,310
soil megan's little bit to Germany

422
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:21,560
am in Germany we do have a concept of
product liability by the manufacturer so

423
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,110
if you manufacturing any goods

424
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:27,380
you are liable and responsible for the
security and safety of the product

425
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:31,090
you cannot sell a computer which got
some fire when you turn it

426
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:34,699
on if that happens you're required to

427
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,980
to repair machine and you also forced by

428
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,930
the courts to pay some money for people
who have

429
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:46,810
been threatened by John products another
concept is that abuse liability by the

430
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,810
user so

431
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:51,260
and as the user of a technical systems
you also

432
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:56,260
responsible and liable for the safety of
that system for champion

433
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:01,220
and you are responsible and liable for
the security and safety of

434
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,260
a car when you're running around wasn't
so if you're driving a car with the

435
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,830
brakes on it working

436
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:10,270
you responsible completely if anything
happens no insurance yours will pay for

437
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,139
the exit and

438
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,930
if you drive the car which broken breaks

439
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,750
unfortunately the court in Germany have
need and some decisions

440
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:22,430
that the users in Germany I'm normally
not responsible or liable for the

441
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,540
technical security of the computers

442
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:29,220
because to called the dungeons IT
security isn't too complex and too

443
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,840
complicated topic

444
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,890
we cannot force is used to be
responsible for the security because

445
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:39,470
a they would be forced to learn a lot of
things and we can't refuse to do so

446
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:44,120
soul a many the judges ruled but those
people are not liable

447
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,290
for security problems for example they
were

448
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:50,800
decisions made by courts of people's
whose computer have been turned into

449
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,390
zombies

450
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:54,760
and Houston botnet attacks and the
victims of the pot next

451
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,960
botnet attacks and issued the owns

452
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:02,790
of the zombies and they wanted of course
some money from them or at least that

453
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,909
the the judges say that those people are
responsible for the problem in should

454
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:12,210
fixing computers but unfortunately the
judges were not willing to do so

455
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,660
I am in my opinion this should be
changed I'm not am

456
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:19,220
more you're more explode and I'm also
not that much into politics in Germany

457
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:19,880
but

458
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,370
arm we could at least try to to start a
discussion in the media room politics

459
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:29,100
that people should be liable for the
security and safety of their computers

460
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,820
and in my opinion the manufacturers of
software should also be responsible and

461
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,990
liable for the products

462
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:38,660
and my opinion is completely
unacceptable that big companies like

463
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,830
Google Microsoft Apple so on

464
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:44,669
a producing operating system with
security problems and security holes and

465
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,640
not react on it

466
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,720
I can be clear to me that you can never
that you never can get one hundred

467
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,440
percent of security or

468
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,180
on a technical system but at least the
manufactures have to establish some kind

469
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,920
of management strategy or at least the
strategy on handling

470
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,480
the security problems and if they don't
and willing to do so

471
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,650
they should be forced by the law but
politics to

472
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:09,950
to implement and this does not only has
to be done by

473
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:13,270
establishing a new a new long but for
example

474
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:17,080
government or offices could decide to
not use

475
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,750
software produced by manufacturers who
are not willing to invest in security

476
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,050
and safety

477
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:26,780
others one example some years ago and
baton of Munich decided to switch to

478
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,379
Linux

479
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:31,240
on the complete on management and two or
three days later Steve

480
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,760
form of love has flown directly to
Munich to talk to

481
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,120
the city management that they might
change their decision so

482
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,370
once the tournament going on something
switching to the next the

483
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:46,750
Steve Balmer came directly to Germany to
do some spinning

484
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:51,350
public relations on so it works and
might for example works if

485
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:54,400
for example the German armed forces say
we are not willing to buy my personal

486
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,140
computer

487
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,480
operating systems anymore because in
securing and

488
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,130
that would happen in my opinion why
would say that steeple Mon

489
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:06,480
or another manager would come at once to
Germany to

490
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,900
try to prevent the German armed forces
for doing so from doing so

491
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,350
yeah politics security politics or

492
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,910
security policy is in essence of every
government and the discussion

493
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:23,110
war and peace is of course something
that is usually done by security

494
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,980
politicians

495
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:28,150
bye bye governmental states of the
United Nations armed forces

496
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:33,429
so arm each government is responsible
for setting a police forces firefighters

497
00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:36,130
hospitals armed forces and so on to
protect the sit-ins

498
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:40,660
citizens and the Internet is now being
discussed but politicians

499
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:44,290
mostly in very strange me so currently
there is a debate

500
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:48,840
on the remote forensic tool German law
enforcement community

501
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,560
they've developed some kind of the nose
mood can't to spy on

502
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,740
from YouTube's in and unique

503
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,150
and one of the tribute to spend all that
there might be something wrong with his

504
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:02,340
computer turned it into the case
computer clock in Berlin

505
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,900
and term for weeks ago the case Computer
Club published together was a big

506
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,190
German news-journal 10 pages

507
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:13,700
analyzes of that remote for in Dec 29 to
call it in

508
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,190
the politics and now there is a big
discussion going on if the

509
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:21,360
politics the policies I'm the law
enforcement community if they should be

510
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,890
allowed to develop such huge

511
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:26,090
such good kids and deploy them in the
wind

512
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,800
especially since the security of
magnitude

513
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,640
is very very limited has a lot of
security falls

514
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,900
of consumption could has ministry to the

515
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,010
rights who joins on the computer and

516
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:44,800
the developer of the dream could use to
hardcoded password for this

517
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,380
for the communication between the
command and control server and

518
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:53,679
the router should and that password
percent can text over the network

519
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,220
so if you if you just catch-all

520
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:00,620
eavesdrop on the password you can to
control over any of that federal

521
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,120
children holes

522
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,300
and the password for that Trojan horse

523
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,250
is in every case the same it is r2 d2
c3po

524
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:15,460
some there is even some kind GM and the
German please available

525
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,380
arm I don't know if the no-nonsense is
completely legal in English but if you

526
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:19,940
read

527
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,510
if you are able to read German go into
the fund for 20 minutes I think they

528
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:27,129
have a lot of articles missing

529
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:30,510
arm yeah you should also talked to
poland

530
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:33,530
politicians you should trying to educate
them

531
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:37,530
you can avoid holding for them to
confound

532
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:41,320
upon a new political party arm

533
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,520
the German pirate party on the plane
plenty of people in

534
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:49,010
no is with all 15 pirates a member of
the berlin poignant

535
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:53,060
because the people are when the the to
be cool the old

536
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:56,970
parties are discussing Internet and
computer games and

537
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:02,410
it. problems topics and in a very
strangely and polls in voted completely

538
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:02,890
full

539
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:06,490
pirate party in provincial all 15
members of

540
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:10,540
or fifteen people who'd been 15
available to be elected

541
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:14,590
when elected into the burn in Parliament
and now each and every single political

542
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:18,760
party in germany has and again on IT
security computer games and so on

543
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,429
because they are frightened by this
development of course

544
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:26,500
arm another single politics good to

545
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,860
if the manufacturers have suffered on
Campbell security the government could

546
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,640
force him by

547
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,380
law by avoiding buying their problems
much uncertainty

548
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,130
slide

549
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:43,170
I'm yeah not only thing the nation's
shouldn't

550
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:46,450
work on on cyber security IT security
but also

551
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,929
the United Nations governments in
countries should cooperate in fighting

552
00:31:49,929 --> 00:31:51,250
cybercrime

553
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:55,230
and soul if you sign a crime someone is
doing so I'm a crime from Russian on a

554
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,440
German computer

555
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,440
of course the German police cannot

556
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,360
the fight against those russians because
they are working in a different country

557
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,540
and they are not

558
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:08,340
germans doing any crime sold the
governments in countries should

559
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,050
cooperate in fighting cybercrime

560
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,649
are all really corporations for example
in fighting terrorism

561
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:16,960
hiding text laundry or something like
that money laundering

562
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,370
and and and tax crimes and should be
extended to IT security and IT problems

563
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,340
and cybercrime

564
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,770
many countries on what the way of
cybercrime

565
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:31,920
I did some research on the situation and
clean white Russia and Russian

566
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,480
and unfortunately most of the Russian
police forces

567
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,010
are not without the time chronic since
and if they are when they don't have the

568
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,460
technology they don't have the time and
money to buy

569
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,240
am computers for forensic tools
something like that and they don't have

570
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:46,960
the knowledge

571
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,250
solo the police forces of States rooftop
don't have that knowledge could be

572
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:52,970
trained by

573
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:57,190
other police forces as we offer example
it wrong he doing in Afghanistan

574
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:01,810
a lot of Afghanistan policeman offices
trained by the German police

575
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:05,820
the German Federal Police in Afghanistan
thing having training programs for those

576
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,490
policemen they could do the same

577
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,760
for example for russian policemen inside
a crime so the russians good

578
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,110
fight time tram in a more efficient way
so

579
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:19,870
maybe in in the near future the united
nations are able to shut on cyber crime

580
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:20,500
gangs

581
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,170
least those who want to come to you can
in

582
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:31,170
more sophisticated manner else holding
solvable problems

583
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,160
am like a already set according to
Microsoft forty-percent

584
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,660
exploited used moon beauties were
security pensions have been available

585
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,270
for more than 12 months

586
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:44,960
Microsoft evolved and implemented to
cyber security strategy

587
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,610
which is a very good thing think of the
times when Windows 95

588
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:52,060
was ruled on Microsoft didn't give a
fuck about

589
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:56,419
computer security but unfortunately the
Jews did not evil

590
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,410
they are not interested in not easy to
use it don't have know when and if they

591
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,710
don't have the skills to

592
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:03,770
sent to harden and secure the system's

593
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:07,370
so arm some some

594
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:10,660
Enzo ideals how the different

595
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:14,719
by means of security could work together
what they could do so

596
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,550
as a psychologist I would say psychology
is responsible for awareness from

597
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,020
training and education

598
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,590
um as far as I know on No really
scientifically based

599
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:29,169
the pre class problems available for the
training and education of

600
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:33,839
IT security skills on some hand books
available in the US

601
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,990
developed by the and honesty anthems
also

602
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:40,190
am an and manual available by the German

603
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:43,590
office for and security in information
technology

604
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:46,960
but they all morning some kind of hands
on not

605
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,409
really the scientific base with the
tactical few million swansong

606
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:55,440
when I brought my pension seasons my
professor bait me to use tools manuals

607
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,270
people 30 not scientific based

608
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:00,640
so we should do a little research on
that field

609
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,759
and there will also be a talk on human
factors research he on deep sink

610
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,720
today so if you're interested in that go
to the talk it

611
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,970
and will be very interesting I think am

612
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:18,470
the politics the politicians and
politics could make users more liable

613
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,360
for security problems and so

614
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,840
if you want to get rid of Bulls easy
solvable security problems which are

615
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,410
usually

616
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:29,660
explored by striptease we have to make
the user's line before the security and

617
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,850
safety of the optical computer systems

618
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:35,330
and this can only be done in the end by
the politics so

619
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:39,600
am at least one laws established in
Germany that every users as possible for

620
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,440
his computer

621
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,970
and people I am forced to pay money if
their computers are exploited

622
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,560
then they will definitely react because
you can get almost any German

623
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,360
to management about money arm

624
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,500
the medium can also do something about

625
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:01,050
we on this and they can cover the topic
of IT security but please do so in a

626
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,160
serious way

627
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,250
there is a lot of of of media coverage
on on the topic of IT security which is

628
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,050
not very serious sandwiches

629
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:12,420
more in the sense of oh my god we're all
going to die to morning

630
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:17,420
and the Chinese army is trying to take
in San trying to june's and you should

631
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,660
use the internet on

632
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:24,420
that's not way to discomfort problems
I'll the social science could do

633
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:27,140
something about knowledge management in
organizations

634
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:31,150
this is a big problem I usually face
been doing security runs campaigns and

635
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,960
companies and organizations inserts

636
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,140
it's a big problem too if you already
have the moment it's a big problem to

637
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,540
deployed in an organization so that
every member of this organization is

638
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,250
aware of what he's a cutie and

639
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:45,950
am has developed the required skills

640
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:50,430
and capacities to to social security
problems soul

641
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:54,339
a lot of what has to be done not many of
his work can be done

642
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:58,570
by IT security in specialists a
professional statement

643
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:02,150
technical background some has to be done
by non-technical

644
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:05,490
by people with non technical background
but in the end they all have to

645
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,030
cooperate and

646
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:11,040
I think it's its vital for forty
security that

647
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:17,970
IT security professionals cooperate with
non technological professional

648
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:21,840
saloons mmm the last night when I have
to say something about

649
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,180
am to sum it up IT security has many
dimensions

650
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:30,129
and IT security professionals and
resurgence and people who looking out

651
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:33,450
his security have to connect to the time
engine

652
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:36,910
problems can often only be solved and
some all of these dimensions

653
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:40,779
only there's only a very limited sent IT
security problems which can be solved

654
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,860
completely by

655
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,860
technological met in small pensions or
something so

656
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:50,220
most problems you extend to multiple
dimensions

657
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,460
20 security and another thing IT
security is not stated

658
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:58,090
study it's an evolving process it's the
pros and cons

659
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:01,250
means management so for example on

660
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:05,830
economy on management professionals can
also teach us something about it.

661
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:06,600
security

662
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,480
the can teach us on how to manage to
choose how to manage organizations to be

663
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,350
up to date with a knowledgeable
something like that
