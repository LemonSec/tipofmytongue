1
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,330
basically what we're going to be talking
today he Res

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,580
see how SEP East

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,670
resistant to all which can often talks
to me and i actually to SAP Web

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,490
applications

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,770
on what companies can do to prevent what
I can promise is up

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,230
we're going to be trying to avoid and
very borrowing

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,950
long to your ego let talk with into
liking we have like seven like the most

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,019
of attacks to S&P will obligations so i
hope u

9
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:38,019
UN should a quick introduction to a nap
cease

10
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:41,079
not is accompanied out its focus on the
security of

11
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:44,920
in P systems as mister missus with
obligations so lemme

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,030
talking about this EP but we are also
working on other EMP but tom thinks he

13
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:49,370
will

14
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,179
Oracle e-business suite PeopleSoft and
JD Edwards we're working with lust

15
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,469
companies in the sense i mean less
companies use the systems

16
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:00,820
on well week up some software

17
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,940
my kids alone would be slowed on ups and
a tantalising

18
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,200
never open source tools and you can get
from a website

19
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,360
we also have one up 61 that's a
commercial tool to let it be security

20
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,049
assessment

21
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:15,439
um what we provide different kind of
services that you come

22
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,270
also finding you know once I don't want
to bore you with that air

23
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:24,119
about myself I'm the CEO of the nazis I
have this guy come from them when I V do

24
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,119
research on penetration testing fields

25
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,180
and then I started digging into the city
Ward

26
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,509
so I have been hone in trains and
presentation Singh

27
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:37,020
in some conferences a.m. I was also the
developer of the first

28
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,908
SEP on your people addition testing
framework on

29
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:44,159
also in the lead author of this article
using the publication not

30
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,460
i buy you also don't know it from a
website its it's a free publication we'd

31
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,609
with very in-depth technical security
aspects of SAP systems

32
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:56,439
so a in this fifty minutes

33
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:59,899
we're going to be talking about very
quick introduction to this if you wore

34
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:03,450
how death threats to SAP system has been
evolving

35
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,590
over the last two years which under the
frenetic beware application servers

36
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,020
which are the threats to this
application servers are how the stuff

37
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,190
that's coming perform

38
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,380
only to know how many of you news asleep
in your company

39
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,920
hop on pretty much am

40
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,130
fighting you'll get quite interested in

41
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,380
in some of the things that we're talking
about for their was out

42
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,010
a hundred races and their hands and
basically SEP

43
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,500
East largest provider of business
management solutions in the work

44
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,500
these are just some of their numbers

45
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,880
they hire more than 140,000 S&P
implementations around the globe

46
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,070
are over ninety fell from customers you
say CPR on the word on

47
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,870
the user's AP I mean this what became of
Fortune 500 companies

48
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,580
governmental entities military
organizations and the using this kind of

49
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,970
the subs not to do like

50
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,670
there not to to support the Internet the
use decision to actually run the most

51
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,160
critical business processes

52
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,560
so we are talking about financial
planning in Boise

53
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,930
selling procurement my mission to bear
on

54
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,250
everything that this the most important
information process of the company

55
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,850
it's been one long process through the
air through the system's

56
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,940
so that's why we told we set up

57
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:24,359
air decide the crown jewels of the comp
right so what we're talking about

58
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,910
East a about the security aspects of
star

59
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,260
S&P well occasions so a

60
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,700
shots for you to understand we're not
talking about it was a

61
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,360
how you deploy a home you develop your
own recipe publications and if you're

62
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,360
exposed to cross ice cream Tina
Oreskovich exxon's

63
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,800
or this kind of attacks that's going to
be going in a future talk

64
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,120
while we're talking about it is about
threats to the koran

65
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,820
and stun them with application servers
so no matter which obligation

66
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,299
custom obligation or running you may be
success tubal

67
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:00,680
to this kind of of of issues so how

68
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,270
the threats to SAP systems have been
evolving I think the main problem when

69
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:09,860
actually II did indeed take in 2007 one
of my first presentations on on SAP

70
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,610
security

71
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,290
and but then I i've been having a harder
time

72
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,849
challenging a what SEP security actually
means

73
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,560
the bowling with us in the security from
my point of view sup

74
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,120
it has been traditionally only got the
assassination of a senior team of

75
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,620
technicians do this controls

76
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,050
so if you have never held the post in
addition a few these it basically means

77
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:30,689
up

78
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:33,770
again make sure not if the user a team

79
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,948
concrete innuendo he doesn't grade but
too so there's two gunmen

80
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:41,479
right I why he gone air make ever we see
kind of fraud

81
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:44,758
so this is Mark into a matrics

82
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,039
just usually accepted excellent sheets I
use for this

83
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:52,199
are which is translated in SAP to the
section of occasional checks

84
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,969
and basically S&P securities checking
your use of medications against

85
00:04:56,969 --> 00:05:02,289
nixon she dramatics so what we see it
right now is that many organizations

86
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:03,840
have a CB secure it in place

87
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,050
so they're spending a lot of money

88
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,249
am I having a dedicated human Resources
team

89
00:05:10,249 --> 00:05:15,330
I'm I'm expenses so far licenses to to
service for Bose

90
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,960
but the main problem another that we
follow that we are facing sup

91
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,638
this is also providing a false sense of
security right because

92
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,879
companies are musher see that they have
the people they are they have the

93
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:27,659
software

94
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:33,840
so they think they're taking care of the
security of the S&P systems

95
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,499
I'm them but nothing to highlight is up
what this kind of Congress unnecessary

96
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:41,960
they are not enough right so if you
think about

97
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,318
an SAP system like a layer psych here in
the ride

98
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:48,729
what you have in a broken system a
database what we call the business

99
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:49,930
runtime:

100
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,479
on the business logic layer the
segregation of you did confront

101
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:56,539
is only applied to the Slayer

102
00:05:56,539 --> 00:06:01,009
however while we detect eased up this
layer this usually gone and we were

103
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:02,639
basically you're

104
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,169
is prone to sick just any other piece of
software is prone to security

105
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:07,370
vulnerabilities

106
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,629
that EP get exploit will provide

107
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:14,629
air another cox's to to perform to
release use a back seat to business

108
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:16,590
information

109
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:21,249
I'm if you stop to think in for a minute
for someone to exploit the syndication a

110
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:23,020
few display elation

111
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,878
he would first two you will first need
to hop a user account in the system

112
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,370
right so you need to have a malicious
employees are you sir

113
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,620
not suddenly discovered that he has more
of a patient

114
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,069
but he should hop a he can perform
certain activities that he should not be

115
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:38,139
able to do

116
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:42,800
however by exploiting one every dis in
the lower layers

117
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,529
death second doesn't even me the user
account in the system

118
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:50,129
in many cases baby many different
installations of SEP

119
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:53,029
and I think I just by knowing the IP
address of this is Simone been able to

120
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:55,110
connect to settle separatist other

121
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:00,389
usually are always open a he gonna end
up compromising the system fully

122
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:05,099
right so there was a some to the was
definitely not right here

123
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:08,599
will secede not that their own thread is
slicing

124
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:12,469
this is a chart that we made about day
number of SAP security knows

125
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:18,300
release each year so in 2005 we were
talking about less than 20 security

126
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,949
notes per year

127
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:23,520
on in 2010 does something doesn't then
we

128
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,909
were almost another 900 SAP security
notes

129
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:31,740
right it had been December released over
500 to cutie notes

130
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,059
eso administrators the home very happy
Christmas

131
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:38,419
I guess a.m. I'm this year a

132
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:42,748
I think that we are ready almost all
along 700 security note

133
00:07:42,749 --> 00:07:45,819
by you cannot tell whether it's going to
be 750

134
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:51,110
or is going to be and 2000 until we get
to December and see what happens

135
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:56,629
am so is obviously the larger number of
security notes that a number of known

136
00:07:56,629 --> 00:07:57,949
vulnerabilities

137
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:02,379
on in some way he did the more EC will
be from Tiger to reverse

138
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:05,819
any of these patches unexploded some of
these when abilities

139
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,589
this one also the main problems ASAP
loves games up customers do not

140
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:13,039
apply patches very promptly

141
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:18,479
so I i'm often ask whether seabees doing
about all these threats our staff

142
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,729
while air a cup been working with SAP

143
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:25,438
a.m. reporting to Qt Mobility since 2006

144
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,139
I think if AA made the first
presentation on on SMB security attacks

145
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:32,490
or threats in like %uh I'm sometime in
2007

146
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,490
on I can really see that they're moving
to to live up to this new reality

147
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,850
and Mike then it was quite a a bit of a
surprise for them

148
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:44,860
but now things are getting better and
you can see that in each new release

149
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,030
the price up many customers are still
using on releases

150
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,030
and it's not really not easy to upgrade
to any real its

151
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,980
so thats wat many customers are at risk
at this point

152
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:02,040
so let's get into their the car the
subject

153
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,709
and mister talking about the difference
in the web application servers

154
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:11,490
so their I mean once you get used to I'm
S&P acronym

155
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,770
or name or solution as it is going to
change it

156
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:18,880
yet so don't put too much effort into
remembering names or anything

157
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,530
the first one the first S&P web
application server K

158
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:27,010
released by AICPA is there internet
Transaction Server the 80 S

159
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,740
so it was freezing 1996 on it's
basically me the work great too

160
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,060
I I'm not sure if it's very clear but
you can see it here

161
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,110
basically the you suck on its to a
conference call that negated

162
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,260
at the same like any subject for they're
running on a web server like Apache RIAs

163
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,439
the server translate its sorry this this
a few tourists sensed it

164
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,820
there traffic to another company that is
called the I gates

165
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,780
I'm this sentenced to death in the
system so basically 80 s

166
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:00,270
its translating between HTML Bay she's
or HTTP traffic

167
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:04,870
to SEP traffic on patients right so it's
its like a commercial and isolation

168
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,460
system

169
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,140
sadat was the first approach the second
approach will stay

170
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,319
I see I'm on a single solution know what
Sarah said i cm

171
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,560
is basically the pollution of the 80 S
component on

172
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:22,460
know the company itself of this EP
system has been haste to support HTTP

173
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,160
SMTP products

174
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,469
so you don't need anymore Amy the work
yeah so

175
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,500
the first thing that you should tell
your customers or think about yourself

176
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,880
is not

177
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,300
the fact that you don't need them in the
work dozen imply that you teach

178
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,590
just plug into the Internet directly yes
please for the reverse protein the meal

179
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,250
and place it in and emceed

180
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,420
otherwise few could be in in pink eye
problems

181
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:47,699
so for you we're going to get into the
air

182
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,670
deeper into these but pair had Indian
dot what you're about to see where you

183
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,550
at JCM

184
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:57,380
the Sun ICS service so he would be like
a PHP or an ASP page

185
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,030
its it will be the equivalent for that

186
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:05,560
and finally you have Enterprise Portal
interest for the lease the late this web

187
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,080
technology from S&P

188
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,480
day is not it provides a unique access
point to their organizations

189
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,680
SABR even on SAP system through the web

190
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,120
so here you can see some some examples
of how it look like

191
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,370
a.m. technically these one is running

192
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:26,030
on a is michigan is and very complex job
application running on a on its

193
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,630
S&P AG to eat E engine

194
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:33,439
a.m. any and it's basically the latest
thing that you can find

195
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,030
from my sybian regarding way lots right
so

196
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,709
IDAs i cm and the press barbell it for
customers

197
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,720
sometimes isn't be difficult to choose
what to use

198
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,370
I'm and you may find many of them
running at the same time

199
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,880
so they start going into that
exploitation of it should be well hugs

200
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,430
wanna things that we usually find when
we talk about the city when offices like

201
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,580
I'll really I I don't really care
because my as the peace only use

202
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,160
internally

203
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,219
so wide that could be true like more
than a decade ago

204
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,420
know it's very common to find SAP
systems online

205
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,900
I don't thank us know how to finding a
these are just using examples

206
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,370
a are you familiar with saddam a

207
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:21,980
me up what for further was not johnnie
specialist attention that allows you to

208
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,030
search for

209
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,120
Adams a.m. web server you can specify
like

210
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,580
like a string here on it will such for
not

211
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,680
a string in their server Heather of of
web servers connected online

212
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,740
so he you cannot see but discuss almost
like to sell some results

213
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,470
hey of on the side like 2008 if the
systems connected to the Internet

214
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,960
right also you can use some Google Docs

215
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,110
to search for SAP systems online are you
really quite surprised to see the names

216
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,010
%uh the bronze that are actually
exposing the recipe systems

217
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:58,060
to the Internet so if you think that
your SAP system is not public

218
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,460
might have less make this fear this a
quick takes

219
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,740
just to make sure it's not at least it's
not listen

220
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,410
so wat wat i say that this is a.m. in
their way SEP well

221
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:12,650
way up starter package dream if you stop
to think in

222
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:17,870
a for an extra attacker to compromise in
but can SAP system he has to reach

223
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,340
or to go through several defense lawyers
right like DNC's

224
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,310
IPS fire was whatever

225
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:28,450
I'm so it's kinda hard but changes the
privileges of

226
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,470
been hard to catch yes he's in a remote
country

227
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,000
on and for a country that it very
difficult to get him

228
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,270
and to law order

229
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,270
undercutting the republicans have much
more follow usually

230
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:44,770
sabc since I'm not a candidate
internally so they are not internal

231
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:49,670
at the McD's for us in December silicate
artists 24 ports food services

232
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:54,820
I'm that brings a lot of power to them
but there are more prone to detection

233
00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:00,320
however East I mean your SEP whereabouts
are not implemented security

234
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,750
securely you're basically having a given
that I can the best of both worlds

235
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,930
and we're going to see what's up

236
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,570
so let's talk about the attacks a I can
have divided the scene in a very

237
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,850
progressive way so we can just first
talk about week about

238
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,340
identification this is very day

239
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,530
silly or EC it is up does any web server

240
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,220
recipe also returns this summer herring
HTTP responses

241
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,400
so you gone uses information attacker

242
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:36,320
to identify a witch is dead party for
SEP with application running on that

243
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,820
I that part so in the ID ace

244
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:44,090
in the IDS is not possible because I
tony is like a feeder so you get diks

245
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:47,240
Apache Heather a but the ICAM

246
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,430
on the job I engine that is the one one
interprets portal

247
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:55,420
you get quite descriptive an extender
messages so you can we fingerprint

248
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,860
it which is application running on the
background

249
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,430
this is how you gone I mean we also
going to see how you can protect against

250
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,000
this or this information disclosure in
this kinda

251
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,760
like pop ups and soul I we lived out for
you as a reference

252
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,140
a I think you can also explore the
system's

253
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,310
you can trigger some special requests
that will %uh

254
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:24,410
you can send special request that will
trigger some maybe ever conditions or

255
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,510
he sings just us analyzing the source
code

256
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,870
for instance in the IDS if you try to
access a nonexistent service

257
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:35,510
like and when this kind of s of spare
seem dots

258
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,910
he will show what this kind of care or
love asked

259
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,430
a long scream I also if you analyze this
article some school

260
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:45,490
you can get that very except Amercian

261
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,500
right this is very useful for and a

262
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,610
for on a bus station on that I were you
yes I think you need to find out which

263
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,700
exploit

264
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,820
you're going to lunch the ACM

265
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,840
it's pretty much the same you can
trigger a.m.

266
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,720
air 40 40 40 three messages on

267
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,300
that I care I mean there's like it
disclosure of information to you can see

268
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,430
the hostname

269
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:12,550
you can see this subsystem ID that is
very useful for some fun there are talks

270
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:17,590
is this will be like the name of the
system on also the system number

271
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:21,580
important I'll it's also very easy just
right click mu source

272
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,950
on you have to accept Burcham of that
part out

273
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:31,560
runtime: and a about doing some HTML
comments

274
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,580
this is how you protect against his but

275
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,680
let's start really getting into
something more serious a more

276
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,260
interesting

277
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,350
and we're going to start talking about
the Baxter the ICAM right

278
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,570
so I tell you that when you oxidase him
you're going to get to sing

279
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:52,350
and I see if service good I'm by default
there over 1500 stunned the icy and

280
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,240
services

281
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,070
in a typical SABS EMP installation

282
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:03,210
so this would be equivalent to what I am
want to 1500 ASP or PHP bases W

283
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:06,919
are you run when you installed the
system

284
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:10,179
so each of these one would receive
barometer some would perform such

285
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:15,240
activities in the brothers right so
their injection points

286
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,859
when a dicey embassy said a request for
one of these services

287
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,579
the following procedure will take place
first of all this system would take

288
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:27,980
if it's public or private right if it's
public he will just give you the content

289
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,439
or

290
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,090
do what he needs to do I'm if it's not

291
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:35,999
if it's private sector a sandwich it
would take for certain things that

292
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:40,210
mainly doesn't that mean nothing do many
much many good to go into detail

293
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,370
but basically it with Regan
authentication mechanism

294
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,830
right so if bad day you sell them to get
successfully

295
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,499
then you would take if you if the user
honey facial

296
00:17:51,499 --> 00:17:54,929
to run that specific service I think he
house

297
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:58,230
at this service code is executed so to
be fair

298
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,309
most of the services require
authentication yes but

299
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:07,269
we will see white this gonna be so much
of a reader for an attacker

300
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:11,340
anyway fri-sun he would have a public
service be installed by default

301
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,009
s conde bodycare sorry that in for
service

302
00:18:15,009 --> 00:18:18,129
so this basically the URL dot

303
00:18:18,129 --> 00:18:21,200
and where this is published so it would
be like AP

304
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,090
not for slashed s it be slashed by next
last inform

305
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:28,209
arm with other thing to gation
december's will

306
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,499
a give you an A on XML air

307
00:18:31,499 --> 00:18:36,929
or so attorney response and wat you can
see their system ID

308
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:40,480
you gassy ended word the database Coast
the store

309
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,159
we you can see which database engine
it's the two-seam

310
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:47,620
this should be released the operating
system but it's being used

311
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,590
internal IP addresses so very useful
information from an attacker to

312
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,590
also to an advanced age

313
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,009
but let's really good have been more
seniors

314
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:03,799
so I tell you that most services require
authentication right

315
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:07,799
on I tell you that also once the user
authenticates the system with tech

316
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:12,149
if you're so funny faces to run that
service

317
00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:16,320
the problem number one that we farm is
up

318
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,830
actually authorization check usually
does not apply because

319
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,769
services are by default not assign to an
authorization rule

320
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:27,960
let's call it that way so the default
behavior is up okay

321
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,700
do not check for authentication so that
means a

322
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,360
debt that that I can we only need to use
not counting the system

323
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,159
yes dozen mother its not much how many
religious studies at hop

324
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,370
I he will be able to access the service
then she will

325
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,370
obviously be subject to Gold level
authorization checks

326
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:52,529
by police he can access the same with
any said the story with n you too

327
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:56,220
on the second while it can sound a bit
silly you will be surprised

328
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,710
on I mean we we are related to you ASAP
benders for many large companies

329
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:04,299
and you will be quite surprised to see
how common I think a training on the

330
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:06,918
premise that we deal with the phone at
least one

331
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:10,700
a see sense I continue with deformed you
sent from bustles

332
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,220
so this after the for users like sub
started the company watch sub CBSE

333
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,700
and EMSA the M and they have publicly
known

334
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:23,139
a default passwords so that I get us a
lot of chances to find one of these

335
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,860
compete you

336
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,100
on assay II the shower know that they
can also call

337
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,029
content which month dont or client is
something but yes be specific

338
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:35,429
but I mean want you want to get out of
this is up

339
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:40,200
okay another good needles indication but
there will be no authorization check

340
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,299
entirely probably that he can find you
sir

341
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:46,408
and for you sir to trigger that service

342
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:51,080
so what this tussle to be isn't that the
cost for chances of us really sensitive

343
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,299
a business functionality through the ice
incentives

344
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:58,408
and we're going to see some and they
must

345
00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:01,869
in particular you were going to talk
about once every service console

346
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:05,759
RC so there are see the RFC

347
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:09,649
es especial a broader S&P practical that
is used to call

348
00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:12,690
a financial model in cs2 call at

349
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,190
function was in remote S&P summers

350
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:19,759
so this is what we actually person did
though first production black hat on

351
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:21,210
here actually a deep sec

352
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:25,840
we presented a lot of threats to this
interface I love the waiting to I can

353
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,918
exploit weaknesses

354
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:30,149
in this interface but from an excellent
point a few

355
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:33,820
is brought up a lot our main interface
implemented this printable is not

356
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,830
usually accessible from the night right

357
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:41,309
however the Reese and I see of service
that can be used

358
00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:44,999
to perform RFC call

359
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:49,539
so if this service is in a mood but is
flow also usually easy nail

360
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:53,059
and I think it can perform RFC close to
the web additional server

361
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:56,070
just us he was sitting in the in the
local network

362
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,619
that's why I tell you about this by
adding of of like have been

363
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:04,289
be next on all but hubby 9 thing thermal
power right from a 100 point of view

364
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:07,419
I know the did this looks a bit like
ugly I

365
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:11,419
so let's go and the beating the detail
before the demo

366
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:15,499
this is a an essay you said I should be
summer

367
00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:20,340
a week I'm overly simplified version of
of an SUV summer where you hop

368
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,559
they were publication say server
interface

369
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:26,869
under sup RC in the face under braking
system right

370
00:22:26,869 --> 00:22:30,559
so from day demanded won't be used to
get access to

371
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,980
through HTTP to the web server us
received there seem to faze

372
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,529
however from the internet the RFC
connection

373
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:43,070
he's stop under fire right it only
allows web connections

374
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,289
however what that again with new these

375
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:51,210
three gir the special so our city centre
beasts but this is a nice if service

376
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,960
to call Irish Sea function models

377
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,539
and we're going to see what that
actually comey

378
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:05,539
singing to make that the for them

379
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,289
boxer first of all certainly the frozen
wastes

380
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:13,940
a about sorry what up it would be like

381
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:18,039
a very simple case of Osama best about
right

382
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:21,249
so at this is something we dislike that
their client

383
00:23:21,249 --> 00:23:26,029
that is used to connect to an SAP system
so I'm going to be

384
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:29,669
connected to the system right and going
to be i mean this

385
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:33,730
this is this will be the day the
end-user using this is 10 too great

386
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,710
vendors whatever

387
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,190
so we're going to use an exploit when
you do to

388
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,619
actually it will make this

389
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:47,279
absurd

390
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,299
and wanted to do exactly the opposite

391
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:55,730
ok and went

392
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:59,529
so what they're going to do every day
hearing to show you the exploit I'm on

393
00:23:59,529 --> 00:24:04,029
to do like black magic

394
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:07,749
basically on this this do it the smother

395
00:24:07,749 --> 00:24:12,739
but basically what he's doing is this is
that the key part

396
00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:16,409
by so it's making a so-call

397
00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:20,419
I mean you don't you I had to do it with
the like and by consequence free because

398
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:21,350
it's only bossed

399
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:24,350
I kinda do it with their like with a get
otherwise weekly

400
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:28,509
with Rosser but basically this is going
to be calling

401
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:32,600
for a a function model undersea puncture
Morgan

402
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,710
trestle call through the air where a

403
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,820
interface by we're going to see

404
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:43,918
what that means

405
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,190
so beef you see that we had a

406
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:50,749
screen here the use it is logging on
after

407
00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:54,039
we run this day

408
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:58,210
windows close right so basically that
one the biggest dream

409
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:03,070
is at looking of all day users connected
to this if the system

410
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:06,658
through the web application right so you
can imagine not

411
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:10,119
a.m. companies most of their employees'
are just

412
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:14,220
I mean at their everything work is
running SAP transaction spread

413
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,570
so and I think it could be like you
could put this in a loop

414
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:20,950
right I'm on continually lot of

415
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:24,350
every user in the company so obviously
that will

416
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:28,139
and mean some costs for organization
because

417
00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:32,480
employees will probably need to go home
so that's a very simple

418
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,230
and suffered the second one

419
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:39,909
excite ali also a bit silly is a about

420
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:44,149
a spawning through the same way right so

421
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:49,549
their I'm going to connect again to the
system

422
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:54,450
base unconnected here I'm going to use
another exploit

423
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:57,480
or another yeah so calm

424
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,600
this call arm

425
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,059
that is basically the same it's like
another failed right its

426
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:08,450
and the same attack vector like calling
unearthly fun to modern remotely

427
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:11,590
I you see that one

428
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,759
what the you share the usually getting
his insists green

429
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:18,570
a is espy messages from there I can
remotely

430
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:23,189
right this is that this %uh week screen

431
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:27,440
but I know I mean this is just

432
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:34,259
funny things are led me for the team's

433
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:38,999
the so let's get Martinez here let's use
their

434
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:44,340
so we can build a them a number three
from the web to the show

435
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:49,669
sorry

436
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:53,409
national sewn into lunch this exploit

437
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:57,350
up to so a

438
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,529
I'm I me I would in pertinent to be that
I could hear so this is

439
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:05,730
are sorry Francia so this is my username

440
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:11,519
arm this is my

441
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,269
my IP address right one dataquest 30

442
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:18,690
a glance to be on time that includes
there

443
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,950
so this is my IP address right

444
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,440
so I 13 and exploit

445
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,509
on what that I could guess is

446
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:32,809
basically and I should consider

447
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:36,700
air his side our next term right

448
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:41,080
being there

449
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,570
3 up for yes so this actually

450
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:48,418
the remote SAP system yes ok is getting
a remote shell

451
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:52,109
through s he's making a SOAP request and
getting an external shell

452
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:56,139
and explain that cinnamon but obviously
if the tiger i mean if this is not

453
00:27:56,139 --> 00:27:57,529
comfortable enough

454
00:27:57,529 --> 00:28:00,759
he can also use like something like
ninety Los on

455
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:04,190
get there am graphic I'll fine Roeser

456
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,850
do to go through their SAP system

457
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,889
remotely so he can get into

458
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:15,239
I system

459
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:20,100
use server SEP

460
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,139
I he cussed full access to this Easter

461
00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:26,580
let's say the system provides anything

462
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,460
that these on the remote sabc so that's
actually if we compromised of messages

463
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,169
such this system

464
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:37,769
through and weak I simpson's

465
00:28:37,769 --> 00:28:42,559
turn I i'm going to shine on to explain
oh yeah

466
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,379
I know that there this council member
its strange

467
00:28:46,379 --> 00:28:50,659
right so what sorry

468
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:53,909
what actually happened over there

469
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:58,249
at the Q stream I tell you we could
execute our city function months

470
00:28:58,249 --> 00:29:02,239
so what we're doing in the neck injury
the code that is basically sending eso

471
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:05,080
request to execute the function within
the discount DH

472
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:11,259
Rep right so dysfunction mother the
illegitimate use for dot is to search

473
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:12,179
for Strings

474
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:15,700
in fines I'm

475
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,259
what's really important %uh this can be
executed by the only what you certain

476
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:23,710
that is one of the best on the users
that are thought to be like

477
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:27,330
yeah I don't care about only watch in do
not have many privileges

478
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,350
by so friend of mine from

479
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:33,779
the Netherlands discover a common
section where Billy Dean there've c'mon

480
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:36,559
you

481
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,840
so actually what we're doing is okay
from the wave

482
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,999
we had three in a call to an era si
function model

483
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:47,570
dot we're in czech teen operating system
go months to get to the operating system

484
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:48,408
layer

485
00:29:48,409 --> 00:29:51,840
I'm just forbid them all proposes

486
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,049
where what we're executing yes exporting
a displayed on getting an

487
00:29:56,049 --> 00:29:59,080
next on Bach right so that's why

488
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,178
you could get Dexter but obviously

489
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:05,869
K not we require another long connection
to but it's not

490
00:30:05,869 --> 00:30:09,210
not not difficult or to find like week
fine was

491
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:12,950
but that's not really necessary right
that's just for the more effect

492
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:16,309
but lost that against mine operating
system commas

493
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:19,480
at that point we ducked kinda releases
he's already

494
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,659
therefore no matter of the system of
Google Nexus any kind of

495
00:30:22,659 --> 00:30:25,700
of the stall a and misinformation

496
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,159
right so that's what

497
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:32,230
what happened so anyway

498
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:36,299
when we do this kind of tests we usually
I mean if we go to a masher

499
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:39,658
I we show them that we could get a
common shelled

500
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:43,409
with the reverse connection with
exporting display they will look at us

501
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:47,039
say okay I have at to play golf tomorrow
and I don't care

502
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,269
really much a month what you're talking
about so

503
00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:53,700
a what we try to do all which is to show
what this actually

504
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,799
could mean to the business right so what
I'm going to do now

505
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:02,220
is through use other exploits

506
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,049
that wheeler actually a mean something

507
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:10,600
for for the business that mean close
this

508
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:16,869
am

509
00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:22,369
okay so and again I'm more than the
normal to showed here

510
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:25,830
again that's another earth she call

511
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:29,369
on they receive function more easily
using his RC with thing

512
00:31:29,369 --> 00:31:32,929
so it's basically a function models air
people

513
00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:35,940
to re and S&P tables

514
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,519
right a.m.

515
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,220
so I'm going to call these

516
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,330
on what you will seize up at the race

517
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:50,478
there interpreters these XML output

518
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:54,279
so I'm going to to send it to a fight
for us to be able to

519
00:31:54,279 --> 00:32:01,279
seed and a in a better way

520
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:08,780
okay

521
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:12,520
so that again again to go through the
web is executing

522
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,299
a financial models King retains what
he's reading this case

523
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:20,309
he's reading the day was with the credit
card transactions

524
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:24,399
of their safety system so here you have

525
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,900
lag their MasterCard their credit card
number

526
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:33,039
are on their mounts of their operation
on

527
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:37,010
you can't hear the names of the guys at
were running this transaction so

528
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:41,650
this obviously air good mean something
for the PCI

529
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:45,530
guys right and a that over there a.m.

530
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:49,010
so this is one example you can be tales
from k gotta sections

531
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,289
air another two

532
00:32:52,289 --> 00:32:57,080
examples are I'm into the ticket another
that is basically accessing another

533
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,820
table

534
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:02,090
so

535
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:06,570
we going to refresh up I in this case
when I think you can get for instance

536
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,149
this day owned a human resources payroll
information

537
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:13,929
so everything that you see here this is
like day personal number

538
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:17,150
the name of the employee there

539
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:20,700
and birth date were in which state he
leaves

540
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:23,940
on I don't remember clearly but one of
the others

541
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,730
1 like am sex I really shown

542
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:33,340
better this one here is on this bites
also reflect a lesion things are on sale

543
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:38,320
exxon own other sings air so let's make
a quick example let's say okay

544
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,370
Julia lights so let's go be there
personal number of Julia white

545
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:46,919
we'll execute the last

546
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:53,919
explode regarding days because we had to

547
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:59,789
look at up in another table I

548
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:03,700
whether they can we get is a game this
is how much

549
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:09,250
Julia y and speedier I sharon's 56,000
you're a skier

550
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:12,909
so obviously this is quite an
interesting disclosure

551
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:16,409
information what's important to also
mention it up I mean

552
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:19,649
we are using functional months that can
only not

553
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:23,239
are used to retrieve data right this
espionage only but

554
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,740
that I can also use function was to
modify data

555
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:30,070
so if he's a friend of Julia lied she
can

556
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:34,770
maybe %uh this era here and Julia will
have a great holiday Singh

557
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:40,219
thank all know whenever am so this is
complete the bossman to be done over day

558
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,629
named so its

559
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:47,379
get back to these %uh sorry had to

560
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:54,379
the sum

561
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,490
speech of day beyond words

562
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:01,840
any questions so far

563
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:08,840
I can think one question in them

564
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:19,100
what actually I A 1c to bother you say
it's like hand use a functionality

565
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:24,279
because that mmm

566
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:31,280
not all not know and they want okay

567
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,820
so

568
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:40,480
yeah actually but this RC function mind
that we have executed

569
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,670
their a over 25 fell from

570
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:48,400
RC functions unit in a summer residence
at least so you can definitely find a

571
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:48,859
lot of

572
00:35:48,859 --> 00:35:52,279
so again this is how you protect against
sees

573
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,420
this what actually that they're that the
one that we used to all

574
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,250
execute a braking system Commons has
been botched on their

575
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:02,790
some ways into how you can protect
against

576
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:07,910
some of these threats the most important
thing here is to disable

577
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:11,520
this home where she said this 22 just

578
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:18,520
close it under on their yes the media
talk finally

579
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:24,830
I want to talk about something I I
actually this calmer

580
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:29,098
and regarding the security of and the
price portals I think you'll find quite

581
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:29,750
interesting

582
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:33,630
so I tune up and the rest for her was
delayed as when technology

583
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:38,250
right from a sippy so a interest for the
supports different authentication

584
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,400
mechanisms

585
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,589
such just uses the pic I used a bus tour
client certificates

586
00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:47,049
their lawn tickets that's recipe profit
re: Camaros

587
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:51,950
and many different authentication months
a journey through the kitchen is 100 by

588
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:54,869
DJ fine jim wright know by den to press
for the soul

589
00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:57,440
what we're talking about our choice
really affecting the job I mention

590
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,010
salinas mother which kind of

591
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:03,510
air obligation run you're running on top
if it's part of a PI

592
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:08,160
so long whenever the things up

593
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,629
similar decisions already have like Web
Access Management or enterprise access

594
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,150
management solutions in place

595
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:17,530
and they want to integrate dot we'd
within the press portals

596
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:22,430
so maybe they want to use to integrate
them because they want to do seem to say

597
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:22,950
no

598
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:26,839
or maybe they want to increase the
security of the solutions by

599
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:31,220
and points south other like a two-factor
authentication on providing a successful

600
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,720
tokens biometrics or

601
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,470
things like that so these are some
examples of

602
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:40,570
at solution stuff integrate with SAP
enterprise portals

603
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:44,050
and that allow you to perform this kind
of things going on

604
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:48,900
or increase authentication procedure so

605
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,830
in order to do disintegration in order
for you to authenticating with a nurse a

606
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:53,440
token

607
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,460
on that not talking is being money they
did with the portal and grants you

608
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,550
access to portal

609
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:02,500
a should be used to such as call Heather
by Evans

610
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:06,050
logging mining not it works

611
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:10,300
like this yeah it's just for you direct
her to reference but

612
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:13,740
we're going to see 18 broccoli up

613
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:17,160
sorry for survival in men take that my
like the continent

614
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,470
okay so how this works we have

615
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:23,930
the user those going through a firewall
we have the thick

616
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:27,450
authentication proxy this too would be
like day day and the price

617
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:31,450
access monahan away rocks management
solution are you had entered by sport

618
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:36,390
like so the user since their credentials
to the authentication proxy this could

619
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,910
be you some pasta or or you could be
like the token

620
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:43,060
it could be there biometric information
anything so the proxy

621
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,369
will check in its own directory whether
this is valid or not

622
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:49,780
so if its money they will say okay

623
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:53,589
and authentication proxy week connected
enterprise portal with this

624
00:38:53,589 --> 00:38:56,740
Heather by Evan slugging Michael I'm
talkin okay

625
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:00,099
authenticated user and the rest for the
with a okay

626
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:03,450
on they use are we get his kooky that he
will use to

627
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:08,320
keep on connecting to the portal what's
the problem here

628
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,000
what if the attacker can connect
directly

629
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,420
to the Porto on on that kind of
impersonate authentication proxy

630
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,540
so let's see how

631
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:24,580
this actually looks like I think that
some of you may

632
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:30,230
already mushing with your thing to do
sorry

633
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:33,359
billion six UNM

634
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:39,960
still the first thing to do is to access
their enterprise portal system

635
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,089
this is a this is a long scream from the
front porch railing going to show you

636
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,549
that this is running

637
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:47,760
going to login ask administrator

638
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:54,760
hi have to change gave

639
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,270
so administrator is happily eating that
the system and everything works right

640
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:06,270
so let's close these to open a new one

641
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:17,940
let's also open our friend for

642
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:29,410
a bit so let's say no that air design
factor

643
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:33,100
that faces I mean he has discovered they
said be in the respondent online

644
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:37,009
out key attitudes toward she exited the
URL

645
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:40,090
arm his face is with these
authentication

646
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:43,630
their mayhem screen right so

647
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:48,170
ki will try administrator on

648
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:53,140
she will like a long shot again on me
game design work so

649
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,430
company day is a similar so

650
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:59,529
she would try myself doing this you will
try a different thing

651
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:04,810
who will use burr as anyone

652
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:09,980
everyone from the woodburner right and
ganske

653
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:14,510
am so we will September

654
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:17,620
I think it's racist intercepted a.m.

655
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:21,870
so that they can we keep coming no use
on a bus right

656
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:24,980
is a very very complex and not so pinch

657
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:28,650
a.m. so the user clicks on logon

658
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:32,630
right and the only thing that he will
have to do

659
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:37,320
East other a special Heather

660
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,870
in this case con remote user: we'd

661
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:44,900
the username she will like to be

662
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:51,900
so he sets is for work

663
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:05,610
and a.m. yet hands so

664
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:09,380
actually obviously went well I are
starting to

665
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:14,030
on a discovered this I was sweeney's
Bryson kind of excited had done it

666
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:17,500
there but it was even worse actually

667
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,970
day also I mean S&P phoning over sorry

668
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:24,400
searching for an online to see if there
was any less love nineteen or or

669
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,020
anything else I actually found that
these was

670
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,600
somehow the commended the some SAP form
on the condition

671
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,880
since 2006 basil in talking about five
years ago

672
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,560
it's a feature via it said the same
problem that it that way

673
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,680
so it's important to read the
documentation ride am

674
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,950
get him a problem here is up I mean

675
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:50,010
how you can actually have you have had
to come to measure

676
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:53,310
day the main problem are the main

677
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:56,560
way to solve these is to avoid this guy

678
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,940
connecting directly to the portal okay

679
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:04,020
so that the what he's doing at least is
impersonating

680
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,100
defecation proxy so you have to make

681
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,280
all Europe you source attackers go
through the fine one

682
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,740
I'm speak to a vindication proxy not
directly to the portal

683
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,340
that's the way into how you can protect
these II

684
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:22,570
is actually you think about this a
renting a high-profile organizations who

685
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:23,260
cop

686
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:27,490
fuck about increasing the security at
and it doesn't occasion to the system's

687
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:30,740
right on if they're failing to do that
probably there are 20

688
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:33,920
making it much worse just making it
anonymous right

689
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,130
am so it's really important to

690
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:40,690
act actually we we did an assessment of
the customer that the

691
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:44,420
implemented all these but us you
searching the first lady

692
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:47,820
quite not connected through a final day
I mean

693
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:51,770
digit the change would you sir URL's to
connect authentication proxy

694
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:54,890
but the fine one whilst will steal open
to them

695
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:59,299
for to assist in the press for directly
so that I could dance team goal

696
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:04,400
through that whole that's the thing
think the key point a.m.

697
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:11,400
yeah

698
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:18,800
yet

699
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:25,800
all

700
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:30,060
exactly that's a point that's how you
secured that you

701
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:36,700
you have to force everyone to go through
not channel exactly a

702
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:40,569
I i want to know what I would say that

703
00:44:40,569 --> 00:44:45,910
we phone cases where people were not
doing that him am

704
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:49,328
okay finally nothing to talk about

705
00:44:49,329 --> 00:44:52,510
air some possible but they somethings

706
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:56,390
a.m. I mean once I think a success to in
the press for tall

707
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:59,710
assign it a doctor can do everything you
want you can access business information

708
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:00,210
anything

709
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:03,670
on he may try also to a-arm

710
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:07,349
to list all about their to secure future
access to this system right

711
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:11,920
so well this is some background
information

712
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,380
Bob just to make the a long story short
a hook up the ASB shell

713
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,599
that bhp shall DSP Jul we

714
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:25,310
s we realize that there was no they're
amps up for touch-ups so basically

715
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:28,890
why do we need a loss a and are Shelfari

716
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:32,609
is the name of the portal applications
someplace like sinatra wire file

717
00:45:32,609 --> 00:45:37,310
on Missy how that looks like so

718
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:40,339
was at the gas fluxes he gonna go to
these

719
00:45:40,339 --> 00:45:43,700
convenient tool this call or tile

720
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:49,210
air archive deploying remover Bros his
finance

721
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:52,359
I am a blow the partnership shell

722
00:45:52,359 --> 00:45:58,220
up upload iron

723
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:02,300
then he Haas these

724
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:05,980
URL for the future axis actually come

725
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:10,270
go anything so this will be like

726
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:14,130
and partial for for enterprise portals

727
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:20,650
and mmm

728
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:24,900
okay a.m. for the docs had to reimburse
wanted to talk

729
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,760
everything the week on about attacks
were big asians

730
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,380
I just wanted to highlight to most
things the first one

731
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:35,750
East air the burbs number into docs I
know if you're familiar with the

732
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:36,840
presentation was awesome

733
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,830
it was done but have this year in US by
Russian security researcher

734
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:45,549
clicks on the Polyakov air she and
discovered not

735
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:49,830
some of their job way obligations were
prone to bear pumping up axle

736
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:53,380
let aid to make it easier if you know
the term is like they weren't

737
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:56,550
restricting day get on post methods by

738
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:59,560
you could see you should be you say had
metal

739
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:04,130
to look at what sadat arm its really am.
any

740
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:08,170
important able maybe the because he will
allow anyone to create a new threat to

741
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:08,760
you sir

742
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,690
anonymously so really critical a.m.

743
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:15,940
also something up you can take on a Web
site is

744
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:19,000
something we call in book earth summit
the two attacks

745
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,320
but I'll also allow doctors to white bus
authentication authorization checks

746
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,350
and access to sensitive functionality
you can see that in the in the paper

747
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:31,450
on one many more things are done for
company

748
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:34,540
something to waiting for barges
somethings

749
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:38,590
air gonna we cannot just make it fit
into one hour

750
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:42,770
so complexions a

751
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:45,970
actually weakness really

752
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:49,710
a.m. a lot of as if this isn't going to
be an online so if someone tell you a

753
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:50,020
lot

754
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:54,190
his as if the system selling dunno and
make another taken up

755
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:58,230
obviously this increase is a lot of the
risk because

756
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:02,330
the universe of possible attackers is
why them and the chances to catch them

757
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:05,819
quite reduced us a

758
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:09,500
told you there a many different kind of
web technologies

759
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,320
from SEP so it's really important on
their like complete a different one to

760
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:13,900
each other

761
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:17,810
the security models nothing to gauge
model Avantasia everything is different

762
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:22,299
so you have to know really well a the
specific component that you're trying to

763
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:22,840
secure

764
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,950
assert ownership is getting better in
these

765
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:30,290
their new security guys teen slut you're
distorting relating to

766
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:34,710
regular security patch days that's kind
of cool a.m.

767
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:38,150
on there are some recommendations out
organization should follow

768
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:42,080
attorney don't think so though
documented since 2006 and people are

769
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,090
still not following them

770
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:47,230
a.m. duncan et de services and directed
to Internet

771
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:50,360
attorneys use a reverse proxy or were
because if I will

772
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,760
I if I E

773
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,440
want you to date one thing ought to talk
is out remember that be

774
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,270
someone exploits a vulnerability in an
SAP Web Component

775
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:05,810
every morning I can make be able to get
full control of this ABC's tim

776
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:10,330
a nexus on the disinformation in that
system not just technical Daytona Beach

777
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:14,529
pop up a shell out of it but get access
to create update us to come into social

778
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:16,110
data to financial results

779
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:19,630
everything that store in the system a.m.

780
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:23,270
so everything that this is there the
only way to my Nash

781
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:27,740
this kind of threats and a what I think
it's me when we started with us

782
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:33,210
on this S&P research there was like some
and some people that were not very keen

783
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:33,710
on dot

784
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:36,760
on the thought he was better to keep it
quiet Bob

785
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:41,120
demanding I think that it was not a very
good position for my for

786
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:45,040
for a twenty companies users because
they didn't know the threats that they

787
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:45,730
were facing

788
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:49,640
so air what I just want to make them
know the threats are facing

789
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,819
if then businesses size up is here is
that they can take

790
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:56,470
that's perfectly fine with me but is
important for them to be aware of the

791
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:56,780
threats
