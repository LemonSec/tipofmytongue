1
00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:09,210
good morning everyone can just hear me
OK

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,610
well the to our non-skid

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:15,420
okay menus to a podium you want

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,210
around so I'm here today to talk about

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,740
identity axe more specifically for the
cause

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:29,150
like Open ID and a while so

7
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,599
if you like i remember anything from
this talk is a couple things I'm hoping

8
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:33,410
you remember

9
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,290
firstly this party cause im gonna be
talking about today actually a pretty

10
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,350
good intentions and that for most part
to do a pretty good job

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,530
dressing so much today's a

12
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,920
we are all problems with I Neng all says
he will see

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,430
most the issues I will talk about are
geared towards the implementation

14
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:58,710
and the design as opposed to the park on
himself so

15
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,610
first gonna stop by and talk about it TX
.0

16
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,710
argue quick overview what is identity
explain o.o that

17
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,710
people talk about and give you a quick
overview of

18
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,350
as a protocol dad talk about some
third-party of crying opticians that

19
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,080
you've built show you how easily can use
militias things with him

20
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:26,080
and shift gears limit quick overview

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,070
actually a case study already
compromised

22
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,780
and attacked by some design architecture
issues the wrap it up with a quick

23
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,310
summary

24
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,549
so I probably need entire forty five
minutes that I have to my apt to take

25
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:46,270
your questions after talk maybe even off
the podium we'll see how much time you

26
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:46,670
have

27
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,770
are so what is next generation identity

28
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,850
INDX Plano 2.0 which I'm sure your
printer

29
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,450
basically all this recess a poor causes
standards

30
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,380
that allows you as a user to share your
reaction

31
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,039
views with difference X and the goal is
to optimize your

32
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:12,880
re-experience are you online experience
within the context money management so

33
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,490
what is either in the FBR have

34
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,090
our own oceana by I 10 years I think we
can all agree dat

35
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,660
is a lot different things Water Action
huge contributor I inne

36
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,220
I S who we are for example I'm Cache
County that's my fish on a man that's

37
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,190
part of my identity

38
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,739
it's where we live I live in Oakland
Calif

39
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:34,900
which is having it so I only crisis at
the moment if you forgive

40
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,250
Occupy Oakland all that stuff what's
going on in states

41
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,890
as well be do professionally speaking

42
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,549
for example I am as mention amo

43
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:48,799
principal consulting with pink sec add
to our application security

44
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:52,530
integration and I leave it in the pen
test and

45
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,340
I'm also asking a few conferences I blog
on social agenda or

46
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,409
afognak sects and Jackson activists qt4

47
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:03,429
so all these contribute to my NES way

48
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,299
other things we do are things we like

49
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:10,720
at a personal level alike watching
sports

50
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,599
like Apple products like vacation in
trouble spots and I quote here

51
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:18,349
now right now but typically I but so
these are all

52
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:22,110
activities that I have a key to beat my
identity is also reputation

53
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,310
thing to say about ourselves each other
people say about us

54
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,439
and communication are you know address
the way to get hold each other i phone

55
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,609
number they saw

56
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,680
active houston we have a key to be tried
in when we talk about

57
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,769
digital identity really mean

58
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:43,219
is what we talk about is authentication
and authorization hence

59
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:47,719
that's because they've been talking
about today so what is

60
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:54,299
00 of is a permission-based

61
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,420
authorization scheme that allows one
side access your protector resources

62
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:03,069
I difference i and actually just a bit
so the of community

63
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:06,180
and the Standards Committee typically
uses the

64
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,400
Valley TN allergy to describe a typical
of what

65
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,170
I guess in the valley key can give the
valet key to valet

66
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,540
and you can have limited access to a car
for example we can open

67
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,180
the glove compartment and that the trunk
we can drive the car for X number of

68
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,000
kilometers before the engine shuts down

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,070
what about you guys but I've never had a
valid key and a

70
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,070
as I mentioned in Oakland as he saw and
I val is typically don't need to keep

71
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,930
to get your car I but that's a different
story so instead we use a

72
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,520
banking I also social network use case

73
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,460
so here we have our main actor you want
barksdale

74
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,299
not a valid he's actually gangster from
a TV show wire

75
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,630
so a Mon was apparently I G and Freddie
Mac

76
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,820
and he was a third party client
application that mean dot com

77
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,300
to access is aging Freddie Mac's on a
limited scope

78
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,540
so for example when his tax time he
wants it

79
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,520
main dock arkansas they always checking
statements makes it easier for

80
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,560
sensor giving him the 1850 max
credentials cement

81
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,740
he creates specific token very limited
scope and signs that

82
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,310
two minutes cementing use it on an
ongoing basis to access

83
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,830
is protect the resources same things
through social network

84
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:24,669
so yes a tutor and yes brewster 42
requires

85
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,670
that I'm sure so you have used in the
past two axes to retire on a limited

86
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,610
basis

87
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,380
so for example post RSSP owed post a
picture

88
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,490
again he doesn't want to give his
traditional sister party clients

89
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:41,110
should use an access token with limited
scope permission

90
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,130
to provide some context arm every of low
has

91
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:49,050
a to key actors so there's a resource
owner discuss

92
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,500
I thats I am you want to share something
waxa ka to something like that

93
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,590
and there's a Reese's consumer which is
the client now wants taxes something on

94
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,180
your behalf

95
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,610
and his research provider which is also
known as a server that contains a

96
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,630
post-tax

97
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,090
I am contact on your behalf

98
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,790
your talk is all over the place we have
Consumer Financial switch our

99
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:14,510
sort of consumer teen secret that are
used by third-party client application

100
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,789
to I think it's all to the server

101
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:23,050
we have request ok is an access token
stats ir contact: user ID password

102
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,330
and we have refresh tokens so access
openings art

103
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,550
short-lived refresh tokens are
long-lived are used to

104
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,790
refresh tax so applying to some naughty
to

105
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:38,120
typical flow we have you served as a man
to have server which is Twitter and have

106
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,380
you have a client which is pretty

107
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,500
the typical of clothes been involved
with your recent fighting for Sprint

108
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:44,990
steps

109
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,970
I'm assuming if you really want to get
under-thirty can go and do some research

110
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,080
to find all the transactions this going
on behind the scene

111
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,520
but at a high level the first thing you
do

112
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,950
as a third-party client app attention
use of the server

113
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,349
and you'd every consumer potentials
about what's that trust has been stabbed

114
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,130
list

115
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,480
you get a request request okay and the
request book is really just use for

116
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:11,160
the client to point to use it to the
proper authorization in point on the

117
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,000
server

118
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,570
we use actually authenticates provides
consent

119
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:19,430
and is redirected back to the club and
consumer

120
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:24,290
but declined an access token is given to
a consumer to consumer can use on

121
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,550
ongoing basis to access to protect the
resource answer

122
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,840
so sorry directions going on alright

123
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,530
so before we talk about the design
issues this go over a few

124
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,160
I sample third-party client applications
that

125
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,220
developed and show how easily can use
these to do some new bookings

126
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,010
and if you need the entire source code
for all these after she's never gonna

127
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,250
show you

128
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:55,250
ives you know me and I can you what
happened City

129
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:00,400
so I yes we have it nearby US ap

130
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,140
and have a prosperous for baptism shit
to the first one

131
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,640
as install their party i OS applications
that use to still

132
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,750
Lucretius so the first thing to do

133
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,630
I said appealing afferents cracks to go
to because basically go to Google's

134
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,350
website

135
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,430
and this is I this app is

136
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:23,630
both the bill before of 1.0 and 2.0 to
download it was simple touch mobile

137
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,340
application which is basically a sample
at the connects to Google Reader account

138
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,940
going to mean controller class I that
deals with all the delegation

139
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,169
all the you i've review contacts I'll
make some changes

140
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:40,409
i'm saying everyone here is 20/20 vision
soaking public read it

141
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:43,659
you can partner outcome for but

142
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:47,709
here goal is to intercept the request
for is posted

143
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:51,019
too because of it often cation in point
so

144
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:54,110
here we are within the context in my
view we not really think

145
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,519
I'm constrained by some to limitations
or

146
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,120
some constraints that a browser for
example would appliance about where

147
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,899
things are the same origin policy

148
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:07,439
so as you can see we are grabbing ish
peabody be signing to strain

149
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:11,269
entering a rave strains and hearing
through innovation the prefixes email

150
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:13,029
password

151
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:16,480
which is grabbing download it as how
easy this

152
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,110
and what we doing this the user is going
through a typical of low

153
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:23,889
on the mobile device not realizing than
the background

154
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:30,889
catching using password: so here we just
log book is easy to send it to extensor

155
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:35,449
so the problem is that's of providing
false as a security

156
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:40,160
here I am around anti authentication
authorization workflow

157
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,000
because the user is under the impression
that everything is legit and everything

158
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,769
is official

159
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:48,000
because everything's happening as from
his point of view within the context of

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,819
the Google application

161
00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:54,259
so your clients with third party what
kind application developer or just took

162
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:55,550
to adjusted

163
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,670
so make sure you manage your
authentication authorization workflow

164
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:03,959
outside your optician and within for
third-party

165
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:07,459
addition expiry your user don't trust
applications that

166
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:11,819
to adjusted and someone is issues are
the result of

167
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:15,120
lack of proper trust management in the
client and server

168
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,129
I will talk about later today when you
talk about

169
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:22,649
Consumer Commission's so this is a third
party

170
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:26,629
I browser-based Facebook application I
am

171
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:30,540
have used to do some social engineering
basically uses act together some

172
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,170
sensitive information

173
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:36,870
about a user that we can use to
launching an attack

174
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,709
so I I speak talk

175
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:44,899
to the first thing you do we all miss
any to make sure that the user can

176
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:48,310
I axis application anyone persuade the
user to

177
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,420
go and install it or nine stone actually
use it

178
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,569
so this case sensitive I am

179
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:57,800
targeting user manual use or changing
tool kit which sparked minutes for

180
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,720
framework

181
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,930
to basically launcher to go fishing
attack obvious send a link to the user

182
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:06,199
our app which is writable fortune is a
fortune-telling application

183
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:09,819
tells people's fortunes and is hosted on
a proper

184
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:12,839
demand after facing dot com launch

185
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,930
I'll this towards a target and target
once

186
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:20,769
day open up the application click on the
link to see a typical

187
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:25,329
Facebook permission pitched which I'm
sure we have all seen this

188
00:11:25,329 --> 00:11:28,529
so this week is telling you use a lot of
things but is also trying to use ahead

189
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:30,300
mister pork loin application

190
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,899
once to access your inbox messages so
you think that

191
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:38,899
most users not going to allow some
random third party planning application

192
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:42,389
accessing much messages but to our
surprise we actually ran campaign

193
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:45,430
this was part of a fishing camping this
menu her

194
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,259
users have no problem with its so

195
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:52,930
I so that's an issue so what's the click
on it

196
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:56,699
I we're on our first according to rich
which is basically

197
00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:00,550
simple it's like you out to read all the
inbox messages

198
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:04,029
and this can access to all the messages

199
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:07,660
so we could stop there but I am

200
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,170
we see one message interests where the
users talking about the banking

201
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,360
preference

202
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,180
against the sample applications that
snow reopen said

203
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,740
to use that message to many uses talking
about the back preference to tell the

204
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,839
Fortune so this is again the social
engineer optician so we

205
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,579
stabbing truss and building two tracks a
user can click on it

206
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:31,529
and executing which will carry our next
attack which the Chrysler persuasion

207
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:32,490
attack

208
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,149
basically executing Ajax postscript to
transfer some funds from one account to

209
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:37,889
another

210
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:41,509
again as I mentions the sample app
community some sanctions

211
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:46,110
thats the user or the the host doesn't
have any ceaser protection

212
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,499
and is a licensed going on between you
send it back insects

213
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:53,290
but the issued every tribe point out
here is that once again

214
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:57,599
of provides the user with positive
security around the entire of dentition

215
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,059
and opposition work love does everything
look legitimate everything look as if

216
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:02,309
this was condoned by

217
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:06,540
Facebook I maybe you and I mean that we
realize that but I think a typical user

218
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,110
will help our

219
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:12,629
that

220
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:16,639
I really like to know why Facebook ever
allow some ran third-party client

221
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,079
application to access my inbox

222
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,079
messages that's like giving an
application access for you know

223
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:24,290
pensioners business reason for

224
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,389
all right now let's talk about some I
design issues

225
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:32,040
with the some typical of implantations

226
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,540
you might seem that I'm picking on
Twitter the intersection maybe Yahoo in

227
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,860
the next section but actually not doing
that

228
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,540
I based on my experience low developers
use Twitter Facebook Google or

229
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,219
sample applications as a blueprint to
build their own apso these issues are

230
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,559
pretty much coming across

231
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:50,969
for so this is a very basic session
management flaw

232
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,220
I as recalling the use case we show your
earlier

233
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,079
I am the user uses a third party client
application

234
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,970
Twitter feed to post an RSS feed so uses

235
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,180
Twitter as a publisher to clicks on
Twitter

236
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,559
gets redirected to the tweeters
opposition in point

237
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,899
within the context of to defeat provide
season in password

238
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:17,180
and post RSSP goes back in a Twitter
feed

239
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,420
signs out and walks away

240
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,790
not realizing that in the background
actually headed to recession open

241
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,709
so again maybe you and I realize this
and go on fire for browser open tap

242
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:32,930
between Dakar logged out but to

243
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,790
typical user pie when do that because
nothing happened

244
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,740
at no point to use actually went to put
a dot com everything happen within the

245
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,819
context

246
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:45,329
of 22 fwy and within context of law

247
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:48,430
so the thread is elevated when

248
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:53,439
user for example student uses computers
in various places like a clapper

249
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:58,389
library a dormitory and he could barely
hear it with a session hope and

250
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:02,029
on every computer he touches that uses a
third party who are

251
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:05,839
your body to react ish same I think that
will

252
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,769
what's the big deal might for a guy gets
hacked me not talking about

253
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:13,779
says information not to commit bank
inside working single wrong actually

254
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,300
to attack attack for example I was going
to talk earlier this year

255
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,369
a wall I was giving a talk later I found
out

256
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:24,319
my trick I got hacked so this message
for POS

257
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:27,589
Expo can prevent me from ever going to
promotion

258
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:33,029
so well no one cares about me What's Up
Fox News disguise a pre-bid doin

259
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:36,759
something Party United States so what
happened with your account getting

260
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,589
hacked or the Syriac

261
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:43,639
I'll some disturbing messages about
President Obama so

262
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:48,769
public art these all impact could impact
the user individual

263
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:51,800
at a Grand Am I celebrities

264
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,379
I just love it is live and die by the
tutor I

265
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:59,329
tweets it must be that you're something
so we saw happen with Britney Spears

266
00:15:59,329 --> 00:15:59,959
account

267
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,269
I get hacked antis definitely

268
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:06,459
impact someone's self-esteem appearance

269
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:10,079
and shortly after this man from this to
this

270
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,470
mad at this and this is just not that so
it could impact you

271
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,389
if you to recap sac so the solution
space 24

272
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:22,360
and use cases where the user was not re:
logging

273
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,269
to a server account but I release that
their party

274
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:29,290
client application answer session is to
be invalidated

275
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,899
so if I'm not already logged in to
Twitter rallied to defeat

276
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:36,839
dan Graham don't repeat that it Twitter
accounts to be

277
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:40,689
or to decisions to be invalidated and
some implementation is actually a pretty

278
00:16:40,689 --> 00:16:42,790
good job is for example when you leave

279
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:47,939
I believe on Flickr beginning option to
kill your ya session back

280
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:54,939
so this should be the norm not exception

281
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,309
passwords are about you guys but

282
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:02,850
me when I change my password are hoping
that it will pass we cannot be used in

283
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,250
any ship before

284
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,319
directly or indirectly and that's fine
with Twitter if you change a password

285
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,329
I cannot go back to the main Twitter
page and

286
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:16,339
taking a pass when getting right but you
still have

287
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:19,708
all these access tokens thats within the
context

288
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:23,660
I'll of the really act as a password for
third-party client application to access

289
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,010
to content on server

290
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,930
sinister the Zacks ok is regretted using
your password

291
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:33,290
and is still valid so the problem with
that is that

292
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:37,389
always acts against to access your party
and the reason is because

293
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,760
in order to invalidate this you actually
have to manually to

294
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,990
your to recount and revoke every access
token

295
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,450
one by one again something that most
users parliament do

296
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,760
when the change a password

297
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,510
what goal here is to make sure that when
you change a password

298
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,870
your access tokens or your credentials
cannot be using you

299
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,360
directly or indirectly to gain access to
your account and

300
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,700
I am on a mission or some sort of magic

301
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,220
access token we relocation is probably
the right answer

302
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,220
to Facebook actually is doing this right
now see if you change your

303
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,360
past when Facebook goes in reeboks all
your access tokens and thats

304
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,460
because side-effect of a compromise we
preach they had

305
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,830
about a year ago where daily

306
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:28,320
basically all over access tokens to
budget better qualified applications

307
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,870
so now if you change a password as a
magician ago when

308
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:36,300
remote access to so consumer credentials

309
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,159
bit mentioned briefly talked about this
earlier I pretty highly debatable topic

310
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,790
still wouldn't know of community I am

311
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,990
so first thing you do when you believe
her party of

312
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:50,370
client application going to consider
consume a keen secret in bed in your

313
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,690
application code

314
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,200
that way when you make the initial of
collagen identify yourself as a valid

315
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,440
legitimate

316
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,580
third-party Klein optician to server

317
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,129
so you better than your code and make
the call on to protecting its consumer

318
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,170
credentials

319
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,440
on the server side is pretty
straightforward you just used to secure

320
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,330
the best practices

321
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:13,720
you protectees on server but when it
comes to the

322
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,100
mobile applications or given the

323
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,800
the nature of these applications the
fact that we have a large number mobile

324
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,540
devices

325
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:26,190
each having to manage on consumer can
ensure because bit problematic

326
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:31,070
I and of I am portico and says committee

327
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,939
plugs reasons they say that one Shin
uses consumer potentials for anything

328
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,570
other than

329
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,060
statistical purposes that's fine is
probably good point but

330
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,919
sometimes don't have the luxury
princeton I had a client

331
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,320
where they had to use case when server
had to keep track of

332
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,730
the purported find applications orders
charging for JP I call

333
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,740
and you can rely on the user's identity
because the user could belong to

334
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,180
multiple clients

335
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:59,850
also maybe a server wants to keep track
of the client seeking

336
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:03,720
provision clients a provision new
clients

337
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,770
ongoing basis so if there's no trust

338
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:12,129
stabbed from the client and server the
check doing in this

339
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,560
so with of 2.0 you're actually

340
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:19,919
I have an option to ignore Consumer
Financial salts getting so there's some

341
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,040
new flows

342
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,820
are being introduced in can not use
consumer credentials with of 1.0

343
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,899
was actually mandated some
implementations act allowed you to put

344
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,880
enormous

345
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,260
answer to cancer can ensure that Google
did that so if you don't use it

346
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,650
I s fine you know trying to recive have
been compromised

347
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:41,270
by a meeting with business requirements
but if you do use it and obviously

348
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,750
you could easily take our price range
for example if you have s

349
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,930
open source application yet in bed this
consumer financial

350
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:51,540
in the code or in the resource bundle X
not hire packets fire or something like

351
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,810
that

352
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:56,060
and at the end US you can go to some
Google searches right now find budget

353
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,399
third-party

354
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,080
popular third-party of client
applications with the consumer can shows

355
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,830
in a clear & Co

356
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:09,100
despite have actually not only has and
some potential have to be a season pass

357
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,730
you do some cool things with it

358
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:17,230
a closer's class will be more involved
but outside just one being

359
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:21,030
a I'll catch in consumer credentials
again to be more involved but

360
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:25,899
at the universe can spend some time and
it's a

361
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,370
so in my opinion the biggest impact is
the whole notion 0

362
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:32,770
cue location and kill switch so

363
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:36,170
yes you consume a credentials are
compromised the servers

364
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,470
obligated to in Bali the consumer
credentials in issue

365
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,330
new ones so the client now has to go and
register at

366
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,889
did use it to consumer financial laws in
bed in the purported find applications

367
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,890
in distributed to all the users

368
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,230
by time you do that the party lost happy
customers

369
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,920
also we talked about business
requirements words server had to keep

370
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,180
track

371
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:00,410
of the client charging for JP I call or
forty provisioning

372
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:04,310
again these are the things that's I am
major business impact

373
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:07,909
if the consumer can show their
uncompromised also

374
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:11,960
as a militias competition you could go
antes

375
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,150
cut my somebody else's consumer
credentials in our music publishing

376
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:21,200
and perform at the US attack on the
service by this a couple weeks

377
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,730
just talk about alternative approach
that

378
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:28,960
deviates from a typical of low

379
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:35,960
is gonna die cast by marcia forward

380
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,460
so p.m. here we have a user and

381
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,330
view third-party client application
which is a mobile device that has an

382
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,418
associated

383
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:50,070
backing web services is meant man comes
be installed app on your eyes device and

384
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,000
as a back massager

385
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,740
so when of Los stars the user
authenticates to

386
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:59,990
manse Medoc comes back in web server
through the install app

387
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,210
using his men season and password it's a
device ID

388
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,520
to this device has new notion you
talking every introducing here

389
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,760
they want to get the device id: you
story

390
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,908
safely on your eyes keychain or you just
keep in memory dan upon

391
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:17,440
dad first request to gets your

392
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,830
hum access token we did you original
request token

393
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:24,230
you can bet that if I said yes a new
friend her or pen into an existing

394
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,240
parameter

395
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,770
when you make the call to the server
obviously minister Fergus said device

396
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:29,379
id:

397
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,529
is to make sure that's it's a legitimate
device id: soon yet

398
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:37,450
make another call to the clients back in
server to provide

399
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,669
to a client can provide authenticity of
the device id: and you perceive the rest

400
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:42,130
the flow

401
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,700
sorry adding a line you steps here which
is very expensive

402
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,860
but you don't have to do this once and
both campuses

403
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:53,899
over the server now can be sure that
this request came from a legitimate user

404
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:57,610
and from a the gym at their party
planning application not

405
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:02,529
not from the road one alright so

406
00:24:02,529 --> 00:24:07,100
we talked about of so of a seesaw I had
some issues with

407
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,340
third-party find applications in my
opinion it doesn't work

408
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,658
well the mobile device we talk about
succession pasa management issues

409
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:19,539
and we saw that most cities issues are
geared towards implementation not for a

410
00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:20,020
call

411
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:23,340
but for most poor actually of is a
pretty good job at

412
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,389
defeating passport act like I don't
because without it will

413
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:30,799
sharing our credentials by two different
sites alright

414
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,600
Open ID so what is open I D

415
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,090
opportunities pretty much a
decentralized user-centric

416
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:41,149
single sign-on that helps you I

417
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:44,200
manage trust between you and if in sacks

418
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,120
an actual open ID's just you need your
item is my

419
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,740
Yahoo a p90 I am

420
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,890
so every over ninety flow has a user
that's awesome in our bras region

421
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,200
by our user agents and there's a real
I'm party

422
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,230
which is a site that requires you to
provide Open ID

423
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,299
in order to access some protected
resources on

424
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:10,210
data hosting and his identity provider
desired size like

425
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:13,419
a well ya who that amongst other things
stay

426
00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:17,210
I'll manager identity and that to hold
you and the actual

427
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:22,289
beats and his identify which is the
unique your ID used to identify yourself

428
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:24,649
so

429
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:29,409
what promises saw within the context of
this already but I think about providing

430
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:30,470
my identity

431
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,470
I think about but should be from
registration forms so

432
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:36,500
I am sometimes you

433
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,500
have to go and fill up wiser decision
forms

434
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,899
to set up a sign all you really need to
do is post a comment on a blog

435
00:25:43,899 --> 00:25:47,990
so much 52 minutes so two seconds do
that reacts min five Min S

436
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:51,630
disposers are complete a registration
form so

437
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:55,240
for some uses could be considered
painful and also

438
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:00,210
you are and verify as a user every
talking about are using the password

439
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:04,570
and I am again for me that's not an
issue but maybe for an average user

440
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:08,480
that's me for my mom it is issues and
went to check my passwords

441
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,250
and I am I talk to my life and usernames

442
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,510
I sometimes get the user names that you
only want because the user names he was

443
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,440
unavailable

444
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,679
everything happens with the silo
everything is very site centric

445
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,799
SI sinatra sharing I your react views
must each other

446
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:27,139
a sentencing issues can exist having

447
00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:31,710
user names passwords I basically speed
record century all you really are is a

448
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,149
single row in a directory

449
00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:38,200
are single directory entry I'll the
single off her team up as a result stop

450
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:38,760
portable

451
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,789
so these are some other issues using
passwords and typical digital identity

452
00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:46,350
I implementations so was it

453
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:49,539
what does it attempt to mimic I am

454
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:52,750
well I think car driver's license or

455
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:57,730
any government-issued ID we go to a
single any provider trusted online

456
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:58,770
provider light

457
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:02,240
some state or federal or

458
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,960
national government to get ninety

459
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,340
right so we when we travel I'll

460
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:13,590
we don't go every state every country W
we don't go and apply for new drivers

461
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,440
license right

462
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:18,510
so this provides consistency

463
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:23,450
so that we can use the same ID to
provider I need to get his businesses

464
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:27,000
so if you want to go to a hotel here
neck we don't have to register for you

465
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
hotel ID we just use our identity

466
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,960
I was doing twice by trusted IT has
already established relationship

467
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,649
with these businesses so that's the
that's the concept

468
00:27:38,649 --> 00:27:42,500
so what are the benefits other hand
consists consistent

469
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,100
I don't fishing or issuance process
there's a consistent verification

470
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,899
process

471
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:51,570
so I all you have to do to verify means
to make sure that the picture my ID

472
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:52,490
matches my

473
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:57,240
face and measured ID's attic that's all
you have to do

474
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,879
so what is the benefit this book forget
this guy was a benefit to Lindsay Lohan

475
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:05,530
I was kinda early for this but I'll was
the one thing that she's access to

476
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:10,678
at all times anyone

477
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,230
wuz I saw this right so she's access to
booth

478
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,909
pretty much every night when she's not
in jail

479
00:28:18,909 --> 00:28:22,070
are so instead establishing trust

480
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,980
with each liquor store in the LA metro
area when she goes for a look around him

481
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,030
Sunday night

482
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:30,629
he just uses her ID that was give it to
her

483
00:28:30,629 --> 00:28:34,059
by so City Calif

484
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:38,970
and arch the user ID to stab ashore are
providing identity departure other

485
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,100
liquor stores

486
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,309
so she doesn't have to apply and
register which liquor store with a new

487
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:44,000
ID

488
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,530
against this is a symmetric relationship
between state of California

489
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:51,370
let's look at all the liquor store so
this provides scalability

490
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:55,309
right and that's why of attempts to
mimic

491
00:28:55,309 --> 00:29:01,490
and every skillful solution usually
comes the side effect

492
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:07,389
a case

493
00:29:07,389 --> 00:29:10,419
arm but in terms of often denied any

494
00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:14,460
same thing happens you have a any
provider like Yahoo

495
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:18,460
they can use to access different sects

496
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,799
this is a simple of low so the first
thing you do

497
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:25,440
as a user you present your unique you
are a unique

498
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,409
I'm hoping I D to the consumer that's
ahold sums are content with some service

499
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:31,679
that you want access

500
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,289
and consumer directs you to the
opposition in point

501
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:38,840
on the identity provider and are you at
any Kate

502
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,480
and ninety redirected back to consumer
going to access the content

503
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,919
to that said sluggish to be redirects
going on and this is a very basic flow

504
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:50,289
there's some trust management into some
crypto going on here that

505
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:55,149
when I can talk about absolute a case
study

506
00:29:55,149 --> 00:29:59,460
so we talked about some other issues of
attempt to resolve around the complex

507
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,539
leader comes with today's

508
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:04,720
password management I and management
general

509
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,570
I'm but my pee in the Sun something
fundamentally wrong

510
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:12,110
wat I putting all your eggs in one
basket

511
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,870
so what do you do with it Open ID you
are putting all your data

512
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:20,379
behind a single door locking that door
and community to single provider

513
00:30:20,379 --> 00:30:25,250
so if you do that you have to make sure
that identity provider is somebody or

514
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,010
some things

515
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:31,250
entity they can trust with actually more
poorly you have to make sure that

516
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:36,100
its I think provided cannot be easily
hacked

517
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,760
because if to do get hacked within
especially within context

518
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,210
Open ID because impact allow users and I
could be devastating to a large

519
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:47,210
users not also on the fact that a user

520
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:51,110
could use Open ID to access the insides
could have a major impact

521
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:54,280
so for example Yahoo all you have to do

522
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,610
to build your I or selfish OPI the you
just have to go to the arms of the

523
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,200
education for get started

524
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:05,780
and that automatically turns your Yahoo
account for ya I D 2.9

525
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,080
so have a friend I who I

526
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,010
long couple years ago was a big Open ID
proponents

527
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:16,119
to talk about how great the open nine
years and can uses Yahoo OpenID account

528
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:17,399
to

529
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:21,470
access all the spec 2.0 iron sights I
decided

530
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:24,770
to spend some time Monday to cover my
eyes open

531
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:28,700
Yahoo ride it out so the goal here was
to use some

532
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,700
I design flaws in Young's pass for
management scheme

533
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:37,280
second use to compromises account
setting I research

534
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,580
are safe and now that which is linked is

535
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,809
not his password resets keep so when
they're

536
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:47,399
and I'll you know you know their new all
seen these

537
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:50,760
I get challenged with much questions the
first moments where his father was born

538
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,740
in sin he was

539
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:56,200
Venezuela never his father was born in
Venezuela after doing some research

540
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,190
I got ahead his father was born largest
fourth-largest city men's well I was

541
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,000
trying to

542
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,280
to the second question was what street
you grew up in and

543
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:10,290
I saw I didn't know Jordan when he was a
kid so I had to go do some research

544
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:13,530
in the states you have two cycles of
research we can put someone's name into

545
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,220
every dress

546
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,359
phone number that ever happens to people
finders I'll

547
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:20,580
that's it free people finder website

548
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,840
so again after some trial and error I
get an I

549
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,049
guess the right street name and I was
able to reset is using password:

550
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:33,040
after that a man access all his relying
parties

551
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,710
and not only that but yet sites like
paparazzi gmail

552
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,750
that they had dipped Password Recovery
map today

553
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:44,679
yeah we kept so you go to pick how reset
my password makes it easy on you can I

554
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:45,649
was able to

555
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:50,049
compromises accountant as well we said
change all the passwords and I thought

556
00:32:50,049 --> 00:32:52,309
was time to let him know

557
00:32:52,309 --> 00:32:55,639
site all about what I did and I

558
00:32:55,639 --> 00:32:59,389
game all this new passwords and joining
being a good

559
00:32:59,389 --> 00:33:02,629
security professional UN and did what we

560
00:33:02,629 --> 00:33:06,230
was it was would probably give so you
can change the secret questions and

561
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,809
password to something stronger

562
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:12,590
right so what is better than compromise
your friends

563
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:16,480
Yahoo OpenID I did you count once Monday

564
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,320
you twice Monday so I'm back in

565
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,750
I saw that he changed his secret
question something stronger

566
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:28,000
soap agreement with honey this is for
you

567
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,109
easy to guess on problems that he's not
married right

568
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:35,450
he was in a real-time even ever marry I
don't think anybody where a guy I'm with

569
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,399
him

570
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,429
so sign in the park with some strong ass
raises some arbitrary acetone he knows

571
00:33:40,429 --> 00:33:40,850
about

572
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:44,290
so I was about to give up until I
noticed lol mention the bottom

573
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:48,970
this is not my question where you happen
when I click on a link

574
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:52,220
actually seen this

575
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:57,220
do reverted back to the original
question

576
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:00,790
so again already had the answer

577
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,820
since I did some research on this and

578
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,020
talking about it using your password and
use it

579
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:12,030
I gotta try to get a soviet-backed and
kept he knew that I could get back to

580
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,359
the original questions

581
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,949
so we kept the original questions and
strengthen his answers

582
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:21,418
to surpass reasons that have on Valencia
for example

583
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:26,589
hoping that these new answers would
replace the original questions

584
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:30,609
but that's not the case Yahoo is one
young guys basic recent collection

585
00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:34,250
up questions answer with identical
questions

586
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:37,889
and different answers psalm with work

587
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:41,379
basically with this good always

588
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:44,790
always get back and compromise your
friends Africa

589
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:48,589
Oreo you'll have an idea tell in this
case to assist in actually work with ya

590
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:49,850
security and

591
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:53,359
to make some changes you still can't get
to this bites

592
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,420
I there's some criteria for example if
you don't use your account for a while

593
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,220
they make an assumption thats I am

594
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:04,490
I don't know your account has been
hacked issue or something like that

595
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:07,630
so under some circumstances you can
still get attacked this is now my

596
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,830
question

597
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:12,450
I link so young is doing this

598
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:16,350
because they want to provide 60
self-service password recovery scheme

599
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:20,299
for a compromise account holders

600
00:35:20,299 --> 00:35:24,009
account so basically they want you to be
able to go back to your question

601
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:28,640
if your account has been compromised by
attacking was changing questions

602
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,270
trade shows it did happen thought this
through

603
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:37,030
I second goal here is to we're trying to
point out here is that if you use in

604
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:39,280
your identity provider for yourself

605
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,799
or for your organization make sure
they're not picking a week and provider

606
00:35:44,799 --> 00:35:48,850
because if they compromise that can be
compromised at a grand scale

607
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:52,730
and also we saw my friend Jordan had
left a

608
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:55,830
children crimes with all his accounts

609
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:59,950
so having his strong authentication
scheme

610
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:03,770
gmail link to his yahoo account is just
not the right thing to do

611
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:06,950
because I could easily get to
gmail-account 30 cap so make sure you

612
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:10,500
don't miss anything

613
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,080
alright some insecurities and design
issues

614
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:21,080
with Open ID

615
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:24,880
so asking to talk are no I'll go to
conference suck my fishing with a

616
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,880
different context

617
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,119
someone yon said the a fishing this is
the whole problem

618
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:33,730
well I know I saw a problem but so is
murder doesn't mean that

619
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:37,430
you have to ignore I still applies them
you have to dress it

620
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:41,618
a fishing is still probably did biggest
issue and a high state with

621
00:36:41,619 --> 00:36:44,650
Open ID implementations

622
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:48,680
so what is the glow of a Fisher is to
access

623
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,109
some website using your credentials

624
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:55,660
so they do that by Brittany aside and
somehow

625
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:59,069
luring you in convincing you any taxes
replica

626
00:36:59,069 --> 00:37:02,690
second enter your using password: insist
they have control over their replica

627
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:06,109
outside capture and use it to this some

628
00:37:06,109 --> 00:37:09,450
I complexity in that because steny to I

629
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:12,770
you know make sure that provide
sensitive more division they would

630
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,030
access this

631
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:17,030
website Bridgestone we need to access

632
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:20,220
well let's look at a typical Open ID
Flow so

633
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,710
first you goin' is it legitimate site
right

634
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:27,440
and I'll never seen before but we
provide some interesting content you

635
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,810
want to access the sequential can I do
you know those and you clicked on

636
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:34,190
your favorite one I got and locking

637
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:38,549
injury directed of intuition in point to
provide a password and get redirect back

638
00:37:38,549 --> 00:37:42,460
consuming the now is the catfish

639
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:46,440
opening procedure well the same thing
exactly the same thing

640
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,990
exercise no longer legitimate overnight
it comes with

641
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:54,490
some awesome building vision
capabilities

642
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:58,130
for the Fisher so the biggest problem is
that

643
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:01,440
Open ID actually teaches the user to
follow

644
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,910
I link from and trusted partner in this
case would be interested party from a

645
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,540
third-party client

646
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:11,190
so all the trickery that goes into a
fishing North book value

647
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:15,010
create some motivation and convincing
you need to go access congo's

648
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:18,030
at the window you wanted need to do that

649
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:21,510
as a fisherman Open ID so for example

650
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:25,170
i feed my fish I some young account

651
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:29,160
he go and build interesting website
shows some funny pictures of cats and

652
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,020
dogs and

653
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:34,609
book by to open it you know goes on it
and one being the younger Pido go

654
00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:38,279
and create a replica a the OpenID
account

655
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,700
and basically sit back and relax into
some other requests to come in

656
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,690
I'm now I have to do is make some minor
change Iveco changes

657
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:50,670
to miss the point out to the replica
page you wanna go to

658
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:53,890
again this is a sample app to grapple
just change the

659
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:58,118
redirection for the overnight so and
then you go into so changing to kill

660
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:02,160
I build a Fitch replica I'm

661
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:08,368
I'll login page and that's how easy this

662
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:11,650
Sosa get some solutions that's I

663
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,849
leave a lot to be desired with

664
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:18,830
within the context efficient so

665
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:22,390
this is my favorite people always say
well just educate users and I was all

666
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:26,250
vision problems with us great but it's
not going to solve problems

667
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:31,950
it's nice to have my puny I also I P so
I keys don't work well

668
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:36,680
when you talk about uses the roaming
users that don't have said I P e's

669
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,580
I just not a good solution and same
thing with my side certs than you have

670
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,259
to

671
00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:44,750
worry about roaming users enough to be
able to manage all these clients and

672
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,410
their certs

673
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:48,870
questions not a good solution i've seen.
solutions

674
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:52,049
Open ID providers i DP's dad

675
00:39:52,049 --> 00:39:56,890
I instruct you to create a bookmark so
when you register with open it.

676
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:00,970
provider you going free to bookmark an
immediate redirected

677
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:04,420
to DIPP for the first time or even

678
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:08,569
any other time instead of providing you
with the authentication in point

679
00:40:08,569 --> 00:40:13,330
I an action at law login instruction to
go use that bookmark

680
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:17,520
we could take it one step farther and
actually attended redirected

681
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,790
to the IDPA you just tell you to
manually inter

682
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,850
your I authorization for yourself

683
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:27,120
so desire did the address on a fishing
issues

684
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,150
but im the user experiences pre-flop

685
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:34,960
and that undermines the whole notion of
an idea because of the ID's around

686
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,350
flexibility and user experience

687
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:41,470
so there's a couple better solutions
that I think I

688
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:46,310
you've seen in industry today I am one
is obviously sign in sales

689
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:49,569
that BC on banking web sites for example

690
00:40:49,569 --> 00:40:53,430
is a is a trust the established with the
ID P

691
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:56,859
which the consumer and a third party
finds know anything about

692
00:40:56,859 --> 00:41:00,170
so that works that I definitely reduces
a fishing

693
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:05,089
threat also it would be nice to have
something like a message no host

694
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:09,450
built into your browser so every time
you go to an ID for the first time

695
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:12,819
you get a warrant that pays first time
actually going to sign EP

696
00:41:12,819 --> 00:41:16,440
are you sure you want continued because
it is legitimate I DP

697
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,069
tension be going to for the first time a
spot to redirect are you should be there

698
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:25,440
when you register also any sort of two
factor authentication in Google does

699
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,170
this

700
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:30,380
the sites all do that and this is pretty
common when I

701
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:37,109
people on implement Open ID solutions
for the enterprise

702
00:41:37,109 --> 00:41:42,089
also quick note about privacy so if you
can swing open ID again for yourself or

703
00:41:42,089 --> 00:41:43,330
your organization

704
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:46,390
have in mind that ID key becomes

705
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:49,790
p.m. single point of I authentication

706
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:54,569
for all users so again as an attack a
point tracking user annoying have to go

707
00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:57,000
on a tack bra second attack I DP

708
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,000
and to have access to all users track

709
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,970
alright so we talked about I big data
providers

710
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:15,140
we talked about I fishing issues

711
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:19,450
beTouch some privacy and I what you
doing you know parody basically

712
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:22,630
outsourcing your pass a managing and
party security

713
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:26,480
if you doing that's happened in mine and
disagreeing about passwords

714
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,500
so I think my reasons why Open ID has
been retaken office because

715
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:34,330
I using password the passwords for most
part

716
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:38,370
works well when there's only two
entities UN different entity involved

717
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:41,790
and its shares a good thing to you
overnight leaders

718
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:47,069
potentially hundreds up entities
involved so that's why doesn't work well

719
00:42:47,069 --> 00:42:50,810
so again hopefully you remember that I
Dysport cause

720
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:54,850
African intentions for most part the
address some real-world issues i mean

721
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,220
management

722
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:00,060
and I'll be so easy to make the wrong
design decisions

723
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:03,819
and implementations and but i think is
easier to actually make the right design

724
00:43:03,819 --> 00:43:04,670
decisions when

725
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:07,920
making decisions and we saw that most

726
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,060
issues saw with your towards the
implementation

727
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:14,420
and not the park on himself

728
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,470
yes I had thank you
