3
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,549
hello

4
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,269
hello disobey my name is an Tibetan an

5
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,430
and I'm coming to talk about how to get

6
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,670
into buildings and places where you

7
00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:04,860
shouldn't be without using social

8
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:08,250
engineering and we are talking about

9
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,310
bypassing access control here we are not

10
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:14,009
talking about bypassing the alarm

11
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,600
systems for example I'm not going to

12
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:19,320
introduce you any traditional

13
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:23,309
lock-picking techniques and I want to be

14
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,979
clear that social engineering is by far

15
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,920
the best approach if you are doing a red

16
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:31,170
teaming gig or something social

17
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,869
engineering works much better than these

18
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:37,229
tricks but it's not the only way to get

19
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:39,929
in and preferably we wouldn't want to

20
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:42,810
leave any kind of traces we would not

21
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:47,670
want to harm the lock or the door or

22
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:49,920
anything like that and in the end I'm

23
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,050
going to talk a bit but risk management

24
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,459
and mitigations that you can do to

25
00:01:52,050 --> 00:02:01,890
prevent some of these attacks and my

26
00:01:56,459 --> 00:02:06,590
story starts with this door about 30

27
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:10,169
years ago I was playing with my friends

28
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:12,690
in front of this building and we

29
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:14,269
realized that it's possible to get in

30
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:18,780
without a key

31
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:21,450
by using this ice cream here because

32
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,180
when you eat that ice cream and you are

33
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:27,149
left with the wooden stick and you could

34
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:30,690
stick that in between the door and the

35
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,670
frame and then such big alit and the

36
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:37,650
lads goes inside the door and the door

37
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:42,569
opens and we were like oh yeah we are

38
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:44,870
the kings our parents weren't convinced

39
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:48,599
that this is a good hobby for the kids

40
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:51,270
but they had to install a mini case

41
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:54,810
under this door they had to install a

42
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:58,530
metal frame there to prevent this attack

43
00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:00,120
and now I checked this later

44
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:04,710
some reason they have taken the metal

45
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:10,080
out of the door so that's interesting

46
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:12,300
and we were so happy with our success

47
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,640
here that didn't we event to have other

48
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,410
kind of adventures for example we

49
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,140
noticed that in the building where I

50
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:22,320
lived in you could get inside any

51
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:25,049
apartment because children have small

52
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,410
hands so you could like put your hand

53
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:30,240
from the mailbox reach over inside the

54
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,690
door and open the door from the dork

55
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,540
realm and the residents in that building

56
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:40,650
were also not so happy about this

57
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:42,810
finding and then we went to have some

58
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:46,739
other adventures I'm going to talk about

59
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:49,470
them later but now I'm the security

60
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:51,120
chief at Soul Eater so Naaman looking

61
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,030
that is also from the professional

62
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,020
perspective so I'm responsible for the

63
00:03:54,030 --> 00:04:01,410
physical security of our offices and I

64
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:04,290
had to stop this hobby because somewhere

65
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:07,109
when I was about 15 years old I realized

66
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:09,900
that if I'm going to continue this I

67
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:15,090
will get into trouble with the law and

68
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:16,829
the police and then I haven't heard this

69
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,238
hobby for 20 years and now I have a

70
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:23,010
professional perspective

71
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:27,929
I'm also hacker at teen rot and I'm not

72
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:30,659
doing red teaming gigs for living so I'm

73
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:35,580
a hobbyist in that sense and I still

74
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:38,340
suck at social engineering one legal

75
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,919
disclaimer before we continue I don't

76
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:45,599
want you to get any to any kind of

77
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:48,030
trouble because if you like see a

78
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,440
building and you dry out the doors and

79
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:55,880
you pin test in in a white hat manner

80
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:59,180
but if you go inside you are effectively

81
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,740
trespassing on someone's property and

82
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,560
pretty much in every country it's a

83
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:07,080
criminal office offense and the police

84
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,840
will ask you some questions pretty

85
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,390
quickly so don't do that get the

86
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:22,380
permission if you want to do some

87
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:27,030
things like that but now let's switch to

88
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:30,390
the attack mode and before we can do

89
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:34,349
anything I recommend that we prepare

90
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:37,560
ourselves like do a full recon of the

91
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:40,380
building and that when I say full I mean

92
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:46,890
full like go through every door every

93
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:51,900
lats every window every backdoor some of

94
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:54,210
them might be open and when I was a kid

95
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:57,570
we also climbed to the roof of the

96
00:05:54,210 --> 00:06:00,539
buildings which is pretty dangerous

97
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:04,190
we could have been killed so I suppose

98
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,190
the red teaming people don't do that

99
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,450
find out the model and the type of the

100
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:13,290
access control system check out what

101
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,760
kind of locks do they have and who has

102
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:19,470
access to different parts of the

103
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:22,409
building and so on this is active recon

104
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,000
but if you are just walking around the

105
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,970
building and and they're looking at

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,160
things it's unlikely that you will get

107
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,160
into any kind of trouble doing this part

108
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:41,820
now for the next phase when we have done

109
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:44,100
this recall what have we found out well

110
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:50,460
this is the oldest trick in the book and

111
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:53,280
it still works they are open doors like

112
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:56,880
in this picture it's from a Christmas

113
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,010
shopping center and I don't know where

114
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,950
that door leads to probably nothing

115
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:04,950
interesting there but when you start

116
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:08,190
paying attention you will see a lot of

117
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:13,110
open doors which might look like they

118
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:16,410
are closed and this works marvelously

119
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:19,710
well last autumn I accidentally did this

120
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:24,450
I was supposed to go into our office

121
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:26,248
here in Helsinki and in the same floor

122
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:28,938
there's another company

123
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:31,889
I accidentally walked into their office

124
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:35,129
people were coming out and they didn't

125
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:36,569
ask me anything I walked in and then I

126
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:39,809
realized that oh

127
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:42,329
this is not our office at all it is the

128
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:45,869
wrong company I didn't have any kind of

129
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:48,449
bats with me or anything obviously I

130
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:50,879
wasn't nervous because I honestly

131
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:55,379
thought that I am going to our office

132
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,009
and I was dressed up properly I didn't

133
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:58,829
look like this

134
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:01,469
I had the shirt and a jacket because I

135
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:03,779
was going to meet a customer and it just

136
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:06,269
happens to be the proper dress code for

137
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:10,259
that company so I looked exactly like

138
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:10,709
their own employees then I couldn't

139
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:14,009
resist

140
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:15,869
I stayed there a bit just to see if

141
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:18,749
somebody asked me who are you what are

142
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:22,979
you doing in our office but nobody asked

143
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:26,549
me anything so then I walked out so this

144
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:29,128
still works and you don't have to talk

145
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:32,728
to anybody or convince anybody to open

146
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:34,438
you the door you can just walk in and if

147
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:38,309
you have props like if you have a fake

148
00:08:34,438 --> 00:08:41,458
ID but then you cannot say that this is

149
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:44,939
an accident I'm here by accident

150
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:47,819
so these fake props like ladders and the

151
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:50,160
maintenance guy outfits might help you

152
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:56,189
but then clearly you are not there by

153
00:08:50,160 --> 00:09:00,509
accident here's another very old trick

154
00:08:56,189 --> 00:09:03,870
you can bypass the door because you can

155
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:05,579
climb those stairs and then flip behind

156
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:10,759
the door easily you don't have to be an

157
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:13,620
athlete to do this in this case and

158
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:16,139
depending on what they are protecting

159
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:19,470
this might be enough protection for them

160
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:23,269
because you cannot bring big stuff out

161
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:27,660
if you cannot open the door and

162
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:31,170
sometimes it's not that easy there was

163
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:33,449
one door when I was kid which we really

164
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:37,579
wanted to get behind behind this door

165
00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:39,709
and it is a tall door but there is space

166
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:43,069
at the top we

167
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:44,270
being the roof and the door so one

168
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,760
person couldn't do it

169
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,920
but two persons good my friend helped me

170
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,439
so that I could get my hands to the top

171
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:55,219
of the door and then I pulled myself up

172
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:58,060
and climbed down and opened the door to

173
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:00,260
my friend and we did this multiple times

174
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,380
because then it was an interesting place

175
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:05,360
to be in and they had thought that

176
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,340
because the door is so high nobody can

177
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,180
go there without the ladder but that's

178
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,180
not strictly true

179
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:19,250
you could also bypass the lock like in

180
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:23,839
this picture that's my finger

181
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:26,120
so the constructor had installed this

182
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,250
door so that you could put a finger

183
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:32,900
between the door frame and the glass

184
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:34,940
wall and if you can do that you can use

185
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:38,449
something like that metal wire there and

186
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:40,940
reach the door handle and then just pull

187
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:44,000
down from the handle and the door opens

188
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:49,460
because that's that's what the door

189
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,960
handle does from the inside and in this

190
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:55,370
picture there are other similar tools

191
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:59,840
that metal wire in the picture is

192
00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:01,760
actually a spare key I made it works

193
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,760
marvelously well on moths the one to one

194
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:10,760
because I kind of need it a spare key

195
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:13,939
for that and this works in many places

196
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:16,520
because the doors are not airtight just

197
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:19,760
usually some way to wiggle something in

198
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:23,350
and depending on the door you might be

199
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,770
able to pull the handle upwards also

200
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,770
depending on the door

201
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:36,550
then there's this I I mean saying that

202
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:38,800
it's a privilege escalation because you

203
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:43,329
have a reason to be in some place a

204
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:47,199
legitimate reason but then you leave it

205
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:51,400
to look for example you put something in

206
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,980
the hole where the latch goes so that it

207
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:57,069
doesn't engage fully when the door is

208
00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:00,850
closed and you only need something like

209
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:03,250
five seconds to do this and it's easy to

210
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:07,330
do even and when you are supervised by

211
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:09,310
someone and then the door looks closed

212
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:13,470
it might even click and make all the

213
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:19,270
sounds and then you can come back later

214
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:22,330
unsupervised that's the idea and this

215
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:24,220
notice is from a certain building so

216
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:29,700
apparently some people are still doing

217
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:32,980
this today and very surprising that a

218
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:37,300
series of robberies has started after

219
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:39,630
someone has made this unlock trick to

220
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,630
the door

221
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:51,870
here's a boiler room and that you cannot

222
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:54,300
get inside that boiler room from the

223
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:58,020
main door of the boiler room but this is

224
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:00,209
the side door to the boiler room from an

225
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:04,819
other room next to the boiler room and

226
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:07,770
for some reason this is unlocked and

227
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,990
this boiler room is not interesting but

228
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:13,890
it was a similar boiler room

229
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:17,790
which led me to a hospital in Finland

230
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:20,790
and we first tried to access the

231
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:23,910
maintenance tunnels below the hospital

232
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:26,599
from the main entrance and we were

233
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:29,640
always stopped somebody always asked us

234
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,100
what are you doing here you are not

235
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,050
supposed to be here go away and we were

236
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,280
like okay sorry sorry sorry we took a

237
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:37,500
wrong turn somewhere

238
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,150
via we weren't meant to come here we

239
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:43,410
wanted to go to the visitor area or

240
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:47,430
something and we couldn't get in so what

241
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:50,370
we did we examined every building close

242
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,479
to the hospital because we had the

243
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,980
reason to believe that there are

244
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,850
underground tunnels leading from the

245
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:58,890
other buildings to the hospital and then

246
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:02,010
we found a way to get in in a boiler

247
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:04,949
room and from the boiler room there was

248
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:07,470
a small latch on the wall and you could

249
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:10,770
climb in and there was a dark small

250
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:13,470
tunnel and when you crawled the tunnel

251
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:18,980
you ended up in the bigger tunnel and

252
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:22,080
suddenly you were inside the hospital

253
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:24,840
maintenance tunnels and quite far away

254
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:27,180
from the main entrance which is

255
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:30,630
convenient because there wasn't so many

256
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:33,209
people going understand holes in that

257
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:37,050
point so all we had to do was to avoid

258
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:39,660
meeting anyone in the tunnels and we

259
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:44,219
were never caught we were there multiple

260
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:47,219
times and it was very exciting I must

261
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,810
say and we found interesting things in

262
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:52,980
these tunnels but I'm not going to talk

263
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:56,550
about that here today what I'm saying is

264
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:59,190
that if you do the full of recon you

265
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:01,760
might find a very strange way to get

266
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,760
inside the building

267
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,520
that was the physical part now let's

268
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:15,640
talk about digital access control a bit

269
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:17,290
I have pretty different approaches to

270
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,120
this digital access control first

271
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,980
technology then we talked about the

272
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,740
process and then I will show you some

273
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:28,030
installation mistakes that can happen

274
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:30,810
and how many of you know how digital

275
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:34,630
access control works with these tags

276
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:38,560
probably at least some of you know it

277
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:40,720
works roughly like this it doesn't

278
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,349
always will work exactly like this but

279
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,480
this is the rough idea the reader asked

280
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,760
the tag who are you

281
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,340
and the tag has an identity one two

282
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,680
three four and it says that I'm one two

283
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,020
three four and the reader asked the

284
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,900
server can I let this one two three four

285
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:02,920
in and if the server says that yes you

286
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:05,020
can then the control system applies

287
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:08,860
Baltics to relay and the relay opens the

288
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:13,300
lock and the door that's the brief

289
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:15,010
summary of how this works and obviously

290
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:16,599
there's communication between these

291
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:18,760
elements there's communication between

292
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,830
the reader and the tag and communication

293
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:25,720
between the reader and the server and

294
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:28,030
since it's 2020 of course we could

295
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,280
assume that the communication is

296
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:32,860
encrypted and authenticated and signed

297
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:37,140
so that you can a temper with it you

298
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:39,460
cannot sniff it of course it's 2020 and

299
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:42,040
if you are talking about new buildings

300
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:44,110
certainly this is the case how many of

301
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:51,430
you think that this is the case for new

302
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:55,030
buildings some people yeah actually that

303
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:57,069
was what I thought that certainly these

304
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:59,380
attacks have been around for a long time

305
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:02,080
so certainly they are not building new

306
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:05,589
buildings which are vulnerable but they

307
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:07,420
are quite often the communication is not

308
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:12,220
encrypted at all and it's not

309
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:15,280
authenticated in any way so if you

310
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,319
present the tag to your own reader it

311
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,599
will happily talk with it and you can

312
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,919
also sniff the traffic between the tag

313
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,169
and the reader when

314
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:26,170
when they are having a conversation and

315
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:29,470
so on and this opens door to different

316
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:31,060
things and there is a reason behind this

317
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,880
if you want to know the history and the

318
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:37,770
legacy why this is so you can Google

319
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:41,530
vegan and you find different things but

320
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:44,740
the real story behind this is us that a

321
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:47,980
weekend is a brilliant idea it was a

322
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:51,250
brilliant idea decades ago when it was

323
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,750
invented you have a passive element and

324
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,730
you can't read bits from the passive

325
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:59,490
element which doesn't have a battery and

326
00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:01,720
it works it's magic and it's great and

327
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:04,200
the bad thing is that they are still

328
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:10,330
using this as a model for these systems

329
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:12,370
today now the obvious question is how

330
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:16,540
difficult is it to copy an access tag

331
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:20,320
and this depends but you need to get

332
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:22,980
close to the tag you cannot copy it from

333
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:27,460
2 meters away that's not how it works

334
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:29,230
because it's basically some kind of

335
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,500
conversation and since there's no

336
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:36,340
battery there's no power in the tag it

337
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:38,710
is a very small distance but if you can

338
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,689
do it the nice thing is that these tags

339
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:43,450
don't have any kind of memory inside

340
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:45,640
usually so they don't remember having a

341
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:48,970
conversation between your copying

342
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:51,460
machine so it leaves no trace you can

343
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,270
make a copy and nobody ever finds out

344
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:56,770
about it

345
00:18:52,270 --> 00:19:01,330
and this particular tag here there's no

346
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:02,920
magic inside like you can see it there's

347
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:09,010
some induction loop and antenna and

348
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:12,310
that's it no magic and then we have

349
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:16,180
these wonderful tools I have this keys

350
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:21,060
here which is also on the slide so this

351
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:24,370
costs 50 euros and anybody can use it a

352
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:26,830
five-year-old kid can use it you present

353
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:28,570
the tag press the button and it copies

354
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,970
the tag and then you can use this to

355
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:34,800
open the doors because you can replay

356
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,800
the tag with this

357
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:44,720
you can buy a clone or device for 15

358
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:48,379
euros and anybody can use that you can

359
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:51,980
use your phone in some cases you can

360
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:55,040
find this software from the Google App

361
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:57,620
Store and download this to your phone

362
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,870
and you can play with me for a classic

363
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:02,510
tags because they just happen to use the

364
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:07,280
same frequency that your phone uses for

365
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:10,190
NFC so magic and if you are really

366
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:14,020
really brave you can also send your tag

367
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:17,929
by mail and they will send you back

368
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:24,040
copies of your tag and they can support

369
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:24,040
any copy apple protocol and and version

370
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:31,700
no hacker magic required for this and

371
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:36,530
practically no money then there are

372
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:40,280
professional tools the proxmark a size

373
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:44,510
factor is like this and it's about 300

374
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:48,290
euros or so and it can work multiple

375
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:51,440
frequencies and it can reverse-engineer

376
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:53,690
the traffic and and so on it's a real

377
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,490
hacker tool it's not a duplicator

378
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:59,450
it would be quite expensive the

379
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:02,030
applicator but you still need to get

380
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:06,140
close so so maybe in an elevator you

381
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:08,870
could get close to someone like and copy

382
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:13,880
the tag but finish people don't really

383
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:17,030
like that kind of proximity so the next

384
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,900
level is to use long writes antennae put

385
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:24,530
it inside your backpack put it inside

386
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:26,929
this back and then just go next to

387
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:32,120
someone in a train for example sit down

388
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:34,670
oh that's it now you have to duck and it

389
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,879
wasn't super suspicious even to finish

390
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,880
people

391
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:44,940
and I don't know what this rebuts

392
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:48,780
enterprise does exactly because they are

393
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:51,290
not releasing the specifications but if

394
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:54,629
somebody here knows I would be happy to

395
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:56,879
understand what it does three thousand

396
00:21:54,630 --> 00:22:01,050
and five hundred years and it claims to

397
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:03,860
pay some kind of out of pone cloner for

398
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,860
police enforcement

399
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:15,149
okay so access tax copying is possible

400
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:17,460
and it might be easy the next question

401
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:23,880
in your mind might be is my office safe

402
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:24,690
and you can check this if your tag looks

403
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,960
like that

404
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:30,929
it's not safe the tag helpfully says

405
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,420
that it's in dalla so if your Google in

406
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:35,910
the la tech cloning you can find the

407
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:40,320
videos and examples of how easy it is

408
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:43,200
and if the tag doesn't have any kind of

409
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,480
label you can take a picture of the tag

410
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,290
or the reader and do Google reverse

411
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:52,650
image search I I did it once because I

412
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:54,690
asked people who are responsible for the

413
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,580
security that what kind of standard is

414
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:59,670
your reader using and they said that

415
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:03,210
that's a business secret it took me five

416
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:08,070
minutes of googling to find out pretty

417
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:10,920
business secret and you can of course

418
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:15,139
check it with proxmark if you want to

419
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,140
know what kind of standard it's using

420
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:23,190
so that was trick number six copy an

421
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:26,880
access tag and use that copy access tag

422
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:29,220
and the biggest risk here is you don't

423
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,500
know that it's possible if you know that

424
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,330
it's possible you can make some kind of

425
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,850
decisions about the mitigations or

426
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:38,610
decide if this is a risk that you don't

427
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:49,909
want to take and I have a demo video

428
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:49,909
here which I got from a friend and

429
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,049
in this case the tag has been cloned

430
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:02,049
with proxmark

431
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:42,730
and when you clone it you can clone it

432
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:47,320
the different kind of tax but the device

433
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:55,480
came from the shop with that labelled

434
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:58,149
code like this they are variations to

435
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:02,170
this if you cannot text the clothes that

436
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:04,390
a person who has the access tag you can

437
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:06,010
also try to attack the reader and the

438
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:08,890
communication between the reader and the

439
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:11,320
server if you can go to the building and

440
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:13,840
that tamper with reader you can insert

441
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,970
something like this that the system

442
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,909
because the communication between the

443
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:22,450
reader and server might be unencrypted

444
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:25,120
and using this old vegan protocol so for

445
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:27,520
about 30 euros you can sniff the traffic

446
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,290
and you can keep collecting different

447
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,600
access tags as they go through the door

448
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:34,330
so do this to the front door and you

449
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:38,649
will get a lot of access tags in a short

450
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:41,260
period of time of course this requires

451
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:43,780
some skills you cannot like you have to

452
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:47,500
understand something and gain some kind

453
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:52,050
of access first of the building but it's

454
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:56,130
not overly difficult then we have a

455
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:58,450
trick number 7 request to exit sensors

456
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:01,150
these are not very common in finished

457
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:06,310
buildings I have seen this in two kind

458
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:08,920
of places basically but the idea is that

459
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:11,260
somebody is going out and the door opens

460
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:16,090
automatically when it detects that a

461
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:21,190
person is going out and usually these

462
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:23,290
react to heat changes so for example

463
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:27,160
there are demo videos in the internet

464
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:27,490
where people can blow smoke behind the

465
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,380
door

466
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:31,960
blow smoke through the door somehow and

467
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,760
suddenly the sensor things that you are

468
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,920
inside and the heat has sense and I will

469
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,020
open this door or you can spray

470
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:41,710
something like cold air or something

471
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:45,700
inside and that triggers the exit sensor

472
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:48,000
and again this works because the doors

473
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,470
are not airtight you can slip something

474
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,480
through the door without damaging the

475
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:54,670
door

476
00:26:51,480 --> 00:27:02,650
here's an example of exit sensor door in

477
00:26:54,670 --> 00:27:05,140
Finland now let's talk about the process

478
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:08,950
how digital access control works from

479
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:12,090
the process perspective so it doesn't

480
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:15,930
exactly work like like the old hotels

481
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:18,669
but it's quite close to that actually

482
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:22,080
how many of you work in a big office

483
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:25,930
building with multiple organizations

484
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:28,750
yeah if you have only one organization

485
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:30,160
it might be different but but the bigger

486
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,900
office buildings with multiple

487
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:36,220
organizations there's usually some kind

488
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:39,040
of info desk in the lobby and this info

489
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,120
desk might not have the ability to the

490
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,909
program the keys

491
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,820
they might have what might not have

492
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:48,700
anyway they hand out the keys that the

493
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:51,669
employees and different people so they

494
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:56,920
have pre-programmed keys waiting for

495
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:59,710
delivery and they usually have a master

496
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,990
key which they can use to open any door

497
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:03,570
in the building and how do they keep

498
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:08,530
these keys

499
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:10,330
well pretty often there's no safe there

500
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:16,290
might be a locked drawer which you can

501
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:16,290
open very easily or something like that

502
00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:23,429
and what could possibly go wrong here of

503
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,110
course there are obvious social

504
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:27,210
engineering angles here but what could

505
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,539
what other things could possibly go

506
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:31,489
wrong

507
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:34,110
well you could steal from the lobby

508
00:28:31,489 --> 00:28:36,450
there are different ways to do this but

509
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:39,080
if you walk to the lobby during the

510
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:41,779
office hours you cannot reach your hand

511
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:43,590
behind the desk it will look a bit

512
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:46,230
strange if you do that

513
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:50,488
or you can do that if you are very quick

514
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:53,249
and and handy but you could take your

515
00:28:50,489 --> 00:28:54,869
backpack with the long legs antennae and

516
00:28:53,249 --> 00:28:56,879
just place it on the desk

517
00:28:54,869 --> 00:28:58,649
it's not very suspicious if you are

518
00:28:56,879 --> 00:29:01,830
trying to find something from your

519
00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:04,229
backpack and since the keys are often in

520
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:05,939
close proximity you might be able to

521
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,799
copy the keys just like that without

522
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:17,399
anyone noticing or without talking to

523
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:18,929
anyone and after office hours where do

524
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:22,199
they keep the master key and these other

525
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:23,999
keys well they it might be in an easily

526
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:29,489
accessible place depending on the

527
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:33,119
building and even if the keys are locked

528
00:29:29,489 --> 00:29:35,190
away too tightly there's usually some

529
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:38,279
kind of box for the visitor keys because

530
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:40,499
you don't want the visitor keys left to

531
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:44,039
the info desk when nobody's there

532
00:29:40,499 --> 00:29:47,009
so you have a box and this box is

533
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:49,408
usually just the simple mail box or

534
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:52,259
something like that so you can easily

535
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:54,659
open that after the office hours so just

536
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:56,279
leap into the building during the normal

537
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:59,789
hours and you don't have to go into

538
00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:02,519
anyone's office at that time just hang

539
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:06,059
around a bit and at five o'clock the

540
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:08,669
info desk people will go home and then

541
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:11,100
just read a book for two hours and see

542
00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:13,710
what kind of visitor tags you have there

543
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:16,320
and at that point it's a seven o'clock

544
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:18,239
and they are still valid you can still

545
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,908
use them immediately to access the

546
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:23,129
office and there might be somebody

547
00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:25,529
working there but maybe not more than

548
00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:28,949
one person so the alarm system is off

549
00:30:25,529 --> 00:30:33,679
and you can just walk around if you are

550
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:33,679
a criminal or red teamer or something

551
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:41,160
then there's the evil visitor case

552
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:43,980
because these tax caught so much money

553
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:47,430
like 1 euro per tack or so they don't

554
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:50,040
usually physically destroy the tag they

555
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:51,930
will give it to the next person with

556
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:57,060
updated access permissions after you

557
00:30:51,930 --> 00:31:03,230
return the tag so you could copy the tag

558
00:30:57,060 --> 00:31:05,790
and return it and then come back later

559
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:08,340
if they have given it to the next person

560
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:10,379
with updated permissions your copy now

561
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:16,919
has access to other parts of the

562
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:21,240
building and when I showed this to one

563
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:24,600
one info desk company that hey these

564
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:29,520
access text can be copied like this

565
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:32,340
easily and I was like obviously they are

566
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,900
going to destroy that tag and which I I

567
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,290
gave they like I said that this has been

568
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:38,520
copied and the copy is not in my hand so

569
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:40,740
so here's the tag and give me a new one

570
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,389
and they were like ok I will put in this

571
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:45,060
pile and and give it to the next person

572
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:47,670
I was like no no don't do that you have

573
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:52,470
to destroy it because I cannot control

574
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:54,360
what happens to the copy but they had

575
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:57,570
never heard about this and this was last

576
00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:00,570
year they had never heard that these

577
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:06,570
tags can be copied they had not prepared

578
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:08,429
at all and it was a rather big company

579
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:10,919
and the rather big office building we

580
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:14,730
are talking about in this case and I was

581
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:16,440
totally baffled like how is it possible

582
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:20,450
that you haven't heard about this

583
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,450
because this has been around for years

584
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:30,750
this is also a nice nice story I was

585
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:33,090
behind the door and I really wanted to

586
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:35,640
go to the other side but I didn't have

587
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:40,669
access permissions to go through the

588
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:45,220
door so I went through every possible

589
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:49,140
path I went upstairs I went downstairs

590
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:51,760
and search for every possible door and

591
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:54,250
eventually I found a way to walk through

592
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:58,150
other doors to get behind that one door

593
00:32:54,250 --> 00:33:01,600
and then I started thinking like how is

594
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:04,480
this possible how could this happen

595
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,428
because the system could easily check

596
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,780
that the access permissions are

597
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:14,520
illogical and don't make any sense

598
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:17,379
but it happens because the software

599
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:19,418
often deals with the list of tags and

600
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:22,390
list of doors and it doesn't have any

601
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:25,059
kind of mapping to the topology so you

602
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:27,610
cannot run a graph algorithm which would

603
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:31,090
tell you that these nodes are reachable

604
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:32,649
from these nodes and that kind of system

605
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:36,039
doesn't make any sense you have

606
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:37,960
configured it wrong please fix it no

607
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:41,320
it's just the list of tags and lists of

608
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,309
doors and in this case that building it

609
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,760
was very complex

610
00:33:42,309 --> 00:33:48,158
so the topology was very complex if

611
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,379
there's just one door to exit the area

612
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:52,020
and one door to enter the area this

613
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:56,760
doesn't happen but in a complex

614
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:56,760
situation these kind of things happens

615
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:06,939
okay finally even if we have a perfect

616
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,589
system that uses encryption and and we

617
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:10,440
have perfect that the process of

618
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:14,529
handling the access tags and everything

619
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:20,770
you can still get the installation wrong

620
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:22,869
and this picture is a typical

621
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:24,969
installation in office buildings so

622
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:28,000
there is a panel at the top which you

623
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:30,428
can lift with your finger and then you

624
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:35,770
can see the wirings and and stuff there

625
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:38,260
and it shouldn't matter that you can

626
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:43,899
leave this with a finger but it it

627
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:47,320
actually opens some avenues now I have a

628
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:51,549
first I have a video of really really

629
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:53,849
weird attack which I got from a friend

630
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,849
also

631
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:22,310
what what did just happen let's let's

632
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:33,230
look at it again because it's so

633
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:36,330
unbelievable so the door is locked and

634
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:39,650
somebody was manhandles the handle and

635
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:39,650
the door opens

636
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:54,420
why did the demon work why in the hell

637
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:56,580
does it work like that we discussed this

638
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:00,860
and and became that the some kind of

639
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:03,450
conclusion that this is a cheap lock and

640
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:05,850
it uses a solenoid system and it's

641
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:08,870
possible that it's a bit broken but but

642
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:12,540
anyway because it's a cheap cheap system

643
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:18,710
it thinks that you are coming from the

644
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:18,710
inside out and just opens the door and

645
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:24,090
if you try this at your office please be

646
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,520
prepared that you might break something

647
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:29,010
I don't recommend trying this out on

648
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:34,370
your own office it might cost you some

649
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:34,370
money but this was really really weird

650
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:42,710
this is another kind of installation

651
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:46,250
mistake that can happen I have seen this

652
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:49,110
they changed the reader in the door and

653
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:52,970
they had drilled holes to the door for

654
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:55,590
the past installation so what do they do

655
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:58,169
do they change the door because it costs

656
00:36:55,590 --> 00:37:02,000
800 euros to change the door of course

657
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:04,920
not so the holes were still there and

658
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,520
the wires were accessible through the

659
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:10,820
holes is older holes and when I

660
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,800
mentioned this develop it doesn't matter

661
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:16,530
like how could anybody like take the

662
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:20,150
wires out of the hole and and do

663
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:25,260
something it's probably still there I

664
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:27,660
think of course this shouldn't happen if

665
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:30,090
it's installed properly the wires should

666
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:31,980
be inside the door so that you cannot

667
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:35,940
access them without drilling holes to

668
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:39,210
the door this is a variation of the

669
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:44,130
previous one if you cut the power to the

670
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:46,380
electrical door system it can fail open

671
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:48,150
or it can fail closed for security

672
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:52,440
reasons you have to get out of the

673
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:54,660
building if the power is cut so if there

674
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,080
is a mechanical override like a club or

675
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:58,560
something

676
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:59,940
then it can feel closed and you can

677
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,589
still get out

678
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:07,260
but if there's no mechanical override

679
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:09,569
usually it fails open which means you

680
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:16,500
can simply cut the power somehow and all

681
00:38:09,569 --> 00:38:18,660
the doors open in the building and this

682
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,030
is the final trick from the installation

683
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:24,509
issues because this was also like what

684
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:28,589
the actual is happening here this was a

685
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:30,119
new building last last year and we

686
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:36,029
lifted one of these panels with the

687
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:38,400
finger and the control box which

688
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:39,740
controls this everything was at the

689
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,329
wrong side of the door

690
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:45,538
so you get such the use a screwdriver

691
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:47,579
and short-circuit something and then the

692
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:50,339
lock would open without any kind of

693
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:52,500
access tag and that normal amount of

694
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:57,960
encryption will help if you do this kind

695
00:38:52,500 --> 00:39:00,799
of mistake and then we got into thinking

696
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:06,210
like okay so this is a new installation

697
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:07,890
bond or is it the one of mistake please

698
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:11,549
check all the other doors in the

699
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:13,799
building you can probably guess it

700
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:17,210
wasn't the one of mistake there were

701
00:39:13,799 --> 00:39:22,259
more than one one of these mistakes and

702
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:24,539
if you think about how this happens this

703
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:27,420
it's not a one of mistake this probably

704
00:39:24,539 --> 00:39:29,880
one guy in the installation crew who

705
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:34,440
repeatedly does this mistake in other

706
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:37,619
buildings - I have no idea who installed

707
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:39,839
this but I'm pretty convinced that the

708
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:44,520
same person has done this multiple times

709
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:48,558
in multiple buildings in Finland so

710
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,559
that's also something you might check

711
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:56,040
that's for the tricks now let's talk

712
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:58,799
about it about medications for example

713
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,810
if you have a pin code it doesn't matter

714
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,630
so much that your access that can be

715
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:05,730
copied that's an easy mitigation because

716
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:11,270
this mythic case and of course cost

717
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:13,890
money you could use proper standards and

718
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:15,480
you could separate the alarm system from

719
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:17,730
the access control system if you are

720
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,460
using an integrated alarm an access

721
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:24,720
control system all of these mistakes

722
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:28,260
become deadlier but if your alarm system

723
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:31,410
is separate from the access control even

724
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:33,990
if somebody can get in the alarm might

725
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:38,819
go off and you might catch catch that

726
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:42,899
person but the biggest and the best

727
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:47,760
mitigation is proper administrative

728
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:49,859
roses nobody should be able to get an

729
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,090
access tag by social engineering and

730
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:58,410
saying that I need this access tag and I

731
00:40:53,090 --> 00:41:03,119
have to do some maintenance work so if

732
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:05,779
you have a proper process you are well

733
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,780
off already

734
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:13,320
from the risk management perspective you

735
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:15,480
have to decide for yourself if any of

736
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:20,609
these things matter to you I cannot tell

737
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:23,220
you that what I can tell you is that you

738
00:41:20,609 --> 00:41:25,350
can pass multiple security audits

739
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:29,580
category audits and all kinds of audits

740
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:32,190
and they take some of these things but

741
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:35,100
nobody has ever asked me anything about

742
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:37,710
like is it possible to copy your access

743
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:40,200
tags nobody has ever asked that question

744
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:42,330
nobody has ever checked the control box

745
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:46,410
installation is it in the wrong side of

746
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:48,359
the door they don't never do that so you

747
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:56,299
might have this vulnerabilities and

748
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:56,299
still pass the security audits thank you

749
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:04,328
