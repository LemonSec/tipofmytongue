2
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:40,339
good afternoon Finland how's everyone

3
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:42,860
doing not too hungover that's fantastic

4
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,350
you could make it to the talk wonderful

5
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,970
wonderful and I'd like to thank

6
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:49,070
dissipate for loaning me a laptop

7
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,750
because mine broke don't worry it was

8
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:55,220
encoded by Boeing it wasn't another

9
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:58,160
failure on their part so like to talk

10
00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:01,519
about a little story and an adventure

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,309
that I went on with Boeing and some of

12
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,979
their employees as well some of the fun

13
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:08,450
that I had so since this is the first

14
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:09,950
time I've been in Finland a lot of you

15
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,440
don't know me my name is Chris kubecka

16
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:16,130
and I actually deal a lot in the cyber

17
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:19,250
warfare space so I was the one that was

18
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:21,460
called up by Saudi Aramco to reconnect

19
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:23,630
all of their international business and

20
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:28,220
reestablish all of their international

21
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:30,380
business operations in addition to that

22
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:33,679
I advised various EU governments and

23
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:36,318
also part the US government and dealing

24
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:39,560
with strategies concerning what happens

25
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:42,380
if there is a joint attack against both

26
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,350
the EU and the US and things of that

27
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:47,750
nature in addition to that I deal a lot

28
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:51,410
with critical infrastructure and in the

29
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:55,459
ICS world my areas are oil and gas of

30
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:57,229
course from Aramco but also energy of

31
00:01:55,459 --> 00:02:02,200
all different sorts especially nuclear

32
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:06,560
and also aviation and maritime and

33
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:08,899
previous to my career at Aramco I also

34
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,360
was in the US Air Force started my

35
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:14,569
career as a military aviator and then

36
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:18,050
moved on to Space Command not space

37
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:20,839
force and this was actually the aircraft

38
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:22,849
that I used to fly on I was the

39
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,489
loadmaster on that aircraft which is

40
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:27,500
like the flying calculator of it and the

41
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:29,420
ground commander so I come from an

42
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,860
aviation background I'm not just a

43
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:36,170
hacker right so when we talk about the

44
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:40,430
aviation industry we're talking about

45
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:42,530
a very very old industry for example KLM

46
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:46,040
has been in the air for now 100

47
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:49,370
years since 1919 and when you have an

48
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:53,510
industry that is so old you're going to

49
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:58,370
have a lot of legacy devices yeah who

50
00:02:53,510 --> 00:03:02,149
likes flying who likes flying I'll ask

51
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:03,770
that question again after this another

52
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,300
problem is when you're dealing with a

53
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,790
company that's been around for a long

54
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:11,150
time like Boeing they're going to have a

55
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:14,000
lot of things on the internet that they

56
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:16,130
may not even know about and this can be

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,500
very problematic this happens with a lot

58
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:22,010
of big companies a lot of entry points a

59
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,570
lot of exit points and so far forth they

60
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,549
also have a lot of third parties that

61
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,049
they have to deal with that tie into

62
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,569
their systems that provide them

63
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:32,209
different types of code and so forth

64
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:33,859
then they also have to be very very

65
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:36,410
concerned about intellectual property

66
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,510
theft because that's basically their

67
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:40,280
bread and butter somebody steals an

68
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:43,040
aircraft design and makes it in another

69
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,019
country like China and what happened

70
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,828
with Lockheed Martin's fighter jet that

71
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:51,560
can be a very very bad thing now to give

72
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:54,079
you a rough estimate intellectual

73
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,650
property theft actually cost the US

74
00:03:54,079 --> 00:04:02,269
taxpayer about six billion dollars a

75
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:04,549
year yes there's a reason why China has

76
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:08,590
awards for their citizens bringing back

77
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:13,420
intellectual property and unfortunately

78
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:16,250
with many many companies security is

79
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:20,089
something that really isn't thought of

80
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:21,680
that much in the case of Boeing one of

81
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:25,310
the things they still don't understand

82
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,710
is they're actually an IT company who

83
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:30,919
just happens to make aircraft because

84
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:35,450
nowadays aircraft are gigantic IOT

85
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:41,180
devices yeah we love IOT especially

86
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:44,150
planes yay so to give you an idea of

87
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,370
some of my motivations when I was

88
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,580
reading about the story from Ethiopian

89
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:52,940
Airlines I got a little angry and

90
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,770
frustrated with Boeing's response the

91
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,300
reason being is I myself have been an

92
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,448
in-flight emergencies

93
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,220
and also an airplane crash and I know

94
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:03,710
from my background in the aviation

95
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:06,860
industry that Ethiopian Airlines is one

96
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:10,039
of the safest airlines in the world that

97
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:12,069
might surprise a lot of people Lyon air

98
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:14,150
does not have as good of a reputation

99
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:17,990
they're still struggling with their

100
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:20,810
safety but when I took a look at the

101
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:23,360
case of Ethiopian Airlines and saw that

102
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,979
their alternate maneuver of what they

103
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,009
were supposed to do as pilots was

104
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:30,530
actually physically impossible and I

105
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:33,370
also read more that they were doing this

106
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:38,059
in flight emergency for 12 minutes

107
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:41,990
that's a very very long time for both an

108
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:44,690
aircrew person or for passengers because

109
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:47,060
at the time the nose of the aircraft was

110
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:50,060
being tilted downwards by 20 degrees

111
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:53,389
over and over again now imagine being on

112
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:58,520
that aircraft that would not be a good

113
00:05:53,389 --> 00:06:01,669
time less than a week ago an aircraft I

114
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,849
was in leaving London City Airport had

115
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:08,289
to slam on its brakes because we almost

116
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:11,840
collided with a landing aircraft and

117
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:16,370
everyone on board was will say quite

118
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:19,099
surprised with that one right so at the

119
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:22,430
end looking at Lyon air and looking at

120
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:24,949
Ethiopian Airlines 357 people died in

121
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:27,860
those two airplane crashes and Boeing's

122
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:29,960
response was very unfortunate they

123
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:33,169
blamed the pilots they said that they

124
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,388
did not have good training and that's

125
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:38,529
quite ironic since Boeing had withheld

126
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:41,300
information from those two airlines

127
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:46,639
about what they would need to do in case

128
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:48,620
their sensor went bad so in April of

129
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:53,300
last year I started fooling around like

130
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:56,270
Oh hmm I wonder if I can see any general

131
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:59,000
bad coding practices on the external

132
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,490
facing portion of Boeing and the first

133
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,880
website that I came across was actually

134
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:07,430
there aviation ID system now to give you

135
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,680
a bit of some information what happens

136
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,430
is when you go to update an aircraft or

137
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,670
a satellite

138
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:16,070
up in space you have to download the

139
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:18,050
software and upload it somehow in the

140
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,880
case of an aircraft that's to a

141
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,850
maintenance laptop which is unphysical

142
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:25,040
II plugged into an aircraft and the way

143
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,170
that you get this aviation flight

144
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,360
control software is actually in Boeing's

145
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:32,390
case behind the aviation ID system

146
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,460
you're supposed to have some good login

147
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:38,810
credentials and then you can download

148
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:43,789
everything you want yay go Internet

149
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:46,190
now unfortunately first thing I did like

150
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:49,520
many of us do in this room we look at

151
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:51,800
the HTML page source and towards the

152
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,590
bottom and the copyright I found

153
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,680
something very funny and I had to send a

154
00:07:54,590 --> 00:08:00,440
pilot friend copy of what I had found

155
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,840
and his comment was basically maybe I

156
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:06,650
shouldn't extrapolate code from the

157
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:09,710
flight control code website laugh out

158
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:12,020
loud and the first thing that stuck out

159
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:15,859
was this comment that a developer had

160
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:19,460
actually left in no idea what this does

161
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:21,650
it only prints null and this is

162
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,510
unfortunately a very good indicator that

163
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:26,599
the developer didn't know how to escape

164
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:30,170
special characters there were a lot of

165
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:33,250
problems in the HTML code mostly it was

166
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:37,940
made up of if-then-else statements I

167
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:40,250
also ended up finding six cross-site

168
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,290
scripting exploitable vulnerabilities

169
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,570
because when I downloaded everything and

170
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:47,750
tested it in my lab I could exploit it

171
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:51,350
like pop pop pop and I actually sent a

172
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:54,800
tweet out wearing a face mask going haze

173
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:58,760
anybody know anyone in Boeing cuz I just

174
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,640
got my sixth cross-site scripting and I

175
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:05,030
really need to stop there's only so much

176
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,970
one can do so after that tweet I was

177
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:10,160
contacted by a person who worked for the

178
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:12,710
u.s. aviation ice sack which is an

179
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,010
information sharing Association in the

180
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:17,780
United States and he asked me hey can

181
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:21,230
you send us a report of everything

182
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:23,420
that's wrong immediately after I was

183
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,140
contacted by that individual I was in

184
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,910
contact

185
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,280
by someone in the UK who said they

186
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,270
wanted to put me in touch with

187
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,150
Department of Homeland Security's

188
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:35,210
ics-cert and to not work with the u.s.

189
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:39,140
aviation Ishak this was a strange

190
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:41,480
message not what you would expect so

191
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:46,250
over that weekend I began writing my

192
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:49,130
report and it was 59 pages long there's

193
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:52,720
only so much you can put in a report and

194
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:54,740
I had reached my maximum at this point

195
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,410
some of the things that I pointed out

196
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:00,530
were that Boeing had a very high threat

197
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:02,600
profile because they handle classified

198
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:04,400
and unclassified systems and also

199
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:10,220
passenger and aircrew safety are

200
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:13,610
involved addition to that not only was

201
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:16,520
national security at risk but they

202
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:21,370
didn't really have this concept of

203
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:24,699
something called secure access at all

204
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:27,230
they had an eight character password

205
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:30,710
complexity with no requirement of

206
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:33,500
uppercase or or lowercase or special

207
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:35,930
characters to get into the aviation ID

208
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:40,190
system to get the flight control

209
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:42,500
software both live and test and they

210
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:45,050
also had lots of other little problems

211
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,570
such as I successfully could spoof the

212
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:51,319
CEOs email because they had never set up

213
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:53,900
something as simple as Demark in

214
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,390
addition to that a lot of the coding was

215
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:59,600
done by a third party called XO star who

216
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:01,870
also is in the market for aviation and

217
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,910
space and codes up a lot of

218
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:07,700
authentication log in websites for that

219
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:11,839
particular industry for the u.s. for the

220
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:15,830
UK Australia Canada and New Zealand so

221
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:17,990
some of the highlights were I commonly

222
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:22,340
use a browser called Firefox with no

223
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:25,180
script and I happen to find in census io

224
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:28,340
certificate properties which said oh

225
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:33,229
Boeing has a certificate for test

226
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:37,040
aviation ID that can't be online can it

227
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,910
well it turns out it was and when I went

228
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,120
to the website

229
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:45,050
all it said was you're not running

230
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,430
JavaScript please press this button how

231
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:51,459
many of you would have pressed that

232
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:53,660
button right I did and if I passed all

233
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,580
authentication and it took me into their

234
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,920
research and development servers and

235
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:00,680
into their test environment and their

236
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:06,709
test flight code for all of their

237
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:10,550
aircraft so this was quite unfortunate

238
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:13,460
because as a person who used to lead and

239
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:15,800
had security operation centers you don't

240
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,960
really monitor your test development

241
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,030
systems because there's a lot of things

242
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:23,210
that are being fired off against it and

243
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:25,520
it would be a lot of false positives and

244
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:27,590
you don't want your actual people

245
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,390
concentrating on that instead of

246
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:32,840
concentrating on the real events in

247
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:35,660
addition to that tests and development

248
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:38,300
systems they're tied to real systems on

249
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:41,900
the inside so you can rather easily

250
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:45,050
pivot from that press that button to get

251
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:47,959
in to pivot directly inside of Boeing

252
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:51,620
and this was written up in the report as

253
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:54,590
well they didn't have this concept

254
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,640
called encryption which I thought was a

255
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,520
little strange

256
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:02,240
since firstly they do handle classified

257
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:05,960
systems and secondly Boeing actually

258
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:12,160
sells cyber security services to the US

259
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:14,900
government so this was a little strange

260
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,959
where they did use some encryption they

261
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:21,199
had very outdated ciphers with known

262
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:25,580
problems where you could easily crack

263
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:28,040
those ciphers and one of I will say

264
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,630
piece de resistance was the fact that

265
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,360
they were using an older version of

266
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:36,080
sam'l on a bunch of their login pages

267
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,990
including for the live actual flight

268
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:44,150
control software and they had hard-coded

269
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:47,180
the credentials in it so there wasn't

270
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:50,660
much hacking that needed to be done

271
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,680
because they had already hacked

272
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:56,360
themselves and

273
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,449
essence now one of the reasons why I was

274
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:04,220
told not to work with the u.s. aviation

275
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:07,120
I sac was because I was told that they

276
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:09,649
do not like people discussing

277
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,529
vulnerabilities with any of their

278
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:15,380
systems and there are now several

279
00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:17,899
lawsuits by employees and third parties

280
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:20,420
dealing with Boeing in the court systems

281
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:24,380
now both in the United Kingdom and the

282
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:26,089
United States because Boeing apparently

283
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:30,920
so that I don't get sued

284
00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:32,959
apparently perhaps have blackmailed used

285
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,089
extortion and coercion against

286
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,180
individuals who have also even raised

287
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:41,690
issues about safety issues such as most

288
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:44,750
recently an engineer for Boeing brought

289
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:47,660
up the fact that a quarter of the oxygen

290
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,350
masks could not deploy in the 787

291
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,520
dreamliner

292
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:55,370
in case of emergency because Boeing

293
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:59,000
supposedly had swapped the parts on the

294
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:01,670
assembly line for cheaper oxygen nozzles

295
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,470
and that person has an active lawsuit

296
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:06,949
against Boeing now because they

297
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:09,050
blackmailed him supposedly and forced

298
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:12,230
him into early retirement to give you an

299
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:15,319
example there had also been a previous

300
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:18,650
researcher who took a lot of heat for

301
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:20,930
discussing things about Boeing and to

302
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:25,130
this day he will not discuss anything

303
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:28,339
Boeing related with anyone so I'm not

304
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:33,709
sure what happened but he's not talking

305
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:35,810
to anybody for our very good reasons so

306
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:37,550
in the report that I wrote I pointed

307
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:39,709
this out because this was going to the

308
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:42,319
Department of Homeland Security that

309
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:43,880
Boeing had threatened any security

310
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,220
researcher who divulges any

311
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,100
vulnerabilities about our systems we

312
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:55,279
will turn our entire legal and PR

313
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:59,930
apparatus against them now this doesn't

314
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:03,950
sound nice and I've actually been sued

315
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:05,329
before by companies although I've won

316
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:09,000
every single time

317
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:10,888
but legal bills or legal bills and they

318
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,279
can be kind of expensive I think the

319
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:17,540
last one cost me about 20,000 euros just

320
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:20,370
to fight it and when the court case and

321
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:24,170
also at the same time nobody wants the

322
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:27,569
reputation right and in addition to that

323
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:29,399
less than a year ago I got out of a

324
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:31,860
wheelchair because I had been long term

325
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,170
sick from an illness that I picked up in

326
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,959
East Africa in Tanzania

327
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:39,360
so I'd gone through a very long medical

328
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,979
battle where I was between life and

329
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,579
death and in a wheelchair a lot of the

330
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:46,769
time so I was trying to get back up and

331
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:47,878
running as a professional and these

332
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:53,550
types of threats

333
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:56,490
I took them extremely seriously so to

334
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:58,439
give you a good example of the fact that

335
00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:01,019
they didn't know what encryption

336
00:16:58,439 --> 00:17:05,418
actually was this was a screenshot of

337
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:09,809
the Boeing website where it is just HTTP

338
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:12,780
there is no encryption and Boeing did

339
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:18,959
not encrypt their webpages until October

340
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:22,500
29th of last year yes I've seen faces

341
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:25,620
you're like no this can't be true

342
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:28,260
yeah yeah I remember

343
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:32,639
they sell cybersecurity consulting

344
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:36,408
services to the US government right

345
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,730
everybody feels warm and fuzzy now yay

346
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:42,059
in addition to that I found that there

347
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:44,309
had been a targeted malware issue coming

348
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:51,120
out of their servers which involved

349
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:55,230
documents such as 737 max PDF again I

350
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:58,350
could spoof any one's email account at

351
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:01,250
Boeing they had a whole bunch of remote

352
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,250
management yes

353
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:11,499
rocks and EXO start the coding that they

354
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:13,779
used was really really bad this is what

355
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:16,269
one of the malware infections look like

356
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:20,440
and what's interesting about this was

357
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:22,600
only 21 of the 71 antivirus vendors

358
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,369
could actually pick up on it and the

359
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:28,240
ones that could were actually oddball

360
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:31,809
ones they weren't major ones and that

361
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:35,889
this is a little odd and I belong to

362
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:39,460
virustotal for 11 years so I do a lot of

363
00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:45,279
malware research as well it's one of my

364
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:49,029
favorite things so last year I was going

365
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:51,009
to be including Boeing in my talk hacked

366
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:54,340
the world with open-source intelligence

367
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:55,869
gathering at the DEFCON ICS village but

368
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,939
I was asked nicely by Department of

369
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:59,860
Homeland Security not to say their name

370
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,950
in that presentation at the time until

371
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:07,149
they could actually try to start fixing

372
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:09,460
things but two nights before I was send

373
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:13,629
an email from what was supposedly the

374
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:16,899
Security Manager of EXO star and this

375
00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:20,980
person had detailed my tweets a podcast

376
00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:23,229
I was in date and time stamping and so

377
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,809
forth and the first thing I thought when

378
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,700
I saw the email was this was this was

379
00:19:25,809 --> 00:19:29,110
written by a lawyer and I just so

380
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,850
happened to have a very good friend of

381
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:34,809
mine who is a lawyer and that was also

382
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:37,600
her first reaction as well so the email

383
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:40,418
that I sent back to EXO star I'll just

384
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,289
point out in red this feels a little bit

385
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:46,990
like a chilling effect and what the e FF

386
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:49,749
would label it in addition to that all

387
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:51,669
of the research that I did I took place

388
00:19:49,749 --> 00:19:52,990
in the Netherlands and in the

389
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:55,419
Netherlands we have some very strong

390
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:58,539
laws to protect security researchers of

391
00:19:55,419 --> 00:20:01,240
which I did not fall afoul and I did not

392
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:04,389
break any laws I also pointed out that

393
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,970
censorship is illegal in the Netherlands

394
00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:09,639
for a reason so a big company can't just

395
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,470
try to get me to sign an NDA in the

396
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:15,189
Netherlands that's considered censorship

397
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:15,789
they can't just I have a judge issue a

398
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,649
CSUN

399
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:20,379
desist that can only come from the Dutch

400
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:23,889
prosecutor otherwise it's considered

401
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:25,509
censorship and in addition to that I

402
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,539
repeated something that the Department

403
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:30,519
of Homeland Security told me themselves

404
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:33,789
was that they wanted the names of any

405
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:35,940
person who organization who tried to

406
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:39,129
threaten me in any litigious manner

407
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:41,320
censor or try to bully me because

408
00:20:39,129 --> 00:20:42,580
Department of Homeland Security said

409
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,989
that they would be turning it into a

410
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:53,109
teaching moment yes taking them to

411
00:20:46,989 --> 00:20:55,749
school so another reason why I was told

412
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:58,779
not to work with the u.s. aviation Isacc

413
00:20:55,749 --> 00:21:01,389
in the top picture that was the person

414
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:05,320
who had contacted me about sending them

415
00:21:01,389 --> 00:21:08,738
a report and he said oh I've run the eye

416
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:11,649
sac I also happen to be a Boeing

417
00:21:08,739 --> 00:21:13,570
employee how many of you think that

418
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:15,728
Boeing would have fixed anything if I

419
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:19,509
had reported any of this to the u.s.

420
00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:22,769
aviation Isaac for the record nobody

421
00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:26,440
raised their hand in addition to that

422
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:28,659
the bottom one the CEO of the u.s.

423
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,450
aviation Ishak that was from a media

424
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:34,989
article about this he insisted that no

425
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:37,409
Boeing employees or u.s. aviation Ishak

426
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:40,149
employees ever came to my hotel or

427
00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:43,269
threatened me or tried to get me to sign

428
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:45,879
an NDA the middle picture it's actually

429
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:49,659
in Central European Time from my

430
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:52,238
calendar that is Doug Blau a Boeing

431
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:55,239
employee who also around the u.s.

432
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:57,279
aviation I sac and he came to my hotel

433
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:59,590
that was a hotel that I was staying in

434
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:02,849
during last year's hackers summer camp

435
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:06,070
and he tried to get me to sign an NDA of

436
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:09,340
which I said I don't need to sign an NDA

437
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:15,009
I don't have to sign an NDA and I'm not

438
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:16,599
going to sign an NDA so finally a

439
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:18,309
department of homeland security they

440
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:21,519
took a look at my report and asked for

441
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:23,229
my permission to send it to Boeing and I

442
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:24,849
said yes of course because I went

443
00:22:23,229 --> 00:22:28,210
blowing to actually fix some of these

444
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:29,260
things now Boeing did not respond to

445
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:32,140
everything

446
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:36,879
that I put down but to summarize some of

447
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:38,280
their report feedback they insisted that

448
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,010
there was no malware

449
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:43,420
however in 2017 there was a malware

450
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:45,700
infection coming out of their email

451
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,200
servers which they denied over and over

452
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:51,550
again and it turned out that it was

453
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:54,550
absolutely true so I don't really trust

454
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:57,480
Boeing that much they were saying that

455
00:22:54,550 --> 00:23:02,020
they were looking into deploying Demark

456
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:07,660
they have since decided to deploy Demark

457
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:10,780
by going with office 365 for the sam'l

458
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:13,510
credentials what they said was well you

459
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:16,060
know it might be a problem but we're

460
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:22,120
meeting the regulation from NIST so it's

461
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:24,730
fine like magically there's no problem

462
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,360
with hard-coded credentials right for

463
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:32,190
login systems to get into the live

464
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:34,659
aviation ID system and into live in

465
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:39,160
production flight control software for

466
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:44,070
aircraft and for satellites it meets

467
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:48,460
NIST it's ok magic rainbows and unicorns

468
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:51,100
for the exposed development systems they

469
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:54,280
reference the email systems for some

470
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,719
strange reason and then said you know we

471
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:00,960
know it's exposed

472
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:03,370
however it's performing as intended yeah

473
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,310
more magic getting rainbows and unicorns

474
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:08,260
and then they said for the password

475
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:13,960
complexity that they were working on

476
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:17,110
making it more secure so here's where I

477
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:21,550
I divert a little I'm home how many of

478
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:23,770
you think that you would want a nice

479
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:28,659
security researcher to report to your

480
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:33,970
company and write a pretty good report

481
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:36,670
and want your company to respond back in

482
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:39,610
this manner especially if your personal

483
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:43,270
data was there especially if it could

484
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:49,330
cause issues with safety loss of life or

485
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:51,400
right so this was my reaction and this

486
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:55,480
also was privately at the Department of

487
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:58,600
Homeland Security reaction in addition

488
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:01,710
to that they still did not respond

489
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:04,840
adequately about the malware issue and

490
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:06,820
right now I'm actually working with the

491
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,730
Chicago office of the Federal Bureau of

492
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:15,280
Investigation about this particular

493
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:17,410
matter now back in late December I was

494
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:20,560
given the opportunity to use a tool to

495
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:23,530
demo it out for free and I found a new

496
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:26,679
series of infections involving malware

497
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:29,410
and the Boeing email servers now because

498
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,510
I don't have access to all the evidence

499
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:33,750
I can't say for sure because I don't

500
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:36,910
have control of the command and control

501
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:39,910
servers or one of the Boeing assets

502
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:42,970
however in addition to finding

503
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:45,460
additional malware issues also Japan

504
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:48,250
search became involved with this as well

505
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,990
a couple of weeks ago to try to see if

506
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:52,180
the command and control server was

507
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:54,540
within their jurisdiction so that they

508
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:58,240
could contact law enforcement

509
00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:01,480
poni loader is known to be a credential

510
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:06,580
harvester just what everybody wants

511
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:09,490
unclassified systems now here's where

512
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:12,429
the story takes a bit of a turn

513
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:13,810
late last year I was requested by a

514
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:15,100
member of the Dutch government to

515
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:17,649
contact the Federal Bureau of

516
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:19,899
Investigation to ask them if they would

517
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:23,230
open up an investigation for coercion

518
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:28,960
that Boeing had used coercive illegal

519
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:31,420
methods to keep things quiet and one of

520
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,220
the reasons for that was in 2009 there

521
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:37,350
was a Turkish Airlines plane crash

522
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:39,760
involving the aircraft of 737 and G and

523
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:42,459
actually crashed landed at Schiphol

524
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,170
Airport on an alternate runway that

525
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:47,020
plane actually almost took out the

526
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:51,000
building I was working at at Schiphol so

527
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:54,370
I was actually there when it crashed and

528
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,770
the news broke about two weeks ago that

529
00:26:54,370 --> 00:27:01,449
Boeing and the u.s. say

530
00:26:56,770 --> 00:27:04,360
50 Borg actually apparently coerced the

531
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:06,490
Dutch government to remove information

532
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:09,820
out of the safety report concerning the

533
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:12,640
sensor that went wrong on that aircraft

534
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:16,480
and that same sensor in the same code on

535
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:21,640
that 2009 airplane crash was used in the

536
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:25,150
737 max so if a parent coercion had not

537
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:29,860
occurred 357 people would still be alive

538
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:33,940
today I'm now in touch with one of my

539
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:36,429
MPs in the Netherlands who has been

540
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:39,070
quite vocal about this matter in

541
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:43,150
addition to that Boeing is a publicly

542
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:44,530
traded company and / 2017 guidelines

543
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:47,470
from the Securities and Exchange

544
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:49,840
Commission they are required to tell

545
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:52,060
their shareholders about any major cyber

546
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,629
security risks that could affect their

547
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:58,659
intellectual property and diminish what

548
00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:00,940
their stock is actually worth make sense

549
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,280
right you want to know what you're

550
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:06,400
buying before you buy it so I've been in

551
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:09,100
touch with the SEC lawyers and we talked

552
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:12,070
at length and if need be I will be

553
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:15,909
getting whistleblower protection from

554
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:19,000
the SEC as well one of the reasons for

555
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:21,820
this is because Boeing has a very very

556
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,920
very powerful corporation and they are

557
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:26,590
known to try to shut people down using

558
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,390
any means I also have the protection of

559
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:30,189
Department of Homeland Security and the

560
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:32,380
protection of the Dutch government and

561
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:34,060
assurances from the Dutch prosecutor's

562
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:37,030
office that I did not do anything

563
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:41,980
illegal and no criminal charges would be

564
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:43,930
pressed against me in addition to that

565
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,810
Boeing did not tell people that they

566
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:49,060
were breached back in 2018 the same our

567
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:52,060
D systems that I was able to get into

568
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:54,639
they also did not fix anything so this

569
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:59,260
is a timeline that was leaked to me by a

570
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:01,720
whistleblower and what had happened was

571
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:04,090
someone was able to press that button as

572
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:07,210
well get in download all of the flight

573
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:10,449
control software including for the 737

574
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:12,580
max boeing did not fix anything

575
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:14,800
and they decided to issue this thing

576
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,720
called an airworthiness certificate that

577
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,000
every single one of their planes that

578
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,010
they ever manufactured met the

579
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,080
cybersecurity requirements for air

580
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:25,840
worthiness we're talking about planes

581
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:28,449
that are not IOT devices we're talking

582
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:31,120
about 50-year old planes so the issuance

583
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:36,310
of that certificate was most likely this

584
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:39,340
thing called fraud and other people

585
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:41,350
whistle blew to me as well there was a

586
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,879
company that was a third-party for

587
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:45,040
Boeing when they tried to report

588
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,050
corruption they were actually

589
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:52,120
blacklisted from ever doing business

590
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:54,370
with Boeing again now Department of

591
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:56,709
Homeland Security they asked me

592
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:58,629
privately would you mind taking a look

593
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:01,690
at Boeing again to see if they fixed

594
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:06,250
anything well as soon as they said that

595
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:09,850
I said yeah let my fingers do the

596
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:12,850
surfing and I immediately found with no

597
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:15,550
encryption no authentication a way to

598
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:18,790
see all of the in-cabin

599
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:22,840
IOT cameras on all of the boeing

600
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:24,909
aircraft that have them enabled so if

601
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,370
you flew on a Boeing aircraft last

602
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:33,970
September in October I might have seen

603
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:36,639
you so has there been any improvement at

604
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:38,800
Boeing well because of my report they

605
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,800
actually started their very first

606
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:45,040
vulnerability disclosure program so that

607
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:47,260
was a good win however the PGP key that

608
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:52,360
they posted actually was just gibberish

609
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:55,840
and it still doesn't function they

610
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:58,060
finally started rolling out encryption

611
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,270
certificates however while I was

612
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:02,950
attending the previous talk I wanted to

613
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:08,139
double check a few things and it turns

614
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:10,510
out that their VPN server has no actual

615
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:13,300
encryption certificate it's

616
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:16,150
misconfigured as is their business

617
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,590
intelligence and analytics systems which

618
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:20,470
are exposed to the Internet without a

619
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:23,310
functioning certificate so Loggins

620
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,310
Loggins Loggins

621
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:27,500
they ended up escalating what the

622
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:29,780
journalist who covered this story their

623
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:32,120
legal department contacted the media

624
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:35,120
organizations legal department his

625
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:38,060
editor and senior editor which dokdo

626
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,370
overwhelm the journalist said no this is

627
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:42,950
you know an attempt at censorship they

628
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:46,100
also launched a Twitter bot to campaign

629
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:48,140
against him in addition to that when I

630
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:50,510
contacted partner of homeland security

631
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,340
and I said hey whatever boeing's doing

632
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:54,290
with that media organization this one

633
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:57,260
from a small story to a much bigger

634
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:59,270
story because of it and shortly after my

635
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:01,850
phone call with them bones legal

636
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:05,810
department actually had the won't say

637
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:07,580
balls balls to contact Parkman of

638
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:09,830
Homeland Security legal department to

639
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:14,689
have tried to apply pressure on them as

640
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:17,060
well go Boeing XO star who does all of

641
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:20,180
this authentication coding for the

642
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,560
aviation and space industry and they

643
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,750
still don't have a vulnerability

644
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:26,810
disclosure program however they have not

645
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:29,330
been hassling me again which is kind of

646
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:31,700
nice now the picture that you see here

647
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:35,149
this is actually the brand new CEO of

648
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:38,570
Boeing he's got three albums out I

649
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:40,670
happen to be i think his only subscriber

650
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:45,290
on one of his YouTube channels and his

651
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:48,050
latest album is called a drinkin with my

652
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:50,889
favorite lines take your hand off the

653
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:55,090
throttle and put it on your wife or

654
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:59,210
chillin in the cockpit with a cold beer

655
00:32:55,090 --> 00:33:01,310
so I I encourage you okay I would

656
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:04,430
encourage you to listen but it's really

657
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:08,120
not very good music so I wouldn't want

658
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:11,420
to torture you like that so are there

659
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:14,120
solutions to any of this well during

660
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:16,100
part of this boeing tried to accuse me

661
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,800
of being a criminal hacker and trying to

662
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:21,020
extort them for money so i sent them a

663
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:23,600
picture of the NSA director that I took

664
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:25,700
last April at a closed conference and I

665
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,219
said if you want it I could probably get

666
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:30,830
you an autograph because they didn't

667
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,570
look me up very well so we aren't

668
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,280
criminals in this room we're trying to

669
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:36,409
do something to make the world a bit

670
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,600
better because our modern world is the

671
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:41,480
digital world

672
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:44,330
in addition to that they had a very very

673
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:47,899
light non-destructive pen test for free

674
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:50,389
I did ask for a t-shirt and what I

675
00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:51,889
wanted the t-shirt to say was I hacked

676
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:57,620
Boeing and all I got was this lousy

677
00:33:51,889 --> 00:34:00,289
t-shirt I don't think they laughed now

678
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:02,899
because of Boeing's public image issue

679
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:04,999
they're going to need to involve a lot

680
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:07,370
more stakeholders there are pilots who

681
00:34:04,999 --> 00:34:11,359
have contacted me with concerns there

682
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:13,520
are CEOs of we'll say three major US

683
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:16,520
airlines who actually voice their

684
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,500
support for me in private so they're

685
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,599
gonna have to include those stakeholders

686
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:23,239
as well as people like you and me

687
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:25,069
because we all fly on aircraft I assume

688
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:29,000
how many of you don't fly on an aircraft

689
00:34:25,069 --> 00:34:34,129
I saw one too baby

690
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:36,530
right so they're gonna have to fix this

691
00:34:34,129 --> 00:34:40,250
they also have to make Boehner ability

692
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:44,899
disclosure of routine with a working PGP

693
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:46,550
key for goodness sakes so I tried to

694
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:48,799
leave some time for questions because

695
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:50,329
the last speaker had four questions so

696
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,819
I'm looking forward to questions because

697
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:55,639
I like questions I wanted to give a

698
00:34:52,819 --> 00:34:57,740
quick thank you very much to disobey for

699
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:01,910
accepting this talk and also to the

700
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:04,640
journalists who took a lot of heat for

701
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:06,348
actually writing up this story as well

702
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,839
as Department of Homeland Security who

703
00:35:06,349 --> 00:35:11,349
were very very nice and tried to work

704
00:35:08,839 --> 00:35:13,940
with me as best as they could even

705
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:16,849
though they had legal pressure on

706
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:19,540
themselves in addition to the free tool

707
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:22,420
that I had used from lookingglass and

708
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:25,040
although it's not official but the BBC

709
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,780
over in the UK is actually looking at

710
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,050
doing a documentary on some of these

711
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:31,880
issues with the 737 max and I've already

712
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:33,890
been interviewed for it to be included

713
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,050
about the software vulnerability and bad

714
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:39,770
coding practices that I was able to find

715
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:42,950
in all of this so thank you very much I

716
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:45,109
appreciate your attendance even though I

717
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:46,669
heard there was this great after-party

718
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:48,319
last night but I had to be a good girl

719
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,490
and I wanted to be fresh for this talk

720
00:35:48,319 --> 00:35:51,710
so

721
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:53,919
I'm ready for any questions than anyone

722
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,920
has

723
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:59,509
[Applause]
