[Music]

3
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:45,530
hey guys welcome everyone to disobey

4
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:48,980
I'm allergic ovitch coming from Hungary

5
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:53,470
and this is my first time at this obey

6
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:58,309
or rather in Helsinki and I have to say

7
00:00:53,470 --> 00:01:01,460
I am it's cold here so yeah I've been

8
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:03,910
having a runny nose all the day so bear

9
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,910
with me please

10
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:12,500
this talk is about a malware that made

11
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:15,770
some waves not so long ago back in last

12
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:18,350
year in August and I just want to give

13
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:21,500
you guys a short primer to it this will

14
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:25,929
be a technical synopsis with some

15
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,930
technical details I hope you enjoy this

16
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:33,140
so a little bit about myself I coming

17
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:34,850
from a what I like to call it a

18
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,920
traditional blue team background I

19
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:42,199
started out there's a security analyst

20
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:46,070
went on to senior incident responder

21
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,320
then I joined the Navy company and over

22
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:51,229
the time I've spent learning all these

23
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,869
things I sort of developed a keen

24
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:56,060
interest in memory forensics threat

25
00:01:53,869 --> 00:02:00,110
intelligence reverse engineering and

26
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:05,210
malware analysis so that's that's where

27
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:07,970
I'm coming from I've been doing mostly

28
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:12,230
reverse engineering the past year and I

29
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:14,410
made two reports during that year one

30
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:18,320
for an information still remember and

31
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:22,910
now for dark red version two which is a

32
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:26,720
a basically red I think this is my third

33
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:31,459
presentation overall so I just started

34
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:36,140
presenting last year and yeah I'll try

35
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:39,220
to keep going so let's talk about the

36
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:41,350
origins and the source of the malware

37
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:44,500
basically when I

38
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:46,060
first encountered the smell there I try

39
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:50,560
to sort of ascertain that it's coming

40
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:54,610
from and what I gather it is it's mostly

41
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,460
some joint work from previous malware's

42
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:00,760
for example it was the absent loader and

43
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:04,870
the light HTTP these were sort of the

44
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:09,250
inspiration for this malware and those

45
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:11,200
previous members were both made public

46
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,290
on github so you can look it up and

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,980
learn the bits about themselves

48
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:21,660
those humors basically made for

49
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:23,590
educational purposes and I think the

50
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,720
developer of this malware took a lot of

51
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:31,150
inspiration from those from those two

52
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:34,810
mothers oh yeah you got a lot of these

53
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,790
disclaimers it seems like every rare

54
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,430
developer putting up some sort of

55
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:42,820
disclaimer now you know they try to

56
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:45,160
avoid some sort of responsibility by

57
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:48,130
saying you know this software is not to

58
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,410
be used maliciously for example while on

59
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:52,359
the other side its whole purpose is to

60
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:59,440
be used maliciously so it's kind of

61
00:03:52,360 --> 00:04:02,020
interesting and basically just one

62
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,020
question remains if it's it's all

63
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:07,000
illegal then why it is advising only

64
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:11,730
otherwise advertised on underground

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:17,070
cybercrime forums yeah I guess the

66
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:17,070
developer doesn't even know that until

67
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:26,469
the week there's a big huge collection

68
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:32,740
of never source code on github now under

69
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:35,320
the account the tlg IT I think he houses

70
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,450
a really big collection of leaked nether

71
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,930
source code and dark rat was also

72
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:42,670
amongst those those codes and the

73
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,520
developer of this malware went to the

74
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:48,820
trouble of opening several pull requests

75
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,159
and issues on this repo you know saying

76
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:54,380
hey you're not permitted to share my

77
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:58,370
malicious code which is kind of weird

78
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:02,890
she also says this isn't open-source and

79
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:06,410
I'm like what why this is malicious code

80
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:08,240
and he again goes to the trouble saying

81
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:13,310
you know this code is vulnerable and

82
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:17,060
it's for educational purposes which is

83
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:20,480
kind of dodgy then the maintainer of the

84
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:23,630
account you know replies the infection

85
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:26,750
saying hey I doubt your venti or local

86
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:34,040
government to register your illegal

87
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:36,410
activities so yeah she's fair point but

88
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,770
he keeps bargaining you know leaving his

89
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:42,110
account so he says please try to add me

90
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,650
here and let's talk about this so he's

91
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:48,980
trying to get the contents or the

92
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:51,169
malware's source code to be removed but

93
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:56,030
I guess the maintainer won't won't

94
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:59,930
remove it so one of the source for this

95
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:04,729
malware was the light HTTP malware which

96
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:06,830
is HTTP botnet and once I started

97
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:09,170
digging further down into the origins

98
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:12,590
and the comings of this malware

99
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:14,360
it became clear that the guy took a lot

100
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:19,429
of inspiration from these previous works

101
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:21,200
and basically as you can see that's how

102
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,990
the first version of the dark red came

103
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,870
to be the guy just basically went and

104
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:29,120
changed some parameters renamed some

105
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,670
classes functions and that's how the

106
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,360
first version came to be which is

107
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:38,210
honestly is a bit lame but I like these

108
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,920
comparisons for two reason two reasons

109
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:45,530
one of them is it just goes to show that

110
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:49,250
how easy it has become to develop a

111
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:53,690
simple matter for example in C++ or C

112
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:55,670
sharp you don't really need to know code

113
00:06:53,690 --> 00:07:00,070
that much you can just basically take

114
00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:06,590
code from already existing report repos

115
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:07,790
secondly this kind of shows that you

116
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,849
know these

117
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:13,040
there's perpetrators or you can call

118
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:18,680
them script titties don't really know

119
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:21,500
about operational security and this just

120
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,630
shows that you know github never forgets

121
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:29,120
so you can find all sort of information

122
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:30,370
on early pull requests but who is this

123
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,670
guy

124
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:37,400
he goes by the name dark spider and he

125
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:41,510
had multiple accounts on many social

126
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,609
platforms like github base beam but all

127
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:46,580
of these separate accounts could be tied

128
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:50,900
up into one single identity because his

129
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,650
object was so bad on on the github

130
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,190
account

131
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:57,260
he states that you know he's a web web

132
00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:01,550
developer and a security researcher as

133
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:03,710
well which kind of brings me to the

134
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:05,750
point you know I'm not sure if you saw

135
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:11,690
the matrix but there's this specific

136
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:15,200
scene with agent Smith and you know mr.

137
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:18,350
Anderson being apprehended and agent

138
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,860
Smith just goes like you know hey mr.

139
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:24,410
Anderson it seems you're living two

140
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:27,800
lives now you know in one of them you're

141
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:31,430
a programmer for a respectable software

142
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:35,000
company as the guy claims to be on the

143
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:38,150
right side on the slide on the other

144
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:45,890
hand at night for example he's most

145
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:49,640
likely a hacker or he who knows probably

146
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:51,860
he's a vigilante at night and you know

147
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:59,540
in real life he's Bruce Wayne living as

148
00:08:51,860 --> 00:09:03,290
a playboy so the product or the malware

149
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:05,300
was mostly advertised on hack forums and

150
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:07,880
some other small-time or underground

151
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,280
forums and this guy would often you know

152
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:13,790
bolster up the fact that he's doing

153
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,620
quality coding he would often post

154
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:18,079
screenshots of his machine or the

155
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:21,200
development environment he was coding in

156
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,380
and again just the

157
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,930
just show some amateurish level of

158
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:29,480
Maverick coding and as you can see on

159
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:33,979
the slide he would post some screenshots

160
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,810
of his desktop and obviously when this

161
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,610
opportunity comes you can spot some

162
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:41,239
really interesting things like he's

163
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:43,730
using some German language like cogent a

164
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,459
William is a bish Lawson obviously is

165
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:49,790
coming from a German keyboard or alia

166
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:52,599
Laila layout so we can kind of put a

167
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:55,099
picture together that this some of

168
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,870
German origins

169
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:03,529
maybe he's residing in Germany

170
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:05,329
Switzerland or Austria who knows these

171
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:08,540
are some of the functionalities that the

172
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:11,510
malware heads I think you guys can

173
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:14,449
already sense there's some really script

174
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,519
kiddie amateurish level behind this but

175
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:20,630
there's been some interesting

176
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:24,940
functionalities among the way and these

177
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:24,939
are some of the interesting functions

178
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:31,819
I'd like to detail one of them which was

179
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:36,620
kind of interesting for me it was hiding

180
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:38,269
the c2 server address this guy

181
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:41,029
implemented the rather interesting

182
00:10:38,269 --> 00:10:45,079
process where he would have a base being

183
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:48,050
URL a encryption key which turned out to

184
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:51,229
be a rc4 encryption key both in the

185
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:53,990
sample and the sample would go out to

186
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:55,519
this space being URL grab the contents

187
00:10:53,990 --> 00:11:00,260
which was as you can see on the

188
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:03,440
screenshot a base64 encoded string the

189
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:06,170
sample would decode that and it would

190
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,250
give out a binary blob now that blob

191
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:12,620
would be decrypted with the rc4 key and

192
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:16,010
then you would have the c2 server

193
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:19,370
address so it's kind of a I would say a

194
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:22,189
small-time or alpha station but I think

195
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:27,589
it had some real creativity which was

196
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:30,319
interesting for me one of the many

197
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:33,060
features was having some sort of anti

198
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:35,849
debugging capabilities

199
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:39,569
I would say these are really simple

200
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:42,750
checks for checking whether you're in a

201
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:46,439
debugging environment and all of these

202
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:48,720
could be a sort of could be avoided or

203
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:55,439
circumvented on the fly

204
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:58,170
by just patching the few bytes even went

205
00:11:55,439 --> 00:12:01,219
to the bank to use some interesting

206
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:06,870
instructions like the RTT SC instruction

207
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:12,509
where the sample would count the elapsed

208
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:15,810
ticks for example and these checks again

209
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:21,930
could be circumvented by simply just

210
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:23,489
replacing a few bytes in a debugger the

211
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:26,339
mother also had some functionality to

212
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:31,230
detect and if sort of a vs on the

213
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:35,209
machine it was using a built-in function

214
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:41,730
or feature the WMI command sets

215
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:44,219
specifically the wql and this feature

216
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:48,089
felt like a real a bit a little bit

217
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:51,660
incomplete because the simply would just

218
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:53,970
report back the status grab the name of

219
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:57,209
the AV present on the machine and send

220
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:59,759
it back to the c2 server so I think it

221
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:03,359
was kind of incomplete and the developer

222
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:09,420
meant to further develop this part of

223
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:14,639
the code the sample would also have a

224
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:17,519
capability to save deletion which I'm

225
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,220
sure you guys see it was really

226
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:24,089
amateurish pumping a CMD shell and

227
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:30,990
basically just forcing a quiet deletion

228
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:34,290
of the file from the disk it also had an

229
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:36,990
interesting technique that it was using

230
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:40,829
it's called a process hollowing they're

231
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:46,420
basically any malware now can sort of a

232
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:48,699
map or hollow out a memory

233
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,660
from a process and basically just

234
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,890
overwrite or switch out that legitimate

235
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:57,760
memory of the process with certain

236
00:13:53,890 --> 00:14:00,069
malicious code these are some of the API

237
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:05,770
calls that he would use to do to achieve

238
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:09,970
this now

239
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:12,760
this developer would go and also sell

240
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:14,710
his source version of the malware which

241
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,630
means basically he would grant access to

242
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:19,560
the source code and also supply

243
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:22,480
customers with the Builder itself

244
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:25,900
builders come into picture when you're

245
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,730
trying to deploy at mass for example you

246
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:30,790
want to sell the product or the malware

247
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,040
to more and more customers and basically

248
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:36,010
you want to switch out for example the

249
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:39,959
mutex is the user agent or the spread

250
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:43,060
tags the page being URLs in this case

251
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:51,870
and it's fairly easy to use these

252
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:54,640
builders after the builders are solved

253
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:57,790
basically I noticed that this guy would

254
00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:01,390
start developing certain plugins for the

255
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:05,280
c2 panels for example the guys would

256
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:08,380
have plugins for example a DDoS module

257
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:10,270
monaro minor or even a steal or that

258
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:17,200
would steal students credentials from

259
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:23,220
your browsers um this is how the panel

260
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:26,320
looks like got all of these colors and

261
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:29,380
these are the tasks that you could run

262
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,940
or execute from the c2 panel basically

263
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:33,100
you had the capability to update the

264
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:37,360
malware uninstall it kill the

265
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:41,080
persistence of it or even to deploy the

266
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:51,610
Monaro miner launch the DDS DDoS module

267
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:55,410
as well now once you face a c2 panel as

268
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:58,510
a researcher or a male analyst or a

269
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,469
threat Intel guy first you would do some

270
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:02,560
sort of animation

271
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:06,220
on the c2 server see you know what kind

272
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,930
of resources are available and in this

273
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,980
specific case it's it was quite

274
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:14,880
interesting that you would find a

275
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:19,410
resource under that get slash config

276
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,410
which obviously is a big no-no

277
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,130
this again proves that the guy doesn't

278
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:27,819
even know about operational security

279
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:31,600
death match and as you can see on the

280
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:33,910
screenshot the whole panel though or the

281
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,830
source of the panel was hosted under

282
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:38,829
this URL so basically you could just

283
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:45,550
clone it and get all the files that

284
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:49,090
would go with the c2 panel or for this

285
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:51,430
matter you can go ahead and call /index

286
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:56,100
that who that would list all the files

287
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:58,300
and basically could just parse the name

288
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,790
parameter from the files and put

289
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:08,198
together all the lists all the files

290
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:10,480
that were present on the c2 server now

291
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:13,689
it turns out this panel also had

292
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,030
specific vulnerability in it but first I

293
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:19,750
have to start with the disclaimer if you

294
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:21,939
start to play around panels you have to

295
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,829
be very careful because in some in

296
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:29,080
certain countries this is not allowed

297
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:32,110
and obviously I just grabbed the copy of

298
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:36,429
the panel and played around this on a

299
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:39,870
local VM so again this is a local

300
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:43,630
proof-of-concept so the main question is

301
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:46,659
and you might be wondering how would you

302
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:48,220
get access into these panels obviously

303
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:51,190
they would come with some sort of

304
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:53,920
username or password login and there's a

305
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:57,190
way to circumvent that on the right side

306
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:59,710
you can see a screenshot that shows once

307
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,930
a machine is infected this is the kind

308
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:04,630
of c2 traffic that would be sent to this

309
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:08,020
server it would contain this request

310
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:12,900
parameter and as you can see this is a

311
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,900
base64 encoded blob

312
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:21,360
now upon decoding this sort of base64

313
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:24,720
blob you would get these parameters as

314
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,928
you can see it collects for example the

315
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,960
computer named GPU named CPU name from

316
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:34,020
the machine and as I started playing

317
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,539
around this and you can spot on the

318
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:39,530
screenshot you can just basically insert

319
00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:43,140
a script tag to the computer name

320
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:46,020
resource and I'm sure if you're into pen

321
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:48,600
testing and know about the XSS this is

322
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:51,480
the first thing that you would try on on

323
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:56,340
a site and as you can see on the right

324
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:59,880
side it was successfully sent in so

325
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:02,760
basically once you record this these

326
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,520
parameters and sending the request to

327
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,820
the c2 server up on the next time the

328
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:13,168
administrator is logging into the panel

329
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:15,539
this window would open up with the text

330
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:22,590
1 so that means the exercise was

331
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:24,600
successful there's certainly a window of

332
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:27,449
opportunity here and we could further

333
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:30,059
exploit this by exchanging that script

334
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:32,820
tag with something more advanced so

335
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:35,789
let's say we can switch it with a iframe

336
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:39,030
that's pointing to a external resource

337
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:42,470
now in that external resource you can

338
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:46,918
put any code basically but in this case

339
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:50,820
generated a CSRF birth payload that

340
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:55,289
would create a new years new user on the

341
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:59,460
c2 panel so once this gets encoded again

342
00:19:55,289 --> 00:20:01,500
with basics before and it gets sent to

343
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,090
the c2 server the next time the

344
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,700
administrator is logging into the panel

345
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:09,570
he doesn't even know there's a new user

346
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:17,010
created so that's one way to sort of

347
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:21,600
achieve this now I'm coming to the point

348
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:22,200
where I think we need to discuss about

349
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,240
something

350
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:29,049
it's about IO C's and TTP's

351
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:34,690
because I'm sort of starting to realize

352
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:38,379
a common theme here you know there's

353
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:41,260
this vicious circle it starts by a bad

354
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:43,659
guy or a perpetrator writing code then

355
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:46,870
releasing it then the researchers come

356
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:50,169
into play and analyze the malware they

357
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:52,840
sort of release IOC ste TPS around it

358
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:57,580
because it's new stuff and everybody

359
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:59,439
needs to know about these so I'm not

360
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:02,230
sure if you know but obviously

361
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,140
perpetrators and my other writers also

362
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:10,590
read these blogs and iOS's TTP's and

363
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:13,570
they sort of react to it in a way this

364
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:17,049
sometimes creates challenges because

365
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:19,928
your advantages are now gone and the bad

366
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:21,970
guys are often you know realigning their

367
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:25,210
techniques migrating from

368
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:32,260
infrastructures and this creates real

369
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:33,720
problems sometimes now on the 5th of

370
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:37,240
November

371
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,700
basically I released some sort of gist

372
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,399
and I OCS to github and Twitter as well

373
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:47,590
and the developer of the nether sort of

374
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:49,270
approached me on my social account which

375
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:56,230
you could say is a bit dodgy again

376
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:58,720
because I'm maybe not upset aware on the

377
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:02,380
8th of November again after a couple of

378
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:06,510
days this guy also announced that you

379
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:09,070
know he would retire and he left a

380
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:16,929
goodbye message on one of the discourse

381
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:19,779
server that he was using I just wanted

382
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:21,899
to briefly touch on a topic that's I

383
00:22:19,779 --> 00:22:25,120
think really important in the community

384
00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:27,879
once I release these iOS's and TTP's I

385
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,279
get a lot of positive feedback from a

386
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,799
couple of the guys from the researcher

387
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:36,429
community and I would like to also

388
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:38,550
inspire you and advocate this sort of

389
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:42,650
behavior because I think

390
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:45,659
this field is about sharing knowledge

391
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:49,500
the more you know the better detection

392
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:54,720
you can write basically or even react to

393
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:57,090
sort of brie cheese or pentas and I feel

394
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,200
like we should keep on doing this we

395
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:01,350
should keep releasing

396
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:04,260
iOS's TTP's and i really liked how

397
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:06,179
others complimented my work added some

398
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:15,270
additional comments to it

399
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:19,530
other i/o sees I wanted to finish off by

400
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:22,710
stating a couple of ending thoughts one

401
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:24,780
of them is as you could saw in the

402
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:27,360
slides these perpetrators are really not

403
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:33,149
upset aware they don't have any sort of

404
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:36,270
cyber hygiene and I install the cases we

405
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:39,660
were able to bus these actors you know

406
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:43,310
we found holes issues we see two panels

407
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:46,800
and exploiting these in a way and

408
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:50,159
learning more about these issues we

409
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:53,220
could really find these guys pass the

410
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:56,940
information of to law enforcement for

411
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:59,280
example but what will happen when these

412
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,760
guys learn more about operational

413
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,660
security

414
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:07,170
I feel like eventually we need to find

415
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:09,650
other ways to bust some of these some of

416
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,650
these perps

417
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:16,830
keep iOS's PDP's do an inner circle

418
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:20,250
that's a question I feel like once you

419
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:22,350
release I OCS and TTP's the advantage

420
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:26,840
you have will certain this appear over

421
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:28,800
time these guys overreact change tactics

422
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:33,540
migrate from infrastructures to

423
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:37,320
different infrastructure and sometimes

424
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:39,960
you know there's a real opportunity when

425
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,669
these guys overreact to react because

426
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,880
that's the time then they may also make

427
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:47,490
some mistakes and you can fight some

428
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,060
again some issues holes in their

429
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,060
infrastructure

430
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:56,050
but there's a real question here whether

431
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:58,510
you should release it publicly you know

432
00:24:56,050 --> 00:25:03,540
hold it to your inner circles perhaps or

433
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:03,540
even not shares anything at all

434
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:09,190
engaging thought talking to perpetrators

435
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:13,240
I would say that's definitely a big

436
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:15,130
no-no don't leave a surface for them and

437
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,920
I kind of felt like I was in the

438
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:20,559
crosshairs when he approached me some

439
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:23,410
would say you know there they would be

440
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:27,610
flattened by by an Alfred

441
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:29,950
if they were to approach him but in my

442
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:32,530
case I felt like I may have missed

443
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:36,580
something on the operational security

444
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:40,050
side because once he approached me I

445
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:42,699
felt like you know I was a target also

446
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:45,610
you should check your local laws whether

447
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:47,950
it's allowed to hack into c2 panels I

448
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:51,610
know for a fact for example in the u.s.

449
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:58,260
it's considered hacking back under the

450
00:25:51,610 --> 00:26:01,540
CFE CFAA law so you should really not

451
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:04,570
attack this sort of c2 panels if you if

452
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:07,629
your government doesn't allow it and

453
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:09,639
finally I feel active force tech

454
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:12,720
community is one of the best communities

455
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:16,390
out there and I would urge everyone to

456
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,340
cheer information spread knowledge let

457
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:20,590
everybody know if you have something or

458
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:23,230
you've worked on because I feel like

459
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:25,419
everyone can just chip in and Continent

460
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:25,840
the other versus work and I feel like

461
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:29,550
this

462
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,550
that's that goes a long way

463
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:35,850
thanks for listening thanks for having

464
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:39,610
me thanks for the disobey organizers

465
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:42,490
it's been an honor to present here don't

466
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:46,740
forget it's Valentine's Day kiss your

467
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:51,930
loved ones and thank you guys

468
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:51,930
[Applause]
