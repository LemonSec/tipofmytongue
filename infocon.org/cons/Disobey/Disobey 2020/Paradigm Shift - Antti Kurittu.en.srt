3
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:42,700
hi how are you mr. Kurata good hi my

4
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,559
name is auntie correcto

5
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,930
and I'm going to be talking about

6
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,349
something way less technical than it was

7
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:53,590
did and I hope we are happy with that

8
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,629
so I work with Nixa corporation now and

9
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,820
it's the digital forensics and Incident

10
00:00:55,629 --> 00:00:59,110
Response Team Lead before that I was

11
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,620
working with the government for eight

12
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:02,409
years

13
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:05,860
so I've been working a lot with users

14
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:08,590
and trying to help them and I have to

15
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,450
make a confession I really like

16
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,610
computers I really do

17
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:15,010
I've liked them since I was a young kid

18
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:18,430
I think I got my first computer when I

19
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:21,040
was six years old and it was a c64 I

20
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:24,010
always been fascinated with them and I

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,760
have no idea why and I want to ask you

22
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:29,440
guys a question

23
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:31,690
do you like computers yeah because a lot

24
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,158
of people don't but it's quite quite

25
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,740
obvious that you guys do because you're

26
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:38,189
here you're all hackers or wanna be

27
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,530
hackers future hackers past hackers

28
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:44,460
government people all sorts of people

29
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,780
but most of our people who use computers

30
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,419
don't really like computers that much

31
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,520
and why why is that why is that a

32
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:55,240
problem I'll try to explain to you why

33
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,908
that might be a problem because we ask

34
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,469
the people who create basically all the

35
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:02,560
software and hardware and all the

36
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:04,839
devices that we use we have this kind of

37
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,179
this mindset that we like the stuff and

38
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,960
we understand it now we speak the

39
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:13,030
language of computers and that's

40
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,950
actually really hard really really hard

41
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,410
and it takes a lot of time and a lot of

42
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,179
effort to learn that so isn't that just

43
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:24,700
great that we make everything as we like

44
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:29,230
it I'm not sure it is it's all good cuz

45
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:31,319
as technical people and engineers we

46
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:35,109
have a way of approaching these problems

47
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:37,329
so we designed software or a device and

48
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,209
then we give it to the user and the user

49
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:42,250
needs the computer to do their job these

50
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:43,099
days every job requires the use of

51
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,409
computer

52
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:47,869
well not absolutely every job but most

53
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:50,030
jobs I'd say most white-collar jobs at

54
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,939
least and a lot of blue-collar jobs too

55
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,409
so let's say you're a carpenter and you

56
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:56,060
want to sell something to somebody you

57
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:58,459
need a website then you need an email

58
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,769
address and you need all these technical

59
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:02,689
infrastructure when actually what you

60
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:05,599
want to do is build things out of wood

61
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:08,719
which actually is a great hobby but if

62
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,858
that's your passion you should also for

63
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,319
some reason be passionate about

64
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:14,959
computers to be able to use them very

65
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,469
well so what our solution to this

66
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,599
problem has been security training like

67
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:23,120
we be into security trainings I think a

68
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:25,548
lot of people here have actually held

69
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,500
security trainings for their users on

70
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:31,669
people or at least try to explain their

71
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:33,650
mom or sister or dad why security is

72
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:37,159
important and how to use the Internet

73
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:39,199
securely and we have these problems okay

74
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:44,239
users make mistakes and those mistakes

75
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:46,250
turns into security incidents so what we

76
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,439
do is we educate the users some more

77
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:52,400
okay they make more creative mistakes

78
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:54,430
because our education is well to be

79
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,829
honest it's it's failing pretty badly

80
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:01,819
and why is that why is security training

81
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:04,069
failing so bad I think there's a bunch

82
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:06,530
of reasons to this and one of the

83
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:08,780
reasons that usually comes up is that

84
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,329
the security training itself is not

85
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,579
sufficiently complicated

86
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:16,130
well complicated maybe it's a bad word

87
00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:19,310
comprehensive and users don't want to

88
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:21,199
learn it I think that is that is one of

89
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,330
the key points the learning resistance

90
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,389
because if you're not passionate about

91
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:28,430
computers and care deeply about them

92
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:30,860
understand how they work it's really

93
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:35,270
really hard to teach you how to use them

94
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:37,849
securely as everybody is here at least

95
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:41,030
about my age have learned to play the

96
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:43,729
recorder at school remember that it's

97
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:46,940
this plastic device its main purpose is

98
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:49,070
to drive parents and neighbors mad and

99
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,190
how many of we us still play that

100
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:54,020
instrument well I'm not seeing a lot of

101
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,330
hands one hand well done sir

102
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,729
professionally just not

103
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,680
yeah professional recorder player back

104
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:02,930
there that's beautiful but not a lot of

105
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,520
people but you've all been there sitting

106
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:07,039
in the classroom with a bunch of other

107
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:10,000
kids getting this plastic thing shoved

108
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,020
in your mouth and told to make music

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,490
doesn't really work I said well you

110
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,840
weren't that interested in the recorder

111
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,490
you wanted to play the guitar because

112
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,289
you listened to Iron Maiden and you saw

113
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,720
the guys on a stage and thought that's

114
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:22,610
really cool okay now some of you are

115
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,430
probably thinking but I trained my users

116
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:28,159
and now they are better they actually

117
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:31,069
know how to use the computer more

118
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:33,139
securely and that is true it has small

119
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:35,840
benefits because you can teach muscle

120
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:38,210
memory to people you can teach them what

121
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,150
to click and what to avoid but the

122
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,859
problem with muscle memory is that it

123
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,960
doesn't adapt at all

124
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,849
it's just a series of movements that you

125
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,219
teach people and when the security

126
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:53,560
paradigm moves and the things change

127
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:53,560
well the muscle memory can't keep up

128
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:00,770
there's a bunch of I call these learning

129
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:04,610
gaps like when you're trying to teach

130
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:07,400
people how to use the computer properly

131
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:10,009
because computers are extremely

132
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,380
complicated so we have a cognitive gap

133
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:15,560
there it's trying to teach somebody how

134
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,509
to use a computer it actually takes a

135
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,000
lot of intelligence to understand the

136
00:06:17,509 --> 00:06:22,729
conceptual complicated abstract things

137
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,400
that make up an operating system or a

138
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:27,440
file system or how a software works or

139
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,620
how the internet works so if you can't

140
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,229
bridge that gap if the person just well

141
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,990
to put it bluntly if they're not smart

142
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:37,818
enough to understand the concepts how

143
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,650
can you teach that person how to use the

144
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:41,750
computer will you go back to muscle

145
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,159
memory go down and left and click and

146
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,349
then you type word and then you press

147
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:47,000
ENTER and there you have word processor

148
00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:50,360
and you can write your letter to Grandma

149
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,039
there you go another gap is of course

150
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,419
the interest gap if you're not

151
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:55,520
interested in computers there are

152
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:58,310
nuisance to you something that you have

153
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,370
to use because your job requires it your

154
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:04,610
boss requires it and well every job does

155
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:07,279
now it's really hard to bridge that gap

156
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,110
get somebody interested in it and of

157
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,159
course there's a generational gap I've

158
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,520
should have put too

159
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,170
here because I don't think it's only

160
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:18,760
true to say that old people have trouble

161
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:21,440
with computers so I think young people

162
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:24,200
can have as much trouble with computers

163
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,870
as old people as we think okay digital

164
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,270
natives they're born without smart

165
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,620
device in their hand and that is the key

166
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,210
actually they're born with a smart

167
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,520
device in their hand they're not born

168
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,950
and you are using general-purpose

169
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,560
computers anymore that much they have

170
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,960
smartphones and they use those and using

171
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,840
a smart phone doesn't really teach you

172
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,400
anything about computing and using apps

173
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,979
doesn't really teach you much about

174
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,060
computing you have to use a computer and

175
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,880
you have to be interested in the

176
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:55,340
computer to learn how it works and of

177
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,750
course with older people your hearing is

178
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,390
getting worse your eyesight is getting

179
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,020
worse your hands aren't working so well

180
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,630
anymore

181
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:05,090
and if you get to bridge all these gaps

182
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:08,270
then sure you can train somebody to be

183
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:11,929
good but if you can't what what should

184
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:14,539
be done what what solution do we have

185
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:17,030
the problem of getting somebody with

186
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:19,670
let's say two or three of these gaps to

187
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:22,369
use a computer securely they might be

188
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:24,710
really good at what they do they might

189
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:28,070
have very good professional competence

190
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:30,680
they might be CEOs of a company and we

191
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:33,409
probably can think of examples of CEOs

192
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,830
of a company doing something that for us

193
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:39,468
to secure cybersecurity professionals is

194
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:42,380
amazingly dumb like sending money to a

195
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:43,969
Nigerian prince because well they might

196
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:49,700
be smart but they're not smart in the

197
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:53,390
right way and as the people who are

198
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:55,970
creating the digital world we I think

199
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:58,430
our baseline is in the wrong place our

200
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:01,190
baseline is somewhere over there in the

201
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:04,219
middle because we're up there being

202
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:06,050
linux penguins and understanding all

203
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,210
this stuff and being really really up to

204
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:10,010
date with everything and all the threat

205
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:12,770
actors and threat hunting and whatever

206
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:14,900
we know that stuff so we think that our

207
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:17,510
regular users are just a couple of

208
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:20,390
notches below us incompetence

209
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:23,569
perhaps so that's where we put our

210
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,930
target but at least my experience has

211
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,480
been

212
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:29,959
that even very intelligent very smart

213
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,089
people are quite less competent with

214
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,640
computers than what we think about so

215
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:37,130
we're down somewhere over there they can

216
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,569
open an internet browser but good luck

217
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,490
having them explain to you what's the

218
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:43,130
difference between the world wide web

219
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,750
and the Internet some of them don't know

220
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,180
what the difference is between Facebook

221
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:50,450
and the internet or how to behave in

222
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:57,319
very Facebook and I think there is

223
00:09:50,450 --> 00:10:00,070
something that we can do about it so I

224
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,080
was thinking about this subject and

225
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:05,750
trying to see what other people smarter

226
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:09,260
than me have thought about this and I

227
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:11,990
really didn't find much so I came up

228
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,970
with a word so I didn't find a proper

229
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,640
word so I came up with my own and I call

230
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:20,240
this logical depth and this is all the

231
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:23,000
accrued ways of using computers that

232
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,720
were founded years and years ago decades

233
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:32,930
ago actually like remember this one

234
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:34,670
weird guy he's a perfect example of the

235
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:37,609
mindset that we have we call this guy a

236
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:40,790
floppy disk it's neither it's a rigid

237
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:43,279
square but it's a floppy disk for us for

238
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:45,800
some reason it has a disk inside it and

239
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,439
the previous version was floppy but this

240
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:52,160
is still a floppy disk and even today in

241
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:55,910
word in 2020 I still click a picture of

242
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,740
a floppy disk to save my files which to

243
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,540
me of course well that's obvious it's

244
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,150
always been a floppy disk I've had this

245
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,529
but talked to a 20 year old ask them

246
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,120
have you ever seen a floppy disk they're

247
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:08,480
just gonna think you treaty printed a

248
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,120
Save icon and this kind of stuff is

249
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,209
really prevalent in our computing

250
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,800
environment like all things that we have

251
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:17,420
built into the muscle memory of our

252
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,939
users and told them that this is the

253
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,620
paradigm of using a computer this is

254
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,750
what you have to do you take that weird

255
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:26,810
Square and you click it and that will

256
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:28,579
save your file and this is what I call

257
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,839
logical depth and I think this is one of

258
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:35,839
the things that we should start trying

259
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:38,399
to get rid of I think the relationship

260
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,370
between people and computer

261
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,380
for not us it's it's not abusive for us

262
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:46,529
but for a lot of people it is an abusive

263
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:49,290
relationship because a lot of attackers

264
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:51,720
take advantage of the fact that a lot of

265
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,730
people are intimidated and scared of

266
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,630
their computers and I think they're

267
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,839
gonna break it

268
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:59,160
that was well previously in those days

269
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,690
you made a wrong command you could

270
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,730
actually break the whole thing but with

271
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:05,009
a Windows 10 it's kind of hard to break

272
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,420
it well of course we try cuz we're

273
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:09,180
hackers we try to break it in different

274
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,259
ways but a lot of people are just

275
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:13,769
worried that they're gonna do it by

276
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:18,709
accident now we have a lot of outdated

277
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:21,240
concepts logical depth technical depth I

278
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:24,420
think it's just way too complicated like

279
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,970
these buttons here these are actually

280
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,790
security controls that have been boot

281
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:32,430
put into Microsoft Word to stop people

282
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:35,189
shooting themselves in the leg but are

283
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:37,680
these actually what we should be doing

284
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:39,990
like putting buttons there just enable

285
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,219
editing it actually means run all the

286
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:45,779
magma macros and the other thing is if

287
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,279
you want to print the document and you

288
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:49,139
think I'm not gonna get affected by a

289
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,329
piece of paper well you're probably

290
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:54,360
right about that but you have to enable

291
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:56,689
anything to be able to print it makes

292
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,360
absolutely no sense at all even to me

293
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,920
and trying to explain to my mother why

294
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,959
these things work like that and what

295
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,699
these buttons mean it's it's a

296
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:07,829
non-starter I can't do that I just don't

297
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:09,180
click it just don't click it but I have

298
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:13,050
to click it sometimes oh okay well if

299
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:15,410
you have to then you click it they tried

300
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:20,250
to fix that once remember this one a

301
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:22,199
Windows 8 yeah Metro it's a beautiful

302
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,060
user interface I think is one of the

303
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:25,829
worst things I've ever seen it's

304
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,719
absolutely terrible and they they

305
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:29,010
thought about this issue too but they

306
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,899
were thinking of a different paradigm

307
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,389
they weren't thinking about usability as

308
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:35,100
such they were thinking about

309
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:36,810
touchscreen-based usability because the

310
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,060
writing was on the wall tablets are

311
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:41,160
coming the iPad is coming we are going

312
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,779
to start using our index fingers to

313
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,519
interact with the computer instead of

314
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:47,490
the mouse so that's what they came up

315
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:50,069
with everybody hated it absolutely hated

316
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:51,120
it and they came got rid of it pretty

317
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:53,040
fast

318
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,200
and for good reason of course and

319
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:59,490
Windows 10 brought back the Start menu

320
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,380
with a big round of applause from

321
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,210
everybody and I think the reason for

322
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,700
that is that it was in muscle memory you

323
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:07,650
go down and left to the lower hand

324
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,380
corner and you click and then a menu

325
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:12,089
opens and all your software is there and

326
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:16,050
just a couple of weeks ago my dad guys

327
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:18,000
asked me that can I pin or put this

328
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:21,060
program somewhere else than the Start

329
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,550
menu he's been a CEO of different

330
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:26,369
companies for a long time I was like

331
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:28,410
dude of course you can and then I showed

332
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,520
him how and he can't still do it he

333
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,319
can't do it it didn't go through his

334
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,720
muscle memory so I had him do it and now

335
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,720
he knows how to do it so please when

336
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,930
fixing it just think about the actual

337
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,870
issue because this this is just it's

338
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:44,370
just making it worse but they did

339
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,820
something really cool cuz Clippy

340
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:49,980
remember that guy yeah

341
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:53,940
the older gentleman in the front who

342
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:56,040
remembers Clippy Clippy was an attempt

343
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,020
to help the user because okay our user

344
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,969
interface is so complicated people don't

345
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,829
know how to use our software so we'll

346
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,390
just put this cartoon paperclip there

347
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,790
and you can ask questions from it I

348
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:07,680
didn't of course didn't work this was in

349
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:09,540
the 1990s we didn't have the computing

350
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,430
power we didn't have the machine

351
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,439
learning algorithms or the web back in

352
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,819
which it could use or crowdsource or

353
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,300
anything but I think well something like

354
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:20,160
this should be brought back using modern

355
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,199
technologies where you could actually

356
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,850
get help using the computer just give it

357
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:28,110
tasks like take a small step towards

358
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:30,270
talking to your computer like on Star

359
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:31,860
Trek instead of messing around with

360
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:33,270
Excel yourself you can just tell it'll

361
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,940
get correlate all the names here and

362
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:39,000
it's it's gonna be done so bring it back

363
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:44,910
one day maybe not that guy but maybe

364
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,200
someone else I think the problem is in

365
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:50,750
part that it's getting really

366
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:52,709
complicated it's really really complex

367
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:56,430
computers today general-purpose

368
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:58,920
computers can do so much you can browse

369
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:01,770
the web you can play games you can do

370
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:04,899
whatever with them and in the world of

371
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:06,939
IT it's driving really deep specialist

372
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:09,399
because we have experts on one domain

373
00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:11,349
and another domain and those domains

374
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:14,680
don't talk to each other we're very well

375
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:16,509
because if you have to be a really deep

376
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,998
expert on one subject to know all about

377
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:21,279
it we don't really have more of these

378
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:23,740
general computing experts anymore

379
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,839
even better er bina used to be one of

380
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,639
those people like he knew everything

381
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,519
about computers but who here knows

382
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:32,350
everything about computers now

383
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,269
like everything software and hardware

384
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:37,720
you might know everything about the

385
00:16:34,269 --> 00:16:41,740
let's say the tcp/ip stack and that's a

386
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:43,540
lot of information you have to have and

387
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,999
I think we're clinging to really really

388
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:49,660
outdated abstraction layers like does it

389
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:52,540
still in this day and age make sense to

390
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,519
talk about files like individual files

391
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:57,339
that we put in folders in directory

392
00:16:54,519 --> 00:17:00,369
structures on our hard drive and is that

393
00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:02,980
really are we doing that because we've

394
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:05,770
always done it that way we evolved to

395
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,599
that it's been decades of computing and

396
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:09,250
we still do that we just put files in

397
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,379
folders and we're really happy about it

398
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,929
it used to have an analogue in the real

399
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:16,539
world where you had folder cabinets

400
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:20,260
cabinets filing system where you had

401
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:22,510
files when you start your computer you

402
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,279
end up on the desktop well that made

403
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,449
sense when you had stuff on your desktop

404
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:27,309
and now you have that stuff on your

405
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:30,809
computer but now the thing that you have

406
00:17:27,309 --> 00:17:34,149
on your desktop is your computer it's a

407
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:36,730
bit outdated there too and well just

408
00:17:34,149 --> 00:17:39,820
look at the keyboard and the mouse all

409
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:42,940
ancient things and it's just what the

410
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:45,490
users need a want or should we start

411
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:51,070
thinking about other solutions and just

412
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:54,059
start fresh maybe most of you know what

413
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:56,110
this is about it's about the number of

414
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:58,418
transistors in integrated circuits

415
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:00,428
basically the power of computing chips

416
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:04,750
over time and it's a logarithmic scale

417
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:07,890
so every step is a tenfold increase this

418
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:10,570
is excel in 1992 running on a pentium

419
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:14,100
looks kind of complicated and hard to

420
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:17,649
use okay we increase computing power

421
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,580
exponentially forget the next version of

422
00:18:17,649 --> 00:18:20,860
Excel

423
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,928
still really complicated to use the

424
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,908
basic idea is still the same you have

425
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:27,340
the cells here and a bunch of buttons up

426
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:28,840
there and god knows what they do you

427
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,480
have to go to a training course to find

428
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:34,120
out what they do okay we increase our

429
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,029
computing power yet again now we get

430
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,939
more resolution basically the same thing

431
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:43,750
again same buttons a bit more colors

432
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:46,419
looks a bit prettier and here we are no

433
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:48,610
we decided that we don't like colors so

434
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:50,799
we went back to gray and a bunch of

435
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:53,289
buttons basically still the same

436
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:56,139
software meanwhile we had a thousandfold

437
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:58,450
increase a thousandfold increase in

438
00:18:56,139 --> 00:19:01,090
transistor count but we're still

439
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:05,830
thinking about software the way we're

440
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:07,178
thinking about software in 1992 not sure

441
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:09,070
if I'm alone here but I just think

442
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:12,220
that's weird maybe we should put all

443
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:15,279
this computing power into better use

444
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:17,200
instead of just putting the colors into

445
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,630
Excel and then removing them up

446
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,970
absolutely it has new futures now it

447
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:25,000
does things that it didn't do before it

448
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:27,809
has 30 million lines of code I think now

449
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:34,779
the whole office suit that's huge

450
00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:37,240
absolutely huge so what happens if you

451
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:40,600
want to simplify things just make them a

452
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,639
lot more simple look I'm not trying to

453
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,649
bad-mouth this dude whose tweet is here

454
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:47,740
I was just thought that there was such a

455
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:51,250
perfect example of a tech guy's attitude

456
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:53,350
towards towards simpler things if I

457
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:55,210
think we need simpler things and the

458
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,980
customers think they need simpler things

459
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:59,110
so when Apple came out with the iPad

460
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:02,019
they didn't have much trouble selling

461
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:05,110
them his users love them he just poked

462
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:08,320
at it and it works I have a member when

463
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:11,168
my kids were two years old and they were

464
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,970
able to use an iPad a slap a Linux

465
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:15,370
computer in front of a two-year-old and

466
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:17,500
you get a traumatized child and you give

467
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:19,330
them an iPad they can just though I

468
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,549
press here the picture of the mouse and

469
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:22,720
I get the mouse game and then they press

470
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:25,720
the home button and they get to choose

471
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:29,190
another game beautiful perfection in

472
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:31,910
there for a child but for us as hackers

473
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:33,710
can't sideload stuff that's

474
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:35,570
I don't get to configure my window

475
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:38,240
manager I don't get to do all this and

476
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:41,120
that stuff and and we're the guys who

477
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,980
are creating software helping users and

478
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,889
our mindset is so different from them

479
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:48,950
because they love iPads and iPhones so

480
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:50,900
Paul for it a Microsoft guy really happy

481
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,060
about the new Windows Phone well we know

482
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:55,070
what happened there eight years later

483
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,919
who has a Windows Phone by the way a

484
00:20:55,070 --> 00:21:01,510
show of hands please

485
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:05,720
Jesus Christ okay well that's nice a

486
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:09,430
couple of you still have one forensics

487
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:11,720
yeah good reason to have one hates yeah

488
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:13,610
what happens is that the tech press

489
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,920
treats you like you're a retard and I

490
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,240
don't know well luckily this being the

491
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,000
Internet somebody summoned the

492
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:24,350
anti-sexism ghost and he got booed which

493
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,630
was good but the point is not to be an

494
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:28,280
Apple fanboy here it's just to say that

495
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:31,990
they I think they shifted the paradigm

496
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:35,540
there they didn't start creating a

497
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:37,910
Windows desktop optimized for touch

498
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,560
screens so that your Start menu just

499
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,750
takes you in a different planet and then

500
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:43,370
you see all these squares of colors and

501
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,230
then you're back on the desktop with

502
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,300
your app that you start from that they

503
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:50,560
started from scratch and they did

504
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:54,379
something else and once you get it right

505
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:55,940
there's not much reason to shift it

506
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:59,510
around that much anymore

507
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:01,970
after that there's an iPhone from 2008 I

508
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:04,820
think it's the first iPhone and there's

509
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:08,180
the latest iPhone 12 years later and yes

510
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:11,389
you can see it's been quite the same

511
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:13,610
they got rid of the home button now you

512
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:16,010
have to swipe up but that's not a very

513
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:19,370
big barrier of entry took me like three

514
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:20,870
months to master that and just swipe and

515
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:23,929
I'm kind of technical I don't want to

516
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:25,489
brag but you know but it's essentially

517
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:29,360
the same thing a customers love this

518
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:31,460
stuff when my elderly relatives or even

519
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,649
younger relatives asked me at what kind

520
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,540
of a computer I should buy just ask them

521
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:37,280
why would you want to buy a computer but

522
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:40,100
why would you do that and they're like

523
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:43,190
well I'm good question but exactly buy

524
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:45,379
an iPad and I do that for absolutely

525
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:47,630
selfish reasons reasons

526
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,490
once they buy an iPad they never call me

527
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:51,650
again to ask me about problems with it

528
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:53,900
they don't have problems with it just

529
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:56,120
runs and if it doesn't run well do a

530
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,010
factory reset everything's in iCloud all

531
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,060
your pictures and everything you don't

532
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,670
have to talk talk

533
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:04,669
tell them how to copy a punt bunch of

534
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:06,770
JPEG files from a folder called DCIM

535
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:11,120
which obviously means your pictures

536
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:12,740
right it's just all in iCloud as I had

537
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,389
an Android phone because I was a nerd I

538
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,950
wanted to get this coolest smartphone

539
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:19,790
and I got one and I was really happy

540
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:22,310
about the fact that I could sideload

541
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:24,409
apps and I could manage my files and I

542
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:26,419
could put folders there and do all this

543
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:28,580
cool tinkering stuff and I changed the

544
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:30,470
launcher and everything and when I got

545
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:33,050
an iPhone my first thought was where are

546
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:35,120
all my files well where are they how can

547
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:37,040
i browse this device and how can i get

548
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,379
deeper access india then I realized I

549
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:42,860
can't I took me a while to shift my

550
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:44,870
thinking about this that I started stop

551
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:47,629
thinking about JPEG files and started

552
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:51,409
thinking about my photos and I my photos

553
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:53,030
leaving the iCloud and the photos on

554
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,570
their Android phone can't find them

555
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,310
anywhere

556
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:57,260
I'm not sure where they are we've been

557
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,730
looking for them baby pictures there I

558
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:00,830
would have wanted to say but I did

559
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,690
something stupid put them on a hard

560
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:07,460
drive somewhere and then just chucked it

561
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:10,760
away I guess them I don't know it comes

562
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:13,910
down to this age-old question basically

563
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,980
for us as people who love to have the

564
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:18,410
freedom to use our devices any way we

565
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,640
want we have a desk full of people there

566
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:21,260
who will tell you that it's one of the

567
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:25,160
most important things in the world to

568
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:27,170
have freedom and I agree to a point is

569
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,240
when you take the rest of the population

570
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:31,610
not spending their weekend getting drunk

571
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,280
with other hackers and ask them would

572
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:38,510
you prefer a secure device or a device

573
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:41,240
that you can compile the kernel on it's

574
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:43,940
quite an obvious answer and instead of

575
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:46,070
trying to shove our way of thinking down

576
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,990
their throats and trying to get them to

577
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:51,470
understand this is the security the way

578
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:54,790
we understand it maybe we should give

579
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:58,310
them what they want a walled garden

580
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:58,970
stuff sinks to cloud biometric login no

581
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:01,960
passwords

582
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:05,240
nope in codes because I used to be a

583
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,159
detective at the Helsinki Police

584
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,620
Department and one of the easiest ways

585
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:11,960
to crack an iPhone is just to check the

586
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:15,350
suspects date of birth that was usually

587
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:17,030
their pin code slug and these are people

588
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:19,639
who kind of care about their operational

589
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:21,710
security sometimes but still when you

590
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,720
had a thumbprint thumbprint it's a lot

591
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:30,169
harder to crack we have to hold them

592
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:32,020
like this but still it's the question I

593
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:34,970
try to ask here is like why does

594
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:36,820
somebody who works in HR need a

595
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:41,539
turing-complete spreadsheet software

596
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:44,120
because the most I'd say 90% of Excel is

597
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:47,090
being used to compile a list of names of

598
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:49,070
people that is usually I've actually

599
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:51,199
designed a whole exercise using Excel

600
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,730
that's not what it's supposed to do if

601
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,140
you can't even type into the cells it

602
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:56,539
starts doing all this kind of weird

603
00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:06,409
magic you have to start with a tick it's

604
00:25:56,539 --> 00:26:09,799
yeah okay somebody's yelling their lap

605
00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:12,590
oh yeah a bad user user interfaces this

606
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:14,299
it sounds like a trivial thing but when

607
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,399
you take this to the physical world we

608
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:19,610
have examples of bad user interfaces

609
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,950
being fatal and I'm gonna use a few

610
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:24,590
classic ones one is a country singer

611
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:26,929
called John Denver who died in 1997 he

612
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:29,480
was an avid pilot he loved flying planes

613
00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:31,400
and he had built his own plane and the

614
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,470
cockpit configuration was such that

615
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,690
there's a fuel shutoff valve if you have

616
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:38,330
problems with the engines you can shut

617
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:40,130
off the fuel and you'd usually put it

618
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:42,049
somewhere in front of you but he had

619
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,780
decided or somebody else had decided I'm

620
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:46,309
not sure who to put it over his shoulder

621
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:48,649
and I'm not sure if you guys fly planes

622
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:50,720
but they have rudders and when you press

623
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:53,240
the rudder the plane does something like

624
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,429
this and when you have a fuel shutoff

625
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,320
valve over your shoulder and you have to

626
00:26:55,429 --> 00:26:59,780
quickly press it do something like this

627
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,340
and then you press down on the rudder

628
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:05,210
and then you lose control of the plane

629
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:07,370
and then you die and that's that's a

630
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:12,020
person killed by a bad user interface in

631
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:13,050
my opinion another one was this it

632
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,780
always liked to play this

633
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:17,879
what if they changed the way you drive

634
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,980
your car as often as they change how you

635
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,040
run your computer like how your

636
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,360
operating system works or software works

637
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,100
and they've done this a couple of times

638
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,080
but they'd still the basic configuration

639
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,790
is the same because it doesn't need to

640
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,620
be changed you have the gas and the

641
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:36,360
brake and the clutch

642
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:38,610
if you drive a manual car but Jeep came

643
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,590
up with this ingenious shifter that

644
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:42,840
stays in this place I think they gave it

645
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:44,939
a really cool name like mono static

646
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:47,850
shifter or something like that basically

647
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,800
it has just lights on top of it then you

648
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:51,840
push it and you hold it it goes to park

649
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:54,090
and you press it once it goes to reverse

650
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,070
and then it always returns to the same

651
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:58,020
position where it is and then you have

652
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,490
to check it with your eyes instead of

653
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,830
using your hand and you can feel where

654
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:06,270
it goes and Anton Yelchin was an

655
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:08,159
American actor born Russian actually who

656
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:10,320
played Chekhov in the new Star Wars

657
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,520
movies if you've seen those of course

658
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,810
you've seen those he was killed by this

659
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,790
actually killed they think it was

660
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:20,070
because of this he was got out of his

661
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:22,409
car and went to open a gate and the car

662
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:24,899
rolled over him and crushed him to death

663
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:26,490
and they recalled 1.1 million cars

664
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,100
because they had hundreds of accidents

665
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:35,210
just because they'd made a slight tweak

666
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:41,730
in the user interface of the car I think

667
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:45,540
this is something yeah we had one case

668
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:47,220
about this where I actually just saw the

669
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,840
headline so I'm not sure what happened

670
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,400
but I think there was a case even in

671
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:54,000
Finland where somebody was endangered

672
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:56,340
because using I'm not gonna say anything

673
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,740
cuz I'm not sure but this case was

674
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:00,419
confirmed is there was a bunch of nurses

675
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,030
who were giving chemotherapy to a young

676
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:04,320
girl and they needed to hydrate her cuz

677
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:06,389
it's it's really rough on the body

678
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,860
especially if you're young and they

679
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:10,050
forgot to hydrate her because the

680
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:13,590
software they were using to control and

681
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:15,990
monitor the treatment was so confusing

682
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,850
that these three nurses with over 10

683
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:20,070
years of combined experience none of

684
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:21,419
them in different shifts didn't pick up

685
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:23,220
on the fact that she hadn't been given

686
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:25,360
any loo it quits because they were using

687
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:28,030
something that looks like this

688
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,250
that's just terrible in my opinion just

689
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:33,850
to be using something like this and

690
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:37,030
especially when your job is that your

691
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:39,129
job is being a nurse you're not a

692
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:40,980
technical person you care about people

693
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:43,600
and you want to take care of people and

694
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:46,390
they force you to use complicated

695
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,790
software which endangers your patients

696
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:51,100
lives and one problem that they have

697
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:54,790
with medical software is that sometimes

698
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:59,199
they just change the positions of input

699
00:29:54,790 --> 00:30:00,610
input boxes or calculations or results

700
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,500
or something like that and people in

701
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,479
hurry they read the wrong numbers put in

702
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:08,320
the wrong numbers and patients pay the

703
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,330
price so this is my basically the point

704
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,360
that I'm trying to make here with all

705
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:17,470
this pointless or non-technical rambling

706
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:20,379
is like if it's difficult to use it's

707
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:22,450
difficult to use securely so maybe we

708
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:24,850
should start asking that how often our

709
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:28,300
security issues are actually usability

710
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:30,610
issues and why are we demanding

711
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:33,250
basically impossible things from our

712
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:35,709
users like asking them to learn how to

713
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:38,230
use a computer really really well to

714
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,430
keep themselves secure when that's well

715
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:43,180
we've been doing that for the gate

716
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:43,780
decades now is it working I don't think

717
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,150
it's working

718
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:47,830
I don't think anybody think it's working

719
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:50,860
but it's still the only thing that we're

720
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:53,500
doing because we have this mindset we

721
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:55,179
have this hacker techno guy mindset that

722
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,620
we're fascinated with these things and

723
00:30:55,180 --> 00:31:00,160
we love them and we want to work with

724
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:07,570
them all the time so here is a bunch of

725
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:10,120
symptoms what people think about it's

726
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:12,040
the year of Linux on the desktop it's

727
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:16,169
been several years yeah exactly

728
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:19,000
thank you sir you may get up and please

729
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:20,860
no but exactly we never never gonna see

730
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,510
the year of Linux on the desktop

731
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:24,760
have you used Linux on the desktop of

732
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:29,020
course you have yeah would you install

733
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:31,240
that to your elderly mother no way well

734
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:33,250
yeah some people do and some people have

735
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,440
relatives that know how to use them and

736
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:38,740
you can configure it but it will never

737
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,380
be the de-facto user interface

738
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:43,870
of modern computers for people it's too

739
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:45,280
complicated sometimes it feels like I'm

740
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:47,260
playing an adventure game that's the

741
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,970
only goal is to humiliate me when I'm

742
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:52,090
using it and I'm kind of a technical guy

743
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:53,200
not to brag but you know I'm free and

744
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:56,530
open-source software

745
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,230
great idea great for us great for them

746
00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:02,350
but getting a community of technical

747
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:04,900
people to design software well I tried

748
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:08,500
to learn how to use GIMP not that easy

749
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:10,450
when you have usability experts I don't

750
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,550
think they really work that much on open

751
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:15,630
source projects they work for companies

752
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:17,770
and they come up with stuff like iOS

753
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:21,340
doesn't look like free and open software

754
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:24,120
and the Android while technically

755
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:26,260
superior often than the latest iPhone

756
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,178
doesn't really matter because the iPhone

757
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:29,770
is still the same and still works the

758
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:32,440
same way and people will still buy

759
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:34,750
iPhones and of course there are more

760
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,550
Android Souls than iPhones but that's

761
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:38,620
because an iPhone is expensive and you

762
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:44,500
can get a hundred euro Android from

763
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:46,178
anywhere and well social media will they

764
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,490
want to talk too much about that but we

765
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:50,290
see when people who really shouldn't be

766
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:54,760
on the Internet get on the internet and

767
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:56,678
start using social media we have 17th

768
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,629
century disease is coming back because

769
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:01,080
anti-vaccination is obviously a thing

770
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:04,960
have you heard that the earth is flat

771
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:07,629
trump's president all kinds of stuff

772
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,970
like an email security we haven't fixed

773
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:12,820
that e-reader we run or our whole

774
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:17,800
economy on email and we haven't fixed

775
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:19,659
the security we have PGP well s/mime we

776
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,399
have secure mail we have different kinds

777
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:25,090
of solutions to this but none of them

778
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:26,920
have been actual solutions they're

779
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:28,629
technical solutions to a technical

780
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:31,690
problem but they're not a solution to

781
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:33,760
the problem of us not being able to send

782
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:35,880
a secure email by default without

783
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:40,480
messing around with all kinds of weird

784
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:44,530
PGP keys for example and the next

785
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,330
generation will come and they will go to

786
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:48,639
the workplaces and they will have these

787
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:51,070
same problems we can't just wait for

788
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,600
time to solve this for us I say that my

789
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,970
kid is always only smart

790
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:56,949
he's gonna be perfect at work it's never

791
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:59,350
gonna have any problems with email or or

792
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:02,470
any of this it's not gonna happen and

793
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:04,300
don't get me started on Bitcoin because

794
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:06,220
I've been hearing all about it it's

795
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:10,779
about to go mainstream any day now

796
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:13,330
but when ransomware operators attack

797
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:15,250
they have to get a fix at least this

798
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:17,440
long to explain to you what is Bitcoin

799
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:19,270
and how to use it it's just too

800
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,790
complicated and then they hire

801
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:23,350
consultants for that it's just to

802
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:26,560
complicate you can run a multi-million

803
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:29,830
dollar company but just getting Bitcoin

804
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,480
working is it's a lot to ask it's not

805
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:36,239
gonna be a mainstream solution any day

806
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:40,360
but a lot of people think it's gonna be

807
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:42,219
so I have a few suggestions just

808
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,620
radically simplify the user experience

809
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:46,509
if you're working with some kind of a

810
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:48,670
software product don't think about more

811
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:50,620
features just think what is the minimum

812
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:54,060
amount of information I can show the

813
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:56,739
user and they can still use my app just

814
00:34:54,060 --> 00:35:01,240
radically not just a little bit remove

815
00:34:56,739 --> 00:35:03,850
features if 20% of the users use 80% of

816
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:06,399
the features and 80% of the users use

817
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:09,130
only 20% of the features and a lot of

818
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,070
the features can be security risks why

819
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:13,690
ships off soft ship software that has

820
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:16,450
all those features maybe just stripped

821
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:18,430
them down and cloud services for example

822
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:22,120
you don't have to maintain a computer

823
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:24,430
like an iPad for my parents good choice

824
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,960
it's maintaining a computer is hard work

825
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:28,750
and you have to understand the computer

826
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:32,200
to maintain it and please get get rid of

827
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:34,690
the password when I was working for the

828
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:38,290
government we had and we have this

829
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:43,140
campaign like longer is better just

830
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:45,070
talking about passwords obviously so

831
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,960
we've been doing this for a long time

832
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:49,150
just trying to get users to use good

833
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,710
passwords users are still not using good

834
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:52,450
passwords they will never start to use

835
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:54,820
beauty passwords we have to come up with

836
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:56,080
something else maybe a shorter password

837
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,970
and then force multi-factor

838
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,220
authentication to all your services

839
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:03,189
where you can and maybe just set your

840
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:06,069
skillet expectations lower like when

841
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:06,940
teaching the users how to use software

842
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:09,700
secure

843
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:12,460
just don't teach to your peers I don't

844
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:14,049
teach just a notch below your peers just

845
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:16,480
go down enough and try to see the

846
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:20,350
problem from their eyes and try to teach

847
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,030
them something more and stop trying to

848
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:25,000
train your way out of this problem

849
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:26,320
completely and think that the problem is

850
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,810
that we just don't have enough security

851
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,620
training if we've done that for decades

852
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:31,420
it won't work

853
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:35,980
it hasn't work it won't work in the

854
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:37,660
future so I think it's time for a shift

855
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:40,680
in the paradigm now we're seeing the

856
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:43,180
dark and this is typical security advice

857
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,950
but they have a problem it's okay

858
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,379
I'm trying to go to this website I get a

859
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:49,120
certificate warning and then okay

860
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:51,190
brace yourself I'm gonna explain to you

861
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,230
what a certificate is and how it works

862
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:55,180
and how the chain of trust works there

863
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:57,190
and what a sefer suit is and and the

864
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,990
user doesn't really care at all about

865
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:00,520
this all they care about they can't

866
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:03,549
access their mail because they get a

867
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,980
certificate warning and browsers have

868
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:08,110
been doing good work here like modern

869
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:10,690
browsers won't let you bypass it without

870
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:12,450
going through hoops and jumping through

871
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:14,530
hoops and going through a very

872
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:17,529
complicated procedure of clicking open

873
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:20,920
menus and some browsers I think that

874
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:22,510
this day won't even let you do that but

875
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,760
then we teach the users you just click

876
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:26,710
accept and yes I know the risk and then

877
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:31,240
you just go so maybe start thinking

878
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:33,010
about this thing like a rabbit and start

879
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:35,080
thinking this is what my users are

880
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:36,730
thinking and my browser won't let me go

881
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,860
this website I'll just take my business

882
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:39,670
elsewhere

883
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:41,520
because this is what they're actually

884
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:43,780
thinking they don't care at all about

885
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,640
certificates they just want to do

886
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:53,580
whatever they're doing buy a pair of

887
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:53,580
shoes yeah that's basically my message

888
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:59,410
yeah it's a hotel chain logo that's

889
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:02,290
right actually an example of what

890
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:04,210
paradigm shift is when your perception

891
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:07,360
of something shifts and you see

892
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:08,790
something else does anyone want to ask a

893
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:15,889
question

894
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:15,889
[Applause]
