2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:23,878
[Music]

3
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:45,370
so we're here again

4
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:47,800
hello disobey how are you doing so let's

5
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:50,739
start with the practicals our main

6
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:54,519
sponsors and partners of this year again

7
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:57,430
our doctor and Accenture respectively

8
00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:59,559
thank you for being here for us I'm not

9
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,510
gonna read the rest of these because

10
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:04,089
there's a lot like we're growing you can

11
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:07,420
tell we're growing I know we're growing

12
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:09,100
we're getting huge and the support we're

13
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,470
getting both from you in terms of

14
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:14,320
community and from the companies that

15
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:17,560
are believing in what we're believing in

16
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,880
is is amazing to me so thank you for

17
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:25,900
that the rest of the practicals should

18
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:32,710
be on the next slide I hope that worked

19
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:35,950
so workshops are in a new location this

20
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,719
year they're straight across from the

21
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:41,710
main entrance chrome and neon

22
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:45,669
respectively they will close when they

23
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:48,520
start first-come first-serve so line up

24
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:50,679
early when the designated time for the

25
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,259
workshop starts the doors will close and

26
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:55,060
nobody's allowed anymore in anymore

27
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:57,039
after that the reason for this is we

28
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,020
want to make sure that the presenters

29
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:02,979
have the piece they need to present the

30
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:07,380
workshops and make it work well security

31
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:10,060
is clearly marked but if you see anyone

32
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:15,069
behaving in a manner that is not

33
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:17,650
respectful or inclusive please let some

34
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:20,950
of our organizers know or me and we'll

35
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:24,959
handle it accordingly this is about

36
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:29,250
community and being true to ourselves

37
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:32,319
it's not about promoting individuals

38
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,590
respect everyone's privacy don't take

39
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:38,410
photos of people without their consent

40
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:40,500
make sure in the photos you take nothing

41
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,790
is visible that can be identifiable

42
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,640
actually to make it easy don't

43
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:49,000
take photos at all I know some of you

44
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:52,000
will anyway so please keep that in mind

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,060
or capture the flag competition will

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,540
start at 1:00 so for those of you who

47
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:01,989
want to participate in that it's behind

48
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:05,500
the curtain the badge this year is

49
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:08,950
amazing I hope you've all gotten yours

50
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:11,769
manage to turn it on and found it to be

51
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:14,108
in working order there's a puzzle

52
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:17,019
involved with it and there's some cool

53
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:19,450
prizes for the people who solve it if

54
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:22,540
you are one of those lucky few

55
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,578
I already salute you we put a lot of

56
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:28,150
effort into making and as awesome as

57
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:31,599
possible for this year or fifth year we

58
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:33,040
even themed it accordingly to 2020 those

59
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,268
of you who are old enough to remember

60
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,480
this role-playing game cyberpunk 2020

61
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:42,069
will find cool nods to this there

62
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,899
there's Easter eggs but there's other

63
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:51,459
Easter eggs as well now let's get to

64
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:53,889
what I really want to talk about I want

65
00:03:51,459 --> 00:04:00,010
to take a moment to appreciate something

66
00:03:53,889 --> 00:04:02,169
I read it goes like this do you want to

67
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:06,159
be one of those people that look back

68
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:09,519
and go we had it a lot harder when I was

69
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,078
growing back when I was growing up do

70
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,930
you would want to be one of those people

71
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:17,470
that complain about things getting

72
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:19,959
better because I don't think that's a

73
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,699
good way of going forward I think we

74
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,610
should celebrate the things we've

75
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:28,750
achieved and the things that are better

76
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:32,710
now now look at this for example last

77
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:36,490
night alone around 10 o'clock or 11

78
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:39,070
o'clock most of us got to go home and

79
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:41,740
have a good night's sleep for most of

80
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,960
the years building up to this event we

81
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:47,199
spent most of the night making this

82
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:50,258
ready for you we've learned things we've

83
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,060
improved we've made incremental updates

84
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:54,770
and I think that's amazing our

85
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:58,060
volunteers and our core organization

86
00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:02,450
deserve all the credit for that I've

87
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:04,760
mostly been coming up with these visions

88
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:08,780
about our future and thinking about

89
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:12,289
strategy and essentially I get to take

90
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:15,500
credit of all the hard work for all the

91
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:18,110
people who are doing it I don't deserve

92
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,440
all of that credit you do and the same

93
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:24,530
is true in a lot of other communities

94
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,680
besides this obey we have the city SEC

95
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:30,190
communities that are growing and they're

96
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:33,800
getting bigger every year we have our

97
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:36,770
disobey outreach program but most people

98
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:41,630
haven't heard about but you should ask

99
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:46,039
the people involved we are going forward

100
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:48,860
we are improving and I don't want to

101
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:53,750
hear us complain about how things were

102
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:56,420
harder before let's go with things are

103
00:05:53,750 --> 00:06:00,980
good now they're not perfect but they're

104
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:05,780
better now with that in mind a lot of

105
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:08,620
the things you will hear will come from

106
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:11,690
sources that want to stay anonymous

107
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:14,330
disobey operates under the Chatham House

108
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,190
rule that effectively means you're

109
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:19,400
allowed to share the information you

110
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:21,980
hear here you're allowed to talk freely

111
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:25,700
amongst yourself but don't disclose the

112
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:29,030
source without explicit permission this

113
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:32,030
should give you freedom to discuss even

114
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:36,440
hard problems with other members of the

115
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:40,059
community please keep that in mind if

116
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:42,920
you are part of the press or you plan on

117
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:46,910
live tweeting everything you see here or

118
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:54,710
everything you hear we want to keep this

119
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:57,760
as a community with trust that being

120
00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:04,070
said this is disobey

121
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:10,430

around look at what you can find

124
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:19,280
think of novel solutions try to figure

125
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:23,060
out what you can do about it but don't

126
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:27,440
touch our networking here please or mess

127

you to hack here inside of these walls

132
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:45,049
without having to cause problems for the

133
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:47,510
rest of the community with that in mind

134
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:53,480
I want to remind you of our code of

135
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:56,330
ethics respect privacy again that is our

136
00:07:53,480 --> 00:08:03,170
number one ethos serve and protect the

137
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:05,090
community so not an ideology us share

138
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:07,790
knowledge with the community if somebody

139
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:10,969
asks you something that means they want

140
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:13,730
to learn that is not an opportunity to

141
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:17,930
talk down on them or tell them that

142
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:27,260
you're smarter than them we really don't

143
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:29,570
need more alpha nerds or whatever talks

144
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:35,600
a combination of pronouns we can put

145
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:38,510
before it act with integrity avoid

146
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,460
conflicts of interest so if you know

147
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:43,939
you're in a position where you really

148
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:46,460
shouldn't say anything then don't don't

149
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:51,410
don't play with fear uncertainty and

150
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:55,880
doubt don't really don't like give in to

151
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:59,150
the narrative of everything just falling

152
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:03,320
apart magically everything is broken yes

153
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:06,410
but it can be fixed protect everyone's

154
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:10,640
data if you accidentally compromised

155
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:11,490
another attendees mobile device or

156
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,500
laptop or

157
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,240
whatever because they forgot to turn off

158
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,089
their Wi-Fi and they walked into your

159
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,300
rogue ap trap and you didn't really mean

160
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:25,010
to get all of their sensitive

161
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:27,449
information make sure you delete it and

162
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:29,939
get rid of it before it becomes a

163
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:33,709
problem don't be an asshole

164
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:36,300
really that's that's the core of it if

165
00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:39,180
if you see somebody else being an

166
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:44,969
asshole be brave enough to step up and

multitude of things that are interesting

170
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:56,130
