2
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:38,190
a little sinking how are you doing

3
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,870
nothing happened before we're all good

4
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,160
that's a good good job it's like the

5
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,930
problem is when you're having a backup

6
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,879
make sure your backup is charged and

7
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,150
ready to be the backup so that's the

8
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,680
lesson I learned so far thank you for

9
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,019
being here

10
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,120
if people don't realize it's like what I

11
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:55,769
do alternate with my talks it's like one

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,209
year I'll do an offensive talk though

13
00:00:55,769 --> 00:01:00,690
most people say that all my talks are

14
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,930
offensive and then I do a rant talk the

15
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:07,320
next year well this year's a rant year

16
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:10,229
so buckle up buttercup we're we're going

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,300
to get going so I mean there's not even

18
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:14,820
an abstract and there's not even like a

19
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,350
the title so I really appreciate them

20
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,389
still trusting me to actually give a

21
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:22,369
talk this is the first conference I've

22
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:24,450
really officially given to that so sorry

23
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:25,950
it's like we'll see how it goes because

24
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,250
I'm interested in what I'm going to say

25
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:32,130
to the title of the talk I've settled on

26
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,920
is the problem with spoons in life

27
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:39,810
hacking and InfoSec now the key thing is

28
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,039
I recently got a bike a last year which

29
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,479
is like it was a mental health thing

30
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:45,239
it's like literally saved my life and

31
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,530
what I did was I put a matrix rap on it

32
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:48,509
cuz I thought it would look cool right

33
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,880
and it did look cool so I wouldn't watch

34
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:54,119
the matrix again you know cuz I want to

35
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,589
be relevant and I started noticing some

36
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,149
key things and like just piqued my

37
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,489
interest and like how it would tied to

38
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,920
what I want to talk about this year so

39
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:04,080
this whole talk like my breaking and bad

40
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,750
talk is whole themed is based on the

41
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,340
Matrix movie so sorry not sorry but

42
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,568
hopefully more people will understand it

43
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,800
because I guarantee you some of the

44
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:12,988
people in the countries that I went to

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,550
had no clue who the guy in the goatee

46
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:16,560
was and Breaking Bad they're like what

47
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,120
if the is this guy and why should I care

48
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,770
so that was a little bit awkward

49
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,660
hopefully most people here familiar with

50
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:26,250
the matrix it's like so okay whatever

51
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,700
it's like it'll still work out great

52
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,590
okay so here we go a little bit about me

53
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,149
you may have seen me on National

54
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,120
Geographic robbing a bank in Beirut

55
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,200
Lebanon you may have seen me in the news

56
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,030
more importantly though it's like right

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,959
there on the lower left I love the most

58
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,630
is that's me actually robbing people

59
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,730
because that's fun and there's a mean

60
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,799
hotel in the South of France in the

61
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,109
lower picture where I'm walking in

62
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,930
barefoot Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle

63
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,640
pajama bottoms and the t-shirt I got the

64
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,980
the keys to the hotel I got the computer

65
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:01,250
systems it was it was a five-star hotel

66
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:04,340
they provided everything and they asked

67
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:06,110
me circled in red why I made an employee

68
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,790
get out of his desk so I could

69
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,250
compromise them and he got to watch the

70
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,769
whole thing so that was interesting and

71
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,660
educational for both of us and that's

72
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,280
just me walking into a bank and stealing

73
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,170
a computer I literally walked behind the

74
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,510
teller line unplugged the computer and

75
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:22,339
then walked out I was very rude on that

76
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:26,510
engagement I didn't even say hello it's

77
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:28,190
like I just walked in and did it but but

78
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:31,790
that's what I like doing and I like

79
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:33,530
being able to educate and teach that's

80
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,570
one of the key things that's what I like

81
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:37,490
doing it's like I always tell people red

82
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,200
team only exists to make the blue team

83
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,760
better it's like you want them to do

84
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,799
better you want them to work you want

85
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:47,149
them to learn so that's what I do

86
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:50,750
so let's get into this I have I get a

87
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:53,330
lot of messages all the time from

88
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:56,980
different people going I want to be a

89
00:03:53,330 --> 00:04:02,240
hacker how do I become a hacker like you

90
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:04,850
and I'm always confused by that it's

91
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:08,420
like I'm not going to be able to tell

92
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:11,000
you how to be a hacker no one here is

93
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:13,820
going to be able to tell you how to be a

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,860
hacker everybody wants to tell you how

95
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:21,469
to be a hacker but nobody can nobody has

96
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:23,630
that answer for every single person we

97
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,550
have a whole history from inventors to

98
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,990
scientific hooligans that's one of my

99
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:31,400
favorites there was a guy who actually

100
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:33,680
back in the 1800s actually intercepted

101
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,239
wireless Telegraph during a

102
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,030
demonstration of this other guy who was

103
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:41,090
an a-hole and did curse words and like

104
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:42,530
messages and like fortification and all

105
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,440
these other words it's like through this

106
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:47,570
guy's demo is like it was awesome and

107
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,790
the guy who was the victim of that

108
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,919
attack called him a scientific hooligan

109
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,870
and I was like that's in my Twitter bio

110
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,669
now that's awesome that's a great way to

111
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,129
call a hacker

112
00:04:55,669 --> 00:05:00,409
but we have a history and the cycle is a

113
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:03,080
defining those who valiantly fight being

114
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:06,319
defined I talked a lot about more that

115
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:11,240
in my DEFCON 20 to talk on YouTube but

116
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:15,830
the key thing is is that back in before

117
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:19,750
a computer existed before we understood

118
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:23,780
what computing was there were hackers

119
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:27,500
this is not a computer generated you

120
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:29,840
know modern technology thing they were

121
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:33,319
called by different names Leonardo da

122
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,628
Vinci was a hacker Nikola Tesla was a

123
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:39,379
hacker screw Edison but it's like all

124
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:40,159
these people were famous hackers Grace

125
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:43,879
Hopper

126
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:47,330
it's like hacker Ada Lovelace uber

127
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:48,620
hacker all these people were hackers

128
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,270
they were inventors of courage they're

129
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,650
trying to see something they saw

130
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,020
something this is what everybody told

131
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:57,429
them it was supposed to be and they

132
00:05:54,020 --> 00:06:01,508
decided but what if I do something else

133
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:05,629
what if I make it do this what can we do

134
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:07,520
that's hacking so stop trying to define

135
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:11,210
it so narrowly and put in this little

136
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,159
box it's like that that's what it's

137
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,979
supposed to be about it's not about

138
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:18,199
computers it's about passion

139
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:21,440
it's about curiosity it's about

140
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:23,330
challenging the norms it's like and I

141
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,270
love going to some of these places where

142
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:27,948
everybody wants to challenge the norm

143
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:31,188
everybody wants to be different from

144
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:33,589
society and it's like how many black

145
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:35,509
hoodies are in here right now you know

146
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:37,009
everybody wants to be the special

147
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:39,949
snowflake in a special snowflake

148
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:42,050
blizzard it's like and that's me too I

149
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:43,610
dressed the same way because I like it

150
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,259
it's like I'm not doing it because it's

151
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,729
accepted I'm not doing it because I'm

152
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:49,610
trying to blend in no one's trying to

153
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:52,568
blend in but we all sort of blend in a

154
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:55,550
little bit right it's like it's okay

155
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:58,639
because there are no standards there are

156
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:02,479
no set of what makes you a hacker

157
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,870
there is no dressing like a hacker there

158
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,270
is no talking like a hacker

159
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,750
there's just being a hacker because you

160
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:12,530
say

161
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:14,240
a you're a hacker that's it so when they

162
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:17,000
get to this and when I keep getting this

163
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,520
question I started realizing something

164
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
they weren't asking me they wanted to be

165
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:27,950
a hacker they were asking me how do I

166
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,560
get paid to be a hacker how do I get how

167
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:34,670
do I get the money as I said what you

168
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,380
really want is a job at InfoSec you know

169
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,790
our info sucks or whatever you want to

170
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,140
like you know derogatory statement we

171
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,510
want to call how we get paid for doing

172
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:44,479
our jobs to help secure people and make

173
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,800
things better it's like so that's it

174
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,190
that's what I think that we're really

175
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,770
trying to go after and we have such a

176
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,600
thing about if a sec right especially

177
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:56,000
hackers could screw those guys right

178
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,930
dressing up in their suits this is the

179
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,370
perfect representation that I've seen

180
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:04,250
it's like because you look up there in

181
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:06,850
the top left-hand corner that was Zion

182
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:09,440
right those guys were in the matrix

183
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,850
those guys were doing those guys put

184
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,950
their lives on the line remember when

185
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:15,530
the the docs fell it's like spoiler

186
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:18,289
alert it's like those people lost their

187
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:20,900
lives it's like those people were on the

188
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,010
front lines just like this guy except

189
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,210
for I mean they had a way better

190
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,560
interface I mean come on that looks

191
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,359
freaking cool I don't know why the

192
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,310
policy was that you had to wear wipe who

193
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,760
wants to wear white at work that's just

194
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:33,110
embarrassing it's like but Dad I guess

195
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,059
in the it but it's in the matrix so I

196
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:38,210
don't technically get dirty I guess so I

197
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:40,400
think it's fine I digress so that's the

198
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,530
whole thing and I started realizing

199
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,449
people wanted to know how to get into

200
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:47,870
information security so I actually

201
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,790
created the website I Ronin comm and I

202
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:52,280
created the getting started page on

203
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,349
there so I got Roni was mace basically

204
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,870
started out to help define what a hacker

205
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:58,760
is to help educate people and people who

206
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,430
aren't familiar with it like the media

207
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,530
and colleges and people just everyday

208
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,239
people help get them to understand and

209
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:07,790
inform what hackers and then I realized

210
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,520
it needed to expand to help hackers it's

211
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,770
like learn other things so we did the

212
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:16,010
getting started page which has some

213
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:18,260
resources on it so when I started

214
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:20,900
addressing that and I started talking to

215
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,700
people about that I realized one other

216
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,579
thing it's not just

217
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:29,120
how to become a hacker it's like or how

218
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:32,330
to get a job at InfoSec they wanted the

219
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,640
key so you got to go to the key master

220
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:37,370
oh wait sorry wrong movie it's like you

221
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,650
got a little key maker the key Maker

222
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:42,160
right it's like and you want to get that

223
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:44,800
one key that just solves everything

224
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,600
everybody wants that one solution

225
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,849
everybody wants that one thing that's

226
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,830
gonna say I love how this thing is like

227
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,150
ed I am so gonna fall off by the end of

228
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:55,310
this talk it's gonna be hilarious

229
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:57,640
it's like um but I everybody's got just

230
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:59,839
one thing where that's like this is what

231
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:04,790
being a hacker is this is the key to

232
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:07,880
success you do this one thing golden

233
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:09,650
right everybody's found that right

234
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,060
everybody here has found that one thing

235
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,040
that's made everything golden it's like

236
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,920
answered all your problems and now

237
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,480
you're a hacker right it's like because

238
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,250
if you do can I talk to you later after

239
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:23,000
this cuz I got some questions it's like

240
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:25,550
so so yeah we don't because there

241
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,090
doesn't have one in existence there is

242
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:31,400
no one answer to this it's a convoluted

243
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:34,400
thing but do you know what one of the

244
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:37,189
key ingredients is you're gonna hate

245
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:41,300
this you're gonna hate I know everybody

246
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:43,880
cuz it's not this you can't just

247
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,680
download it it's like you know the

248
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,240
implants haven't been that trust me I

249
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,219
wish there was it's like I'd be one of

250
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,140
the first ones in line cuz you know

251
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,910
that's pretty cool it's like I've had to

252
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,230
learn I use just I've been sword

253
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,100
fighting this I was seven it's like I

254
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,630
had to do it the hard way

255
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,730
you know what the cuts and the bruises

256
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,990
and everything it's like so yeah I would

257
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,990
love to be able to just like I know

258
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:10,750
kung-fu it's like that'd be awesome but

259
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:14,480
sorry doesn't exist this exists practice

260
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:17,570
working it even when you had the skills

261
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:21,440
downloaded but that didn't help they

262
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:24,020
didn't solve it that doesn't solve it

263
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,690
you have to keep working you have to

264
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:30,410
keep perfecting you have to put time and

265
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:33,290
effort into it that's where the passion

266
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:36,380
part comes in to being a hacker cuz you

267
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:38,540
gotta want it you got to keep learning

268
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,510
no one is going to be able to give you

269
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,219
that it's like I mean adderall helps I

270
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:46,400
guess but it's like nothing is gonna be

271
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:49,280
able to actually give you that you're

272
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,439
gonna have to do it yourself you're

273
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,360
gonna have to keep practicing you're

274
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,410
gonna have to keep working you're gonna

275
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:00,500
have to figure out what you like doing

276
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:01,579
what you like that makes you go I want

277
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,700
to get up and I want to work on this

278
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:06,260
project it's like because I tell people

279
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,640
when you want to look for a job and

280
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:13,840
InfoSec the worst thing you can do is

281
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:19,010
look for one that's a good career choice

282
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:21,410
that's a death trap okay because if you

283
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:23,390
go and you're looking for a job in

284
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:25,670
InfoSec because you think it makes good

285
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:30,110
money and it's a good career choice

286
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:33,229
you're gonna suck really bad and that

287
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:35,990
makes me sad because the people that

288
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:38,960
you're going against the attackers the

289
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:42,440
criminals they're having a mother field

290
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,000
day they're having a blast I mean

291
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,980
they're like freaking you know scooping

292
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,160
up credit cards and like you know doing

293
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:53,330
some ransomware and playing xbox you're

294
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:55,100
living the dream you're in a cube it's

295
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,720
like with Gary who wants to be around

296
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,040
Gary you know and it's like you know

297
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,190
you're trying to get this stuff done and

298
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:05,089
you're watching logs it's like so yeah

299
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:07,820
you have to enjoy it and this field of

300
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:13,430
info SEC has so many different

301
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:18,140
variations forensics incident response

302
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:20,719
red teaming blue teaming IDS's firewall

303
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:23,330
network infrastructure threat hunting

304
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,420
and it has all these different

305
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:31,880
variations that you can say I like doing

306
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:35,180
that do it find out what you love then

307
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,960
find someone to pay for it that's how

308
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,939
that works

309
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:40,340
and I'm not trying to be a self-help

310
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,740
guru okay I promise I'm just stating

311
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:46,640
fact it's like this this industry will

312
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:49,910
burn you down and grind you out it's

313
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:52,640
like if you let it so make sure your

314
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:55,310
having fun as you go make sure you're

315
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,800
still enjoying the job and one other key

316
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:59,510
aspect that people overlook and people

317
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,270
want to go and you see people come up

318
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:04,189
here and they give these talks and they

319
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:06,710
do demos and they do all these that

320
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,780
really cool amazing things and you're

321
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,460
like I want to do that and then you go

322
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,410
back home it's like you know you go to

323
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:19,480
your lab you go work on your stuff and

324
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:19,480
it fails and fails and fails

325
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:31,340
congratulations because that is part of

326
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:33,620
being a hacker failing I have failed

327
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:38,150
more times than some people have even

328
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:41,810
tried I am NOT an expert I'm just

329
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:43,640
stubborn I'm just too honorary to quit

330
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:46,099
you know I'm just done I'm going to keep

331
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,090
going and I'm gonna keep banging my head

332
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,710
at biggest of all you know the

333
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:50,480
definition of insanity is to keep doing

334
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:55,220
the same things facing different results

335
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:59,300
I'm that kind of crazy and I'll keep

336
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:02,300
going it's like you have to keep failing

337
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:05,000
you have to keep trying the variations

338
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:07,699
you have to keep trying to see what's

339
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,800
going to work until it starts to

340
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:16,340
actually work that's the key there is no

341
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,770
magic sauce there is no magic formula

342
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:21,230
there is I mean I wish there was you

343
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:24,500
know that the the the that was at the

344
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:26,120
the cap con you know master code is I

345
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,920
wish there was that secret code that you

346
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,610
could type you know a BB up-down up-down

347
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,010
left-right

348
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,600
it's like that'd be awesome but it

349
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:35,510
doesn't exist in the real world

350
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:39,280
I checked so spoiler alert it's like so

351
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:42,170
you have to do the work you have to fail

352
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,300
it's not just about succeeding I've

353
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:46,939
learned so many interesting and weird

354
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:49,040
wonderful things based on a really

355
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,430
horrible failure like what how did I

356
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:55,069
even do that how did that even get there

357
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:57,170
it's like it's like and did I just break

358
00:15:55,070 --> 00:16:00,410
international law no it's like that you

359
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:03,680
got to keep trying you got to keep

360
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:07,130
trying no matter how much you fail so

361
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:11,719
what I decided to do was steal an idea

362
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:14,120
sort of from Marcus J Kari and Jennifer

363
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,490
Jen they wrote these books called tribal

364
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,410
hackers where they asked questions about

365
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,810
people in the industry and people in the

366
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:23,300
hacking community and those people

367
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,709
answered them and I was I was privileged

368
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,469
enough and hundred enough to be in both

369
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:29,810
those books and so I decided to do a

370
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:34,010
little bit of variation on that for this

371
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:36,140
talk so I sent out surveys via Twitter

372
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:38,980
of course and asked people it's like to

373
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:44,240
go and like respond to these questions

374
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:46,640
and so I pick two people randomly from

375
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,980
the survey the answer was over 115 so

376
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,510
it's like so every column every time I

377
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,709
give this talk it's going to be

378
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,360
different because it's like I'm going to

379
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:56,359
use two different people every single

380
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,100
time it's like and I ask them simple

381
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,740
questions and what we're going to do

382
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:06,319
right now is we're gonna go through what

383
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:09,949
their answers were so let's start first

384
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:12,649
question is what is your role in hacking

385
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:16,550
and InfoSec this person's answer he was

386
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:20,809
a security engineer cool it's like the

387
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:23,990
next person is product managers the day

388
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:28,000
job and I love the night job open-source

389
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:31,850
contribute for darknet projects darknet

390
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,440
soloqueue hacker after hours so it's

391
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,969
like I don't know if that's like a porn

392
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,220
related you know any Windows thing I

393
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:39,710
don't know it's like but he's like after

394
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:41,330
hours hacker so that's cool that's cool

395
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:44,420
I'm not joking it's like that's awesome

396
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:45,949
it's like teach your own it's like how

397
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,860
many years have you been in the role of

398
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:52,910
a security engineer it was four it's

399
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:55,040
like so that's cool how many years have

400
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:58,330
you been in this role day job is one

401
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:01,370
year after hours forever

402
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:03,740
exactly it's like I tell people you're

403
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:06,110
born a hacker there is no other way it's

404
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,870
like it's like human curiosity it's like

405
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:11,479
some cultivated some run with it some

406
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:13,280
you know water some make it grow and

407
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,140
others just let it wither by the time

408
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,480
they're 12 it's like so it's like that's

409
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,720
what the spirit is

410
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,299
so I go and say the next one is have you

411
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,500
had other roles in hacking InfoSec and f

412
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:26,918
yes what were they

413
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:29,679
I was a quick answer no okay

414
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:31,120
no judging this guy just started boom

415
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,020
right into security engineering and

416
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,799
that's what he did

417
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:37,809
so this one is the next was a QA some

418
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:39,668
people do ride it but it's a very rapid

419
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:41,889
education on the kind of assumptions and

420
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:44,830
attitudes that engineers bring to their

421
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:47,799
projects QA is a great job for a hacker

422
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:49,360
because you get to test the crap out of

423
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:50,440
stuff right and it's like if people were

424
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,270
telling you well it's supposed to be do

425
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:56,350
this this and this well I'll see if

426
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:58,570
it'll do this and it did fix that right

427
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:00,280
so that's a great job for a hacker cuz

428
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,918
it makes you question it makes you you

429
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,600
know I mean I love the question part of

430
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:06,130
the QA it's like sometimes I'm not very

431
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,439
good with giving the answers but you

432
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,880
know the Q part I'm good at it's like

433
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,520
the answers that usually you know

434
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,169
stumble me so the next one is do you

435
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,900
consider yourself an expert in this

436
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:19,450
field and why do you feel this way I am

437
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,580
no expert I work in and on so many

438
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:25,030
different things I do not have a chance

439
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:27,399
to become an expert it's I've gotten a

440
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:30,460
lot of different responses for this but

441
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:33,100
overall the most resounding one has been

442
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,010
that no matter what they've done it's

443
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,899
like no one feels like they're an expert

444
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:41,740
it's like no one feels like that's what

445
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,290
they do it's like do you consider

446
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,120
yourself an expert in the field are

447
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:48,190
darknet hackers super super far from

448
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,689
expert info SEC is always changing so at

449
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:53,669
this point in my life I feel more like a

450
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:56,640
historian than bleeding-edge it's like

451
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:59,169
you can have people that are specialized

452
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,240
there are specialists in this industry

453
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:05,080
who know one thing after another they're

454
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:08,380
like no protocols back and forth but

455
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:13,120
this field this community it is too vast

456
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:16,990
and too wide to say I am an expert in

457
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,760
everything this it's like I mean we'd be

458
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,049
nice and some people can't feel like

459
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,750
they're an expert in that specialized

460
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:24,220
field I'm not an expert in anything it's

461
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,210
like thank goodness it's like because

462
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,650
then people might actually try to

463
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,929
respect me or something it's like that's

464
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:30,160
weird it's like so yeah I am NOT an

465
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:32,590
expert in nothing

466
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,630
it's like I just do what I can I learn

467
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:38,230
at the best I can and I am constantly

468
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:40,300
learning it's like the reason why I come

469
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:42,370
to so many conferences and I give talks

470
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,600
is cuz I social engineered conferences

471
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,699
into believing that I can give a good

472
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,740
talk so I can then go learn from people

473
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,750
at the conference as though this is all

474
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,430
just an educational gambit okay so sir

475
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,140
don't tell the organizers on that they

476
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:56,170
maybe you get upset but that's what I do

477
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:58,540
I'm here to share and exchange knowledge

478
00:20:56,170 --> 00:21:01,150
the least amount of you know productive

479
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,620
time that I have is this hour on the

480
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:04,150
stage they may not realize they're

481
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:07,659
giving me an hour but you know but it's

482
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:09,760
like that's that's it after that I get

483
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,980
to go and learn and communicate and talk

484
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,129
to people that's where I get my benefit

485
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,900
from this I'm very selfish so knowing

486
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:18,900
what this is the key question all the

487
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:22,300
other questions were mainly for this one

488
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:24,220
knowing what you know now please share

489
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,690
the top three things you wish your

490
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,630
younger self would have known when

491
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:32,560
starting out because I wanted people to

492
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:35,500
tell me what they needed to know when

493
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,450
they first started so I can tell people

494
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,540
that are just trying to start what they

495
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:43,570
should know so for the security engineer

496
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:48,510
you're doing InfoSec in non InfoSec

497
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:52,960
roles I get that it's like sometimes

498
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:55,060
companies do not have InfoSec

499
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:59,680
departments because they just like

500
00:21:55,060 --> 00:22:02,560
InfoSec your job is not to be just an

501
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:06,970
info sack but you understand how your

502
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:08,679
company works and then to secure it it's

503
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:11,700
like you have to know how to make the

504
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:14,200
donuts to actually protect the donuts

505
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,910
it's like I used to like work at a bank

506
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,380
and I was like oh I'm working a bank

507
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,820
it's like gosh I'll just you know print

508
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,530
money I don't know in the back I don't I

509
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:23,500
don't care I just need to secure you I

510
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:25,000
was wrong because I needed to know what

511
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,320
their processes were what the different

512
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,910
kinds of wire transfers what kind of

513
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,310
different things that could break down

514
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:32,530
things that could be circumvented things

515
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:35,020
that could be attacked I had to learn

516
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:38,620
those things so I could be better at

517
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:41,650
securing it you can't just say InfoSec

518
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:43,239
for the sake of InfoSec you do not have

519
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:45,280
to know everything thank God

520
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,170
it's like that's great being a

521
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,850
generalist is okay they tend to see the

522
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:51,309
big picture and how things fit together

523
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:53,020
I pride myself on being a generalist

524
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:57,520
it's like so I mean that is a good thing

525
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:58,800
to do the next one he was like it's okay

526
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:04,059
to ask for help

527
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:05,470
often I see so many people it's like

528
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:07,389
they're like holla man I have this issue

529
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:09,940
that's what watch you go after because

530
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:11,830
people can ask me think I'm stupid like

531
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,590
no people are not gonna think you're

532
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,669
stupid because you ask a question people

533
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,830
are gonna think that you're curious

534
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:19,960
people within that you are smart and you

535
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:23,530
want to know answers because you ask

536
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:25,420
questions I will not hesitate to ask a

537
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:28,090
question no matter how stupid is it and

538
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:30,730
I have asked some stupid questions with

539
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:32,649
total pride because I'm trying to learn

540
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:36,190
and there is nothing effing wrong with

541
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:36,640
that because I need to know it so I can

542
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,800
do better

543
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,570
write about what you're learning what

544
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,840
you did and what you want to know next

545
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:45,220
everyday keep a dream journal it's like

546
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,740
you know if I keep that little journal

547
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:50,470
like and it started that's great that's

548
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:52,450
a good process get comfortable with

549
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,620
being uncomfortable it's like and if

550
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:54,940
you're not very comfortable being

551
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,530
uncomfortable hang out with me for 30

552
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,559
minutes it's like I'll help with that

553
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:01,360
it's like so yeah so you just work it's

554
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:02,379
like try to go outside your barriers

555
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,240
because that's one of the things we do

556
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,040
as a hacker to you right we go outside

557
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,870
of our berries we try to go past our

558
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:11,950
boundaries and there's nothing wrong

559
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:13,809
with that so what obstacle to be facing

560
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:16,030
getting to where you are now and how did

561
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:18,309
you overcome them lack of direct

562
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:20,200
education college degree experience

563
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:22,600
networking and certifications helped

564
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,970
with that my own mind I'm still working

565
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,678
on it this could have been me I'm a high

566
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,510
school dropout who used to live behind a

567
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:30,970
dumpster it's like I've never been to

568
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:34,840
college it's like but I effin put in

569
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:37,120
time and I failed Lots it's like till I

570
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,770
got here it's like so that's what you

571
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,780
need to do you just apply it saying yeah

572
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,280
I got paper I got certificates it's like

573
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,780
I got I got all the different little

574
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:46,330
pieces of paper that would help validate

575
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:51,040
what I did and let me tell you something

576
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:54,550
okay paper being a college degree or a

577
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,678
certificate means nothing if you can't

578
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,950
back it up

579
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,540
it's

580
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,640
like I think the certificates are

581
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:03,670
valuable I think college degrees are

582
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:07,180
valuable as long as you learn something

583
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:09,730
while getting it because that might get

584
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:12,670
you in the door but it ain't keeping you

585
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:15,790
there it's like within three months

586
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:17,830
they're gonna see what's going on so my

587
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:19,600
own mind I said working on it yeah this

588
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:22,300
is a this is a horse show you don't want

589
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,159
to see it in there find the right

590
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,750
balance between paying the bills and

591
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,270
paying the souls to challenge

592
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:30,640
I literally have that scale you know the

593
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:32,980
scale that everybody should have how

594
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:37,090
much money they're offering how much fun

595
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:40,420
I have and you should judge exactly what

596
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:42,159
is worth to you - how much money versus

597
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,930
how much fun you could have I've

598
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,840
literally turned down a job

599
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:50,440
that was this much money but they'd make

600
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:53,560
me wear a suit every day it was a no go

601
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:56,680
that was I there was not enough ratio

602
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:59,350
there it's like he was too eschewed so

603
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:01,600
no not happening you have to judge you

604
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:04,060
have to make those decisions it's like

605
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,840
will this help me will this help me

606
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:09,940
learn more will this make me happy

607
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:12,669
versus will this give me a good job and

608
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,240
sometimes you have to say I need this

609
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,580
money

610
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,350
this will help me short-term and take

611
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,720
that job and learn some of those things

612
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:22,600
and grind down and until you can find

613
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:26,470
something better but never stay at a job

614
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:29,469
where the ratio for money is so

615
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:31,570
disparate between the the ratio for

616
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:32,350
happiness cuz that's not going to end

617
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,230
well for you

618
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:36,189
or usually your company either

619
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:37,930
everything else is looking at a

620
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:40,930
situation saying can I overcome this

621
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:42,580
with practice if not can I route around

622
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:45,370
this by going and doing something else

623
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:48,070
if that isn't too hacker ethos I don't

624
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:50,530
know what is that's exactly how a hacker

625
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:54,429
should be solving their problems so yes

626
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:55,990
that's a good answer it's like I did the

627
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:57,190
push thingy there we go

628
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,630
is there anything else you would like to

629
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:02,290
add something you'd like someone just

630
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:03,930
starting out - no never give up and do

631
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:06,580
not be afraid to ask for help

632
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:09,880
sounds familiar it's like and it sounds

633
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:11,080
like very very good advice

634
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,760
so is there anything else like that

635
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,559
sometimes the smarter way to hack

636
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,799
something is to build a beginner version

637
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,870
of the same thing yourself it's like if

638
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:21,730
I could I would that would be great but

639
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:23,559
it's like but it's a good thing for some

640
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:25,419
people that can do it it's like looking

641
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:26,889
at the Raspberry Pi looking at certain

642
00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:29,289
these technologies building your own

643
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:31,299
essence building your own little micro

644
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:35,340
labs VirtualBox you know you can create

645
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:39,549
these things and learn more it's like so

646
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:41,500
many opportunities now so many CTF so

647
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:43,990
many different ways you can ask you

648
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,760
start honing these skills it's like that

649
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,260
you're trying to learn because you get

650
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,730
down into it and you get to make

651
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,200
mistakes and you get to learn and you

652
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:52,030
get to rebuild it you get to figure out

653
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,240
how it's working it's like that's the

654
00:27:52,030 --> 00:28:00,820
perfect way to do it so I'd like to

655
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:03,880
thank Shecky and I 2p 2020 it's like not

656
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:07,210
his real name and I'd like to thank them

657
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:10,600
for those answers and now I want to get

658
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:16,030
into another section and that was to

659
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:17,428
help people to with your getting started

660
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:21,789
it's because I wanted to provide that

661
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:23,500
but as I was working on this talk over

662
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:25,270
the last few months I didn't really

663
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,850
start working on this talk like legit

664
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:30,610
like trying to work on it until November

665
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:33,129
it's like so I was like I was trying to

666
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:36,418
sit was gonna come of it and it just

667
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:40,539
turns out that a lot a lot of crap

668
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:42,280
happened in our community it's I and

669
00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:47,440
some stuff that I was getting tired of

670
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:49,450
anyway it's like I did a keynote in LA

671
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,510
hack it's on YouTube I did a keynote for

672
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,799
LA hack this was this past year where I

673
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:57,610
started talking about because people

674
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:59,408
were dissing a conference they were like

675
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:01,209
this hacking conference is you know

676
00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:03,100
cosplay or it's like it's just like

677
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:05,530
these aren't real hackers these are just

678
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:08,520
like you know posers coming in and I'm

679
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:12,280
like who made you the judge of that

680
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:15,340
it pissed me off and so I was like no

681
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:18,090
that's not the way it works it's like

682
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:20,220
and so to go into this whole thing of

683
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:23,399
the matrix

684
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:26,380
everybody wants to be neo

685
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,010
and if everybody wants to be neo in this

686
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,470
community

687
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:31,540
then why there's so many effing ages

688
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:33,430
Smiths running around trying to tell us

689
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:35,770
what we're supposed to do how we're

690
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:43,660
supposed to be and what qualifies to be

691
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:46,330
a hacker why what makes the right for

692
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:50,410
you to put in work for you to have that

693
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:52,379
passion to get to where you are to

694
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:56,890
become a voice in this community and

695
00:29:52,380 --> 00:30:00,430
then to say I don't think you belong eff

696
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:02,740
that noise how many here have popped a

697
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:06,340
shell don't raise your hand I don't

698
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:08,500
effing care how many people here this is

699
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:13,740
your first conference don't raise your

700
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:17,490
hand I don't even care you are here

701
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:20,350
you're a hacker as far as I'm concerned

702
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:23,260
you've got that passion you got that

703
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:26,560
curiosity screw anyone else that says

704
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:29,770
anything different this is a hacking

705
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:33,490
conference you know why because I see

706
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:34,629
hackers here I went to a conference in

707
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:37,810
Oslo

708
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:41,410
that was a hacking conference there were

709
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:44,800
hackers there stopped trying to judge

710
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:48,610
and say what makes a hacker what makes

711
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,649
you deserve to be my community that's

712
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:53,020
ridiculous

713
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:56,050
we're getting to this point where this

714
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:58,389
community has grown so big and the

715
00:30:56,050 --> 00:31:00,850
communications are so available for

716
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:03,760
everybody every a-hole can have an

717
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:07,689
opinion that other people get to see and

718
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:13,050
that's great but don't let them drown

719
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:16,960
out the truth that's not how it started

720
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:19,389
that's not how this community started it

721
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,700
was not based on judgment it was not bad

722
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:24,160
it was based on what you knew and how

723
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:28,750
you did it not how you looked where

724
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:30,520
you're from how you dressed people

725
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:34,150
wanted to know what you knew and just

726
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:35,530
share that information let's make that

727
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:39,470
great again

728
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:41,629
this is getting tiresome it's like we

729
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:44,390
get to the point where we want to be

730
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:47,660
leet hackers no one wants to be

731
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:50,990
compassionate hackers no one wants to be

732
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:54,920
understanding hackers no one wants to be

733
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:59,450
learning hackers we just want to go

734
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:03,740
straight to neo and that's fine work on

735
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:07,580
being neo stop being this a-hole stop

736
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:11,330
trying to judge this person put it very

737
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:13,550
pretty pretty exact right here innocent

738
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:15,020
people we have a dire skill shortage how

739
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:17,030
do we get more people interested in

740
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:19,220
security someone who's interested in

741
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:26,570
security hey sorry quick question how do

742
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:30,950
I ever feel lol noob idiot GTFO is that

743
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:35,840
not accurate is that wrong I wish it was

744
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:40,220
I really really wish it was I didn't

745
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:45,409
take this screen shot last year I took

746
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:47,990
it this week we've got a problem people

747
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:51,380
with how we treat other people in this

748
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:53,990
community so many people come from this

749
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:55,910
community who have been like abused and

750
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:58,180
like bullied in school for what they

751
00:32:55,910 --> 00:33:01,310
were and how different they were and

752
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:03,770
they get to a point and they find the

753
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:05,179
communities they belong in and the first

754
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:07,850
thing they want to do is tell other

755
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:10,970
people who can't be in this community or

756
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:12,770
who shouldn't be and be the bully that

757
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:17,200
they were they were fighting against for

758
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:20,530
so long how does that make sense

759
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:23,870
we need to start speaking up about this

760
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:26,210
we need to start making statements and

761
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:29,060
saying this isn't the way it should be

762
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:33,980
this is not the way our community should

763
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:37,580
be I got this one a few days ago it was

764
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:40,400
amazing I got a damn request are you

765
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:42,320
actually a hacker you didn't do the

766
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,450
laughing emoji I just hide them I wanted

767
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:48,260
to hide the person's identity so you

768
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:49,270
know but I mean this is my answer it's

769
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:53,430
like in the Keith

770
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:55,870
it's like you were born one period

771
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:57,850
people come back actually find the

772
00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:01,060
hacker day and I have people in this

773
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:03,280
community who have bullied me when I was

774
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:06,190
coming up who thought I was full of crap

775
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:07,810
and a couple of times let's be honest I

776
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:11,889
was full of crap

777
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:14,409
I am not perfect it's like I made a lot

778
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:16,540
of mistakes my DEFCON 12 the first Def

779
00:34:14,409 --> 00:34:17,889
Con I ever went to I was a complete

780
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:21,310
effing idiot

781
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:23,080
I was the definition of noob there are

782
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:28,389
pictures of me with spray-painted blue

783
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:32,049
hair it was not pretty people I did

784
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:34,960
everything wrong but the community still

785
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:37,810
accepted me and they gave me a chance to

786
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:41,190
grow and a chance to learn and I got

787
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:45,489
better I'd learned from my failures and

788
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:47,139
I did better so that's what we need to

789
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:49,839
start doing a little bit more making

790
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:52,750
those allowances and letting people get

791
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:54,910
better before we burn them out before we

792
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:56,770
exercise exercise them from the

793
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:59,200
community because they don't do the same

794
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:01,600
definition of hacking that we think they

795
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,439
should be doing or in the proper way

796
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:07,420
and we we talk about acceptance it's

797
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,700
like another uncomfortable subject no

798
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:15,670
one wants to talk about so hey let's

799
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:18,189
talk about it women in tech I understand

800
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:21,370
the irony of the white dude up here

801
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:22,470
talking about women in tech it's

802
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:25,180
ridiculous

803
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:29,620
that it has to be said not the fact that

804
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:32,710
I'm saying it I've always said women

805
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:34,410
started this industry men took it over

806
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:38,440
from them

807
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:41,350
women put men on the moon not just those

808
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:44,710
rocket ships and it was a lot of women

809
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:47,799
of color that did that that don't get

810
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:51,460
the recognition in this industry and in

811
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:55,120
this community we keep talking about how

812
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:58,810
we want we don't want women in tech we

813
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:01,230
want women back in tech that's the

814
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:03,390
proper way to say it

815
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:06,300
it's like we keep getting to this point

816
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:07,980
about why do they have issues well Jason

817
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:11,040

821
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:20,400
I go around to conferences and I have an

822
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:22,740
amazing time it's like I don't see what

823
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,600
the problem is yeah

824
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,770
you have testicles yeah I could

825
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,359
understand you don't have a problem with

826
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:30,690
that

827
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:33,990
it's like that's the problem these are

828
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:38,220
screenshots not that I've collected over

829
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:43,950
the last year these are screenshots from

830
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:47,189
this week this is what women face every

831
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:51,080
day day in and day out and we go where

832
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:56,190
all the women at where all the women at

833
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:58,799
they're dealing with this this right

834
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:01,410
here a guy sending a damn because he

835
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,700
thinks it's okay this is it sorry for

836
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:05,879
bothering you with the pin you didn't

lids boobs come on you look gorgeous

840
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,619
without makeup you seem to fight human

841
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,060
trafficking but don't you see

842
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:17,550
contradictions in the way you propose

843
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:19,109
yourself considering your calls men are

844
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:21,240
not stupid if I'm able to see through

845
00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:23,310
that love you're eager for gonna see

846
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,350
much more through it yes I'm slowly

847
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:27,270
wrapping my yeah that's really gross

848
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:30,330
humans are gross man it's like it's not

849
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:33,660
just a min gender but still they had to

850
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:36,810
deal with that I want to tell you

851
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:39,868
something right now you see a woman in

852
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:43,290
this conference and the first thing you

853
00:37:39,869 --> 00:37:46,380
think about is that I wonder she's here

854
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:48,240
with her boyfriend or wonder she's in

855
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:51,840
sales or marketing or something you're

856
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,100
an idiot if you actually let that say

857
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:56,250
vocally to them

858
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:58,560
you're malicious stop trying to act like

859
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:00,210
you're asking an ignorant question

860
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,910
stop trying to ask if you're just trying

861
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:05,550
to be curious that's malicious that's

862
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:08,009
bullying it doesn't matter

863
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:10,619
why they're here just like it doesn't

864
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:12,300
matter why you're here you're here

865
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:15,230
because you want to learn

866
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:17,730
things assumed that's why they're here

867
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:19,710
we need to stop this crap we need to

868
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:25,170
stop this kind of thing and if you hear

869
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:27,150
this stuff you need to shut it down it

870
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:29,310
shouldn't just be people who are like

871
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:31,050
willing to get up and and you know say

872
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:33,960
stupid things and like scream and rant

873
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:35,880
at people everybody should do that if

874
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,740
you see something say some

875
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:41,610
this whole industry is based on

876
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:43,200
protection and security then why are we

877
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:47,490
securing the people that come to these

878
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:51,509
conferences why is that so hard to wrap

879
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:56,310
around this is an environment for

880
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:59,990
everybody people of color women men bi

881
00:38:56,310 --> 00:39:03,270
trans LSU it doesn't matter

882
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:11,160
you've got curiosity you want to learn

883
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:12,330
you belong here and another thing is

884
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,770
like the thing that gets you to

885
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:16,650
comfortable to be able to say that stuff

886
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:18,540
it's cuz I'm on stage and one of the

887
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:20,640
worst phrases I hate more than anything

888
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:22,560
else and it's no offense to the people

889
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,569
who say it to me and I never hold it

890
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:28,110
against them

891
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:30,810
but they call me a rock star that is so

892
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:35,220
creepy I promise you whatever pedestal

893
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:38,430
you put me on I will disappoint you I am

894
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:41,480
NOT a rock star I am NOT a legend I am

895
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:44,160
nothing but a hacker trying to do good

896
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,260
but I'm really loud and I got really

897
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:50,160
cool cat pictures of my my talks and

898
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:53,520
people let me talk I am no better than

899
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:56,970
anybody else in this conference who can

900
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,590
give talks who aren't you think the only

901
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:01,259
smart people that know things that can

902
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:05,850
share knowledge are just the people on

903
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:08,010
this stage every single one of you have

904
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:09,660
a talk inside you have something that

905
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:12,480
you know that you can share and

906
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:15,299
sometimes it pisses me off so much that

907
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,490
you're not sharing it because you're

908
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:19,560
your own agent Smith you're your own

909
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:21,839
gatekeeper will no one else to hear that

910
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:24,779
or oh that's been done before I don't

911
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,590
care you may know it in a different way

912
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:28,170
you may

913
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:32,580
in a way that actually clicks that helps

914
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:35,730
me learn my job and I'm selfish it's all

915
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:37,529
about me it's like you need to start

916
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:41,780
presenting you need to start

917
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:44,970
participating hacking is a contact sport

918
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:45,620
it's like you need to play and you need

919
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:48,390
to give back

920
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:50,790
you can't just be taking the stuff from

921
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:56,370
it you have something to contribute and

922
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:58,529
if anybody tells you you don't fm that's

923
00:40:56,370 --> 00:41:01,710
just one more barrier that you get the

924
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:03,120
pleasure of breaking through because if

925
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:04,950
you're not having fun breaking through

926
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:08,450
barriers why are you doing this in the

927
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:09,660
first place so we need to get there

928
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:13,439
everybody

929
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:17,690
I love how everybody idolizes me oh we

930
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:23,100
all Heil eyes Niels the one Neos the one

931
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:26,490
we got to go what really did you watch

932
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:29,880
the same movies I watched if all these

933
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:32,700
other people weren't doing their parts

934
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:38,610
weren't helping out weren't contributing

935
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:40,500
that guy's toast am I wrong I mean look

936
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:42,360
at this guy over here in the lower

937
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,590
left-hand corner I don't remember his

938
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,900
name it doesn't matter he's a little

939
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:47,220
extra I had to rewatch it and realize he

940
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:49,380
actually survived I didn't even remember

941
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:51,870
if he died or not in the show it's like

942
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:55,440
but he was like running those ammo boxes

943
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:58,529
out to the gunner he was able to get the

944
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:02,490
doc open and he was introduced in the

945
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:04,140
movie as comic relief right he was

946
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:08,250
looked at like the little fanboy riot

947
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:10,560
over Neil he was Neos fanboy but also

948
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:12,540
when the other scenes that he was in he

949
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:16,279
stopped Agent Smith from killing him

950
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:19,650
oh no response no no no credit for that

951
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:23,400
he just did his job he just did what he

952
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:25,910
needed to do it's like he brought ammo

953
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:32,580
to this mean angry person right there

954
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:35,839
it's like who helps save the docs was he

955
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:38,360
the one he made for them to get through

956
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:41,280
he held it

957
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:42,810
stop thinking that there's one person in

958
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,750
this industry that you got to look up to

959
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:50,190
and say oh I gotta be like them you got

960
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:52,710
to be like you you're just as important

961
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:55,980
as neo because without all these other

962
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:57,810
people needle doesn't exist existed in

963
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,630
the minds is in the inspiration for

964
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:02,570
people fine

965
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:08,180
but these other people made it happen

966
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:10,830
there are no rock stars in this industry

967
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:12,299
there are people that hack and there's

968
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:16,310
people that speak and there's people

969
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:18,930
that share knowledge that's what counts

970
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:21,810
it's like it doesn't end you know and

971
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,950
you go to these black picking village go

972
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:25,110
to some of these other village go to

973
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:27,720
these places those are rock star people

974
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:31,080
like to write because they're teaching

975
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:34,049
they're putting in time there's people

976
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,340
that are sitting behind that desk that

977
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:36,380
aren't getting to see the rest of the

978
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,220
conference

979
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,930
because they're trying to make it

980
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:42,959
available for you and give you something

981
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:45,710
give you education how is that not as

982
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,270
important as me on a stage for an hour

983
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:51,720
how do they not get top billing

984
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:55,410
all these organizers all these

985
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:56,819
volunteers that are putting in work the

986
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:59,549
person that was helping me with the mic

987
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:01,590
help me with the display why is it their

988
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:06,060
name more prominent for this conference

989
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:08,370
because they make it happen you need to

990
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,900
start understanding it's not just this

991
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:14,009
stage that's important it's just

992
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:18,090
community it is everybody in it we all

993
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:19,730
make it happen we're all that you know

994
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:22,710
the hero and our own story

995
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:26,070
it's like start sharing that and start

996
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:30,750
believing it more because no one is

997
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:34,260
going to tell you who you are there is

998
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:36,720
no one here that can tell you this is

999
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:39,480
what you're supposed to be this is how

1000
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:41,399
you're supposed to do it it's like this

1001
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:45,140
is how suppose there would be hardly

1002
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:47,700
anything on this planet in existence if

1003
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:51,180
all the inventors and all the hackers

1004
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,960
were just like oh that's the way it's

1005
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:54,899
supposed to be

1006
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,700
darn I thought it could be this way - no

1007
00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:00,020
it can't be that way you got to okay

1008
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:02,549
I'll do it this way then you got nothing

1009
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:05,550
because this whole community this whole

1010
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:10,050
history of hacking came from people

1011
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:12,630
going Fu I'm gonna try it this way I'm

1012
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:14,300
gonna see what happens there and oops I

1013
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:17,010
blew something up I'm gonna try it again

1014
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:18,480
differently oh I crashed an airplane

1015
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:20,640
okay I'm gonna try this a little bit

1016
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,410
differently it's like you know it's like

1017
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,940
they keep trying I didn't mean the

1018
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:25,649
actual boeing thing it's like Chris yeah

1019
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:28,740
I was talking about the Wright brothers

1020
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:33,060
but still is you get the point right we

1021
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:34,979
make mistakes and we kept going and we

1022
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:38,670
kept looking and we kept trying to find

1023
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:45,300
answers so that's the whole genesis of

1024
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:47,010
this there is no spoon there is no goal

1025
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:50,010
there is no definition there is no

1026
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:53,400
single answer on how you become a hacker

1027
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:56,220
or how you are a hacker or why you're at

1028
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:59,010
a hacker conference there are no

1029
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:01,950
expectations stop looking for spoons

1030
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:07,740
stop looking for the answers inside the

1031
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:10,919
box stop thinking there's a box that's

1032
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:15,000
the problem be the hacker you know you

1033
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:17,570
can be and screw anyone else telling you

1034
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,570
different

1035
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:32,940
oh sorry that's usually where my talk

1036
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:36,810
ins and where y'all get to ask me

1037
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:38,970
questions that's not how this works I'm

1038
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:41,820
now going to ask the audience a question

1039
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:44,279
and I'm going to get at least three

1040
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:47,340
answers from y'all and if no one

1041
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:49,950
volunteers immediately I will run off

1042
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:53,880
this stage and I will randomly pick

1043
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:55,109
someone to give me the answer so look at

1044
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,540
everybody separable okay no one's

1045
00:46:55,110 --> 00:47:00,510
bolting so the question I have for you

1046
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:03,360
is very simple it was one of the

1047
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:05,460
questions I already asked what is the

1048
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,410
one thing that you would like to tell

1049
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:09,360
someone who's just starting out in this

1050
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:11,970
industry that you wish you would have

1051
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:15,060
known when you first started out what is

1052
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:18,330
the just one not three just give me one

1053
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:23,330
you wish you would have known just do it

1054
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:25,920
just do it exactly just make it happen

1055
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:28,069
everything can be done it's just a

1056
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,900
matter how long it takes to learn it

1057
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:33,480
exactly I have like tried to do 3d

1058
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:36,060
printing and it's like and I've given up

1059
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:37,560
before but then I would come back to it

1060
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,700
and I would start trying to do more and

1061
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,620
more and I would ask for help

1062
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:42,480
it's like you don't give up it's like it

1063
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:44,670
takes time and sometimes it takes longer

1064
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:47,970
and the answer is not just there for you

1065
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:50,430
but you just keep pounding it no matter

1066
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:51,870
how intelligent you are unless you

1067
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:54,990
understand that the people you are

1068
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:56,670
interacting with have feelings you're

1069
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:58,649
gonna fail and you're gonna fail hard

1070
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:00,900
and you're gonna fail many many times oh

1071
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:03,920
my gosh that is a great answer because

1072
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:07,470
it doesn't people keep thinking that

1073
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,180
executives are stupid I'm sorry

1074
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:11,370
executives know how to run a company

1075
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:13,740
they're not stupid it's like they know

1076
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:15,390
how to run a job your job is to tell

1077
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:17,790
them and talk to them in ways they

1078
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:20,160
understand so they can make their

1079
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:21,600
business decisions you go in there and

1080
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,009
you start talking about how smart you

1081
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,540
are in all these terms and stuff and

1082
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:27,750
laugh at the executive and as the

1083
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:29,160
pointy-haired boss you suck you have to

1084
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:32,040
educate and you have to communicate

1085
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,759
properly yes there are no stupid

1086
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,790
questions

1087
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:38,310
that is true there are no stew because

1088
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:39,759
trust me if there have I would have

1089
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:43,269
invented them by now

1090
00:48:39,759 --> 00:48:48,279
like so you got to keep going do we have

1091
00:48:43,269 --> 00:48:49,839
any other answers up what over here and

1092
00:48:48,279 --> 00:48:51,189
after that I'll let you actually you

1093
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,659
know ask me a question you want to ask

1094
00:48:51,189 --> 00:48:55,029
me a question or throw something at me

1095
00:48:52,659 --> 00:48:58,209
the only true answer is keep packing

1096
00:48:55,029 --> 00:49:00,669
yes keep packing keep trying to go after

1097
00:48:58,209 --> 00:49:02,649
it now if anybody else would like to ask

1098
00:49:00,669 --> 00:49:08,038

okay

1102
00:49:13,509 --> 00:49:18,849
I didn't think anybody would fall

1103
00:49:14,919 --> 00:49:25,499
through on that one hi there hi you

1104

1106
00:49:28,179 --> 00:49:35,219
flaws in that logic it's like very good
