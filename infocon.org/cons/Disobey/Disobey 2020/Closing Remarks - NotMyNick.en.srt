171
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,880
holy there was a lot less of you

172
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:44,579
when we start started

173
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,740
Wow okay thank you thank you thank you

174
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:48,930
thank you I will make sure all of you

175
00:13:46,740 --> 00:14:06,620
who drink gets very drunk at the after

176
00:13:48,930 --> 00:14:06,620
party so where did I put the thing

177
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:26,010
anything I would say after this would be

178
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:28,980
meaningless so thank you thank you thank

179
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:31,620
you I hope I'll see all of you are more

180
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:34,710
next year and I hope I'll see some of

181
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:38,430
you at the after party thank you so much

182
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:43,130
we truly do love you and this wouldn't

183
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:43,130
happen without you showing up so

184
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:55,120
