00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:40,000
[Applause]

3
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:43,180
hello disobey and thanks for coming my

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,460
name is Miko and if you know who I am

5
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,470
you probably know me as the old fart who

6
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,809
goes around carrying a five and

7
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,180
quarter-inch floppy disk on him at all

8
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:53,860
times

9
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,050
so I've stopped doing that instead of

10
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:59,559
carrying a five and quarter-inch floppy

11
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:03,760
disk which is getting old I started

12
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:09,789
carrying an 8 inch floppy disk huh how's

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:11,979
this and these are so old

14
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,680
I mean I'm old I've never used an 8 inch

15
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:17,050
floppy disk myself professionally I have

16
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,820
used like actually working at f-secure

17
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:21,009
I've actually used 5 1/4 inch floppy

18
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,639
disks for real I've also started

19
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:26,830
carrying punch tape so if anybody wants

20
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,570
punch tape later today I have plenty of

21
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:33,819
that and punch cards there's so many

22
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:37,240
people here in the audience who started

23
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:40,810
hacking much much later than any of this

24
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,369
technology was around us world is

25
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:47,580
changing because of technology

26
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:51,970
technology shapes our world shapes our

27
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:54,910
crises shapes our conflicts and it

28
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,500
shapes our wars and all these changes

29
00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:00,100
are happening very quickly we're

30
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:03,119
actually very lucky to be alive right

31
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,288
now these are very exciting times

32
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,459
technology has never been moving so

33
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:13,450
quickly as it is moving right now but

34
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:17,370
one thing bothers me a bit if you go to

35
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:20,140
your computer you open up your browser

36
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,090
then you open up the history list and

37
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,660
just browse through where have you been

38
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,510
lately

39
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:28,660
what kind of websites have you been

40
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,489
visiting over the last week where have

41
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:33,430
you been surfing the web over the last

42
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:36,450
days well you'll see that there's

43
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:39,370
probably some new sites and if you're

44
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,920
local for example living here in Finland

45
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,090
those probably are Finnish local news

46
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,940
sites in your own

47
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:52,090
language sure but then everything else

48
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:54,940
everything else including the cloud

49
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:58,120
services and the search engines and the

50
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:02,049
social media websites are coming from

51
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:05,319
United States of America and this is a

52
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:08,709
bit weird this is actually really weird

53
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:10,988
especially when you consider that the

54
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:13,900
operating system that you're running on

55
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:16,360
your device many of us would be running

56
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,790
again an operating system made in United

57
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,130
States of America because the majority

58
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:24,760
is running Windows on OS X or on your

59
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:29,709
mobile device Android or iOS all made in

60
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:33,220
USA so the services we use the operating

61
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:36,129
systems we run and the chips the CPUs on

62
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:39,040
our devices are coming from Intel AMD or

63
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:41,290
Qualcomm from United States and this is

64
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,200
a bit surprising because when you look

65
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:47,620
at the actual statistics on internet

66
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:51,638
users United States of America isn't

67
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,959
important at all the majority of

68
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:55,780
Internet users are coming from

69
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,060
everywhere else except from USA

70
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:01,450
everywhere else except North America in

71
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:03,940
fact North America could disappear from

72
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:06,010
the internet and there would be no

73
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,859
significant dent in the amount of users

74
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:11,078
at all there are more users obviously in

75
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:12,220
Asia Asia has as many users as the rest

76
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:14,829
of the world combined

77
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,649
but even Europe Africa and Latin America

78
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:20,470
have more users online today and so

79
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:23,200
isn't it a bit weird imbalance that we

80
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:26,710
have right here United States of America

81
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,740
is the king of faint in it but they

82
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:32,109
create these services hardware CPUs and

83
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:35,130
operating systems for everyone else rest

84
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:37,750
of the world relies on them

85
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:39,820
and I was thinking about this last week

86
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,500
because last week we got the quarterly

87
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,620
results from the largest technology

88
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,419
companies in the world the largest

89
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,039
technology company in the world is Apple

90
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,960
Apple is the second most valuable

91
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:52,510
company in the world based on their

92
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:55,000
stock value and they're quickly reaching

93
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:57,180
Saudi Aramco which is the most valuable

94
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,250
public company in the world

95
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:04,120
now in the quarterly results and the

96
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:07,120
combined results for the year 2019 Apple

97
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:10,180
mentioned in passing that they now have

98
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:15,510
a little over one and a half billion

99
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:20,080
active devices one and a half billion

100
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:24,969
active devices running Apple operating

101
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:27,640
systems running OSX or iOS and that's a

102
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:31,930
big number but exactly how big a number

103
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:35,680
is that well a day later we got the 2019

104
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:38,860
results from another technology company

105
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,950
another over a billion dollars valued

106
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:44,340
company Microsoft and in their details

107
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:49,260
they mentioned that they now have almost

108
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:53,710
one and a half billion active devices

109
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:56,260
Apple has bypassed Microsoft Apple is

110
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:58,060
now bigger than Microsoft when you look

111
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,690
at the amount of active devices you

112
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:05,190
actual devices in use by the users and

113
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:08,860
yes before you ask me this does include

114
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:11,230
Xboxes and it does include all ATMs

115
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,870
running Windows all active devices

116
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,610
running Windows there's less of those

117
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:20,070
that active devices running an operating

118
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:22,750
system from Apple and this is historic

119
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:26,590
it's sort of similar to what we saw last

120
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:30,160
summer because in the summer of 2019 for

121
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:32,349
the very first time in our statistics at

122
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,720
f-secure we saw that there's more

123
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:38,620
malicious traffic on the internet

124
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:41,230
generated from linux based devices than

125
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,150
from windows-based devices this is

126
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:45,670
largely thanks to the Internet of Things

127
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,820
because all these insecure coffee

128
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:50,710
machines and doorbells are running some

129
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:52,540
god-awful old Linux distribution and

130
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:55,180
they are generating massive amounts of

131
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:58,870
network traffic but nevertheless it is

132
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:01,510
historic times Microsoft and Windows has

133
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:06,240
been the king of the hill for two

134
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:10,539
decades and now things are changing so

135
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:13,900
we are more and more reliant on tech

136
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:17,700
nology more and more reliant on the

137
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:20,789
Internet but this is nothing new

138
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:24,370
technology shapes our world technology

139
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:27,520
shapes the way we live and if you think

140
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:30,040
about other big shifts it's easy to

141
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,200
compare this shift of going to the

142
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,670
online world to the shift which happened

143
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,750
little over a hundred years ago hundred

144
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:39,030
and fifty years ago which was

145
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:41,740
electricity when electricity became

146
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,450
mainstream and they started actually for

147
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,790
example putting electricity grid in

148
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:48,760
Helsinki which means you've got electric

149
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:51,310
light and you got radio obviously that

150
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:54,909
was a very very big shift and very

151
00:07:51,310 --> 00:08:00,490
quickly in two or three decades we

152
00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:03,850
became reliant on electricity today our

153
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:06,400
society every society runs on

154
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:09,100
electricity and the easiest way to take

155
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,799
down a society today is to cut

156
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:15,910
electricity and you keep it down for a

157
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:19,210
week or two or three that's it within a

158
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:21,910
week things start happening because we

159
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:23,919
can't do anything without electricity we

160
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:26,290
lose all communication capability

161
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,910
including our mobile phones we don't

162
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:31,120
know what's going on we can't get

163
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:34,570
information we can't move around we

164
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:38,590
can't feel gas in our cars we can't

165
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:41,550
travel we can't get food so electricity

166
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:44,920
is a great example of an innovation

167
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:47,260
which made us very very reliant on that

168
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,599
innovation we can't live without it

169
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,760
anymore but of course we wouldn't want

170
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,340
to go back either electricity has

171
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,710
brought us so much everything around us

172
00:08:54,340 --> 00:09:00,850
runs on electricity we wouldn't trade it

173
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:03,090
for anything and exactly the same thing

174
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:07,150
is happening with internet right now

175
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:08,890
yes internet has brought us so much good

176
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:12,579
so much connectivity so much

177
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:16,330
entertainment so let's business and so

178
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:18,420
many new risks so many new threats but

179
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:22,720
most importantly we are becoming as

180
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:24,339
reliant on Internet as we are on

181
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,980
electricity

182
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:29,650
eventually everything that we plug into

183
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:32,230
the electricity grid we will also be

184
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:34,329
plugging into the internet grid and just

185
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:37,150
like today our society will not be able

186
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:40,060
to function without electricity in a

187
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:43,000
matter of years our society will not be

188
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,920
able to function without internet in

189
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,750
some respects it's already happening

190
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:53,319
today within ten years within 20 years

191
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:57,190
it's gonna be as bad as losing access to

192
00:09:53,320 --> 00:10:02,560
electricity grid now this is a trade off

193
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:06,670
we are trading safety for great new

194
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,410
benefits we did that with electricity we

195
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:14,260
are doing that with the internet right

196
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:15,699
right now so what are the biggest risks

197
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,520
for us online

198
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:22,440
is it the foreign intelligence agencies

199
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:26,020
or foreign militaries or activists or

200
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:29,350
terrorists well no it is criminals

201
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:31,360
online crime continues to be the biggest

202
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,820
single problem we have the vast vast

203
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,339
majority of the problems we fight and we

204
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:39,400
see at our customer base are obviously

205
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:42,070
coming from organized crime gangs gangs

206
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,709
which buy and sell stolen information

207
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:48,580
which use ransom Trojans and password

208
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:51,490
theft which use services seen the tor

209
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:54,339
hidden service to sell stolen goods to

210
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,060
sell stolen passwords to still stolen

211
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:57,520
dumps

212
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:00,760
that's credit card information and offer

213
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:03,010
you services where they will buy stuff

214
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:06,100
illegally and sell it further or launder

215
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:08,470
your money for yourself as I was going

216
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,910
through different online marketplaces in

217
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,800
the tor hidden service there's actually

218
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:16,810
one which really interested me it's

219
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:18,430
called Trump dumps yeah there's a

220
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,020
website which is selling stolen credit

221
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:25,150
card information called Trump's dumps

222
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:29,680
and this made me thinking who is the

223
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:31,920
richest hacker in the world who's the

224
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,290
richest hacker in the world

225
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,599
maybe the richest hacker in the world

226
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,410
is this guy

227
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,510
[Laughter]

228
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,510
[Music]

229
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:56,169
[Music]

230
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:10,089
[Music]

231
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:14,830
let's see any nickel in you've gonna

232
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:16,450
nickel in who hacked most of you this is

233
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,460
the LinkedIn hacker guy who grabbed

234
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,800
broke into LinkedIn and stole the whole

235
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,450
user base I'm guessing most of us are on

236
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,930
LinkedIn or we're on LinkedIn when he

237
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:27,820
did his hack in 2016 and you saw him

238
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:30,870
driving around the Moscow Ring roads

239
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:33,430
with his audio rate and his Lamborghini

240
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:38,920
sure he made a lot of money but maybe

241
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:41,589
he's not as rich some got him ballot of

242
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:45,250
who probably also hacked many of us here

243
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:48,010
as well I'm guessing most of us have at

244
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:51,160
some point had a yahoo account he's -

245
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:54,910
yahoo hacker a russian guy from Toronto

246
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,500
who was hacking services a couple of

247
00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:00,250
years ago here's a picture from his yard

248
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:03,040
so he made clearly a lot of money but

249
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:05,740
then again maybe he's not the richest

250
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,800
hacker maybe the richest hacker is eager

251
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:11,650
to receive also known as Tiger who was

252
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:15,939
one of the heads of the so-called dry

253
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:18,069
decks also known as evil Corp gang which

254
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,410
is a gang operated from Moscow which was

255
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:22,600
involved in many of the Ransom trojan

256
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:25,510
operations we've been fighting over the

257
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,209
last five years the dried extrusion have

258
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:32,380
been used to drop all kinds of ransom

259
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:34,089
Trojans on infected machines that logo

260
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,839
right there in the hood of the Nissan

261
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:40,380
Skyline GTR is the logo of the evil Corp

262
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:43,480
team and the gang themselves preferred

263
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:45,430
Lamborghinis and Oddie our eights here's

264
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:49,870
actually a video clip of one of the gang

265
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:51,469
members showing off his our audio aid in

266
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:57,110
Moscow

267
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:59,520
[Music]

268
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:02,399
the building you see in the background

269
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:08,490
is the office of the Justice in Moscow

270
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:10,380
and he's doing donuts outside so these

271
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:13,620
guys have made a lot of money but then

272
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:16,170
again these are all Russians I'm sure we

273
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,450
have rich criminals online hackers from

274
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:20,969
somewhere else maybe the best Kundera

275
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:23,610
might be this card is Milo Mustafa

276
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:26,820
however a smiler has not been convicted

277
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:30,120
of anything so he's just allegedly

278
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:32,180
involved in business email compromised

279
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,860
attacks you know see your scams

280
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:37,770
large-scale attacks targeting companies

281
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,899
trying to fool the employees of these

282
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:44,370
companies to wire money to outside

283
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:45,779
accounts how much money has he made well

284
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:50,760
I went to look at his Instagram

285
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:51,959
this is boom fun here's moon with

286
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,500
his Mercedes

287
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:58,529
here's moon fall with his other Mercedes

288
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,970
here's moon fought with his Ferrari it

289
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:02,160
looks like a Lamborghini because it's

290
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:04,350
yellow but it's actually a Ferrari and

291
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,420
here's he is with his Lamborghini which

292
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:10,380
is red and it looks like a Ferrari and

293
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:12,240
his McLaren and his rolls-royce and they

294
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:17,610
always say that crime doesn't pay

295
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:19,860
right so who is the richest hacker in

296
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:22,170
the world well this is a trick question

297
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,820
of course of course he's a trick

298
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:26,880
question because the richest hacker in

299
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:30,270
the world by far is Mohammed bin Salman

300
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:33,029
the crown prince of Saudi Arabia because

301
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:35,970
he's the 29th richest man in the world

302
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:40,439
and as we read from newspapers three

303
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:44,100
weeks ago he allegedly sent a whatsapp

304
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:46,890
message which contained a video to this

305
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,730
guy and this is Jeff Bezos the number

306
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:52,319
one richest guy in the world and

307
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,329
allegedly this whatsapp message

308
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,810
contained an exploit which took over

309
00:15:54,329 --> 00:16:02,760
Jeff Bezos E's phone and all of this

310
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:05,030
happened five months before Mohammed bin

311
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:08,900
Salman was involved in

312
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:11,660
during this guy Jamal khashoggi and he

313
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,110
Jamal khashoggi was working for Jeff

314
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,390
Bezos

315
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:16,310
at the time because he's a journalist he

316
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:21,880
was riding for Washington Post and

317
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:21,880
Washington Post is owned by Jeff Bezos

318
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:27,770
and this all sounds like a movie plot or

319
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:29,600
something just things that we find for

320
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,910
hard to believe it's actually happening

321
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,460
for real but that's nothing new it

322
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:37,370
sounded like a movie plot when we

323
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:40,580
learned three years ago that North Korea

324
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:42,650
is launching attacks against Sony

325
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,620
Pictures because Sony Pictures is about

326
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:48,949
to release a movie which laughs at the

327
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:54,380
dictator of North Korea yet that was

328
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:56,630
true so governments are involved in the

329
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,630
attacks we see but the attacks coming

330
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:01,820
from governments don't typically target

331
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:04,609
normal people they target people like

332
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:09,440
Jeff Bezos they target unusual people

333
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:11,240
they target unusual organizations normal

334
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:16,100
organizations have nothing worth

335
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:19,280
stealing by a nation-state Intelligence

336
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:21,859
Agency some companies do but they are

337
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:26,230
rare so most companies are never

338
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:30,439
targeted by foreign governments and

339
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:33,920
today intelligence agencies wouldn't be

340
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:38,420
doing their job if they already wouldn't

341
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:41,420
have physical moles people working

342
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:46,010
inside of the largest cloud and social

343
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:51,440
media providers in the world our data is

344
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:54,020
in the cloud our data is at AWS in Azur

345
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,660
in Google cloud engine that's where it

346
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:59,780
is intelligence agencies know this very

347
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:02,090
well and they know that it's hard to

348
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:04,250
break into the service is run by Amazon

349
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:06,530
Microsoft or Google because a lot of

350
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:09,500
makers of the Google spend hundreds of

351
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:12,920
millions to secure their networks yet

352
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:15,890
they have to gain access so the easiest

353
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:18,320
way has got to be to just get your

354
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:21,860
people recruited to work in

355
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,950
side of these organizations last year I

356
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:28,340
was visiting Google and I mentioned this

357
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:30,559
that's we were having lunch with Google

358
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,629
guys and girls I just you know brought

359
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,309
it up that you know then what do you

360
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:36,490
think about the problem of moles like

361
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:40,158
you know foreign intelligence agencies

362
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:42,110
working inside of Google and they were

363
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:43,519
all like yeah it probably happens and

364
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:49,240
then they were looking around the table

365
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:51,889
at each other like and this isn't just

366
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:55,730
theoretical again going back to Saudi

367
00:18:51,889 --> 00:18:58,279
Arabia there has been arrests of Saudi

368
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:01,940
intelligent agents working inside of

369
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:05,840
Twitter in fact one of the three arrests

370
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:07,970
of the Saudi agents who were working for

371
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,799
Saudi government and we're working

372
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:12,169
inside of Twitter one of them actually

373
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:18,668
left Twitter before they were arrested

374
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:21,470
and went to work for Amazon I wonder why

375
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:24,309
what were these guys working at Twitter

376
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:29,000
well of course they were trying to find

377
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:32,120
dissidents who tweet things against this

378
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,549
or the government that's where they were

379
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,320
trying to find why did one of them leave

380
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:40,070
Twitter and go to work for Amazon well

381
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:44,360
we don't know but that's where AWS is so

382
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:47,509
yeah cyber operations are very real this

383
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:54,620
really is happening around us and most

384
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:58,570
of this is invisible so if you want to

385
00:19:54,620 --> 00:20:02,449
want to learn how it actually feels like

386
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:04,789
when your organization is targeted by a

387
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:07,070
foreign government we have to speak with

388
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:11,320
the people who were there when it

389
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:14,090
happened so a friend of mine Andy Jones

390
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:17,840
wrote a book last year this book right

391
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:20,418
here surviving the extinction event he

392
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,059
speaks about what it feels like when you

393
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:26,179
are inside an organization when things

394
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:28,580
really go bad because he knows because

395
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:31,850
Andy was the chief information security

396
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:34,750
officer for Maersk

397
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:37,549
not petia went through their networks

398
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:41,030
the book paints a great picture about

399
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:44,440
how it went down when it actually

400
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:47,660
started and he was having an off site

401
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,760
with his people IT staff in a hotel ten

402
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:52,220
minutes away from their headquarters

403
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,870
Maersk is a Danish company their IT

404
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,960
operations are run from United Kingdom

405
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:59,689
and it was in UK which which is various

406
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,460
offices so he was in his off-site with

407
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:04,070
his key people when the phone rings and

408
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:06,080
he gets the first word about the

409
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:08,178
ransomware trojan going through their

410
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,939
networks so he leaves the meeting right

411
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:13,669
away gets into his car drives the 10

412
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:16,220
minute drive to the headquarters during

413
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:19,929
that 10 minutes they lost 90% of their

414
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:23,990
infrastructure that's how fast it was

415
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:25,640
and then it was bad like they soon

416
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,559
realized that you know most of their

417
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,690
computers are overwritten most of their

418
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:31,908
laptops are gone most of their desktops

419
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:34,970
are gone most of their servers are gone

420
00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:38,270
all of their abs are gone their phones

421
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:40,309
are empty like they're trying to call to

422
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:42,230
their country offices to check what the

423
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:44,059
situation is then they can't call them

424
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,559
their desk phones are voice over IP

425
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:47,809
phones they don't work of course they

426
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:50,178
don't work because it's voice over IP so

427
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:52,549
they use their normal iPhones but their

428
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:55,640
phone lists the address book is empty

429
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:56,900
because a DS are down and you don't

430
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,070
remember the phone numbers of your

431
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,360
people of course you don't remember the

432
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:01,309
phone numbers because they are in your

433
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,649
phone and how many of you have printed

434
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:06,260
out your address book on a piece of

435
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:08,960
paper so you could have it in case your

436
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:12,590
phone doesn't work nobody does that

437
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,450
nobody does that except the people who

438
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:17,178
have gone through it they realize that

439
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:20,570
having your phone book on a piece of

440
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:23,780
paper is words worth it waiting cold

441
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:26,720
when you're a DS go down and of course

442
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,549
we never assume that all of our a DS

443
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,820
would go down at the same time but

444
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:34,400
that's exactly what happened here

445
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:37,760
there's a great part in his book where

446
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,110
Andy describes that he's they realize

447
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,780
just how bad it is that they've lost

448
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:44,540
everything and then he sits back in his

449
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,649
chair and starts thinking that ok you

450
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:50,659
know we've lost everything

451
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:55,500
now is it just us it's just our company

452
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:57,300
or is it the whole world as far as they

453
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,740
can see it could be the whole world it

454
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,050
could be that every single Windows

455
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:02,580
machine on the planet has been

456
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:05,220
overwritten because from their point of

457
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:09,620
view everything they can see is gone and

458
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:13,590
then he looks at the window and he sees

459
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:16,139
cars driving by and tram operation and

460
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:17,909
people walking in and out of shops and

461
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:21,300
then he realized okay it's not the whole

462
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:24,000
world it's just us but you know just

463
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:26,639
think about that but for a moment it

464
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,260
seemed possible that the whole world has

465
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:34,410
gone down and there's a great question

466
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:38,310
and he asks in his book practical

467
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:39,780
question a question you would ask when

468
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:43,800
you are in the middle of something like

469
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:45,840
this when the massive scale of the

470
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:49,800
attack against your company becomes

471
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,750
public when it hits the news when every

472
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,210
newspaper is writing about these

473
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:56,250
massively large massive massive large

474
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:58,350
attack and uses your company as an

475
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:01,620
example of a company which has been hit

476
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:04,110
bad what happens next is that everybody

477
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:05,219
wants to talk to you your phone is

478
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,679
ringing off the hook

479
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:10,320
every regulator wants to talk to you

480
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,810
right now every intelligence agency

481
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,889
wants to talk to you right now

482
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:21,240
every client wants to talk to you right

483
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:22,560
now like what do you do he actually does

484
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,510
not answer the question in his book so

485
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,520
he asked him I asked him that Andy I

486
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:30,360
mean you lived through it like tell me

487
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:33,000
what did you do and he said well you

488
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:35,699
know they had to make they had to make

489
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,390
some calls about what to do so they made

490
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:43,410
a call that you know we are a Danish

491
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:46,260
company so we will only speak with the

492
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:49,110
Danish police we will only speak with

493
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:51,180
the Danish regulator we will only speak

494
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:53,370
with the Danish shirt

495
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:55,890
we will only speak with the Danish

496
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:58,229
intelligence everyone else who calls we

497
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,440
direct them to those that's what that's

498
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,090
what they did in practice

499
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,650
but once again it's something you can

500
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:07,689
think through beforehand and have a plan

501
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:10,980
so then you are ready when your phone

502
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,980
starts ringing off the hook

503
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:20,290
so in slush three months ago we

504
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,490
announced a new major project for

505
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:23,310
machine learning and artificial

506
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:26,740
intelligence that we've been developing

507
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:29,440
inside f-secure and machine learning is

508
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,960
shaping our world the world of computer

509
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,080
security right now more than any other

510
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,430
technology and it has been doing it for

511
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,679
many years already

512
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:41,350
every single security company every

513
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,960
single large security company is relying

514
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:45,850
on machine learning right now and it

515
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:49,240
seems to me that machine learning is

516
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:51,969
becoming a similar technology like

517
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,400
electricity and Internet it's going to

518
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:57,580
become so important that we will become

519
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,860
reliant on it and within decades we

520
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:04,389
can't function our societies can't

521
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:06,429
function without these mechanisms the

522
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:08,800
machine learning is problematic because

523
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:11,710
when it becomes advanced enough we

524
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:15,120
humans can't understand it anymore and

525
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:17,050
I'm not speaking about general wide

526
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,350
superhuman AI and I'm speaking about

527
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:24,490
narrow AI like you know Google search

528
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:27,550
Google engineers don't really understand

529
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:30,280
anymore how Google search works because

530
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:32,860
it's been teaching itself for a decade

531
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,960
it's getting all this data are learning

532
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,879
more and more and it works like a charm

533
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,860
you know it when you go googling it's

534
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,200
sort of guesses what you're but you're

535
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:43,540
thinking about it that's how good it is

536
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,320
but not a single human anymore

537
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:52,600
understands exactly how it does the

538
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:54,280
guessing so these narrow examples of

539
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,740
machine learning are everywhere around

540
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:00,000
us and there's plenty of great research

541
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,000
being done in this space

542
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,880
this is one of the slides I have where I

543
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:10,550
know that it doesn't matter what I speak

544
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,840
during this slide because nobody's

545
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:14,450
listening to me everybody's just

546
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,919
watching the morphing phases you know

547
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:17,750
this is what machines can do when

548
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,910
machines learn this is very interesting

549
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:22,370
research which actually has been done

550
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:25,640
like a hundred meters from here this is

551
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:27,560
from Nvidia Nvidia Finland so you're

552
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:31,040
collecting a tarot card assembly line at

553
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:34,780
Timo Isla these guys do world-class

554
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:39,860
research on technologies like these like

555
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:41,899
how to create human-like things and this

556
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:44,060
looks like science fiction in many ways

557
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:52,900
so let's play a clip from a science

558
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:55,040
fiction movie premiere until my own room

559
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,330
I'm placing you under arrest for the

560
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:01,780
future murder of Sarah marks give the

561
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:05,409
man a sense for a future murder

562
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:09,379
this is Minority Report speaks about

563
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:14,960
pre-crime based on a philip k dick story

564
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:17,350
from 1956 so 70 years old story which

565
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,650
puts a picture of pre-crime where

566
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:25,280
technology is so good that we can detect

567
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:29,150
crime before it happens so we can arrest

568
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:32,740
murderers before they murder so we can

569
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:35,740
arrest innocent criminals innocent

570
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:39,020
criminals why am i speaking about this

571
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:42,320
because last night I was scrolling

572
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:44,840
through the talks which we will be

573
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,540
hearing later this month at the RSA

574
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,310
Conference in San Francisco unless it's

575
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:53,600
going to get cancelled because of the

576
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:55,550
corona virus but if it's going to go

577
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,219
through its well RSA is the biggest

578
00:28:55,550 --> 00:29:00,970
single event in computer security with

579
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:04,270
50,000 or almost 50,000 people attending

580
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:06,350
and as I'm scrolling through the talks I

581
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:08,240
noticed that there was a talk called

582
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:11,510
three crime detection using predictive

583
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:16,549
policing systems for real let me never

584
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:19,759
talk about pre-crime in RSA in two weeks

585
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:22,580
so we are crossing borders that we've

586
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:23,959
never crossed before we are using

587
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:27,769
machine learning this talks about

588
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:30,830
machine learning to detect crimes before

589
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:32,959
they are committed machine learnings

590
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:34,928
that detect murder before it's murdered

591
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:41,559
you are under arrest for a future murder

592
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:45,709
huh and when we look at the other narrow

593
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:47,779
machine learning areas of course the

594
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:50,599
things that have been built by Tesla are

595
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:53,419
interesting this is a real clip this is

596
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:55,369
what Tesla the cars actually see when

597
00:29:53,419 --> 00:29:57,709
they are driving around on their own

598
00:29:55,369 --> 00:29:59,718
that's straight from this is published

599
00:29:57,709 --> 00:30:03,679
by Tesla themselves as an example of the

600
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:05,690
data they collect for machine vision for

601
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:09,559
self-driving car functionality in

602
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:12,999
current generation Tesla cars it looks

603
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:15,999
pretty neat but it does remind me of

604
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:15,999
something

605
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:44,180
[Music]

606
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:47,540
I don't know if any of you have a hobby

607
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:49,790
of pausing movies when they show a

608
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:52,399
display for computer or something like

609
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:54,350
this like you know HUD or things like

610
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,690
that but if you actually do it in

611
00:30:54,350 --> 00:31:00,500
Terminator and you zoom in on the

612
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:03,500
details for example here we see 6502

613
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:06,050
assembly that's basically Commodore 64

614
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:09,470
actually you google for it this is Apple

615
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:11,030
to assembly code shown on screen and in

616
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:16,700
Terminator which is kind of neat

617
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:22,399
gotta love it but if technology enables

618
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:27,560
us to do artificial seeing an artificial

619
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:30,320
hearing and generation of human-like

620
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:34,610
data which is completely artificial of

621
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:36,560
course it can also be used for bad like

622
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,729
I said all security companies use

623
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,730
machine learning we've been using

624
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:44,450
machine learning since 2005 what we

625
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:46,520
haven't seen yet is attackers

626
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:48,740
using machine learnings or machine

627
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:52,850
learning mechanisms to do attacks yes

628
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:55,370
they are trying to poison our machine

629
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:57,050
learning systems they are attacking the

630
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:59,149
machine learning systems used by the

631
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:01,790
defenders that is absolutely happening

632
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:03,380
and has been happening for a while but

633
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:05,720
that's a different thing from actually

634
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:08,660
using machine learning to launch attacks

635
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:11,870
launching I don't know a botnet which

636
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:14,030
would learn how to avoid detection and

637
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:16,250
they would morph its operation to better

638
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:19,550
avoid detection or things like that

639
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:23,270
things which are absolutely doable but

640
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:30,169
which hasn't been done before however

641
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:32,270
there was one news piece recently about

642
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:34,070
a real-world attack which would have

643
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:37,129
been using machine learning and that was

644
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:40,460
about deep fix no yeah the effects are

645
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:43,340
not real I suppose that's that's pretty

646
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:46,550
given and when I speak about deep fakes

647
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:50,720
we probably mostly know deep fake video

648
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:53,690
where you can fake fake visuals so for

649
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,419
example in a clip done by a guy called

650
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:56,820
contra

651
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:58,889
if face we have a clip from the

652
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:01,049
legendary shining movie with the

653
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:03,748
original Jack Nicholson playing it and

654
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:09,149
then a deep fake of Jim Carrey in the

655
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:10,919
same scene it is it's weird it's the

656
00:33:09,149 --> 00:33:13,619
kind of technology that would have been

657
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:15,480
unthinkable ten years ago and today I

658
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:19,649
mean this is done by one guy in at his

659
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:22,529
home alright so what's the link to crime

660
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:25,248
well the headline we saw last year was

661
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:27,299
that fraudsters have now started using

662
00:33:25,249 --> 00:33:29,519
machine learning and deep fake

663
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:31,769
mechanisms for phishing attacks and I

664
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:36,570
know in particular business email

665
00:33:31,769 --> 00:33:39,450
compromised attacks so you get a phone

666
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:42,928
call and it's your boss and he asks you

667
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:45,149
to do things and of course you do that

668
00:33:42,929 --> 00:33:47,309
because it's your boss but then later on

669
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:50,729
you realized that it wasn't the boss it

670
00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:53,340
was a deep fake voice and this happened

671
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:56,249
last year and I'm calling on

672
00:33:53,340 --> 00:34:00,209
this I don't think this happened I don't

673
00:33:56,249 --> 00:34:00,749
think this is real is it technically

674
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:04,139
doable

675
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:06,539
yes could it be done yes did it happen

676
00:34:04,139 --> 00:34:10,918
here I don't think so I don't believe

677
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:13,619
that until we see some evidence so why

678
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:18,078
am i calling on this because

679
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:22,020
there are so many easier explanations

680
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:25,649
sure attackers good create a deep fake

681
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:28,619
generator for CEO of a company and then

682
00:34:25,649 --> 00:34:30,839
call I don't know the CFO of the company

683
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:32,760
and pretend to be him through a deep

684
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:34,790
fake generator but he's probably easier

685
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:40,790
just to get a guy who sounds like him

686
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:43,799
and even more importantly when people

687
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:46,770
fall for business email compromised

688
00:34:43,799 --> 00:34:49,168
scams they become ashamed and they

689
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:52,230
become ashamed for a reason because

690
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:54,029
whenever we read headlines about some

691
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:57,690
company falling for a business email

692
00:34:54,030 --> 00:35:00,420
compromised scam we laugh at them but

693
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:03,720
what an idiot falling for a Nigerian

694
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:05,730
scam or how stupid do you have to be to

695
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,160
wire the company's money away that's

696
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:09,840
what we say

697
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:13,950
we're blaming the victims and I hate

698
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:16,710
that I hate blaming the victims but as

699
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:19,109
long as we blame the victims for falling

700
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:22,200
to a scam which actually might not be

701
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:25,800
that simple to begin with then they the

702
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:30,930
victims will come up with excuses and

703
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:34,590
that's what I think happened here the

704
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:38,160
victims most likely made it up yep I got

705
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:39,930
a call and I'm confident he was our CEO

706
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,600
and it must have been a deep fake voice

707
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:44,669
so I didn't fall for a business email

708
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,620
scam I'm not stupid I wouldn't fall for

709
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:49,350
a scam like that this was a completely

710
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,970
new kind of an attack using machine

711
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:54,089
learning and anybody would have fallen

712
00:35:50,970 --> 00:36:00,660
for this which is a good story for the

713
00:35:54,090 --> 00:36:02,040
victim to defend themselves East is

714
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,620
going to happen in the future

715
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,600
sure as it becomes easy enough to do

716
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:08,400
within a couple of years it will but I

717
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:11,460
don't think it has happened yet I'm not

718
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,980
believing it until we see some evidence

719
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:17,250
and what this means is that we can't

720
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:20,250
always blame the user we shouldn't

721
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:23,340
always blame the user we could take all

722
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:25,770
of the attacks all of the breaches and

723
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:30,950
all of the leaks we've ever seen and

724
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:34,770
they are all either user error or a

725
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:37,740
technical error so it could be a

726
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:40,170
vulnerability in the systems programming

727
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:46,229
error or it could be the user doing

728
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:48,210
stupid stuff and as long as we blame the

729
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:50,610
users for doing stupid stuff they will

730
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:54,150
keep hiding what they did wrong they

731
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:59,370
will keep coming up with lies and that's

732
00:36:54,150 --> 00:37:02,250
not what we want either so of course the

733
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:05,220
solution is education but education is

734
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:08,310
hard education almost always fails

735
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:10,620
people never learn anything and pay

736
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:12,570
attention I'm doing education right now

737
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:18,799
as I'm telling you that education never

738
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:22,080
works so what works well examples work

739
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,610
one of the reasons examples

740
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:27,020
I've seen which I think works really

741
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:31,670
well is this new site new service called

742
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:34,050
skit this is the way you can educate

743
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:36,720
developers and coders who use services

744
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:40,260
like github and explain to them why it's

745
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:43,890
problematic when you use you know

746
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:47,040
Exchange API keys with your colleagues

747
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:49,319
by pasting them for just a second into

748
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:54,150
github because this service which is

749
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:56,990
called skip is online right now watching

750
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:59,520
everything committee to all get services

751
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:02,509
including get lap and github and

752
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:06,780
whenever someone posts an API key or

753
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:10,200
Google authentication key or SSL private

754
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:12,360
keys or passwords or you know a string

755
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,220
with a lot of random characters so it

756
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:18,450
could be a password it just posts it

757
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:20,129
online for everybody to see and the way

758
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:22,529
you can use this to educate your

759
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:25,170
developers is just to show it to them

760
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:28,050
that's all they need to do they see it

761
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:29,970
oh holy hell there's the service which

762
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:33,330
does this automatically and if I just

763
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:34,680
paste an API key there for a second it's

764
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:37,259
gonna be there for the whole world to

765
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:39,060
see maybe I shouldn't do that yes you

766
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:46,100
shouldn't do that and this is a great

767
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:46,100
way to educate it but education is hard

768
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:52,140
it's hard but it's not as hard as trying

769
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:53,959
to defend against the technical

770
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:56,490
vulnerabilities because in the end

771
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:59,910
technical vulnerabilities are just bugs

772
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:02,399
in the code programming errors that's

773
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:05,040
what they are that's all they are and

774
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,100
we've always had bugs we always will

775
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,259
have bugs in our code well we will have

776
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:12,720
them as long as our programs are written

777
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:15,240
by human beings and of course eventually

778
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,970
they will not be written by human beings

779
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,939
but for the foreseeable future they will

780
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:23,700
be and there will be bugs

781
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:26,910
that's why patching we keep talking

782
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:29,220
about patching and maintenance and

783
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:33,710
update and all that and then we wonder

784
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:35,410
why it fails let me give you an example

785
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:39,039
last year

786
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:41,470
several Finnish cities were hit with

787
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:46,480
large bridges including ransomware

788
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:48,700
breaches and large outages our incident

789
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,490
response teams were working with many of

790
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:54,910
those cities as it was happening one of

791
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:58,439
these cities was breached through their

792
00:39:54,910 --> 00:40:01,180
Windows RDP server they had three

793
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:04,390
windows already be servers in the public

794
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:07,629
internet for remote work purposes set by

795
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:11,190
the IT team and the IT team perfectly

796
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:14,859
well understood the risks involved with

797
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:17,559
public facing RDP servers so they had

798
00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:19,720
all kinds of authentication enable to

799
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:21,640
make sure nobody could use credentials

800
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:24,069
to gain access to them and then they had

801
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,890
set up specific rules so these three

802
00:40:24,069 --> 00:40:28,299
servers had automatic updates enabled

803
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:30,400
unlike the rest of the network

804
00:40:28,299 --> 00:40:32,920
this basically meant at any time

805
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:37,030
Microsoft pushed out any update these

806
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:39,400
servers would get it straight away yet

807
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:42,839
they were breached through one of these

808
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:46,029
servers why because it was out of date

809
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:47,230
how can it be out of date these machines

810
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:49,059
are on the internet they have

811
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:52,329
connectivity they have automatic updates

812
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:55,109
enabled in fact it turns out that the

813
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:58,000
problematic server had tried downloading

814
00:40:55,109 --> 00:41:03,098
critical updates for the RDP server

815
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:06,880
itself 200 tons and it had failed 200

816
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:11,200
times why did it fail well it failed

817
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:13,029
because the hard drive is full the hard

818
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,799
drive is full it's right downloading the

819
00:41:13,029 --> 00:41:16,029
pay was a big patch it couldn't fit in

820
00:41:14,799 --> 00:41:18,690
on the hard drive partition and it

821
00:41:16,029 --> 00:41:22,809
failed and he tried again 200 times

822
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:26,319
after 200 times they got owned and their

823
00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:29,020
network got owned so how come the IT

824
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:31,480
admins didn't realize that the hard

825
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:33,609
drive is full well this server was part

826
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:38,650
of the educational network of the city

827
00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:40,808
which had 18,000 endpoints 18,000

828
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:44,160
machines creating log entries for things

829
00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:44,160
like hard drive for

830
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,819
and when you think about it from that

831
00:41:48,109 --> 00:41:51,920
point of view is it becomes pretty

832
00:41:49,819 --> 00:41:54,259
understandable why this happened

833
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,510
sure they were trying to do their best

834
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:58,760
they were trying to secure their

835
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:00,470
machines they were trying to update

836
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,720
everything they were trying to go

837
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:03,799
through the logs and fix every machine

838
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,598
which was running out of hard drive

839
00:42:03,799 --> 00:42:07,599
space they just run out of time

840
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:15,759
but there's always a story behind the

841
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:19,220
failures that happen when security fails

842
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:22,099
and it always looks bad when security

843
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:27,549
fails but when security doesn't fail

844
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:31,490
when security works that nothing happens

845
00:42:27,549 --> 00:42:35,480
this is the dilemma for work if we do

846
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:37,819
our work perfectly if we do our job 100%

847
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:44,380
right then the end result is that

848
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:47,299
nothing happens there will not be a

849
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:51,290
headline in the biggest newspaper in

850
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:53,359
Helsinki tomorrow saying that the second

851
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:57,369
largest company in Finland was not

852
00:42:53,359 --> 00:43:00,859
hacked yesterday like that's not news if

853
00:42:57,369 --> 00:43:02,690
it is hacked then you can guarantee it

854
00:43:00,859 --> 00:43:05,720
will be on the front page but if we

855
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:09,020
succeed it's going to be invisible I've

856
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:11,899
used the term security Tetris because we

857
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:15,619
all know the game of tetris where all of

858
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:17,650
your successes disappear and then when

859
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:21,470
you screw up the screw-ups pile up

860
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:25,099
that's what we're doing and rarely is

861
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:29,509
anyone thanked for stopping the disaster

862
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:33,160
that didn't happen rarely is anyone

863
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:39,430
thanked for stopping the disaster that

864
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:43,339
did not happen so I want to thank you

865
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:47,690
for your work I want to thank you for

866
00:43:43,339 --> 00:43:53,119
doing your part in stopping the

867
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:56,319
disasters before they happen thank you

868
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,319
very much thank you for your work

869
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:13,379
thank you let me put a plug in for a

870
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,510
thing we're doing later today with Tommy

871
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:18,030
to hominin we will have a session at the

872
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:21,150
f-secure booth on the second floor at 8

873
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:24,150
p.m. today in finish Gusev Aerosmith

874
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:25,800
Hawk crater where we go through an AMA

875
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:28,650
if you want to ask me and tell me

876
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:30,360
anything please join us at 8 p.m. and if

877
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:35,070
you want to ask me something right now

878
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:36,330
the floor is open questions please put

879
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:38,100
your hand up and we have a question

880
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:43,290
right here at the front row please wait

881
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:45,839
for the microphone coming right here do

882
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:49,259
you have any Internet asbestos warning

883
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:53,580
stickers indeed I've lately been

884
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:57,840
speaking about IT asbestos ideas best

885
00:44:53,580 --> 00:45:00,779
assist a metaphor for what we're doing

886
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:04,320
right now with IOT because asbestos the

887
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:08,150
material was such a great innovation is

888
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:08,150
this asbestos

889
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:17,030
thank you have a punch court

890
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:25,180
[Applause]

891
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:27,220
yeah it's not asbestos it's us best

892
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:30,040
stickers so I think it's a fair fair

893
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:32,350
deal so the thing about IT asbestos is

894
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:34,570
that asbestos really seemed like a great

895
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:36,549
idea when it was innovated so we put it

896
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:38,830
everywhere into every building and then

897
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:39,400
we realized two decades later is a bad

898
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:41,380
idea

899
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:44,050
which is what we're doing right now by

900
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:48,490
putting IOT into everything so it is the

901
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:50,710
IT asbestos and our kids will curse us

902
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:57,549
for implementing this what well right

903
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:59,110
now questions put your hands up there in

904
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:00,490
the back thank you please wait for the

905
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:02,700
microphone there's so many people in

906
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:02,700
here

907
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:13,720
hi so regarding the pre-crime you showed

908
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:16,180
earlier and I kind of think that you

909
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:18,490
missed a point in the has been done for

910
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:21,029
many years in a sense of correlating

911
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:24,339
where crime happens and how to improve

912
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:28,030
action on it but the dangerous part is

913
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:30,670
kind of when law trusts these algorithms

914
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:34,150
to enforce something before it happens

915
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:37,240
so kind of how can we who know the

916
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:39,760
technology not that law cross the

917
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:42,279
boundary to go to that kind of a point

918
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,130
where they trust algorithms more than

919
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:47,920
evidence and previous normal social

920
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:51,640
behavior basically you are now under

921
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:53,620
arrest for a future murder you do have a

922
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:55,870
great point though we when we build

923
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:58,420
machine learning they are as good as the

924
00:46:55,870 --> 00:47:00,720
data we give them and in these cases we

925
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:03,850
typically give them data with biases

926
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:06,189
biases created by humans like you know

927
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:08,140
we think that those people create more

928
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:09,940
crimes than those people because they

929
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:11,920
look different or live in the wrong

930
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:14,380
place and then of course the algorithms

931
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:17,860
learned that this is potentially very

932
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:20,290
very problematic but I'm sure there's

933
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:22,840
plenty of research being done in this

934
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:25,210
space but it does really remind me of

935
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:30,250
the science fiction movies based on

936
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:31,780
stories from 1956 more questions thank

937
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:33,239
you for the great talk

938
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:36,849
I would

939
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:41,859
how will the IT security landscape look

940
00:47:36,849 --> 00:47:44,439
like five years in your opinion well in

941
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:48,339
five years it's such a short time that

942
00:47:44,439 --> 00:47:51,129
the changes won't be that big I already

943
00:47:48,339 --> 00:47:53,529
made the call about machine learning in

944
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:55,689
the hands of criminals being you know in

945
00:47:53,529 --> 00:47:58,509
the near future so maybe that's that's a

946
00:47:55,689 --> 00:48:01,479
good forecast to make that in five years

947
00:47:58,509 --> 00:48:03,789
we have crossed the threshold where we

948
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:06,098
are starting to see attacks which are

949
00:48:03,789 --> 00:48:08,739
using machine learning machine learning

950
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:11,799
still requires a bit of expertise within

951
00:48:08,739 --> 00:48:14,709
couple of years the barriers of entry

952
00:48:11,799 --> 00:48:16,449
are becoming so low that any idiot will

953
00:48:14,709 --> 00:48:18,609
be able to do machine learning and then

954
00:48:16,449 --> 00:48:20,799
any idiot will be doing machine learning

955
00:48:18,609 --> 00:48:23,828
and we will start seeing malware and

956
00:48:20,799 --> 00:48:26,288
other attacks using machine learning so

957
00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:32,319
that's my forecast and we'll take one

958
00:48:26,289 --> 00:48:36,180
more question before we break one more

959
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:36,180
question right there thank you very much

960
00:48:36,209 --> 00:48:42,578
would you say that maybe rather than any

961
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:46,209
idiot doing the machine learning there

962
00:48:42,579 --> 00:48:49,779
will be stuff sold at the darknet mark

963
00:48:46,209 --> 00:48:52,598
place for the less idiotic people to be

964
00:48:49,779 --> 00:48:55,959
with people and then all hell will break

965
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:58,989
loose I hate the way you think you're

966
00:48:55,959 --> 00:49:01,149
under arrest for a future murder yes

967
00:48:58,989 --> 00:49:02,410
you're absolutely right that's exactly

968
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:06,130
what's going to happen and that's one of

969
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:07,420
the problems we have and with that have

970
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:11,780
a great disobey thank you very much

971
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:11,780
[Applause]
