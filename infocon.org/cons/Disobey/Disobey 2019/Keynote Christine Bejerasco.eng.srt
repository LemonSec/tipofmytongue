2
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:33,680
whoot smoky in here good afternoon

3
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,880
maybe in a few minutes I can see you

4
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:42,450
good afternoon

5
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:43,410
hackers geeks friends and everyone with

6
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,590
an interest in the world of

7
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:50,839
cybersecurity it's it's an honor to be

8
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:54,290
here so one of the very first

9
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:59,630
conferences of the year and it's called

10
00:00:54,290 --> 00:01:03,720
disobey now in some cultures like mine

11
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:05,400
there's a belief that whatever you may

12
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,950
be doing the first few things that you

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,460
do at the beginning of the year will

14
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:15,030
define what you will be mostly doing for

15
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:18,289
the rest of the year who among you here

16
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,649
has disobey as their first conference

17
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:24,060
Wow

18
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:26,270
me too with this much people having

19
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,350
disobedience as their theme

20
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:34,350
don't you like where this year is

21
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:37,889
heading already for those who don't know

22
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:41,970
me my background in cyber security is in

23
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:45,890
cyber defense so I joined the antivirus

24
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:49,140
industry in 2003 because I thought that

25
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:54,330
fighting against malware was cool and

26
00:01:49,140 --> 00:02:00,360
heroic and I wasn't wrong so back then

27
00:01:54,330 --> 00:02:06,330
like spider-man I was young broke but a

28
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:09,600
superhero it's fun gig and I was working

29
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:12,630
as a malware analyst reversing compiled

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,030
portable executable codes typically for

31
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,670
the Windows operating system and was

32
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,769
doing that for several years until the

33
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:23,369
amount of malware vastly increased and

34
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:25,739
so did the need to automate so I had a

35
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,920
stint shortly as a developer of Hana

36
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:32,940
client systems as well and then 11 years

37
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:38,160
ago I joined f-secure where I became a

38
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:39,209
malware analyst once again so how long

39
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,980
is that

40
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:50,819
sixteen years so sixteen years in this

41
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:53,969
industry sixteen years I must have

42
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:59,099
learned something right I mean I hope I

43
00:02:53,969 --> 00:03:02,969
did so beyond the highs of reversing and

44
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:06,450
STP Packer that refuses to be reversed

45
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:08,519
and you ace it or finding and

46
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,530
never-before-seen malware in your

47
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,139
honeypot when you get to the office in

48
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:16,169
the morning what have I really

49
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:18,120
accomplished these were the thoughts

50
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:19,980
that I was thinking to myself while I

51
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,669
was invited here and thinking what

52
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,988
should I tell these people and that I

53
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:28,049
began to realize that these are

54
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:33,930
questions that people who are having a

55
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:35,519
midlife crisis ask themselves and you

56
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:41,040
don't want me to have a midlife crisis

57
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,079
on stage right so I I started thinking

58
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,569
bigger

59
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:49,650
what have we in the cyber security

60
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:53,488
community accomplished in our defiance

61
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:55,680
in our disobedience in pushing back

62
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:59,669
against organizations that were

63
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:07,500
seemingly and willing to change have we

64
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:11,599
really made a dent in our community we

65
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:14,729
focus on issues a lot there's a bug here

66
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,570
there's a vulnerability there and look

67
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:19,370
there's no malware exploiting this bug I

68
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,750
knew it

69
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:24,919
I've been talking about this bug for

70
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:28,320
years and nobody was listening to me

71
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:35,039
these sentiments they're not uncommon in

72
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:39,840
Twitter and they do have a point but

73
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:43,110
sometimes sometimes maybe we just failed

74
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,599
to see that some of the message that we

75
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:49,919
have been saying has already come across

76
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:53,870
and we have already managed to raise the

77
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,870
bar of digital security

78
00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:00,330
now throughout our careers here we will

79
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:04,729
be meeting different personas some of

80
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:06,900
them will be faceless and nameless and

81
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:10,100
some of them they could be your

82
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:14,270
colleagues or the people beside you and

83
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:16,800
some of them may be you

84
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:19,260
for instance many among you here are

85
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,140
probably white hats performing

86
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:24,000
penetration testing in organizations

87
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,349
recommending solutions or trying to do

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,720
vulnerability testing against

89
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:29,310
applications and reporting those to

90
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,550
organizations who can do something about

91
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:35,070
it or some of you like me could be

92
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:38,160
defenders building endpoint protection

93
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:42,050
systems building VPN software encryption

94
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:47,010
software IT security perhaps or sock

95
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:48,450
cert these are the people who try to

96
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:52,380
create defenses to protect an

97
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:55,670
organization against an attack and there

98
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:58,650
are those who we often work with

99
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:01,230
platform owners who build the operating

100
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:04,289
systems who build the banking systems

101
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:07,470
the different platforms where users

102
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,360
interact with and one thing that they

103
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:14,120
have in common is that the onda code

104
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:18,600
where we find these vulnerabilities and

105
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:22,050
for some it's the government what can I

106
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,730
say about the government well like a

107
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,670
platform owners we do have a love/hate

108
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:28,620
relationship with the government and

109
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:30,570
more and more recently we are working

110
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:32,760
closely with them but there are also

111
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:36,240
times that you know we have kind of

112
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:40,020
friction with the government and then

113
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:43,160
lastly cyber criminals so this can range

114
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:46,200
from misguided people to all-out

115
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,980
underground crime syndicates and the one

116
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,810
thing that they have in common is that

117
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:54,690
they only really think of themselves

118
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:58,890
they don't care if their actions makes

119
00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:02,969
victims out of people and these

120
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:05,710
different personas they help elevate the

121
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:09,940
bar of digital security

122
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:11,919
and today as is customary during

123
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:15,550
beginnings of the year let's take a trip

124
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,710
back in time and see how these different

125
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:21,160
personas have helped elevate the game

126
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:28,870
and how we have managed to raise the bar

127
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:32,740
of digital security first up these

128
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:37,030
closures very flammable topic in the

129
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:41,229
cybersecurity community well before the

130
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:42,940
bug trap mailing list was created vollar

131
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:45,130
abilities were passed around between a

132
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,910
close group of hackers security

133
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,780
researchers software engineers and

134
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:52,169
whatever they did with these

135
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:54,340
vulnerabilities we we don't really know

136
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:56,859
because during this time they were not

137
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:59,500
sharing this information they just keep

138
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:04,120
that among their circle this was the

139
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:08,440
time of non-disclosure and since there

140
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:10,510
was no no publicity there was no in the

141
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,750
problem is that really visible problem

142
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:15,820
was hidden and during these time

143
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:19,900
platform owners didn't have any

144
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:23,710
incentive to fix the problem because it

145
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:26,739
felt like it wasn't really up there for

146
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:28,680
the cyber criminals this was beneficial

147
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:33,789
because they could use these exploits

148
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:36,370
for personal gain but for the white hats

149
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:38,740
who wanted to elevate the state of our

150
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:41,440
digital security this was very

151
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:45,190
frustrating because however they tried

152
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:49,240
screaming that there was a problem well

153
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:52,450
virtually nobody was listening and so

154
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:55,510
this frustration led to the birth of

155
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:57,640
discussions on how we can involve more

156
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:59,640
people who can actually do something

157
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,640
about it how we can involve

158
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:06,250
administrators perhaps and from these

159
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:09,550
discussions the pendulum swung to the

160
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:15,820
other end of the spectrum and gave birth

161
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:19,150
to the full disclosure movement so full

162
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,699
disclosure Vockrodt mailing list so bug

163
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:24,259
tracker

164
00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:26,738
created in 1993 and it was the poster

165
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:28,819
child of the full disclosure movement

166
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:31,239
bug track at that time it contained

167
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:34,248
everything vulnerability related from

168
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:36,019
how to exploit the vulnerability new

169
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:39,169
tools written to exploit this

170
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:41,569
vulnerability mitigations against this

171
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:45,079
vulnerability suddenly all of this

172
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:47,229
information was now available to a wider

173
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:47,229
audience

174
00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:55,249
both the administrator and a script

175
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:57,769
kiddie now had access to the same

176
00:09:55,249 --> 00:10:04,639
information that they can use either to

177
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:06,230
defend or to initiate an attack now to

178
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:09,319
say that the full disclosure movement

179
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:12,259
cost headaches to the platform owners

180
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:14,479
was an understatement because at this

181
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:18,199
time there were patches that have been

182
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:22,369
released for months even years that have

183
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:23,719
not yet been applied and having an

184
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:26,269
exploit for some of these

185
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,259
vulnerabilities was like having a loaded

186
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:33,859
gun out in the public for anyone to use

187
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:36,679
and during this time the malware

188
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:39,100
landscape shifted so malware slowly

189
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:42,858
stopped being filin factors and

190
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,959
propagating via removable drives to

191
00:10:42,859 --> 00:10:49,249
network worms and automatically

192
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:52,638
propagating via the network and it

193
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:55,609
didn't help that during this time more

194
00:10:52,639 --> 00:11:02,179
and more people were staying online much

195
00:10:55,609 --> 00:11:06,679
longer Code Red was one of these early

196
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:10,569
2000 worms and it was a fireless was an

197
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:13,369
automatically network spreading worm and

198
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:16,789
it caused headaches to the cyber defense

199
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:19,100
industry at that time we didn't really

200
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:22,999
have a lot of memory or network scanners

201
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:24,679
we had file-based scanners so we had to

202
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:27,709
elevate our security in the sense that

203
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:31,629
we now had to introduce protections both

204
00:11:27,709 --> 00:11:31,628
for the memory and for the network

205
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:39,790
in Scott cop's essay in 2001 he

206
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:43,150
mentioned that malware such as Code Red

207
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:46,569
alright Lee attributed to criminals and

208
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:49,760
yes they should be called criminals but

209
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:53,690
they needed help to devastate our

210
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:57,880
systems and we in the cyber security

211
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,880
community gave it to them

212
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:03,710
Scott Culp was the manager of the

213
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:06,230
Microsoft security and response center

214
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:08,420
so this is the division of Microsoft is

215
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:11,570
handling vulnerabilities to their

216
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:17,329
products and they have felt the brunt of

217
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:19,070
the attack now on the flipside full

218
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:23,120
disclosure movement also said that

219
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:26,330
because there is now a sense of urgency

220
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,480
that administrators need to patch these

221
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:31,160
vulnerabilities they should be

222
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,590
immediately going out there and patching

223
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:38,709
them so the movement will help with that

224
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:42,350
and while both sides do have good points

225
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:45,530
both sides are also painfully aware that

226
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:47,870
in the wrong hands exploits to these

227
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:56,959
vulnerabilities have very costly

228
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:59,990
consequences however pain the full

229
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,420
disclosure movement cost it was

230
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:06,470
necessary to give birth to a middle

231
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:10,459
ground which we call many names but I'll

232
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:13,060
call it responsible disclosure so after

233
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:16,550
Scott cop's essay was published

234
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:18,260
Microsoft and a few other vendors they

235
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,650
met together and formed the responsible

236
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:25,040
disclosure forum where they now tried to

237
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:27,680
define guidelines on how white hats and

238
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,530
platform owners would approach this in a

239
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,939
more coordinated manner and nowadays it

240
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,680
has evolved to like different

241
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:37,690
incarnations for coordinated

242
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:41,270
vulnerability disclosure processes and

243
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:43,070
during this time what was interesting as

244
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:45,829
well is that the market for

245
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:48,950
vulnerabilities has evolved

246
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:51,380
and there are organizations such as the

247
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,890
zero day initiative that came into the

248
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,070
picture

249
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:59,090
to capitalize on this market and for

250
00:13:55,070 --> 00:14:01,280
white hats who wanted to earn on the

251
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:03,500
research there was suddenly a platform

252
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:07,760
available for this for example if you've

253
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:09,080
reported a novel exploit with zei they

254
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,360
would then do responsible disclosure

255
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:15,910
with the platform owners where this is

256
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:18,860
targeted for so it provided an avenue

257
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,990
where some of those white hats who were

258
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,790
actually feeling that they don't want to

259
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,740
report this thing straight to the

260
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:27,349
platform owners because it feels like

261
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:33,280
extortion there was no middle ground for

262
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:35,900
them to do it but today bug bounties

263
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,959
they are increasingly becoming common

264
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:42,170
and now there is already a sense of

265
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:46,990
pride associated with reporting and

266
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:46,990
novel vulnerability to a platform owner

267
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:56,960
Microsoft has shown the report that they

268
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:59,180
have for the past decade where the

269
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,820
amount of vulnerabilities that have

270
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:05,719
actually been reported to them has

271
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:07,310
significantly increased but the amount

272
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,370
of vulnerabilities that have been

273
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:16,670
exploited in the wild has been

274
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:19,670
decreasing and another points for bug

275
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:22,000
bounties is that this year European

276
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:25,400
Union has announced that they will

277
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,520
support bounties for free and open

278
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:34,030
source software which is actually quite

279
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:34,030
great now what's what's happening here

280
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:40,130
we have now removed the false sense of

281
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:44,900
security that people have been feeling

282
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:48,100
in the past we have now reached an

283
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:51,290
understanding with the platform owners

284
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:53,690
we have raised the bar towards a more

285
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:57,410
responsible software development process

286
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:59,900
and we have helped make bug bounties

287
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:02,990
commonplace while lesson

288
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:08,319
the exposure of these dangerous exploits

289
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:10,700
to cyber criminals these things are

290
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:18,740
something that you can feel very good

291
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:23,779
about so blast from the past

292
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:26,710
Code Red Sasser blaster slammer what do

293
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:26,710
these malware have in common

294
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:32,680
anyone so that I don't feel like a

295
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:37,600
dinosaur come on sorry

296
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:41,120
yes correct these are worms indeed

297
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:44,960
people who are a bit shy okay I'll just

298
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:49,250
continue so these are worms definitely

299
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:53,540
from early 2000s collectively they cost

300
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:56,029
billions of dollars of damages and well

301
00:16:53,540 --> 00:17:00,949
they were networked propagating on their

302
00:16:56,029 --> 00:17:06,740
own and they use buffer overflows to do

303
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:10,220
it now 2003 that was a exciting time for

304
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,750
me to start my career in the antivirus

305
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:15,890
industry because there was one outbreak

306
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:19,520
after another and I remember a time when

307
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:22,390
I was in the Philippines in the 14th

308
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:27,530
floor of a building we had a case and

309
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:30,650
there was an earthquake so building was

310
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:33,260
shaking I looked around to my colleagues

311
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:35,510
who were also looking around and then we

312
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:39,290
looked at the ceiling and then went back

313
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:41,360
to our computers nobody went down and

314
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,879
thinking thinking about that now it

315
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,909
sounds a little bit silly right but I I

316
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,429
guess I guess our sense of danger then

317
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:51,230
was a little bit warped because malware

318
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:53,929
dust was spreading to tens of thousands

319
00:17:51,230 --> 00:18:00,800
of computers seemed more dangerous than

320
00:17:53,929 --> 00:18:02,450
some tremor so we stayed there but I am

321
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:07,610
really glad that that building was well

322
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:10,610
built but what was why were these

323
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:13,399
malware so effective then why were they

324
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:17,330
heavily using buffer overflows

325
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:19,970
during this time the operating system

326
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:23,260
had virtually no protection for the

327
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:26,330
stack or the heap you can push your code

328
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:29,270
point your execution pointer there and

329
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:33,649
then you can have you can have your code

330
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:36,050
getting executed in the stack so with

331
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:38,230
this type of operating system at that

332
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:44,300
time all of memory was virtually

333
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:46,430
executable space and of course at this

334
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:49,850
time there were worms that came along

335
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:53,090
such as blaster blaster was challenging

336
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:55,250
Microsoft there are why was Microsoft

337
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:58,730
helping making it possible for them to

338
00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:00,290
do it and on the flip side Microsoft was

339
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:02,510
trying to release one patch after

340
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:04,850
another for this buffer overflow

341
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:07,300
vulnerabilities and although their

342
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:10,040
actions were heroic

343
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:15,790
it didn't really address the core of the

344
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:15,790
problem because the design was flawed

345
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:21,740
but little did we know that apparently

346
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:27,560
behind the scenes something was already

347
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:31,580
cooking and in 2004 AMD and Intel

348
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:33,350
announced the no execute bit where this

349
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:36,379
time you can have both the hardware and

350
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:38,570
the operating system cooperate in order

351
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:45,020
to protect certain regions of memory and

352
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:46,490
render them not executable and Windows

353
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:49,370
of course who was the recipient of a

354
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:53,990
bunch of this malware introduced the

355
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:58,040
data execution prevention but other

356
00:19:53,990 --> 00:20:00,710
operating systems they also introduced

357
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:05,240
this kind of protections as well so Mac

358
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:09,220
has the double user X protection and for

359
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:11,960
Android it has an unexcused tag and heap

360
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:15,440
but since Windows was the malware

361
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:18,440
favorite because of its prevalence then

362
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,540
in the next blackhat conferences there

363
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,330
were no presentations of how do you

364
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:25,940
bypass the NX bit and of course they

365
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:27,260
bypassed the NX bit and then eventually

366
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,820
Microsoft had to

367
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:34,010
introduce address space layout

368
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:37,189
randomization safe as eh and in 2013

369
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:40,730
they introduced them mitigation bypass

370
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:42,290
and bounty for defense terms where all

371
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,300
of these different functionalities in

372
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:47,420
the operating system which is used

373
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:50,060
purely for defense you find a bug

374
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:59,240
vulnerability on them you can report it

375
00:20:50,060 --> 00:21:01,879
against that bounty program today worms

376
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:06,680
that are able to propagate on the same

377
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:14,560
level as those of the early 2000s is a

378
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:19,970
rare occurrence but are they gone in

379
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:22,700
2017 one a cry came and one a cry was

380
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:25,340
able to bypass the NX bit all of these

381
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,920
other protections and propagate on the

382
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:34,000
network on the same magnitude as this

383
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:37,540
early 2000 worms now why did this happen

384
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:42,040
well one a cry was using an exploit that

385
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:45,530
was designed by a government agency and

386
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:49,399
this exploit enabled them to perform

387
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:53,450
that level of propagation so if you can

388
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:56,690
see in the early 2000s almost anybody

389
00:21:53,450 --> 00:22:02,240
with access with interest could create

390
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:05,420
this kind of exploits and today it takes

391
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:12,620
a government agency to perform that

392
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:16,310
level of propagation the bar for

393
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:19,060
successfully using this network buffer

394
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:22,750
overflows for propagating your worms is

395
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,750
now much higher

396
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:32,500
but what else do we have then

397
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:37,580
aside from an unprotected memory space

398
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:40,670
what else is there how about an

399
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:43,090
unprotected kernel where you have

400
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:45,020
drivers that can affect each other and

401
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:52,750
drivers that can affect the kernel

402
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:55,820
itself in the late 1990s to early 2000s

403
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:59,150
malware rootkits came into the picture

404
00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:02,899
and although these are not as prevalent

405
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:04,030
as your typical user mode malware they

406
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,400
were still causing some headaches

407
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,870
because they were slightly different for

408
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,160
example there was a rootkit called

409
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:17,899
hacker defender I was able to hide files

410
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:19,660
registry entries processes because who

411
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,980
wouldn't be seduced by the idea of

412
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:25,430
hiding your malware from the operating

413
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:27,830
system for example if you hid behind a

414
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:29,900
file system driver you can tell the

415
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:33,020
operating system that you don't exist

416
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:35,480
you can tell other processes including

417
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:42,820
your antivirus software that you don't

418
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:45,350
exist and of course in a cyber defense

419
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:47,120
it became apparent that we needed to

420
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:50,199
evolve our protections in order to

421
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,870
defend against this type of threat and

422
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,760
so there were solutions such as

423
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:59,300
sysinternals rootkit revealer or eff

424
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,610
secures blacklight that was released

425
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:11,570
during that time to address this problem

426
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:14,209
in 2005 Sony BMG released series that

427
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:19,550
had digital copyright protection on them

428
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:22,100
called extended copy protection and what

429
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:24,680
this series had was that they had well

430
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,899
we had a music of course they had a

431
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:29,030
music player and then when you were

432
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:32,150
playing it silently installed a rootkit

433
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:34,940
into your system and what this rootkit

434
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:37,220
did was that it limited what the users

435
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:40,059
can do with their CDs including of

436
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:42,350
course copying the music out

437
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:46,158
but what's really nasty with this

438
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:49,428
rootkit is that if you are building

439
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:53,869
files of a certain file format this

440
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:56,840
rootkit will hide that as well and when

441
00:24:53,869 --> 00:25:00,139
cyber criminals learned about this guess

442
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:06,980
what they did they built malware that

443
00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:09,350
hid behind the Sony BMG rootkit and of

444
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,119
course this caused a public outcry that

445
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:14,480
cost the US government to file a lawsuit

446
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:19,119
against Sony BMG and they had to suspend

447
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,119
their copy protection two years later

448
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:25,609
but during this time as well

449
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:28,549
Windows has introduced the kernel patch

450
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:30,649
protection or Windows patch guard and

451
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:34,749
this was the beginning of the operating

452
00:25:30,649 --> 00:25:34,748
system trying to address this threat

453
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:42,879
starting Windows 10 red stone 1 you can

454
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:46,369
no longer install kernel mode drivers

455
00:25:42,879 --> 00:25:48,559
that have not been validated and have

456
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:52,309
been approved in a Microsoft Hardware

457
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:54,350
Center dev portal which means that as a

458
00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:56,330
vendor as a publisher of this driver you

459
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:58,939
need to be vetted by the Microsoft

460
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:00,739
hardware dead center and then you also

461
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:04,429
need to have an extended validation code

462
00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:06,350
signing certificate so there's now the

463
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:08,590
validation coming from the publisher and

464
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:11,928
the validation coming from Microsoft to

465
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:17,330
verify if a kernel mode driver can

466
00:26:11,929 --> 00:26:19,159
really run in the OS and a bit more

467
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:21,489
recently Microsoft also introduced the

468
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:25,700
early load anti-malware functionality

469
00:26:21,489 --> 00:26:27,769
where if you're a security vendor your

470
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:30,379
driver could load before other

471
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:32,330
third-party drivers thereby giving you

472
00:26:30,379 --> 00:26:37,580
the opportunity to scan these other

473
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:40,850
drivers before they load and be on

474
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:45,168
Windows Mac has also introduced the

475
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:47,209
concept of notarization where your

476
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:49,519
kernel extensions can now be notarized

477
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:53,019
so that your users can have a seamless

478
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,019
experience with a gatekeeper

479
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:58,490
but mobile platforms there an even

480
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:01,880
better success story because they

481
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:06,230
managed to design security at the

482
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:08,420
beginning by default I mean they have

483
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:10,490
applications and boxes where by default

484
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:12,950
the apps won't be able to affect each

485
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:17,140
other and they have limited actress

486
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:17,140
access to the operating system as well

487
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:27,350
the learnings have gone beyond the

488
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:29,600
desktop operating systems now we are

489
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:35,449
able to design operating systems with

490
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:38,120
security in mind so the bar for

491
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:41,140
subverting the kernel is much higher

492
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,139
than before

493
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:55,540
there was also a time when encrypted

494
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:57,910
traffic was an anomaly if you had a

495
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:00,310
Facebook account or and then you logged

496
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:02,620
in to and through a network and then you

497
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:04,330
also have let's say instant messenger

498
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:08,770
chats with your friends that's what we

499
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:11,590
called it then instant messaging all

500
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:15,850
your traffic is clear text over the

501
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:17,080
network now you would have thought that

502
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:21,219
I'm talking about something that

503
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:25,860
happened decades ago but this was less

504
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:25,860
than 10 years ago less than 10 years ago

505
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:30,550
we're all somebody has to do if they

506
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:33,520
want to grab your Facebook credentials

507
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:36,040
for instance is on this be on the same

508
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:40,900
network with you and have some random

509
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:44,530
sniffer and it wasn't hard to be in a

510
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:46,600
network with a stranger because coffee

511
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:52,290
shops at that time we're starting to

512
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:55,540
offer free Wi-Fi so the threat of

513
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:59,080
session hijacking is very real and there

514
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:01,510
were tools such as fire ship that came

515
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:07,199
into the picture and helped attackers

516
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:07,200
acquire session cookies and assume them

517
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:19,090
banks as a group they were the very

518
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:20,710
first to use HTTPS and and rightfully so

519
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,600
because they're their users have the

520
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:26,530
most to lose

521
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:29,469
in case of these types of attacks but it

522
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:32,410
didn't end there because websites that

523
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:36,130
had were processing credentials followed

524
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:41,770
suit and Facebook in 2011 announced that

525
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:44,800
they were using HTTPS but it didn't end

526
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:47,740
there because nowadays even websites

527
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:51,760
that don't process credentials they're

528
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:54,880
using HTTPS as well they have now

529
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:57,460
understood somehow that if you're

530
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,490
reading some news or searching something

531
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:01,650
why are your search engines

532
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:04,559
and somebody on the same network knows

533
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:10,020
what you're doing that's already a

534
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:11,820
privacy breach and there are browsers

535
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:14,129
nowadays that are supporting this move

536
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:17,580
for example chrome if you visit a web

537
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:22,640
site in Chrome that is an HTTP web site

538
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:25,340
it will call the web site not secure and

539
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,330
this attaches a stigma to the web site

540
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:30,449
hoping that they would encrypt their

541
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:33,300
traffic and probably it's working

542
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:36,750
because Google shared their numbers

543
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:38,550
regarding the amount of HTTP traffic in

544
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:41,790
different Chrome browsers in different

545
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:45,629
operating systems and as of a few days

546
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:50,670
ago the lowest one is in Linux and even

547
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:57,300
that is 70% in HTTPS this is quite

548
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:59,280
admirable less than 10 years and of

549
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:03,570
course while do we don't want to

550
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:07,260
diminish this accomplishment there is

551
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:10,678
one part of our traffic that is still at

552
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:15,360
the very core unencrypted and this is

553
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:16,920
DNS resolution and even with new

554
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,280
versions of operating systems such as

555
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:24,090
Android by where it already has private

556
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:27,420
DNS the server name identification part

557
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:28,590
is still in clear-text so whoever is in

558
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,510
the same network with you

559
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:34,830
will at least know which domains your

560
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:38,370
going to and this is why solutions like

561
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:44,000
VPN are still very useful in order to

562
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:47,489
give you a full cloak of confidentiality

563
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,059
so this should be VPN with DNS leak

564
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:52,770
protection and then of course it has

565
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:54,360
been advised over and over again that if

566
00:31:52,770 --> 00:32:00,000
you have more secure communication use

567
00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:03,600
PGP although although we haven't yet

568
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,720
reached a time when all of our traffic

569
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:11,629
is really protected all of it is

570
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:14,390
encrypted we hope we hope that one day

571
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:18,140
the parties that we'll be able to view

572
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:24,380
our traffic are only those for whom it's

573
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:27,530
intended for at least we hope because

574
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:29,530
one of the most powerful players one of

575
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:33,470
the most powerful personas in this game

576
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:38,030
has taken an interest in global mass

577
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:40,220
surveillance five years ago

578
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:42,680
Edward Snowden shocked the world with

579
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:47,000
his revelations that the NSA is spying

580
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:48,550
on foreign traffic now in a world where

581
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,780
most of our services are actually

582
00:32:48,550 --> 00:33:00,620
located in the u.s. most of our traffic

583
00:32:53,780 --> 00:33:06,379
is fair game today NSA and discussed an

584
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:09,919
outcry around that time but how fast do

585
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:13,280
people forget because last year when

586
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:16,550
projects prism an app stream were pushed

587
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:19,780
to the Congress for renewal they passed

588
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:23,210
with little difficulty and a week later

589
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:27,649
u.s. President Donald Trump approved him

590
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:35,660
to law and this was valid for the next

591
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:38,180
six years raising the bar doesn't mean

592
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:40,850
that we won't encounter those with

593
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:44,720
seemingly unlimited budgets we'll stop

594
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:47,120
at nothing to get your information but

595
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,820
it means that we are able to weed out

596
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:54,439
the weaker opponents so that we can

597
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:55,939
focus on the more advanced ones and this

598
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,660
is where you can truly test your

599
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:04,640
disobedience because if you have an

600
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:08,409
opponent that is this powerful heavily

601
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:13,430
resourced seemingly unlimited resource

602
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:15,850
would you still continue firing or would

603
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:15,850
you give up

604
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:27,219
but there are times that the government

605
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:32,668
can remind us that they can also be on

606
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:35,739
our side so in the recent years there's

607
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:37,779
one topic after another of one of the

608
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:40,598
recent threats that we have seen to our

609
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:44,080
privacy and security which are breaches

610
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:48,909
and since 2013 we have seen one breach

611
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:50,980
after another so 2013 and 2014 we have

612
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:54,700
seen the Yahoo breaches which

613
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:59,830
compromised a billion credentials 2014

614
00:34:54,699 --> 00:35:01,810
there was a Bey 2015 there was a website

615
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:04,930
for extramarital affairs

616
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:07,240
that was breached called Ashley Madison

617
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:09,899
and what happened was that its users was

618
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:14,379
dumped for public consumption

619
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:16,720
and while breaches of websites like

620
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:23,380
Ashley Madison is damaging to some

621
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:25,919
people's reputations and marriages there

622
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:31,240
are breaches that are just plain

623
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:35,710
damaging in 2017 we have seen the

624
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:38,700
Equifax breach and this affected 150

625
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:42,070
million people and what was compromised

626
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:47,740
was their full names Social Security

627
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:54,160
numbers addresses dates of birth and for

628
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:56,919
some even their driver's licenses it

629
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:03,520
doesn't take much to go from there so

630
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:07,119
identity theft and Equifax was quite

631
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:10,420
notorious it was the single most cause

632
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:12,760
of a spike of the search breaches in the

633
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:15,849
5 last 5 years so the search for the

634
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:18,280
word breach and that spike coincided

635
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:19,750
around the time that Equifax divulged to

636
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:23,700
the public that they have been

637
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:26,830
compromised so the people were concerned

638
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:30,790
and of course they wanted a problem

639
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:33,580
addressed and there are some government

640
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:35,980
agencies in the u.s. like the Consumer

641
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:37,840
Financial Protection Bureau

642
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:40,090
which actually rose up and filed

643
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:43,930
lawsuits against Equifax on behalf of

644
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:45,580
the people and then IRS as well

645
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:52,509
cancelled their multi-million dollar

646
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:55,720
contracts with Equifax and these things

647
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:59,680
they are very very good to show support

648
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:02,529
for your citizens but nowhere is it more

649
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:05,049
visible than in the European Union that

650
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:07,260
the government is actually listening and

651
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:11,470
caring about these people's privacy

652
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:15,690
because last year the GD P R starts to

653
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:18,939
be enforced and this is the single-most

654
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:21,400
law with the widest coverage when it

655
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:23,680
comes to protecting against protecting

656
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,610
our information that that's stored on

657
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,440
someone else

658
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:32,230
servers article 33 of the GD P are

659
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:35,980
states that if you have had a breached

660
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:38,700
and it affected users credentials or

661
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:41,770
potentially affected users information

662
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:45,910
you are required to report within 72

663
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:50,830
hours to the authorities and to include

664
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:52,420
remedial actions taken so now the

665
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:56,500
government is holding these

666
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:59,200
organizations accountable for our data

667
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:07,090
and they need to do their due diligence

668
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:10,029
in protecting our data but what is

669
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:16,150
really a good mitigation against

670
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:19,090
breaches many of you here do offensive

671
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:20,440
security for a living so white hats you

672
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,390
try to do penetration testing in

673
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,980
organizations and then you show them

674
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:26,170
where are the weak points give them

675
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:29,170
recommendations for hardening their

676
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:31,750
systems or their networks these

677
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:34,530
recommendations coupled with the

678
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:38,170
solutions that our defenders have built

679
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:43,360
are the best defenses that we can have

680
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:45,850
against this type of threats in this

681
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:50,050
time and age where the Internet of

682
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:53,920
Things is going to the same networks

683
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:56,550
as our endpoint devices even if platform

684
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:00,000
owners such as Microsoft Apple or Google

685
00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:02,350
try to publish their best practices and

686
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,390
try to really push it out there so that

687
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:09,759
others copy it perhaps some of these new

688
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:16,060
organizations this new platform owners

689
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:19,330
may not yet be listening but look at

690
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:24,610
that we're not alone in our advocacy

691
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:26,500
anymore these platform owners are quite

692
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:31,540
actually quite big platform owners and

693
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:34,000
now advocating with us Apple now has

694
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:38,050
more and more topics in WWDC that are

695
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,930
related to security and Microsoft their

696
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:43,870
blue hat conferences virus initiative

697
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:51,450
programs and they even partner with pawn

698
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:54,880
to all it's not us versus them anymore

699
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:57,970
most of the time I'm saying most of the

700
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:02,770
time we are now speaking the same

701
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:07,080
security language if that is not an

702
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:07,080
accomplishment that I don't know worries

703
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:17,589
but what does this mean for us now does

704
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:19,569
this mean that our job is done we just

705
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:25,589
go home because you know they have

706
00:40:19,569 --> 00:40:25,589
already been convinced of course not

707
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:32,859
it is only through advocacy that we

708
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:35,170
don't backslide because as we continue

709
00:40:32,859 --> 00:40:40,150
raising the bar so are the

710
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:42,309
cybercriminals raising theirs and we

711
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:44,049
also have new platform owners who are

712
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:46,960
coming into the picture who are all

713
00:40:44,049 --> 00:40:50,619
about functionality and securities and

714
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,269
inconvenience what do you do then you

715
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:54,730
find a vulnerability in their product

716
00:40:52,269 --> 00:40:56,979
they don't have a bug bounty you try to

717
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:59,470
find a contact you can't find anyone and

718
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:01,660
because you so religiously tried you

719
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:03,038
finally found one and then you sent an

720
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:11,649
email and then they ignore you and hope

721
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:17,880
you go away what do you do gets painful

722
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:20,289
sometimes right do you just give up

723
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:24,910
feels like history repeating itself

724
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:26,549
perhaps it maybe but remember that these

725
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:28,690
are now different organizations

726
00:41:26,549 --> 00:41:30,549
different organizations different

727
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:34,299
platform owners that we can bring to the

728
00:41:30,549 --> 00:41:37,869
right side of history because can you

729
00:41:34,299 --> 00:41:43,329
imagine if we didn't continue our

730
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:46,650
advocacy then can you imagine what

731
00:41:43,329 --> 00:41:46,650
windows would look like today

732
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:58,069
raising the bar is it's a team game and

733
00:41:53,860 --> 00:42:02,660
this is the boat that we have to ride

734
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:05,780
together to grab a page from rainforest

735
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:13,000
puppy this was the first white hat who

736
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:13,000
dared to draft a disclosures guideline

737
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:19,000
let us stop pointing fingers and just

738
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,000
fix the problem

739
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:31,970
there are those who disobeyed and left

740
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:37,970
chaos in their wake there are also those

741
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:42,439
who disobeyed only for personal gain at

742
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:46,549
the expense of others but there were

743
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:49,090
those who disobeyed and change the world

744
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:49,090
for the better

745
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:55,450
disobey wisely thank you

746
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:16,819
do we take questions here I don't know

747
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:19,609
we take questions alright okay thanks

748
00:43:16,819 --> 00:43:23,480
for the talk there was this you used the

749
00:43:19,609 --> 00:43:25,790
term responsible disclosure and that's

750
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:27,970
highly controversial yes because if we

751
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:30,920
think about the situation when

752
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:34,098
everything was wide open exploitable in

753
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:36,290
the 90s or early 2000s and then what

754
00:43:34,099 --> 00:43:39,410
kind of capabilities think people like

755
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:41,839
nation-states had at the time and then

756
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:44,808
there were actually people or there are

757
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:48,410
actually people whose lives can be

758
00:43:44,809 --> 00:43:51,410
depended on their computer security and

759
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:53,029
so forth and if we think about that

760
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:55,129
those people don't know that their

761
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:58,880
systems are vulnerable

762
00:43:55,130 --> 00:44:01,660
is that a bigger problem than just some

763
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,400
malware running around and maybe

764
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:06,440
destroying some random people's

765
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,359
computers who don't have actually their

766
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,329
lives online or anything like that or

767
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:14,328
how you would wait these kind of things

768
00:44:11,329 --> 00:44:17,329
so your question is related to is it

769
00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:21,049
information asymmetry basically so I

770
00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:23,240
think now it's on mods we are on much

771
00:44:21,049 --> 00:44:26,000
better grounds with that right now than

772
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:28,779
we were then and then people's threat

773
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,589
models are a little bit different that

774
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:33,470
is true

775
00:44:30,589 --> 00:44:35,480
during the time the problem was really

776
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:38,209
that since the platform owners were also

777
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:41,059
not on the side of security they were

778
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:43,369
even part of the problem that even if

779
00:44:41,059 --> 00:44:45,710
there was a problem they were part of

780
00:44:43,369 --> 00:44:48,200
kind of hiding the problem or minimizing

781
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:51,770
the problem but since that is not the

782
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:54,259
case anymore today then you are right in

783
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:56,000
saying that it has really improved but

784
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:57,440
if your question regarding that which is

785
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,319
a bigger problem the malware that is

786
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:03,829
running around or the exposure of the

787
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:06,140
problem so in both sides the problem is

788
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:08,720
still there but the exploitation of the

789
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:10,210
problem has not happened with that which

790
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,379
didn't have the malware running around

791
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:15,170
sorry

792
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:17,599
well yeah I didn't know so for example

793
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:19,910
when you know then you would know that

794
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:22,220
those that are exploited are clearly the

795
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:26,479
ones that are that have been affected

796
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:29,149
but since since toxnet times we already

797
00:45:26,479 --> 00:45:31,160
know that there are things that we never

798
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:35,210
really knew that was happening behind

799
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:38,450
the scenes did that answer your did that

800
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:41,680
address some of your thoughts probably

801
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:48,169
okay we can talk later as well

802
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:51,049
anyone else yes well what do you think

803
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:55,039
of mobile phone networks as platform

804
00:45:51,049 --> 00:45:58,220
providers and security mobile phone

805
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:59,539
networks not about phones not yet really

806
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:02,899
the networks because I say that

807
00:45:59,539 --> 00:46:04,069
communication providers it it depends

808
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,200
what we're talking about like which

809
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:10,609
communication because if you're talking

810
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:13,129
let's say text or SMS that's on a

811
00:46:10,609 --> 00:46:15,920
network that is completely unencrypted

812
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:18,410
which is um I think you already know

813
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:21,829
that it's it's not very good so let's

814
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:24,078
say there is I'll give you a scenario

815
00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:26,299
for example you interface with your back

816
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:29,059
and you have one-time passwords that are

817
00:46:26,299 --> 00:46:34,249
sent to you via SMS that is quite easy

818
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:36,680
to do sort of like what is the term to

819
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:39,379
hijack in between so somebody can

820
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:42,229
actually take your one-time password

821
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:45,890
because the ss7 network that they have

822
00:46:42,229 --> 00:46:49,069
is not really encrypted but that aside

823
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:52,609
if if we're talking about networks that

824
00:46:49,069 --> 00:46:55,190
are like now fully encrypted as well

825
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:58,819
once we're using for 4G et cetera then

826
00:46:55,190 --> 00:47:02,779
it is it is getting closer to the level

827
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:04,460
of our normal network that we use every

828
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:06,829
day for example in our offices or in our

829
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:08,839
homes so it depends like which which

830
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:11,150
ones we are talking about because they

831
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:16,719
kind of provide different platforms as

832
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:19,220
well thank you all right anybody else

833
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:23,270
yes

834
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:26,069
all right no thanks for the talk yes I

835
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:28,340
remember this story some time ago there

836
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:31,470
was this guy who made a worm that was

837
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:34,140
going to IOT devices and fixed known

838
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:35,580
vulnerabilities okay there was this

839
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:37,020
reaction on the internet that it was

840
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:39,540
quite interesting they were calling him

841
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:44,790
a hero when all these kind of words

842
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:48,210
though what is the how our governments

843
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:51,300
security companies antivirus and those

844
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:54,360
kind of companies how do they see these

845
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:57,060
kind of people so this is a new form of

846
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:59,670
malware you cannot even call it a what

847
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:02,570
malware but know how our discard field

848
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:04,680
today in the security community Thanks

849
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:07,260
yeah thank you for the question

850
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:10,680
actually this type of malware they're

851
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:13,530
not entirely new there were some already

852
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:15,569
in the earlier times that actually when

853
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:18,360
it installs into the system it cleans

854
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:20,310
all the other malware so there are even

855
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:22,260
times that we were thinking that why

856
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:23,730
don't we just use as a cleanup tool we

857
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:25,590
execute this malware and then you know

858
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:27,960
we take it away in the end because it

859
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:31,860
cleans so much more than if we do it

860
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:33,690
individually but still the part of the

861
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:35,850
malware that really makes it malicious

862
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:39,060
is that it installs on your machine

863
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:41,790
without your consent and doing things

864
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:44,549
that you may not really want it to do so

865
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:47,340
this this consent part is one of the

866
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:49,350
biggest things that we have and for

867
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:51,230
example if this malware if it only

868
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:54,900
executes patches and then goes away

869
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:56,400
doesn't clog the networks that might be

870
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,960
a benevolent malware but most of them

871
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,540
they kind of stick around as well and

872
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:03,450
the more like for example in IOT devices

873
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:05,310
the more they continue deploying the

874
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:06,930
more they clog the networks especially

875
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:09,029
if there's a lot of these devices that

876
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:13,700
are really untouched so they still

877
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:15,840
create this this level of damage yeah

878
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:18,439
there was one more question here

879
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,440
somewhere

880
00:49:20,619 --> 00:49:25,880
hi hi you're not allowed to ask a

881
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:28,940
question yeah you um

882
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:31,069
you were referring to how more and more

883
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:33,770
encryption is essentially a good thing

884
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:35,839
for the Internet what's your view on the

885
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:37,460
backlash that's coming from the

886
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:39,770
governments in that regard

887
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:42,410
we're seeing more and more environments

888
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:44,589
where end-to-end encrypted protocols are

889
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:47,930
actually being blocked they're being

890
00:49:44,589 --> 00:49:49,759
censored by governments and there is

891
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:53,089
cause even in Western countries to

892
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:56,539
actually implement backdoors if you want

893
00:49:53,089 --> 00:50:00,759
my personal view or the stage view well

894
00:49:56,539 --> 00:50:04,599
personally I I am NOT for the government

895
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:07,549
going on it I do know that they have

896
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:09,460
they would like to secure their Nations

897
00:50:07,549 --> 00:50:12,970
they would like to secure their

898
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:15,619
basically their areas of jurisdiction

899
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:19,459
against this but I think that

900
00:50:15,619 --> 00:50:22,279
communication like the MIR part that the

901
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:26,210
mere fact that if we cannot be private

902
00:50:22,279 --> 00:50:27,799
anymore in in our communication in our

903
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:29,809
thoughts because a lot of the things

904
00:50:27,799 --> 00:50:31,609
that we do online is reflective of who

905
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:34,190
we are a lot of the things that you

906
00:50:31,609 --> 00:50:37,910
search online that reflects like what

907
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:40,730
your interests are and if everyone is

908
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:44,480
privy to this information if the

909
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:46,369
government can profile me then I don't

910
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:50,930
know like what is the next step will it

911
00:50:46,369 --> 00:50:52,849
be Minority Report level kind of thing

912
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:55,270
where they would be knowing anymore I

913
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:58,089
mean already like based on my behavior

914
00:50:55,270 --> 00:51:01,549
what will I do tomorrow

915
00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:04,759
so personally I am I am not really for

916
00:51:01,549 --> 00:51:06,410
it I think it's a it's a step towards

917
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:08,930
towards something that's gonna become

918
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:12,368
just a little bit more dangerous for us

919
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:12,368
as citizens through time

920
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:20,630
and we are done yes

921
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:22,580
all right thank you for your questions

922
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:25,780
and thank you for your time

923
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,779
[Applause]
