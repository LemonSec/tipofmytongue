[Music]

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,160
thank you

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:26,519
[Music]

5
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,920
thank you

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,100
[Music]

7
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,160
all right

8
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,559
Phillipsburg good afternoon this obey I

9
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,780
would say great to be here but I'm not

10
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,260
sure sure because this is a tough place

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,440
for us I think yeah a bit nervous yeah

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,140
yeah but for the next 50 minutes or so

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,020
we are going to talk about the need for

14
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,160
Network visibility in the age of modern

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,680
EDR right that's why we are here

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,299
hopefully we can get something said so a

17
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,340
bit of background we wanted to come and

18
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,700
talk to our clients at Gold track where

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,040
the people we know a little bit of of

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,700
things we care about self networking and

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,720
yeah yeah and as you maybe see we

22
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,400
thought we were going to be in some kind

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,939
of moldy basement like 10 people in the

24
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,220
audience and I don't know what happened

25
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,159
but here we are at the guava track so we

26
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,220
try to make it so a bit of disclaimer uh

27
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,619
we're gonna go quite fast and use jargon

28
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,360
simplify things because we have to show

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,979
the demos running time and stuff like

30
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,439
that uh we show our test environment so

31
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,180
not a production or client data or

32
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,280
anything like that and we don't want to

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,820
glorify or bash any tool or vendor so we

34
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,040
say what we use but we don't want to

35
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,020
make the thing about the tools yeah and

36
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,640
this is really important since we are

37
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,540
using mde as EDR solution and z-square

38
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,299
as a secure web Gateway we are not to

39
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,000
promote or bash anyone but because we

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,060
want to do demos yeah we have to use

41
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,360
some real products

42
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,060
so about us my name is I'm cyber

43
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,340
security architect at valtry I do

44
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,739
networking Security Solutions there's a

45
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,140
lot of acronyms there all of them and a

46
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,060
bit more I've been 12 years in the

47
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,640
government uh six different roles from

48
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,379
everything

49
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,440
basically

50
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,780
also again I'm really into the technical

51
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,080
deep dive things and uh

52
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,360
well you can read it yourself yeah yeah

53
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,879
and my name is Henry Alto and I'm a

54
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,040
business colleague from Baltimore and I

55
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,459
also work as a cyber security architect

56
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:48,599
I've been working for the Finnish

57
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,060
government for the last 14 years or so

58
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,660
doing I.T stuff cyber security stuff

59
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,900
I've been around for a while and I'm the

60
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,540
I'm that guy who is weirdly in the log

61
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,540
files you know you all know that guy

62
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,680
okay

63
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,700
so a couple of words about valtteri so

64
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,500
for those who don't know what we do

65
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,560
we'll be we are basically governments

66
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,040
in-house IIT service provider tech

67
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,780
computer people yeah for the common

68
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,060
services like the networking and data

69
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,700
centers and that

70
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,000
the oh yeah yeah all of that stuff so we

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,360
have roughly about 80 000 end users so

72
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,180
we have big environment and with over

73
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,300
100 client organizations them being

74
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,420
different agencies and Ministries in the

75
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,540
government and we have a bit over 1400

76
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,599
employees scattered all over Finland so

77
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,299
yeah I don't know if we are big but we

78
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:49,980
have people yeah and we've been

79
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,260
investing heavily on security lately so

80
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,060
we have about 100 people doing security

81
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,700
and it's growing all the time for the

82
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,980
past three years or so yeah when we

83
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,799
started three years ago with Bill we had

84
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,220
like a 50 people doing security so that

85
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,440
has been quite a growth and that has

86
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,200
enabled us to do lots of cool things I

87
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,239
think yeah and we're want to show a

88
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,319
little bit of the cool things we're

89
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,819
doing yeah

90
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,160
uh so about our cyber security services

91
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,820
uh we do a lot of stuff so we got a 18

92
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,860
different Services we provide for

93
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,380
different type of uh cyber security

94
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,540
needs we got 50 different technology

95
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,080
Stacks uh and one of the cool things we

96
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,840
have been able to do is that uh we do

97
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,699
market research and not just like listen

98
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,699
to the Powerpoints but actually do proof

99
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:40,860
of value and actually go into the deep

100
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,840
dive and see what is actually under the

101
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,540
hood before we buy anything so we

102
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,520
understand what we're trying to buy and

103
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,220
one of the reasons uh we're talking

104
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,699
about it here and the EPB the or the EDR

105
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,199
and the success Solutions are two of

106
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,880
those products we are going to talk

107
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,139
today

108
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,900
yeah sure and as you can see we that we

109
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,419
have lots of different technology in our

110
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,479
stack we do Cloud technology we do

111
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,540
purely on-prem technology in air gap

112
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,520
environments and and that causes

113
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,699
different tooling for sure yeah and

114
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,639
again when we started three years ago we

115
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:18,780
had like

116
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,880
normal antiviral stuff locked from there

117
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,280
firewall locks proxy logs and nowadays

118
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,440
we are doing EDR zero trust network

119
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,199
access sassy and SSL decryption yeah so

120
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,840
a lot of has changed for us and

121
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,820
again our stock is slightly less

122
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,320
depressed now because that some of the

123
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,720
tools actually work and also the sock

124
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,500
exists nowadays before we were using uh

125
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,419
outsourced talk but nowadays we're

126
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:45,960
having like a 15 people doing our 24 7

127
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,419
so I thought they were cheering for that

128
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:51,258
yeah yeah okay

129
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,240
okay so about visibility and our tools

130
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,100
that we're going to use to achieve it so

131
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,740
we're talking here about endpoints and

132
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,020
uh usually the tools are either like

133
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,840
control or visibility and we're talking

134
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,880
about the visibility side here control

135
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,620
is really important but that would be

136
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,400
another talk of of its own and uh again

137
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,840
we're talking about the endpoint side so

138
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,400
data centers and stuff like that it

139
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,020
works quite the same but it's still

140
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,759
different and again would be a different

141
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,380
talk

142
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,900
and uh again the visibility is really

143
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,120
important because many times when things

144
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,400
happen we don't know what we're looking

145
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,080
for or what we should be controlling

146
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,699
because if we would know everything we

147
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,319
would control everything and everything

148
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,419
would be secure and it's not

149
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:36,360
so visibility makes us able to do thread

150
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,400
hunting for example investigating and

151
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,680
doing actual like uh

152
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,539
finding out what actually happened yeah

153
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,720
for sure and why Network visibility is

154
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,880
important is because almost every system

155
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,800
on its own is secure nobody does

156
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,800
insecure systems by default or some some

157
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,660
do but most of them don't and

158
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,580
communicating with other system is the

159
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,979
thing that introduces the threat and

160
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,479
there's also like memory and file

161
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,759
visibility but we're not gonna be

162
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:04,500
talking about them that much here but

163
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,539
the network side and why it's why it is

164
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,940
important yeah so really basic things

165
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,500
here that we are going to talk about

166
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,979
yeah

167
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,180
so quickly about the tools so like I

168
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,000
said we used Microsoft's EDR uh we use a

169
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,340
static solution or secure web Gateway

170
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,500
and we use CM solution from Microsoft in

171
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,720
this demo yeah but remember these are

172
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,180
not important yeah there are a lot of

173
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,099
other tools to do this if you know what

174
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:30,900
you're looking at

175
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,360
so okay uh

176
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,220
about them

177
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,660
actual

178
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,000
to understand why the network visibility

179
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,340
is important you have to compare to area

180
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,380
you have to understand what the EDR

181
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,160
actually does so in simple terms what

182
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,139
the edrcs is what the operating system

183
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,900
sees so basically the API calls that

184
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,060
there are some program makes when it's

185
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,800
using some of the operating systems

186
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,860
resources uh again three types of

187
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,259
visibility here memory so process info

188
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:05,400
uh the actual uh program you're seeing

189
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,099
but only outside from it so you can see

190
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:11,759
processing bit spawning account so who

191
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,800
is starting it process handles it's

192
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,259
calling Child parents resource usage

193
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,900
stuff like that what like reflex it was

194
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,479
used to start it but usually nothing

195
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,879
inside the actual program and this is

196
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:26,520
quite important you could actually do

197
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,319
that technically you can take a snapshot

198
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,660
of the memory and go go inside it but

199
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,039
it's not really cost effective because

200
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,500
you would have to actually map every

201
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,360
program and every time it gets updated

202
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,419
it breaks down yes and obviously we are

203
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,820
simplifying stuff here so if you know

204
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,979
how the edrs actually work they are a

205
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,080
bit more complicated but I I think this

206
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,899
is the yeah like the yeah we have to to

207
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,820
actually be able to explain it here so

208
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,980
again there's this file side of

209
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,740
visibility so what files were used by

210
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,140
what process and network side of things

211
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,240
for the EDR it means that everything

212
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,700
that's usually unencrypted so you can

213
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,399
see the IP addresses TCP ports UDP ports

214
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,459
DNS domains from the DNS queries HTTP

215
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,200
connect request if you're using a proxy

216
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,820
TLS certificates

217
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,120
um how much data was in like transmitted

218
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,680
and stuff like that but not anything

219
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,959
inside it because it cannot see in like

220
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,580
inside your browser

221
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,820
and again EDR is usually really great on

222
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,160
Windows machines but on any other

223
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,560
operating system Linux Mac OS Android

224
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,040
iPhone not that good and uh

225
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,779
the same applies to other visibility

226
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:37,260
tools usually so for example you can get

227
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,660
full Network like a Next Generation file

228
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,180
wherever uh

229
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,580
working on Windows and usually for

230
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,620
others it's just a proxy yeah working

231
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,540
and this is not to say they are getting

232
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,120
better

233
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,040
better all the time on the Linux boxes

234
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,399
and Mac OS boxes so but yeah Windows is

235
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,620
still the ground you will for the EDR

236
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,600
vendors because that's where the end

237
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,300
users are yeah most of the time yeah and

238
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,000
especially for us yeah

239
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,240
so uh just to drive the point home uh

240
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,480
what does an edrc so when you go to an

241
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,660
some site uh here you can it's the

242
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,820
disobeyed site and there's an IP address

243
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,500
and a port so what you're going to go

244
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,360
and I'm gonna

245
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,820
fast demo it

246
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,200
yeah

247
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,779
so this is the scary part where we do

248
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:29,880
live demos and jump around between the

249
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,160
desktop so let's let's see how we can

250
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,459
make it so what I'm gonna just do is

251
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:39,360
refresh the site basically it did it and

252
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,959
what I have here is uh do it yourself uh

253
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,320
EDR basically on Powershell so what I'm

254
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,180
getting here I can list all of the

255
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,779
processes I can list all of the network

256
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:54,959
connections a lot of them and on their

257
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,640
own it's just a dump too much

258
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,500
information but when I combine it here

259
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,279
just doing this

260
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,140
running running running

261
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,060
I'm just combining the process

262
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,440
information with the network information

263
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,420
that is available the operating system

264
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,000
and I can see where I'm connecting which

265
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,339
operating system is connecting and now

266
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:21,060
my Chrome exe did like eight six

267
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,360
connections to disobey.fi and basically

268
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,459
this is what the EDR could see because

269
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:29,760
it's using the basically the same apis

270
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,519
so your humble brag about how you build

271
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,860
EDR with like 10 lines of Powershell

272
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,740
yeah I I like that yeah yeah and again

273
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,380
it's not an EDR but it's the same amount

274
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,000
of visibility so just to understand what

275
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,940
it can see yeah and here we also had the

276
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,220
like the secure webcate on so I'm

277
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,740
tunneling traffic to a like an SSL

278
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,260
decryption engine so we can actually see

279
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,019
uh what it's been doing I'm gonna show

280
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:58,500
it here first

281
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,339
this is our Sim solution I was talking

282
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:05,399
about just earlier so this is what mdec

283
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:07,560
is basically on the network stack so

284
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,839
it's the same stuff again there's more

285
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,519
information and it's been enriched I'm

286
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,019
not showing those because that's not

287
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:14,579
important that's like not the basic

288
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:15,959
information it's just enriched

289
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,660
everything goes back to Source IP

290
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,260
destination IP DCP port and then you can

291
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,940
get the initiation process account name

292
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,220
so basically what's the user account

293
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,380
again the same stuff I showed with the

294
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,339
Powershell

295
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:30,720
and

296
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,519
then I'll do it from the secular web

297
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,420
gate Wayside

298
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,440
and it's a bit different again it's like

299
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,240
uh

300
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,160
quite accurate strings so usually you

301
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,139
would get more information but here you

302
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:49,680
can see the big difference so basically

303
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,420
the one connection that you can see from

304
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,420
the EDR side side which is the TCP

305
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,980
connection here I can see the

306
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,160
application layer so layer seven and all

307
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,560
of the actual HTTP application requests

308
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,779
all the files that were downloaded

309
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:06,600
all of the folders were used used and

310
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,579
for example stuff like request headers

311
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,820
so what was probably the browser being

312
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,860
used or the application being used and

313
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,220
the request method so get post options

314
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,540
and stuff like that

315
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,220
so you get a lot of more information

316
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,399
from the SSL decryption side

317
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,800
yeah and we think this is something you

318
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,560
need when you are hunting for threats or

319
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,480
trying to detect something weird going

320
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,480
on in your environment so that just just

321
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,899
a connection info by itself it's quite

322
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,180
limited it's it's important and the idea

323
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,180
provides lots of great stuff but also

324
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,399
you you would maybe like to have the

325
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,240
actual request info yeah so

326
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,399
um here was just a in case the network

327
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,800
didn't work the same same stuff so I'm

328
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,160
gonna go over them quickly

329
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,779
so so basically

330
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:00,420
EDR and as a solution or any SSL

331
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,399
decryption engine that can do the same

332
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,760
they share some properties so you get IP

333
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,639
port domain user device and operating

334
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,639
system information uh EDR can see the

335
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:13,200
starting process information which is a

336
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,899
solution usually cannot get and this is

337
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:18,180
big yeah this is this is huge this is

338
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,980
absolutely huge because you can do like

339
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,079
chains who started whatever and stuff

340
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,839
like that but you can take a guess at

341
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,060
headers but so if it's a normal user

342
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,639
using it so then headers can be valid

343
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,220
but if it's in like a threat actors

344
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,200
something something it's gonna say that

345
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,880
it's just the newest Chrome version yeah

346
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,240
and they will you cannot trust that yeah

347
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,199
and uh again like edrc's TCP sessions

348
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,420
and The Sassy can see HTTP application

349
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,880
Level requests so the orals the agent

350
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,000
headers the ls info more metadata data

351
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,980
than there because you can see it on

352
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,680
every HTTP connection the file names for

353
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,139
download is quite a big especially when

354
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,300
you can start getting file hashes so you

355
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,760
can automatically do hash searches and

356
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,040
do links from if you get iocs from the

357
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,459
from somewhere else and also one big

358
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,800
thing is on the Windows machines you can

359
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,680
get like a

360
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,019
Next Generation firewall lock so you can

361
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:19,500
get get level four like really accurate

362
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,380
IEP TCP information and even Casp

363
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,180
information so which is like

364
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,639
cloud cloud

365
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:28,320
application logs which can be really

366
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,060
like what happened with teams or

367
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,500
OneDrive or

368
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,320
whatever file dump you can see way way

369
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,959
more stuff and one really big thing that

370
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,000
you can get here is passive DNS So you

371
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,959
you're gonna be able to record every DNS

372
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,680
request it's payload and the response so

373
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,620
you get a full passive DNS that you can

374
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,540
combine and this is something that

375
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,660
usually you cannot get with an EDR

376
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,240
so you can detect the DNS tunnels yeah

377
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,459
we don't have any examples on that so

378
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,980
yes but it's a big

379
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,100
but this is the basic idea again we want

380
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,380
also wanted to bring out the mobile side

381
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,959
of things but here we grabbed the scrap

382
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,180
the demo because

383
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,420
mobile logging is slow so it can take up

384
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,980
to two hours to get the logs to the

385
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,740
scene so showing it would be kind of

386
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,720
pointless basically here we have an MD

387
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,959
that is logging uh Android device when

388
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,120
it's doing Network events and what is

389
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,220
actually logging it's it's local IP yeah

390
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,440
so there's happening something but what

391
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,420
it doesn't log

392
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,420
so this isn't very useful for you when

393
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,500
you are trying to find something

394
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,959
happening from that mobile device

395
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,480
towards the network so what you could do

396
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,300
with this is maybe go to local access

397
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,980
point or something like that then from

398
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,360
there you could get some flows or

399
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,279
something like that but on its own it's

400
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,360
really

401
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,399
really small

402
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:56,279
but when you do this combine this with a

403
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:58,380
like a secure web Gateway the same

404
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,839
request that were there you get actually

405
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,600
the same information so HTTP like

406
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,880
request methods the actual files the

407
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,980
headers and all of the good stuff that

408
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,660
you can get from the network side

409
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,760
because this is a really big big thing

410
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,500
because the

411
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,359
mobile devices that are running

412
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,459
sandboxes and you cannot do like so

413
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:19,619
invasive uh

414
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:22,380
monitoring basically on the processes

415
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,299
and stuff like that it just won't tell

416
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,339
you but if you don't do it on the mobile

417
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,919
device but you do it on the line you can

418
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,780
get way more information so basically

419
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,860
this is the same on the Windows

420
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,860
endpoints as it is on the Android

421
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,620
devices uh on the Gateway side

422
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,740
so again the same things the edrs

423
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,600
usually aren't really edrs or mobile

424
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,620
devices

425
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,900
yeah that's right

426
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,960
so okay for our next use case detecting

427
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,900
and somewhat preventing also c2s using

428
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,580
network visibility

429
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,559
and we are going to go with the real

430
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,980
classic here so tweaking the user to run

431
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,900
some malicious stuff and then we are

432
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,059
going to steal their files through C2

433
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:09,360
Channel over the internet and over the

434
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,240
https because that's one thing we would

435
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,740
like to show you that the TLs

436
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,039
internships and might be wider when you

437
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,860
are looking for bad things to happen

438
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,160
yeah and we are showcasing this from the

439
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,820
following assumptions so the user is

440
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,880
running up-to-date Windows 11 box we are

441
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,460
not trying to cheat here the user is

442
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,500
just normal user without admin rights

443
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,380
and big for us there is no app Locker

444
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,080
policy in place

445
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,419
unfortunately I think this is still the

446
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:44,780
case in many of the organizations so

447
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,100
yeah we are letting the user run

448
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,919
anything he or she can download from the

449
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,220
internet and that makes it easier for us

450
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,140
applocker is strong but it's a pain in

451
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,059
the ass to actually Implement so yeah

452
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:59,100
and that's why it's the case yeah and

453
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,380
honorary picking machines we also have a

454
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,559
mde running and Defender for antivirus

455
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,260
without any exceptions so this can

456
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,320
create demo effects for us but there is

457
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,539
more to enjoy for you if our demo fails

458
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,100
horribly so

459
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,500
yeah and the final one it's a big one

460
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,240
the user can be intrigued to download

461
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,460
and run something from the internet but

462
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,580
let me tell you when you have 80 000 end

463
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,679
users this is not going to be the

464
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,080
problem so there's always a software

465
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,159
it's going to click something yeah

466
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,900
and here you can see your big attack

467
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,080
plan so it all starts with a phishing

468
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,539
mail it always starts with a fishing

469
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:42,600
mail and that contains link to a site

470
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,240
which then contains link to download the

471
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,539
exe file that acts as a dropper and

472
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:51,240
that's our fake client and when the user

473
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,160
runs the pay client it downloads the

474
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,559
payload from the internet and then

475
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:58,320
extracts the payload and places exe

476
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,559
service to users local update that

477
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:05,460
creates a shortcut to user startup for

478
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,100
persistence and then starts the service

479
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,620
which is actually the enforce dealer and

480
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,340
the C2 connection to our server

481
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:19,039
and then we get the files Maybe

482
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,919
and yeah because it I thought I think it

483
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:24,780
might be illegal to do a presentation

484
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,620
without involving chat GPD in one way or

485
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,620
another we decided to jump on the hype

486
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,520
train also so our fishing is just gpdt

487
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,039
because it was yeah

488
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,919
and we were so lazy that we even went on

489
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:44,160
and made the AI to ride the fishing mail

490
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,100
for us and I think the future is here

491
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,178
that's great

492
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,340
okay so let's go

493
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,919
just a second

494
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,140
wait a second awesome

495
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,320
this and this

496
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,919
okay on the left you can see our first

497
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:13,440
victim machine and just wanted to show

498
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,140
you that we are not trying to cheat that

499
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,900
Defender is on there is also the sense

500
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,400
and Dr process on but yeah you can see

501
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,600
soon the secure web Gateway is off for

502
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,880
the first demo and on the right you can

503
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,700
see your C2 server we are actually using

504
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,980
this Traverse to slightly modified

505
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,400
version but it's a common C to I think

506
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,799
many of you know it and it works by

507
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,900
sending get requests

508
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,200
from the client to the server so that is

509
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,059
what we are running here

510
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:51,299
so as I said all starts with a fishing

511
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:54,120
mail and hopefully it will work so this

512
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,460
is the fishing mail this is not so

513
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,580
important and then there is a site which

514
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,820
user goes to looks legit right you would

515
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,280
click everything in here I know

516
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,280
yeah download now and try no

517
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,919
registration or installing why don't you

518
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,919
yeah yeah sounds good so we are going to

519
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,260
download the client

520
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,120
and now we are going to see the first

521
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,760
stuff so this is the mark of the web

522
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,059
thing I I think many of you know this

523
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:28,679
and that the way that the actors the

524
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,440
track thread actors used to get by this

525
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,799
was to stop the exe is inside the isos

526
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,919
and vhds but I think Microsoft fixed

527
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,440
that like in last November or December

528
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,600
so

529
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,940
as as I'm aware there is no easy way to

530
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,159
get around the mark of the web thing but

531
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:48,720
I'm sure that someone in the audience

532
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,960
will prove me wrong in like next one

533
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,220
minute or so

534
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,740
but yeah no worries because the user

535
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,220
really wants that chat gbd to write his

536
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,159
mails or something so we will run it

537
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,440
anyway

538
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,679
okay something something happens let's

539
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,799
connect because I'm the user I just want

540
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,260
to connect it I don't know where but

541
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,879
there is a button for it

542
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,280
and okay so yeah something happened but

543
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,679
the important part the user just goes on

544
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:25,020
with his day or something but the

545
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,539
important part is on the right side we

546
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,720
got the C2 connection and I hope it will

547
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,240
work okay so here it is

548
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,280
we can say interact we can say who am I

549
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,100
you can say host name

550
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,500
whatever so we are basically just giving

551
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,980
the comments to the victim machine and

552
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,940
there is no alerts none whatsoever and

553
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,440
there should be no alerts in that

554
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,919
console also sorry that site went down

555
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:01,200
for a second let's see

556
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,260
oh devices

557
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:09,379
and there is our devices this and this

558
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,039
and if all is good there is no incident

559
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:16,460
here

560
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:22,080
second and no incident here so the EDR

561
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,539
does not pick it well it does speak a

562
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:26,880
lot of things but it doesn't alert so

563
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,640
it's just logging now yeah so I think on

564
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,700
the usual cases there would be nothing

565
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,820
done by socks so let's

566
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,360
okay so we can say list home because we

567
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,240
want to steal their files right

568
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,340
and there we can see I don't know if you

569
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,280
can see it it's quite small but

570
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,440
this is basically the contents of the

571
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,840
user's home folder so couple of

572
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,720
interesting files you know

573
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,539
some key pass file I think

574
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:01,200
let's download

575
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,080
get this the mirror and another file

576
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,879
Also let's download that one

577
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,780
so stealing files fund right an easy

578
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,760
yeah and

579
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,280
there is the files

580
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:25,280
also the other one let's say cat

581
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:30,020
okay that's the text from here

582
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,179
nailed it yeah

583
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:35,179
yeah

584
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,159
so that that was our first demo that was

585
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,460
our first victim machine just mde and

586
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,279
Antivirus yeah there are no network

587
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:48,840
controls yeah so next up I will just say

588
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,980
exit one time

589
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,580
and we go to another box to demo what

590
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,159
would happen when the secure web Gateway

591
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:03,120
would be there by default

592
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,340
yeah so with the categorization stuff

593
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,020
and so on

594
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,900
actually I will close this because it is

595
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,059
running as an admin

596
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:14,700
and same thing we are going to start

597
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,380
with the fishing mail

598
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,679
we are going to click the same link and

599
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,559
this is the first difference that user

600
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,659
would get one more

601
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:27,840
just just one more warning are you sure

602
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,480
you want to do this because this side is

603
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,299
categorized by miscore unknown I don't

604
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:36,120
know it's not been seen it before yeah

605
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,460
but as we said user really wants to do

606
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,480
this so we don't have a policy right now

607
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,159
that would block the user to download

608
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,360
the exe file it I think we should do it

609
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,520
but but right now we are letting the

610
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,500
users to download the exe is from the

611
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,539
unknown sites in this demo at least so

612
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:56,460
it's a bit difficult because customers

613
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,500
want to download stuff so yeah your

614
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,679
fault your fault if you're our customers

615
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,820
okay so we get the client

616
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,539
and this should be yeah so this is for

617
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:11,159
the prevention that we were we're

618
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,919
talking about so actually mind

619
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,320
explaining us why we are getting this

620
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,980
can you yeah so so basically uh we are

621
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,539
not blocking it actually what we're

622
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,039
doing it we are it's the script

623
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,980
basically running on CLI and it's trying

624
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,980
to take the HTTP connection and we're

625
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,960
generating that web page that says are

626
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,140
you sure please click OK and the program

627
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,140
doesn't know how to click ok so

628
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,720
yeah it doesn't go through yes so by an

629
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,600
accident we just prevented the C2

630
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,220
connection from ever happened by

631
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,620
accident by Design but yeah yeah by

632
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:49,620
accident I I didn't say okay but yeah

633
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,720
many of you know also know that the

634
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,179
categorization is just one problem for

635
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:57,020
the attacker they can get around it

636
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,820
definitely and our like solution it's

637
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,620
it's not to control everything hundred

638
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,720
percent that is maybe for some other

639
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,320
environment our job is just to make make

640
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,539
it safe enough so basically we're

641
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:12,000
playing a numbers game so we got a lot

642
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,640
of users and

643
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,520
it is okay if something bad happens

644
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,320
every now and then if most of them get

645
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,600
to do their work yeah so it is all about

646
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,419
raising the bar that's a cliche but but

647
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:26,940
it is it really is all about making it

648
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,039
harder so we don't get 100 cases we get

649
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,900
one case or we don't get a thousand

650
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,840
cases we get a 100 cases yeah so for now

651
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,820
we are going to simulate the scenario

652
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,120
where the threat actor has been

653
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,620
in some way has the categorized page

654
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:46,320
that can be used in this case so I'm

655
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,720
going to download different client

656
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,400
that communicates with a different

657
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,140
address

658
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,960
and let's open it and hopefully it will

659
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,020
connect something happened yay the

660
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,260
connection so this is just to say that

661
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,740
that secure web Gateway is nowhere

662
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,320
perfect because we can get the C2

663
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,600
connection working even with tattoo so

664
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,919
so what happened here is just that

665
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:13,500
categorization it's a safe domain so you

666
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,900
use some some domain that was in some

667
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,640
other use for example and you bought it

668
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,580
off and now you're just using it to go

669
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,620
through it it's not 100 but again it's

670
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,679
making stuff harder yeah one more step

671
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,679
least home and this is very basic stuff

672
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:32,580
we we have absolutely no EDR or

673
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,080
antivirus evasions in place in our

674
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,260
bad binaries it's just like a 300 lines

675
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,380
of C sharp code and using

676
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,080
the basic binary the basic libraries

677
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,659
again it's obfuscated in Finnish so

678
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:50,399
that's why it doesn't get caught up by

679
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,640
yeah since we didn't want to get caught

680
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,220
so easily we made lots of Finnish

681
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,380
function names and variables so yeah

682
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,200
that was the biggest encryption or Opus

683
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,279
getting there

684
00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:04,200
but yeah we could download the files

685
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,419
this is not so important anymore but I'm

686
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:08,460
going to do it anyway just to Showcase

687
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,460
download

688
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,500
and and it works so the secure web

689
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,860
Gateway helped us to prevent with this

690
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,520
setup but it was no perfect again the

691
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,899
point is not to show absolute control

692
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:27,059
but how to detect it yeah which is the

693
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:29,279
next step and still there should be no

694
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,700
others but we could we can see is lots

695
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,220
of stuff in the timeline for the EDR

696
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:40,340
solution so if I write chat GPT

697
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:45,000
so as you can see it it sees a lot this

698
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,159
is good stuff for a threat hunting but

699
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:50,039
it is not enough for the mde duration

700
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:53,279
alert that your sock would be looking at

701
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,260
so this would have to be done by

702
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,140
manually threat hunting and or getting

703
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,179
an ioc from somewhere else that you

704
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:01,980
should be taking a look at this site or

705
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,080
this type of exe or a hash or something

706
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,179
like that yeah and at least we would

707
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:08,399
like to know if there was these kinds of

708
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,799
inforce dealer running in our users

709
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,399
computer so it would be a lot to have

710
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,100
alerts right it would be nice yeah so

711
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,140
but yeah it is working we are not

712
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,659
cheating here

713
00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:24,720
and then for the promised detection part

714
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,880
of it so

715
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,880
couple of quick ways how could one

716
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:35,159
detect this C2 like Trevor C2 so first

717
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,260
one would be from the network visibility

718
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,020
using the network visibility so first

719
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,500
one would be detect base64 encoding from

720
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,980
the get requests heading towards

721
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,860
non-white listed or some non-categorized

722
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:54,840
pages so actually I have just run it and

723
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,539
the logs are generated before the event

724
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:00,600
because there's a slight delay and it is

725
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,880
not the query is not the important part

726
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,880
here I just wanted to show that we can

727
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,700
get it gold because because this is the

728
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,640
C2 connection and I also wanted to show

729
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,860
that this is going to create some false

730
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,980
positives absolutely because some others

731
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,559
use base64 for legit reasons yeah yeah

732
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:23,039
lots of others use base64 and it is not

733
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,899
perfect it is not something you would

734
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:28,080
alert the sock tier one but it is

735
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,880
definitely something you can use in the

736
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,100
threat hunting exactly it's not

737
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,140
definitive it's something yeah to

738
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,059
actually get on working

739
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:38,039
and another one using the network

740
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:41,700
visibility would be to find connections

741
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,360
that have like a high amount of get

742
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,240
requests with static received and sent

743
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,399
bytes hitting the same destination from

744
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,940
the same host because the way Trevor C2

745
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,240
and couple of other c2s also work is

746
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,659
when they ask for for the information

747
00:32:59,659 --> 00:33:03,240
from the server if there is like just

748
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,899
wait don't do anything the request is

749
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:09,419
always symmetrical it's always same guy

750
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:11,520
or almost same again they have to pull

751
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,200
it even though they if they do like

752
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,240
intervals That Is Random they still have

753
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,059
to pull it yeah and I think in this case

754
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:20,159
we left the C2 running for a couple of

755
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,000
hours and it created a lot of requests

756
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,140
yeah a lot of requests over a thousand

757
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:31,460
sorry and the last one would be to chase

758
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,140
constant communication between some host

759
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,340
machine and destination host using https

760
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,899
like the fine sources and destinations

761
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:42,059
that have been communicating at least

762
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:46,140
once per 10 minutes for one hour and

763
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,200
that that this has been quite useful for

764
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,380
at least in my experience there are

765
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,419
going to pay false positives also in

766
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:56,399
here but this would be the starting

767
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,860
points that you would take and then go

768
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,559
to the EDR logs and find out what's

769
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:04,080
going on you can do it another way

770
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,120
around and you will do it a lot of times

771
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,179
another way around but without network

772
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:11,219
visibility it is

773
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:14,280
I say you are not getting all of it that

774
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,719
you could yeah

775
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,540
so let's see yeah we have time yeah we

776
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,719
have time so I think I'm done with the

777
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:24,239
demos yeah here just jumping and let's

778
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,179
jump on the desktop number one

779
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:32,540
okay go ahead oh yeah sorry yeah yeah

780
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,540
and I guess you're all thinking that I

781
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,480
am wrong and maybe it's a bit dumb and

782
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,540
but what about X Y and Z and yeah this

783
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:46,020
was John just one C2 profile but in many

784
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,418
cases some kind of encoding is employed

785
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:50,639
and that's something you can look for if

786
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,320
you have that Uris

787
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,520
yeah

788
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,639
so again nothing is definitive again

789
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,339
it's just uh stuff you can use to do

790
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:01,140
more faith hunting better threat hunting

791
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,119
and once you get a lot of different like

792
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,540
uh ways of finding at the same domain is

793
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,060
bad then you probably have a case and

794
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,619
then you maybe should go and take a look

795
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:12,960
at other logs like the EDR logs or

796
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,420
whatever other you may have available

797
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,119
yeah and many c2s also they don't use

798
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,859
Gateway requests but they use post

799
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:23,099
requests and they would be also easy to

800
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:26,820
spot if you know it is a post request if

801
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:29,400
you have you can do this from the just

802
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,920
regular proxy logs if you do TLS

803
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,380
interception but DLS interception is

804
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,380
important in this case right yeah and

805
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,500
yeah the detection detecting c2s using

806
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,599
network traffic even with the TLs

807
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,960
interception is not a Magic Bullet but

808
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,820
it is a great addition to have Network

809
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,839
visibility as we just explained and with

810
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,880
this it is possible to create more text

811
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,060
and hundreds in your CMS and just

812
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,520
lasting don't forget about the control

813
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,740
part that this was not the point of our

814
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,220
presentation today but really does your

815
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,800
normal users need to download exes and

816
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,160
isos and vhds from the untrusted sites

817
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,440
or other scripts and stuff like that

818
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,500
yeah I run or hiding some stuff I hope

819
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,880
not

820
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,760
so summary about the C2 detection and

821
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,240
prevention first deploy app Locker you

822
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,640
don't want your users to run random

823
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,700
sheet in your workstations and and this

824
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,740
can be done and this should be done even

825
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,839
in the big environments like our hours

826
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:37,079
it can be done it is a pain in the ass

827
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:39,060
like Villa said but it takes long time

828
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,900
and yeah and still there's a ways to get

829
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,420
around the application control there

830
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,640
will be remote code execution

831
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,560
vulnerabilities and there will be

832
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,619
bypasses using Lola beans Wireless stuff

833
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:55,260
and yeah but but all again raising the

834
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,680
bar and actually we think the edrs are

835
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,260
getting very good at preventing this

836
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,960
limited amount of techniques the edrs

837
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,359
and Antivirus are not perfect when you

838
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:09,119
let everything in and let every

839
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,420
everything to run

840
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,859
still gets around the application

841
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:16,200
control and the EDR the network control

842
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,420
and visibility is usually your last line

843
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,180
of defense so at least we think it

844
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,940
should be there and what we are after we

845
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,800
are we are after application Control

846
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,760
Plus modern EDR Plus network control and

847
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,540
visibility and logs logs from all of

848
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,700
them and with that way we are going to

849
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,200
maximize the prevention and detection

850
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,240
capabilities

851
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,520
yeah lots of great write-ups and so on

852
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,579
but yeah so uh another use case so

853
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:46,859
detecting uh adversary in the middle so

854
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:49,800
Adam it's really nice acronym so

855
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,480
basically again here we are not trying

856
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,460
to prevent it uh we're trying to detect

857
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,160
something uh because you cannot get it

858
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,380
all once you get a lot of the user base

859
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,540
is Big something is going to go through

860
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,220
we don't know what it is but it's gonna

861
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,460
go through so the idea is here that the

862
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,460
doing an ATM uh the adversary can get

863
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,260
the login password information and

864
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,180
assessing cookie that works without a

865
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,099
multi-factor authentication and actually

866
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:16,440
can get them with the multi-factor

867
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,040
authentication and the idea is here that

868
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,660
once you get an ioc

869
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,280
how do you know

870
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,160
that how many users actually did the

871
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,900
stupid thing and went through with it

872
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,480
and gave the cookie and the password out

873
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,220
because not everybody that visits the

874
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,180
site

875
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,339
goes through with the logging process

876
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:37,980
so idea again here is that stuff

877
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,140
happened you can see that hundred people

878
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,060
click the link but how many were

879
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,400
actually compromised yeah and this is

880
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,560
very big for the assault guys I I think

881
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,900
if we were to ask anyone who is doing

882
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,020
soccer work they would agree that it is

883
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,780
important to really know who fell in and

884
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:57,000
who did and and as last weeks we had

885
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,180
like a massive amounts of secure email

886
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:04,260
phishing campaigns going on so it is

887
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,440
relevant actually it is 11. so here what

888
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,060
we're trying to show you is that we have

889
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,940
an endpoint then we have the decryption

890
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,339
uh in the line and then we have another

891
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:16,800
decryption that is evil Kings and then

892
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,599
we have an Azure 80 where we're logging

893
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:20,040
into

894
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,760
so a lot of SSL decryption

895
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,300
and

896
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:32,400
just a second and the last demo so so

897
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,220
far everything has been going just great

898
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,118
no pressure

899
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,780
so here I have a link that is using a

900
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:58,079
domain vitory.com so with the big L our

901
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,000
big eye it looks a bit like bouldering

902
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,920
then hoping

903
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,260
and here I can see that somebody landed

904
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,700
on my landing page and it's trying to

905
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,260
log in

906
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:14,480
and then I'm looking at my passwords

907
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,320
oh it failed so I have to log in

908
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,980
and because we have MFA everywhere it's

909
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,359
asking me to

910
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,700
yeah confirm it but because I'm logging

911
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,260
in and I know that I'm logging in I'm

912
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,599
going to click it yeah you're expecting

913
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,599
to get an MFA and you will approve it

914
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:45,300
and here's critical part so now I went

915
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,579
went through with it but do I want to

916
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:50,160
get more login prompts I don't so I'm

917
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,320
gonna click this and save a cookie to my

918
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,119
machine

919
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:57,000
and this happened

920
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,720
so basically oh it failed and it went

921
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,300
the login again probably not working but

922
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:08,000
once I show here yes you know

923
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,700
too many else

924
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,598
make that big

925
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,420
so what are we looking at what we're

926
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,700
looking at is here is my credentials so

927
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,260
because we were doing the decryption

928
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,599
that's my username

929
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,160
that's my password

930
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:33,420
and this is my kmsi cookie if I cover

931
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,700
paste this to another browser

932
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,220
I can log in straight As long as the

933
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,540
conditional access policy is not

934
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,400
blocking it which is usually never

935
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,020
especially when I'm coming from Finland

936
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:46,260
so basically I can bypass the MFA to any

937
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,140
AD or a080 Service Enterprise

938
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:52,380
application or whatnot that is this user

939
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,660
would have yeah so all that the attacker

940
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,900
has to do is to get the user tricked to

941
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,540
that site and doing the login it looks

942
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,300
yeah semi legit and then it's like

943
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,220
rotating it through these phases and

944
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,240
you're getting all of this information

945
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,780
and again we are seeing every week that

946
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:13,740
a lot of worse stuff goes through from

947
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:17,820
the user so this is same time scary and

948
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,280
and we'll create a lot more work for us

949
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,579
in the future also and here is the

950
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:25,920
detection part so basically we had the

951
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,560
SSL decryption on there so we are

952
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,020
getting the actual login information all

953
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,599
of the requests all of the files all the

954
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,480
request types and we can see that it

955
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,520
went through it checked that does it

956
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:43,140
have a kmsi on it didn't so it went into

957
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:46,140
the login phase and then it went through

958
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,119
the whole of the login login phase and

959
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:50,040
it these logs are not in the correct

960
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,619
order because the time stamping but it's

961
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:54,000
a bit delayed but it went through the

962
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,400
end oauth so basically I went through

963
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,260
the whole logging process and because I

964
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:01,500
know I have MFA that just happened so

965
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,540
here if we're trying to if we get an

966
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,220
information that there was this domain

967
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,200
that was bad we're looking at it we're

968
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,180
getting the actual requests we can see

969
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:11,099
that this user went through the whole

970
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:14,160
thing yeah so this is the Smoking Gun we

971
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,260
are sure that this account is

972
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,420
compromised and we can start them you

973
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,579
need it yes yeah you don't have to guess

974
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:22,500
yeah

975
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,720
and here is the same again if the demo

976
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,740
wasn't working

977
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:28,619
so basically uh what we are going to see

978
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:30,839
is the initial URI so we're gonna get

979
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:32,520
the actual ioc that we can for example

980
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,440
give to somebody else that there is this

981
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,260
kind of bad domain and this URI that is

982
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,000
going to in doing this type of spool

983
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,339
thing and we can do show Beyond the Door

984
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:44,400
that the MFA went through so there's

985
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,040
going to be the cookie also and now we

986
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,780
know who the sock has to bother with

987
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,940
actual changing credentials and going

988
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:54,260
through a security training again

989
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,619
so in summary

990
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:00,359
uh

991
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:02,700
it's really short yeah if you have to

992
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,680
pick get an 80 or it's it's way better

993
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,480
it's way wholesome you get way more

994
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,119
stuff okay it's not perfect but if you

995
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:11,579

996
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:12,480
value

997
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,060

1000
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,720

1001
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,359
