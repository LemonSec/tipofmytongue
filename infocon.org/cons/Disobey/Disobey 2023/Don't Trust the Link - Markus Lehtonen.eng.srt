1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,259
okay it's two o'clock uh hi everyone

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:06,359
it's nice to see that we have so many

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,160
people here already oh and even though

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,019
it's technically working hours but I

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,340
guess this this is where for most of you

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,020
my name is Marcus leton and the title of

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,840
of the talk is don't trust the link of

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,880
course and go through what I mean by

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,119
that uh first uh

10
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,240
I've been uh basically my job has been

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,939
for the past six years to work with a

12
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,260
sock in a sock uh in in different

13
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,500
roles I've been a engineer maintaining

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,440
the tools that we use in in the sock and

15
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,379
lately latest

16
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:45,480
role I had was managing the socking at

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,860
CGI and as you can see by the logos I I

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,239
work for CGI

19
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,800
this is also first time that I'm

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,320
speaking with a mic so let's see what

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,420
happens

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,199
uh quick very short introduction to uh

23
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,200
what I mean by URL scanning when I when

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,000
I talk about it in this speech so

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,040
scanning for suspicious or malicious or

26
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,400
normal URLs is part of modern Enterprise

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,939
security architecture it's a good tool

28
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,619
or a center to use to fight against

29
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:31,140
phishing emails for example so on the

30
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,500
incoming email there are sensors that

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,720
basically scan for all the links

32
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,820
contained in an Incoming Email if

33
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,400
there's something suspicious it's either

34
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,860
blocked or there's an alert raised for

35
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,979
the sock or for the company in general

36
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,399
you can do it also on the when when the

37
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,420
user has actually received the email so

38
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,860
there are patterns with these tools to

39
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,079
try to identify for example if the users

40
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,780
report

41
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,579
this incoming EMS as suspicious or

42
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,100
malicious or phishing emails

43
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,920
it might go through this type of URL

44
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,560
scanner tool and then tries to identify

45
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,840
again whether it's malicious taking into

46
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,940
account different sort of user reports

47
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,760
for example or also analysts use these

48
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,520
sort of tools to identify when when they

49
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,800
look for

50
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,599
malicious links try to identify whether

51
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,480
that's something that the company needs

52
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,480
actions on

53
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,160
there are also other points in the

54
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,860
architecture that you can scan these

55
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,739
tools for example HTTP proxies or so on

56
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:41,099
but I think this email protection thing

57
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,379
and analyzing the links there is quite

58
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:44,819
common nowadays for example with

59
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:46,500
Microsoft tools

60
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,080
one of the tools that you can use

61
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,379
for example with manual scans is

62
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,900
urlscan.io which is the main main tool

63
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,920
that this talk is going to talk about

64
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,160
so here is an example of a scanner a

65
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,440
scan has been made on Images slash

66
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,840
school.com

67
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,060
it's not the real Google site it's a

68
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,000
phishing site and then the scanner

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,420
outputs the results says that this

70
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,060
purchase fishing most likely or if it's

71
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,739
prepared for a phishing attack or

72
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,840
something like that alert is generated

73
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,420
the sock analyst block block the

74
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,220
accounts that have access to site and

75
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,420
and so on and so on

76
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,560
if you're using a public tool like

77
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,780
urlscan.io what can go wrong how can

78
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,659
things go wrong well if you're using a

79
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,239
tool that scans

80
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,040
URLs scans links

81
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,200
with a tool that that makes the results

82
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,599
of the scan public well now your link is

83
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:51,780
public or if you send your email to a

84
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,720
company or someone who's doing URL

85
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,739
scanning who's either inadvertently or

86
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,459
they don't know better the scans of the

87
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:04,739
uh the link scanning makes the results

88
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,620
public well now your link is public

89
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,439
before I go in examples of uh

90
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,580
interesting things where this went wrong

91
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,060
I'm not going to there are some I've

92
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,798
left out some of the details in these

93
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,019
examples the point is not to bash on the

94
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,180
companies that have had their data

95
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,720
leaked using the URL scan

96
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,520
platform it's most likely that the

97
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,080
companies themselves had nothing to do

98
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,199
with it if I send an email to you and

99
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,759
you make you basically leak the data to

100
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,100
the Internet it's not my fault even

101
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,440
though yes I could implement

102
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,540
additional protections if I take that

103
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,120
into account but it's in general

104
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,479
that's how I see it so the URL scan.io

105
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,540
is a tool you put your url there and the

106
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,919
default setting there is to perform

107
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,139
public scan public scan means that yes

108
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,300
the results are public

109
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,400
here's the screenshot of the previous

110
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,780
example

111
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,419
there's a search functionality there so

112
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:08,100
you can search all the previous results

113
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,500
it's good it's a nice tool for example

114
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,919
you can search for if you take this URL

115
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,259
you can go back in time see how this

116
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,060
site looked before there are certain

117
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,520
types of attack where yes it's first a

118
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,320
legitimate site and then becomes a

119
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,699
phishing site

120
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,100
so the searches has its functionalities

121
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,139
it's a good research tool as well

122
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,419
there's a live functionality it outputs

123
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,240
all the on incoming and basically the

124
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,979
ongoing live

125
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,440
scans it shows you screenshots of toast

126
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,620
just the Curiosity there's an API I

127
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,400
think it's actually a paid feature so

128
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,139
you can put you basically you have a

129
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,900
some sort of sensor that that you use to

130
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,020
analyze the links you can use the API to

131
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,120
basically put all of the

132
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,120
scans through this this tool and it

133
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,080
gives you the results automatically

134
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,479
one more interesting feature here is

135
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,259
that the site actually shows you whether

136
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:11,460
when somebody's had made the submission

137
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,000
for for the scan it shows you whether it

138
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,340
was done automatically I suppose to the

139
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,620
API

140
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,240
or or then it was done manually through

141
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,560
the URL scan UI

142
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,000
and so a couple of examples uh it's not

143
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,620
not the not the worst one I I suppose

144
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,680
there's an I I suppose it's an internal

145
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,639
fishing exercise and the link is he can

146
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,800
be found here here using the search

147
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,919
functionality uh

148
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:48,900
it's not that important what the

149
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,539
specific site was but perhaps this

150
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:54,479
shouldn't have been this isn't perhaps

151
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,699
some internal company phishing exercise

152
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:58,440
where the user if they click the link

153
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,740
and they get this nice

154
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,960
training and uh way

155
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,759
learning learning tool for how to

156
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,440
recognize phishing emails in the future

157
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,259
and don't do this again and so on so not

158
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,539
the I suppose not the worst one delete

159
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,000
and perhaps it's even good that maybe

160
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,340
somebody in the company

161
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,740
put

162
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,139
put a link here before actually clicking

163
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:24,660
it maybe so I don't know

164
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,120
and and no of course you cannot access

165
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,699
the actual emails here just the links

166
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,039
have leaked in the tool

167
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:35,940
another examples and also not not the

168
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,759
worst thing to leak but perhaps also not

169
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,759
something that should be available here

170
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,080
in the search there's a

171
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,080
login.microsoftonline.com

172
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:50,460
um link put into the to the URL scan

173
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,180
um

174
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,560
the outputs of the the scan reveal some

175
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,199
company this under that batch there

176
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,340
there's the company

177
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,520
photo there and there's a

178
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,660
autofilled basically

179
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,300
email address there for the for the

180
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,419
convenience of the user

181
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:16,139
and why this happens is uh whoever put

182
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:19,500
this just well they probably didn't know

183
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,379
that microsoftonline.com is a valid site

184
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:25,680
from Microsoft but also in the original

185
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,220
URL there's no personally identifiable

186
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,279
information there so just having the

187
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,380
link

188
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,599
they couldn't have known maybe they

189
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,279
should have known but they they didn't

190
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,500
know that

191
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,839
when putting data to it outputs

192
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:44,700
basically it generates this sort of

193
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,220
effective URL which is the

194
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,399
URL that you end up after a couple of

195
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,360
redirects there

196
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,160
another example that that did have a

197
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,680
real world effect maybe you cannot see

198
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,019
it that well but there's a this is

199
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:02,230
actually LinkedIn

200
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,380
[Music]

201
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,420
unsubscribe page it looks suspicious I

202
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,320
know but it's an actual unsubscribe link

203
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,060
when the scanner

204
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,940
did scan the email that contained many

205
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,279
of the links you know under the email

206
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,500
there's usually an unsubscribe link

207
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,140
there uh very convenient for you to

208
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,680
unsubscribe if you don't want those

209
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,380
nasty marketing mails from me LinkedIn

210
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,680
but perhaps this was inadvertent I would

211
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,279
say the least from from LinkedIn to have

212
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:39,240
no checks before before the link has oh

213
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,620
well then it's a good thing I don't know

214
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,600
depends how you look at it

215
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,720
from LinkedIn perspective not intended I

216
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,660
suppose and they might

217
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,459
start wondering why all of their

218
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:53,040
marketing image subscribers just

219
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,540
disappear

220
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,060
in the bulk

221
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,300
another example there's a company that

222
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,040
that has also a marketing email system

223
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,240
same thing

224
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,720
just by scanning the the link you get

225
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,480
you've immediately unsubscribed from the

226
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,940
marketing mails

227
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,180
interesting the same same issue here

228
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,580
that from the link if you can see it

229
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,580
there's a submitted URL there's no way

230
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,560
of knowing by just looking at the link

231
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,320
if you if you get that link on your

232
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,779
hands and and you want to scan it and

233
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:34,140
think that there's nothing uh private

234
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,360
there that would leak but there's

235
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,920
nothing that that would say that okay

236
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,180
this link ends up in a unsubscribe page

237
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,839
so it's just email dot company.com slash

238
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,480
some random

239
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,899
ID

240
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,980
then if we go it goes a bit further so

241
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,360
money companies implement this sort of

242
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,540
secure email system whereby you don't

243
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,640
send the actual contents what you want

244
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,380
to send to the user directly of course

245
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,380
but then you send a link to this or the

246
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,060
security image system sends you the link

247
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,579
to access the contents of the other

248
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:16,860
files or whatever you want to send in

249
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,420
this case it seems that there was a

250
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,579
company that implemented the secure Mail

251
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,700
system but then when the secure Mail

252
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,720
system realized that the receiver is not

253
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,120
registered this apparently a requirement

254
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,260
for the

255
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,600
uh receiver to be registered on the on

256
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,240
the system

257
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,860
it realized that they're not registered

258
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,760
and they can the system with sending the

259
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,820
the link to the secure me mail uh it

260
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,579
generated this sort of registration code

261
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:50,820
and what you end up is that in the tool

262
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,560
you can search for

263
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,260
some of these links that where you end

264
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,040
up is the actual you have the

265
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,420
registration link for that secure Mail

266
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,420
system sure it masks some values there

267
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,640
but I I don't know what happens when you

268
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,220
when you set your password and your

269
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,920
Challenge questions there at least some

270
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,899
some sort of

271
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,660
weirdness for for the end user or then

272
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,940
you get access to that all the contents

273
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,240
that that the sender sender has sent I

274
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,000
don't know I didn't obviously go go that

275
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,860
far

276
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,519
but also I would say not intended for

277
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,100
not the best way to implement that

278
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,620
system that then if that one of those

279
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,800
links is is revealed in some some for

280
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,140
another you end up with leaking the

281
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,019
contents of the secure mail here's one

282
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:45,920
example also that

283
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,620
perhaps some note this is a deltagon

284
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,200
secure Mail system and once you have the

285
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,740
link in this case it's a Finnish police

286
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,240
secure Mail system once you have the

287
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,540
link yourself just

288
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,720
set both the URL in the in the browser

289
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,920
bar

290
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,740
and access the site and

291
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,639
just click continue in this screen and

292
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,279
then you get access to the secure

293
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,320
contents of the mail

294
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,360
if somebody has used this deltagon

295
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,700
system before you know that there are

296
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,800
some additional protections here so if

297
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,680
somebody opens the link you cannot use

298
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,660
another IP address for opening the link

299
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,880
anymore so there are additional

300
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,519
protections to it but if you

301
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,680
basically if you're quick enough if the

302
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,100
end user is slow enough what you end up

303
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,260
is actually leaking the contents of the

304
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,420
mail or the security mail itself

305
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,019
a couple of more examples

306
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:52,440
here's an event invite for a European

307
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,079
Union agency

308
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,760
perhaps also not something that you want

309
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,620
to share outside the company or the

310
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,839
agency I don't know this looks very much

311
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,100
like an internal invite there's a

312
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,839
question whether you want your

313
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,600
participation to be reimbursed or not I

314
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,040
would guess an internal mail it's

315
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,320
already actually up and coming the

316
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,459
couple of weeks for for this this event

317
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:21,839
but I don't know and then when this all

318
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,540
actually goes wrong in effectually so

319
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,399
actually revealing the data that that

320
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,500
nothing

321
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,860
that you you don't want to leak here's

322
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,180
one of the one drive links that I found

323
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,339
it's contains some sort of legal

324
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,040
documents I have no idea what what they

325
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,680
are perhaps not something that you want

326
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,500
to share maybe this Republic I don't

327
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,540
know but in this case there is a

328
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,000
interesting

329
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,699
tenancy agreement that contains a whole

330
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:56,339
bunch of data that certainly is

331
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:58,320
something that that's confidential that

332
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,639
you don't want to lead

333
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:02,339
why these were leaked is because there's

334
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:03,560
a

335
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,139
functionality in in one drive where you

336
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,100
can just

337
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,620
generate a link and everyone who has

338
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,079
access to that link

339
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,300
can access the contents of the mail not

340
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,240
the best practice I would I would argue

341
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,220
so why is this an issue why are the

342
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,480
examples here here that I've shown

343
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,959
I would say that the kind of root issue

344
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,000
here is that these systems or users

345
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,519
haven't properly considered that just

346
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,360
sending a link via email is at most a

347
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,820
single Factor authentication well link

348
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,620
itself is just a single Factor

349
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,240
Authentication

350
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,760
so even if you implement secure Mail

351
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,620
system that doesn't contain this

352
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,459
sentence and you don't send the

353
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:57,500
super secret

354
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,339
government documents to the receiver by

355
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:03,899
mail itself

356
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,899
but if you lose lose the mail you lose

357
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,040
the link

358
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,339
and you lose the security of the

359
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:13,740
whatever you're trying to protect

360
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,380
possibly

361
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,940
also

362
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,100
um one thing I forgot to mention was

363
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,040
that in in for example in this Delta

364
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,459
consistent or or this one drives it's

365
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:28,940
just an option

366
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,279
there are other ways to to do it so in

367
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,260
in deltagon for example there is a

368
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,620
option for to enter the phone number of

369
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,860
the receiver and when you send the email

370
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,180
to the end user it forces you that the

371
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,820
reserve receiver to use second Factor

372
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:50,100
authentication sends you the text

373
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,699
message and then you input the password

374
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,620
there and so on

375
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,600
so

376
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,180
the same system it could have been sent

377
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,759
otherwise of course I think a lot of a

378
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,140
lot of people use OneDrive and

379
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,959
SharePoint and so on so there's also

380
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,720
option for you to

381
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,419
put the

382
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:13,980
receivers who you want to share this to

383
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,199
so you put the email address and then

384
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,780
most likely in one way or another it

385
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,579
forces you to authenticate using that

386
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,980
email address using the contents of you

387
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,959
have access to the email and so on it

388
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,880
forces you to authenticate before you

389
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,960
get access to the documents so

390
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,120
the systems have been configured or

391
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,480
developed in a way where it's optional

392
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,299
for you to provide additional security

393
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:42,240
there but

394
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,000
you cannot expect an average user to

395
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,039
understand what are the implications if

396
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,460
you don't use the optional features or

397
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,860
when in what case you should of course

398
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,720
it's more convenient to leave out the

399
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,360
second Factor authentication if you if

400
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,380
you ask the average user to do that so

401
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,140
how to avoid this

402
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,539
I don't think the single point of

403
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,220
failure there are multiple points of

404
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,980
failure here where the why the data has

405
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,200
leaked but there are multiple ways to

406
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,360
avoid this why not Implement all of them

407
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,520
so as a developer

408
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,620
you shouldn't include any sensitive data

409
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,299
in the URLs I think there are other

410
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:25,740
reasons to not do it than just this

411
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,460
but I think we're way past putting

412
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,299
Social Security numbers in uh HTTP get

413
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:36,299
request parameters and so on so for

414
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,160
these reasons and for other nice reasons

415
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,380
just don't include any sensitive data

416
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,720
there fishing ideas and so on that's

417
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,880
what you what you probably need to

418
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,799
include there but not clearly private

419
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,120
when you design these systems don't ever

420
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,919
assume that the average user knows to

421
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,020
add how to add security and we'll add

422
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,020
that security so for example the second

423
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,220
Factor authentication or any

424
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,980
authentication whatsoever anyway they

425
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,320
will just go

426
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,120
to kind of implement the minimum that

427
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,280
they need to get their work done

428
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,919
oh as always just model the threads and

429
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,020
take this example into account so this

430
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,500
can happen you can leak your link it

431
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,620
might not be in any any you might have

432
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,740
had no no control of of the link being

433
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,179
leaked

434
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,780
so in these examples I showed you those

435
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,240
were the failed ones but there were so

436
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,000
many of of properly implemented systems

437
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,640
where you can see that you cannot access

438
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,919
to the data because of for example

439
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,320
timeouts so the link is active 10

440
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,260
minutes or so if you have a logging

441
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,720
system that implements the sort of email

442
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,020
login so password is login timeout for

443
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,820
for depending on the system

444
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,000
I know my favorite food delivery app for

445
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,400
example does that so it might be fine

446
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,640
you might take that risk just implement

447
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,440
the time out there second Factor

448
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,840
authentication sending someone the data

449
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,419
it's always a good idea so for example

450
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:08,400
that uh

451
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,559
Delta connect sample there

452
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,440
wouldn't have any effect if not if there

453
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,120
was a second factor of the duration

454
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,980
implemented there

455
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,679
most it would be the best to implement

456
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,900
that second factor out of band so not

457
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,940
using the email but

458
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,140
using

459
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,059
you know SMS message or something like

460
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,880
that but there are good systems that do

461
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,280
it by IML as well

462
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,860
not the best way not the best one I I

463
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,039
think but bot protection so preventing

464
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,720
this sort of system from automatically

465
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,020
scanning the site

466
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,940
not not the best way to to protect your

467
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,580
data there but at least it would have

468
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,039
prevented this specific

469
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:53,700
example from from having an effect

470
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,380
of course

471
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,080
um as a security professional

472
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,360
a lot of those examples that I showed

473
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,640
you are

474
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,520
they have been scanned using the manual

475
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,440
scan option so somebody put that link

476
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,700
there

477
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,080
and uh I know that oftentimes it might

478
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,880
be even a security profit a

479
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,059
professionals that have

480
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:21,179
are leaking this data and there's actual

481
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,460
related research to this that shows

482
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,380
shows that that's the case so always

483
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,480
remember operational security and so on

484
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:33,860
and don't don't you use the tools wisely

485
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,299
and as a security manager I would I

486
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:38,039
would say that if you're responsible for

487
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:41,460
the data in your company or or also

488
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,159
invest in threat hunting or or hunting

489
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,799
for this data in in different sources

490
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,200
so even though it might not be your

491
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,000
fault that the data has leaked it might

492
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,500
be your problem

493
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,960
uh when your data is there or your end

494
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,840
user's data is leaked in a

495
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,400
similar manner it might might be a

496
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,620
it might prepare to your company as well

497
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,440
so there's no way to prevent your data

498
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,960
from being leaked uh

499
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,600
if you find it fast enough you alert

500
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,400
your users you're responsible in that

501
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,280
manner it's just perhaps even good PR

502
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,100
oud obviously there's a problem there so

503
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:28,159
private data is leaking on a public site

504
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,860
obviously when I did this looked at this

505
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,840
information and do these searches

506
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,760
obviously I reported the confidential

507
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,340
information or private information

508
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,320
either using the URL scan there's a

509
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,659
report option so it actually when you

510
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:45,059
report it it immediately takes it down

511
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,340
and and there's a manual review Taking a

512
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,539
couple of days

513
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:51,600
none of these examples are are there

514
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,120
anymore

515
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,500
some in some examples I actually

516
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,240
reported the finding directly to the

517
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,700
site owners but there's so much data and

518
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,559
you don't know where where the league

519
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:04,200
came from so that's not if it wasn't the

520
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,860
most effective way to do it

521
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,260
URL scan is aware that there is a leak

522
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,179
and there are

523
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:13,980
disclosures unintended information

524
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,039
disclosures uh the site and they say

525
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,140
that it's basically the nature of how

526
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,179
things work how how the platform is

527
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,460
operating

528
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,600
basically they live by

529
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,179
users using the site putting the links

530
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,659
there so they're taking the risk they

531
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:36,620
have done things so for example

532
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,679
I first looked at this a couple of

533
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,900
searches couple of years ago back then

534
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,919
you could actually get for example teams

535
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,299
meetings up and coming teams meeting

536
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:50,400
meetings with no authentication you

537
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,380
could search that there that score now

538
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,740
so you cannot put your team's links

539
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,320
there anymore that's a good thing but

540
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,480
there are still a lot of data there

541
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:06,419
various related research to this so back

542
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,400
in November

543
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,320
the secretary Richard called Fabian

544
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,400
brownline did similar searches and found

545
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,220
that there were a lot of leaks of the

546
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,520
data and he went so far as to look for

547
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,940
where this data was leaked so he

548
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,039
actually conducted a couple of companies

549
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:30,059
that he suspected were responsible for

550
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:33,299
of the bollock of the data in the tool

551
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:35,700
what I've seen is I I've done this

552
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,179
before these searches before this result

553
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,640
was published what I see is that

554
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,640
nowadays A lot of the inadvertent

555
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,380
disclosures have been originated from

556
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,640
the

557
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,600
manual scans and not the automated scans

558
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,980
this basically took down a lot of the

559
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,320
automated scans so there were he found

560
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,020
actually that there were a lot of

561
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,539
security tools and sensors which were

562
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,880
misconfigured and to put all the links

563
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,600
there and and basically the settings

564
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,320
uh for for those uh scan scans were

565
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,840
always made made public

566
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,720
I forgot to show you this so they have a

567
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,460
guide

568
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,880
to say that public if you

569
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,580
use the setting public scan then the

570
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,500
results are public and if you use the

571
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,940
private that they are private and that's

572
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,179
what they're basically doing

573
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:32,460
to to avert this but I would say that

574
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,059
it's not it hasn't been effective I this

575
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:38,299
point

576
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,439
that's it thanks
