[Music]

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,000
thank you

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:33,079
[Music]

4
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:35,480
thank you

5
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:42,660
[Applause]

6
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,020
don't mind the air gap what it is all

7
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,260
about

8
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,100
first of all terminology my talk is

9
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,620
called maximizing exploitation speeds

10
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,660
over HDMI Tempest

11
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,579
and I made it up

12
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,920
so that I would sound smart

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,600
and um

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,720
yes let's start with HDMI this is the

15
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,299
DisplayPort connection

16
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,280
or display connection let's be more

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,439
specific that my laptop is also

18
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,479
connected to

19
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:17,159
it's very common

20
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,759
Tempest means

21
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,740
some kind of unintended radio emanations

22
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,159
from electrical devices but can be used

23
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,020
for nefarious purposes

24
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,580
and air gap

25
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,180
here with Eric I just mean that um

26
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,299
that there is a literal air gap we don't

27
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,640
have a cable or we don't even have a

28
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,159
radio connection to the device the dark

29
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,960
Target device

30
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,240
and exfiltration

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,240
it means secretly transmitting

32
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,840
information out of some system

33
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,880
so what is the combination

34
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,860
what is going to be expected

35
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,340
um

36
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,799
I will first give some background about

37
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,179
what is it

38
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,640
about HDMI that makes it vulnerable to

39
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,959
10 best

40
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,520
and I'll then tell you how I designed

41
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,660
um

42
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,020
low level protocol let's say

43
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,580
unidirectional protocol to transmit

44
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,660
information

45
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,420
using this vulnerability

46
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,540
we'll discuss some results how far

47
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,840
can I make this connection and

48
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,920
how fast it can transmit bits

49
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,360
and finally I

50
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,180
discuss some practical applications

51
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,959
maybe nefarious or not and then let's

52
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,580
discuss

53
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,519
what could be better about this and how

54
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,160
you could be protected from it

55
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,580
uh who am I I'm a software developer as

56
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,580
a profession I mostly

57
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,160
right I've been writing um

58
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,060
stuff related to real-time systems

59
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,180
networks on the osc layer one especially

60
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,879
and yeah C plus plus

61
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,260
stuff

62
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,420
but at night time I sometimes

63
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,400
investigate Mysteries

64
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,180
especially related to signals and that's

65
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,760
that's what I enjoy I write a blog about

66
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,900
it

67
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,180
in this address

68
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,300
and yeah that's all about me

69
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,700
so I would like to begin with a story

70
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,440
how did I end up researching this thing

71
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,720
so I was listening to

72
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,599
some radio broadcast I was supposed to

73
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:45,420
blank all of these bookmarks here but

74
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,220
please don't look at them

75
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,379
um and

76
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,180
on some frequencies that I like to

77
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,580
listen to there was some kind of noise

78
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,420
it was really irritating me and uh

79
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,360
I wanted to find out why this happens

80
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,060
and it always happens at my home

81
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,280
so it must come from some of my devices

82
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,560
probably

83
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,319
and I listened to this because in this

84
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,420
software you can listen to anything

85
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,640
and it kind of

86
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,298
sounded like you know if you had if

87
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:21,298
you're old enough to have had the 8-Bit

88
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,900
Nintendo as a child

89
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,340
it has

90
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,520
it has two parts for audio and video and

91
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,160
especially for a child it's very easy to

92
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,479
mistake

93
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:36,000
one for the other so sometimes I would

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,720
actually plug the audio cable that goes

95
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,259
in our stereo to this video

96
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,860
sockets and there was a very

97
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,199
let's say

98
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,919
very uh the sound was very similar to

99
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,060
this one

100
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,419
so I I was kind of wondering could this

101
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:00,900
be video but why on Earth would there be

102
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,400
video

103
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,860
at my home video transmission

104
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,220
is there a camera somewhere maybe

105
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,740
unfortunately what we had I had audio

106
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,240
here but

107
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,460
we had some technical issues with the

108
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,740
HDMI connection that was supposed to

109
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,520
play the audio so unfortunately there is

110
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,220
no audio now but you can imagine kind of

111
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,320
a z sound

112
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,919
okay

113
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,020
well with played actually I guess if you

114
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,900
play it without sound it kind of goes as

115
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,479
fast as the processor can take

116
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,500
so I made a plot a two-dimensional plot

117
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,820
of this

118
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,039
signal

119
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:47,039
here on the right side you see kind of

120
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,860
the voltage level of the signal

121
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,600
and

122
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,580
the voltage is the vertical actions and

123
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,720
the time instead horizontal axis

124
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,699
and on the left you can see kind of a

125
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:02,820
Fourier transform of the frequencies and

126
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,560
this happened to be exactly 60 hertz so

127
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,820
yes it

128
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,460
does indeed it sound like some kind of

129
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,380
uh video signal

130
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,100
Maybe

131
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,900
this speaks could be the frame start

132
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,960
because they happen once every 60th of a

133
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,039
second

134
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,800
and then in between

135
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,020
this very low level noise

136
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,639
maybe it is the video

137
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,020
and what happened was

138
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,840
so I took all of those

139
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,360
little noisy things and I took the

140
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,419
amplitude of those samples and I plotted

141
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,780
it as a as an image and indeed it looks

142
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,299
like one of my computer's desktops

143
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,380
so this is actually a very old

144
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,319
thing it has been known for at least 20

145
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,340
years

146
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,160
there is this Fable that I always refer

147
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,639
to by Marcus

148
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,020
so

149
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,599
actually it was even before HDMI it was

150
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,000
before

151
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,520
digital displays even

152
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,460
all kind of Teddy's Place emanates some

153
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,979
sort of signals that have a correlation

154
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:38,719
to what is on the screen

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,080
but HDMI is a digital so

156
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,759
how can you see that with like an analog

157
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,460
analog kind of receiver

158
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,460
I'm sorry about the next slide I just

159
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,380
got really carried about with blender

160
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,740
but I wanted to show that it's very

161
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,500
complicated how HDMI encodes the colors

162
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,139
to these 10 bit characters so there is

163
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:06,960
no nuclear one-to-one mapping between

164
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,400
them

165
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,460
and it kind of does an xor there next

166
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,699
door there and it chooses between those

167
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:16,139
and

168
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:18,120
based on some rules and it then it

169
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,460
inverts the bits if their statistical

170
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,819
properties are not perfect

171
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:28,259
and we get these 10 bit words and for

172
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:32,580
somehow each of these 10-bit words has a

173
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,360
kind of a difference amplitude in radio

174
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,479
but this is not like a direct mapping

175
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,820
you can't see grayscales

176
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,800
you can't see colors of course

177
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,779
so what I did I went through all of the

178
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,839
colors yes all of the colors because my

179
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,180
display only has 16 bit colors so it's

180
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,800
there is 65 000 something colors

181
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,120
and here's a small part of it

182
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,600
and I tested each color with one scan

183
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,700
line of the color and see what kind of

184
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,100
amplitude we get

185
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,440
and with this method I was

186
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,820
kind of

187
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,820
able to encode my own

188
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,180
kind of images basically to make

189
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,080
grayscale Transmissions using this thing

190
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,420
we have a little demo video here but it

191
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,420
goes by way too quickly for some reason

192
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,580
technical issues

193
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,160
oh

194
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,680
just a minute uh

195
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,320
I really want to play this video but

196
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,540
ah foreign

197
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,199
anyway

198
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,620
let's see if this fast forward looks

199
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,920
like anything

200
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,060
oh perfect perfect thank you HDMI um

201
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,580
I have the display running on the left

202
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,580
here and I'm using

203
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,339
my color map that I just showed

204
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:14,459
to basically send like one bit animation

205
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:17,760
over it over this

206
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,740
beer basically

207
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:22,260
what I have there is my directional

208
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,180
antenna and you see when I'm turning it

209
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,180
around the colors kind of invert so it's

210
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,760
not even very stable the mapping it

211
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,800
depends on many things I don't even know

212
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,260
what it depends on

213
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,380
but how could we use this for

214
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,860
transmitting something ourselves I mean

215
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,040
this is just some very noisy distorted

216
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,839
stuff

217
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,060
could we make some sort of protocol

218
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,800
that's

219
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,980
you would use the colors

220
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,880
transmit bits

221
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,579
the problem is that

222
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:59,640
I don't know the like the absolute

223
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,199
amplitude what it's supposed to be

224
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,519
what I came up with was

225
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,480
I could have two stripes on the screen

226
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,579
and the difference in amplitude between

227
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:14,399
one and the other stripe

228
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,940
bookmark bits

229
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,579
and yeah this

230
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,640
seems to work I did it vertically

231
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,200
because

232
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,060
in the horizontal Direction there is

233
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,180
some kind of Echo and

234
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,779
some low pass filtering I guess my radio

235
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:36,360
isn't that good so I thought maybe the

236
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,760
vertical direction would be better

237
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,700
and it actually is

238
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,360
on top of this basic simple

239
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,480
one big thing I started building like a

240
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,440
protocol

241
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,040
whoops

242
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,040
so I want to have it error protected so

243
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,440
that it's reliable we can send reliable

244
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,740
information

245
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,860
let's divide the data into packets first

246
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,019
we could add some Header information to

247
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:13,079
these packets at least the position in

248
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:15,480
the file so we know where to put it in

249
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,420
the final file that we are sending

250
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,160
and of course because this is a very

251
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,420
noisy connection

252
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,700
we want to add some forward error

253
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,200
correction

254
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,959
so basically we just add

255
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,600
more bits into the Stream

256
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,399
so that's

257
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,260
a kind of exchange bandwidth for

258
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,640
reliability

259
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,040
then for each packet we add a CRC which

260
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,360
is a checksum

261
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,760
with this we can be sure that the packet

262
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,860
was received intact

263
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,779
then one more thing we can add a

264
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,339
preamble in the beginning so that we

265
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,560
know where to start

266
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,720
receiving so where the information

267
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,500
starts

268
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,060
and because this is video we can even

269
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,540
repeat every frame to get even more

270
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,880
reliability

271
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,440
so if

272
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,300
receiver doesn't get it the first time

273
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,240
it can integrate

274
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,740
from two frames and then

275
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:21,300
we get some better signal

276
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,300
it causes some overhead here is a

277
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,820
illustration of the overhead

278
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,700
but I mean it's it's doable

279
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,220
it's doable

280
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,200
so they run from

281
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,440
up to down

282
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,339
there my display happens to be 768 high

283
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:45,000
so I made 768 packets so I can nicely

284
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,380
put them

285
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,519
next to one another

286
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,579
here we see what it looks like in real

287
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:54,720
life

288
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,180
this is kind of uh

289
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,459
I kind of made a bad decision with this

290
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:00,839
vertical thing

291
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,360
for many different reasons one of them

292
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,040
is that the cash

293
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,040
kind of I get a lot of cash misses when

294
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,839
I process this data because the

295
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,060
processor has to jump up and down and

296
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,680
left to right

297
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,420
in the memory

298
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,079
and there's one more kind of an

299
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:21,360
irritating thing the Raspberry Pi 4 that

300
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,899
I was using it doesn't really play

301
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:29,100
nicely with v-sync videos so

302
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,420
there is a bad bad tearing effect and it

303
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,540
whenever there is steering

304
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,060
it always goes straight through the

305
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,880
image horizontally and breaks each like

306
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,560
every packet so I get zero data at all

307
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,000
So eventually later I redesigned it

308
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,579
and made it horizontal but here's how it

309
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:56,220
looks like on my receiver

310
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,440
so I have like a

311
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,100
receiver software which this kind of

312
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,519
1980s plasma screen Aesthetics

313
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,720
and

314
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,300
it's specialized for this purpose it's

315
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,560
running on this little laptop here

316
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,760
so I'm just a Macbook M1

317
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,000
pretty much single thread and I use a

318
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,199
small

319
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:25,680
radio receiver called airspy

320
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,459
and then this huge antenna that gives me

321
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,320
a lot of directionality

322
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,920
and because I got it for free

323
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,740
so what kind of distances can we send

324
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,660
these packets

325
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,100
here

326
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,260
I got carried around I carried away with

327
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,060
blender again

328
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,920
here's my room

329
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,399
I put the receiver on the table

330
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,920
at the top

331
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,079
the Raspberry Pi and the HDMI display

332
00:15:55,079 --> 00:16:00,120
are in another room behind a closed door

333
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,820
and with this setup I was able to get

334
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,880
200 kilobits per second

335
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,839
using threes method

336
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,720
there is of course a lot of packet loss

337
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,320
but we can do some tricks to kind of

338
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,720
alleviate that for example we can repeat

339
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,420
things or we can add more error

340
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,339
correction

341
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:27,680
if the packet loss ever gets too bad

342
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,899
so of course I got a little obsessed

343
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:34,560
with putting us many bits through as

344
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,320
possible

345
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,540
how much can we get

346
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,940
with this vertical

347
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,759
setup I was able to get about half a

348
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,980
megabits

349
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,740
per second in the same room

350
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,620
here we have like three different kinds

351
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,480
of measures for the speed that's the

352
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,180
total speed which is how many bits my

353
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,639
program is reading from the screen

354
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:01,560
and then how many of those bits are

355
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,540
actually from new packets

356
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,579
that were never seen before

357
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:09,240
and then how many of those are something

358
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,119
else than CRC or error correction so

359
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,859
that number is

360
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,900
half a megabits

361
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,459
but

362
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:20,760
can we get a million

363
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,160
Maybe

364
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,099
I applied some optimizations

365
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,720
so

366
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,820
first of all

367
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,260
I did the horizontal thing so

368
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,240
packets now run horizontally

369
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,860
we get a megabit per second

370
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,600
and

371
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,500
now I can give this a name this protocol

372
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,900
I call it Mac feast

373
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,940
which is megabit connection for exfil

374
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,520
trading all secret tokens

375
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,640
yes very useful

376
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,539
and very much

377
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,760
but with all of this I kind of made a

378
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,039
huge assumption I made the assumption

379
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:09,240
that

380
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,059
we already have some kind of way to

381
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,140
control

382
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,600
what is displayed on the screen

383
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,720
of course if it's an air gap system

384
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,380
you can't really do that or can you

385
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,140
I try to brainstorm some ideas maybe

386
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,179
you're a good

387
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:29,880
embed some bits in the raw video files

388
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,400
if it's a system Place video files

389
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,600
if it's some kind of a system that loads

390
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,660
images or textures from disk such as

391
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,919
Maybe

392
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,440
like an information screen maybe you

393
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,039
could somehow tamper with those

394
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,020
I'm not sure

395
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,600
maybe you could tamper with the

396
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,460
screensaver because screensavers are

397
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,039
known to contain all kinds of wacky

398
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,679
Graphics so nobody nobody will buy an

399
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,059
eye if there is

400
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,340
a little bit of Tempest exploration

401
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:06,179
going on or maybe the boot splash

402
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,100
because this thing can

403
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,020
in optimal conditions

404
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,080
one frame can contain I would say two

405
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,380
and a half kilo bytes kilobits circular

406
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,260
bytes per data of data so

407
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,000
you don't need

408
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,860
to keep it there very long if you can

409
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,260
compress your data very well

410
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,780
and of course you could maybe come up

411
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,360
with some way to access the raw pixels

412
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,080
on the screen

413
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,720
but as you saw the red screen kind of

414
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,539
looks pretty

415
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:41,820
conspicuous let's say how could we hide

416
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,059
it well we could for example

417
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,280
slightly modify the picture on the

418
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,559
screen for example here is a familiar

419
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,120
picture to some

420
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,700
windows screen saver that has been

421
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,600
modified to add about two kilobits

422
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,299
of this data

423
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,400
if you look very closely we can see that

424
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,100
there is some some level of horizontal

425
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,559
blur but it's not very visible or far

426
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:08,340
away

427
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,940
and if you just send it for one frame

428
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,240
I mean it's just another glitch

429
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,640
nobody cares

430
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,799
what are some obligations that we could

431
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,400
use this for

432
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,919
file transfer

433
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,320
we could transfer some kind of a file

434
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,820
that knows

435
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,740
that it has been

436
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,400
received completely

437
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,179
for example zip files they have their

438
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:43,700
own CRC in the end or in the beginning

439
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,280
but now we come to one of those

440
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,620
downsides of this method

441
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,780
there is no return Channel you cannot

442
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,940
request package

443
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,440
again

444
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,320
if you happen to lose one

445
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,840
so transmitting big files is kind of a

446
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,640
difficult thing you have to wait for the

447
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,160
repeat if there is a repeat and that can

448
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,500
take some time

449
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,480
yeah packet loss can be difficult to

450
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,700
deal with

451
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,580
when you have files

452
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,860
well what about some streaming data like

453
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,380
audio and video I mean

454
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,640
audio

455
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,919
doesn't need that many bits per second

456
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:24,900
you you can

457
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:30,059
transfer high quality music at 160 kbps

458
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:32,580
and video

459
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,100
you would think it needs a lot of bits

460
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,440
per second but

461
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,340
does it really I mean 500 maybe you

462
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,559
could put some video through

463
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:46,559
or you could put some static screenshots

464
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,120
if you're ever

465
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,720
taking a look at what the teams desktop

466
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,080
share does in the network

467
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,059
it doesn't use that much

468
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,240
um bandwidth I guess there is a pretty

469
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,960
good comparison for this screen size

470
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,600
and this kind of streaming

471
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,240
streaming types of data are pretty far

472
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,820
giving towards packet loss because you

473
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,500
can just ignore it in your mind if one

474
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,440
frame is missing or a piece of audio is

475
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,780
missing

476
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,220
and indeed

477
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,640
just this morning I did something

478
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,860
related to this I hope this video

479
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,480
doesn't play through

480
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,299
in one second

481
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:39,139
it does

482
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,780
I started as many times as okay I want

483
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,340
to warn you that there is some like

484
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,980
flickering imagery so

485
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,980
just so you know here is the display in

486
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,880
my room

487
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,620
and

488
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,140
here is what I was

489
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,620
doing still this morning

490
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,360
we have to tune it to the frequency

491
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,320
first and get the PLL right hey look

492
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,039
who's there

493
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,179
so this is an MJ big stream at two

494
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:15,000
frames per second and all error

495
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,520
corrected and everything running

496
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,440
just from the HDMI cable

497
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,459
yes

498
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,039
what are some other uses maybe key

499
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,120
logger

500
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,320
if we use a huge amount of bits for

501
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,840
the error correction and the other

502
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,419
stability and

503
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:47,100
other stuff

504
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,280
we could use this for very reliable key

505
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,500
logging and it doesn't leave a trace so

506
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,620
it doesn't leave a log in the computer

507
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,140
basically just could transmit some

508
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,480
Blitz here

509
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,700
maybe even delayed so the user doesn't

510
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,900
see that it's actually logging keys

511
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,480
I come I came up with one

512
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,820
sort of wholesome or good idea like

513
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,700
maybe we could use it to debug games

514
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,340
I mean every scan line is kind of

515
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,039
imprinted with some kind of code so with

516
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,620
the radio you could see how many of

517
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,200
those scan lines end up in wrong frames

518
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,780
and if there is issues with the vertical

519
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,620
synchronization

520
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,740
as I already discussed it's not a

521
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,200
perfect protocol for transmitting just

522
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,940
anything

523
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,580
it's easily broken video compressed and

524
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,580
probably breaks it I haven't tested you

525
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,600
are tearing on Raspberry y4 brexit

526
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,299
maybe we even have to know the exact

527
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:56,039
video

528
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,320
sort of specifications the frame rates

529
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,720
even the color space

530
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,720
to be able to reliably choose the colors

531
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,720
which we use and

532
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,659
but yeah and the frequency that I'm

533
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:11,340
listening to

534
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,340
it's not even

535
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,460
reserved to anything like there's a

536
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,460
there could be something else

537
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,799
that is not compatible with our receipt

538
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,820
reception so yes how could we protect

539
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,700
ourselves with this kind this sort of

540
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,000
attack well HDMI is a pretty old

541
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,260
protocol and already in 2.0

542
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,659
10 years ago they added

543
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:42,419
trembling which means that they add a

544
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,400
pseudonym pseudorandom

545
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,520
sequence of numbers

546
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,620
and this is

547
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,580
like the primary reason is to minimize

548
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,980
electromagnetic interference

549
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,559
and it not only kind of encrypts it but

550
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,840
it also to my understanding the whole

551
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,940
signal kind of disappears from

552
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,360
from Radio because it loses the

553
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,820
repeatability kind of

554
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:12,299
that makes it a signal basically

555
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:14,580
and in this play part this has been a

556
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,900
thing since

557
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,900
2006.

558
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,799
I also came up with some silly

559
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,220
mitigations

560
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,840
what about

561
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,640
what about this

562
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,480
[Applause]

563
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,340
yeah it's very impractical I would say

564
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,880
and also maybe a slight fire hazard I

565
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,140
would imagine

566
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,260
and then somebody told me about

567
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:47,039
chicken wire well whatever chicken wire

568
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,580
um well you can see through it but

569
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,000
I tested this and there was no effect no

570
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,700
effect maybe the cable could be wrapped

571
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,320
in

572
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,679
in tin foil and then we could draft the

573
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,299
monitor

574
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:06,480
with chicken wire or maybe we could put

575
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,919
the user

576
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,140
in a cage

577
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,980
I'm not sure

578
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:18,299
the chicken wire is not grounded and I

579
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:20,700
was also made aware that this might be a

580
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,059
problem with the thing but

581
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,640
this was as far as I was willing to go

582
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,059
with chicken wire and electronics at my

583
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,620
home

584
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,380
so I was kind of worried of grounding

585
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,320
stuff that might be accidentally

586
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,679
connected to mains

587
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:44,520
what are some main takeaways HDMI one is

588
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,799
very loud in the radio

589
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,460
and kind of insecure if you if you care

590
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,220
about that sort of stuff

591
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,440
but I mean if you're aware of it then

592
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:59,520
not a problem

593
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,940
this is somewhat of a surprising side

594
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,279
effect I mean I wouldn't think that

595
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,220
pictures of my screen are transmitted

596
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,419
away

597
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:11,940
but the more you know

598
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,580
we also learned that Raspberry Pi Pi 4

599
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,460
cannot properly do v-sync so I might

600
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,919
have to use the previous generation

601
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,440
yeah telephone hats are really warm

602
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,240
I actually made several pieces of

603
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,880
clothing out of tin foil and it's really

604
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,240
hot

605
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,678
thank you very much

606
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:49,320
I finished so fast that I have time for

607
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,919
audience questions and we have a

608
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,200
microphone guy there and

609
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,799
yes

610
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,340
okay thanks nice talk thank you for it

611
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,460
uh it seems that you made all the tests

612
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,100
with the same monitor

613
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,320
have you tried like is it how much it

614
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,720
depends on the exact same monitor or is

615
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,559
it

616
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,820
how if you just saying change it is it

617
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,899
still like I did this in disobey 2018

618
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:28,140
maybe I came here with the big antenna

619
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,779
and I pointed it everywhere and

620
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:33,480
from everywhere I could like spot

621
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,760
another display another display another

622
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,279
display if I just use the full HD

623
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:41,039
because this wasn't full HD so if I do

624
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,080
need to run after full HD frequency I

625
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,460
could find those

626
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,200
so

627
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,659
I think pretty much every display is

628
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:51,200
vulnerable

629
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,500
all right thanks so if you know the

630
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,700
Scrambler

631
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,159
um like like whatever random mesh

632
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:01,740
sequence it has like can you then dig up

633
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,679
the signal like in style of CDMA or

634
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:06,419
something I I think it's pretty

635
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:09,720
difficult because scrambling also

636
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,880
makes the whole signal disappear because

637
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,120
the like repeating structure is lost so

638
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,940
we don't have the like this all is based

639
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,039
on the pixel clock

640
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:21,840
but we have

641
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,020
for some reason the pixel clock is

642
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,720
radiating very strongly and we can

643
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,760
see the pixel clock in radio and then

644
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,380
this pixel block

645
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,899
somehow modulated with the brightness

646
00:30:38,779 --> 00:30:42,899
it has been some days since you posted

647
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:46,140
in the window then blog uh that's fine

648
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:50,760
but uh can you indulge us as to what

649
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,059
might be the next post about if any or

650
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:56,640
are you still wondering about it I have

651
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,120
maybe three concurrent projects

652
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,000
one of them is this and maybe I will

653
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,299
post something who knows because I would

654
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,159
really like to make like a proper

655
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,500
write-up of all of this

656
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,700
and yeah I have all kinds of

657
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,059
let's say using surprising things for

658
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:20,640
networking

659
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,120
ideas

660
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,799
any more questions or

661
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,100
we have a question there

662
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,460
um have you found out what is the source

663
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,039
of the signal leak in a monitor is it

664
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,580
the monitor itself cable

665
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,179
combination

666
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:03,720
sorry I'm not hearing this at all

667
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,880
um maybe I'll talk louder is it better

668
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,279
now I think the monitors are not on I'll

669
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:10,440
try this

670
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,700
for now

671
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,700
okay any better yeah okay

672
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,740
um have you found the source of the

673
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,740
emission from the monitor cable or the

674
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,240
monitor itself

675
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,539
no so I've tried to wrap

676
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:28,260
either the cable or the display to tin

677
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:31,020
foil or whatever but neither of those

678
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,419
had any effect so I don't know where it

679
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:34,799
will be coming on

680
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,799
I heard that there are HDMI cables that

681
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:41,340
somehow use Optical fibers

682
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,860
so I might try that next if I use an

683
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,320
optical fiber it cannot possibly be the

684
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,380
cable yeah if it's really that but it

685
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,140
could be also the display card

686
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,200
but maybe one thing that occurred in my

687
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,140
mind if it's the monitor or if it's the

688
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,620
cable maybe you could or if somebody is

689
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,260
smart enough to write the code send a

690
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,539
screen server or screen off command at

691
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:08,520
the beginning of the video stream you're

692
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,020
trying to pick up

693
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,120
so you could blank the screen before

694
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,340
actually transmitting the signal that is

695
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,799
true that is true yeah

696
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,460
thank you

697
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,779
I've actually heard better this

698
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:32,760
have you tested it with KVM or like yeah

699
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,159
no I've only tested with direct

700
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:38,000
connection from laptop or

701
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,399
desktop is and all of these adapters

702
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:44,178
yeah

703
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,279
okay

704
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:53,159
okay

705
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:55,260

706
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:59,419
