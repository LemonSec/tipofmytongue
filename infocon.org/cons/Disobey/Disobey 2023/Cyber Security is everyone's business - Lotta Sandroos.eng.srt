1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,359
hello everyone and um welcome to my talk

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:08,519
which is titled cyber security it's

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,099
everyone's business how should we talk

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,799
about cyber to home users and why is

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,859
this important

6
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:19,080
so first a little bit about myself

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,080
like you so already my name is Andrews

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,220
and um as the academics always like our

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,920
titles so I'm a master of social

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,159
sciences with major in political science

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,800
and master of science with the major in

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,300
cyber security

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,200
and this talk is based on my Master's

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,320
thesis that was titled cyber security is

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,700
everyone's business

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,559
framing in the information security

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,440
communication targeted at private

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,620
individuals and this thesis was written

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,219
as a part of my cyber security studies

20
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,800
in University of uvascular and it was

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,519
published in 2021 so last year

22
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,760
my background is is basically in comms

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,900
I have done many things comes

24
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,680
I've I've been working in day-to-day

25
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,000
communication or roles in in

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,640
governmental organizations and I've been

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,680
working in cyber security awareness

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,400
related roles in the private sector

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,860
but I think that's enough about me and

30
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,400
let's go straight to the topic

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
so um

32
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,860
what is one of the most common ways to

33
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,920
break into a system or gain access to

34
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,640
sensitive information

35
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,920
social engineering or exploiting the

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,659
human era

37
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,479
it is often said that humans are the

38
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,600
weakest link in cyber security

39
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,799
it is true that people make mistakes but

40
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:01,320
isn't it a little bit unfair to

41
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,079
hold people accountable and at the same

42
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,040
time

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,320
not even give them

44
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,318
the education training and support that

45
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,020
they need when they try to avoid making

46
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,540
these mistakes

47
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,300
we could say that on a societal level

48
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,239
cyber security is in a way a possible

49
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:24,300
that consists of different pieces

50
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,360
one of those pieces would be the cyber

51
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,680
security in organizations or workplaces

52
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,319
and another piece could be the cyber

53
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,220
security of Ordinary People

54
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,280
the home users

55
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,860
and in previous research

56
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,200
the focus is mainly being on the

57
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,319
organizational aspect of cyber security

58
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,599
there's been a lot of research about

59
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,440
cyber security behavior in workplaces

60
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,700
for example about compliance which means

61
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:04,019
how well people the employees follow the

62
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,300
rules and guidelines at place in their

63
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,340
workplaces

64
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,120
in research there's been much less

65
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,459
attention about cyber security behavior

66
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:17,900
of Home users

67
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,920
yet we can see that home users face more

68
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,560
and more cyber threats

69
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,379
they can get scammed they can get hacked

70
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,840
they can get phishing emails

71
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,980
and home users can often get scared

72
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,640
I'm confused about what they should do

73
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,340
and well who can blame them

74
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,480
because

75
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,360
they don't often get sufficient cyber

76
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,599
security education

77
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,379
so if we truly want to be more cyber

78
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:59,340
secure and cyber resilient Society

79
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,000
we can't forget the home users

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,599
all the pieces are needed for this cyber

81
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:10,080
security puzzle to be complete

82
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,000
the trick here is

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,900
that the home users need to be motivated

84
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,478
to willingly change their behavior

85
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,858
because

86
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,779
at least right now

87
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,880
we can't force them

88
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,400
we don't have many options

89
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,320
but education

90
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,259
and communication and one of the options

91
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:34,580
available to us now

92
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,440
one might ask

93
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,960
why does this distinction

94
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,280
between work and home use matter

95
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,680
so in workplaces

96
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,639
the employees often receive formal and

97
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,220
ideally a very constant cyber security

98
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,540
training

99
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,820
there are information security policies

100
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,759
at place there are different kinds of

101
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,040
rules and regulations that tell

102
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,199
employees what they're allowed to do

103
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,120
with their devices and what they're not

104
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,460
allowed to do with their devices

105
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,580
all these rules and guidelines are at

106
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,139
place

107
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:17,160
to protect the employees and the

108
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,800
employer from cyber threats and cyber

109
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,720
incidents

110
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,919
yet as we have seen home users face

111
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,500
cyber threats too as I already mentioned

112
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,680
they can get hacked they can get scammed

113
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,740
they can get phishing emails so

114
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,800
the Cyber threats don't limit in the

115
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,280
workplaces basically almost any kind of

116
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,680
cyber threats that people are facing in

117
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,620
work environments they can also be

118
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,840
facing when they're home users

119
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,320
so

120
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,620
so obviously the difference here is that

121
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,020
home users don't receive

122
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,479
the cyber security training and

123
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,000
education in the same way that people

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,280
doing workplaces there are no

125
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,620
information security policies

126
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,320
there are no help desks or chief

127
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,780
information security officers to help

128
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,600
home users if they need any help

129
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,580
home users are basically on their own

130
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,400
and they can do whatever they want with

131
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,020
their devices

132
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,360
so no wonder that the decisions that

133
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,440
they make

134
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,419
are not always good ones

135
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,580
so

136
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,620
why does it matter how we talk about

137
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,220
cyber or basically anything at all

138
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,460
so language is a tool that we use to

139
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,120
understand and describe the world around

140
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,259
us

141
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:52,020
it's not insignificant how we talk about

142
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,039
things

143
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,460
because words and communication can be

144
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,080
used

145
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,280
to

146
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,120
affect people's feelings and thinking

147
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,880
I believe that everyone here who knows

148
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,360
the word propaganda won't question the

149
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,759
power that communication can have

150
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,639
it can affect on people's feelings and

151
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,840
perceptions of things

152
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,180
so when we try to

153
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,479
influence people's behavior for example

154
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:30,780
make them have better passwords or not

155
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,759
to believe scammers

156
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,340
how we talk about these things can

157
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,000
affect How likely it is that people take

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,580
these threats seriously and that they

159
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,099
choose to take action against those

160
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,580
threats

161
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,300
so then um

162
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,699
a few things about my most important

163
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,940
findings I made in my thesis

164
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,979
and the recommendations that I formed

165
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,860
based on my findings as well as previous

166
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,580
research

167
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,060
my most important finding was that when

168
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,240
we talk about cyber and try to influence

169
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,240
people's behavior

170
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,319
we use threats speech and fear appeals a

171
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:20,099
lot

172
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,580
and those fear Appeals don't often

173
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,220
enough get softened by encouraging

174
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,060
speech

175
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,979
another of my most important findings

176
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:36,059
was that when we do use fear appeals the

177
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,580
most emphasis is often put to appealing

178
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,880
to the severity of the threat and the

179
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,240
vulnerability to the threat

180
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,940
and let's be clear these two things are

181
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,140
not

182
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,000
bad things

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,640
but the

184
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,560
Danger

185
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,260
here is that according to studies

186
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,339
the feelings of fear or threats alone

187
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:08,640
are not often sufficient to make people

188
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,920
change their behavior

189
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,560
but what people would need

190
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,980
is more encouragement and feeling of

191
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,779
self-efficacy

192
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,600
in other words people need to believe

193
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,399
that

194
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,580
the behavior that they're suggested to

195
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,360
adopt is actually going to help them

196
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,140
and that they have the skills needed to

197
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,940
take that action

198
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,839
foreign

199
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,820
good to note

200
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,980
that according to studies

201
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,459
too much threat speech too much fear

202
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:48,779
Appeals

203
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,600
can actually make people more passive

204
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,339
and not active

205
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,339
if people are simply too scared

206
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,800
they don't know what they should do

207
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,500
they don't know if the measure or action

208
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,959
that we suggest is not is going to help

209
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,060
them or not

210
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,300
they probably won't be doing anything at

211
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,479
all

212
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,240
the danger in in this

213
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,720
cyber related news pieces

214
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,480
it's often that

215
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,100
they they tend to have this somewhat

216
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,920
apocalyptic tone this kind of a anything

217
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,080
can happen to anyone and no one is safe

218
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,399
kind of approach

219
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,399
that when people read these

220
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,980
they can get a feeling that no matter

221
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,899
what I do

222
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:50,660
I can get scammed or hacked anyways

223
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:54,360
and although we here know this to be

224
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,760
ultimately true

225
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,300
this can also be very dangerous because

226
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,760
there are some ways

227
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,800
how people can improve their cyber

228
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,700
security

229
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,399
there are measures and actions they can

230
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,440
take to improve their cyber security

231
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,660
but people just need to have faith

232
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,839
that those actions that we suggest are

233
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:19,980
effective

234
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,399
and that and I need to have faith in

235
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,820
themselves

236
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,360
I'll use an analog

237
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,459
we all know that

238
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,620
traffic accidents can happen to anyone

239
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,040
anyone can end up in a car crash it

240
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,380
doesn't have to be your fault it doesn't

241
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,540
have to be by your mistake

242
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,300
but you can still end up in a car

243
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,959
accident and we all know this

244
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,760
but it doesn't mean that we wouldn't

245
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:56,160
take the safety measures available to us

246
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,740
like safety belts for example

247
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,320
obviously safety belts are

248
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,899
not going to

249
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:06,540
stop the accidents from happening

250
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,060
but they do give us some additional

251
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,940
Security in case you end up in a car

252
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,680
accident

253
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,040
of course this analog is different in a

254
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,500
sense that traffic behavior and traffic

255
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,100
security is very strongly regulated

256
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,740
whereas cyber security behavior is not

257
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,399
and this is exactly why we must put so

258
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:34,140
much emphasis on how we talk about cyber

259
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,600
because right now communication

260
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,940
education are the only ways that we've

261
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,519
got when we try to influence on people's

262
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,000
behavior

263
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,060
so

264
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,319
what can we do better

265
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,980
first of all

266
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,440
we should keep in mind that two

267
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,019
fear-provoking approaches

268
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:00,000
will actually just

269
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,839
damage our cause if the message that

270
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,519
we're sending is to

271
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,160
fear provoking and too pessimistic it

272
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,620
probably won't make people to change

273
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,440
their behavior

274
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,300
so let's keep the tone of our message

275
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,120
always encouraging and let's concentrate

276
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,139
more

277
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:21,839
on creating the feeling of self-efficacy

278
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,300
people need to have a feeling that

279
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,420
the counter measures that we suggest are

280
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,519
something that they're capable of doing

281
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,240
in my thesis I use this concept or

282
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,440
approach of social marketing

283
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,860
social marketing refers to situations

284
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,519
where marketing approach is being used

285
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,680
to promote

286
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,200
wider societal change or achieving

287
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,420
common good

288
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,839
it is often used in health education

289
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,480
context

290
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,320
in a way that marketing approach or

291
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,320
marketing campaigns are used to promote

292
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,300
healthier behaviors

293
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,320
for example quitting smoking

294
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,600
in cyber security

295
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,740
research this concept has not been

296
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,019
researched that much

297
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:28,620
but I argue that we could use this even

298
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,000
more

299
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,040
because what we're trying to achieve

300
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,600
here

301
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,380
is indeed I would say common good or

302
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,620
achieving a wider societal change by

303
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,180
trying to make people as a whole to

304
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,000
change their behavior to be more cyber

305
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,959
secure

306
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,600
as a society

307
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,360
so how social marketing is done

308
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,300
basically

309
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,820
in Social marketing we try

310
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,639
to offer rewards in exchange for

311
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,639
Behavioral change so what this means is

312
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,339
basically we say you change your

313
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:09,360
behavior

314
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,839
you get rewarded very simple

315
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,420
one example in cyber field could be

316
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,940
passwords and password managers

317
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,199
because

318
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,440
there are already people

319
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,620
who know how to make a good password

320
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,600
they know that it should be long and it

321
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,959
should be unique to every service

322
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,600
but for some reason they're not bringing

323
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,800
their knowledge into action

324
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,600
so what we could try to do with social

325
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,519
marketing here is

326
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,860
we could try to promote for example

327
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,699
password managers by saying that hey

328
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:50,820
start to use this password manager

329
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,740
you don't have to come up with any

330
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,720
passwords by yourself anymore the

331
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,300
manager will do it for you whenever you

332
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,579
register into a new service

333
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,860
the password manager will remember all

334
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,079
your passwords so you don't have to

335
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,720
remember any of them anymore except the

336
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,699
one that you use to get into the

337
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:11,160
password manager

338
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,120
so your life gets a lot easier when you

339
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,500
don't have to remember any of your

340
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,940
passwords anymore

341
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,680
and you don't have to come up with new

342
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,839
passwords whenever you register into a

343
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,040
new service

344
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,620
also your life becomes a more cyber

345
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,720
secure in the process

346
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,760
so it's a win-win

347
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,260
win kind of situation

348
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,959
according to my experience in cyber

349
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,360
security Communications and cyber

350
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,339
security awareness

351
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:47,040
the cyber security communication often

352
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,139
tends to be this type of

353
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,240
this is the problem

354
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,420
this is what we should do about it

355
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,420
and yes it does give me the information

356
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,360
that I need to understand what the

357
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,459
thread is about and what I should do

358
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:04,380
about it

359
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,160
but still we should not forget to keep

360
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,740
the tone always encouraging and

361
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,000
motivational

362
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,099
and then of course there are already

363
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:17,640
people like I mentioned who know quite a

364
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,720
lot

365
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,699
there are people for example who know

366
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:24,299
him who knows what makes a good password

367
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,939
so with these people

368
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:29,100
it's not sufficient that we just keep on

369
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,900
telling the same thing over and over

370
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,200
again because they already know it

371
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,360
so this is very strongly connected to

372
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,039
the idea of one size fits all

373
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:43,260
one size fits-all is a concept already

374
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,260
known by previous research

375
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,380
and it refers to

376
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,480
situations when the same

377
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,080
educational material or same

378
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,480
communicational material is being

379
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,460
targeted or offered

380
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,080
to everyone regardless of their previous

381
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,440
knowledge or their skill level

382
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,039
and previous research has already

383
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:12,780
concluded that this approach is

384
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,039
obviously

385
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:18,299
not the best one if you try to make

386
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,700
people change their behavior because

387
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,440
like I already said there are these

388
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,419
people who know

389
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:27,240
what makes a good password

390
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,160
so we can't keep on telling them the

391
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,320
same thing over and over again but then

392
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,240
there are people still

393
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,580
who don't know what makes a good

394
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,200
password

395
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,720
so with these people we obviously have

396
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,299
to start with very basics

397
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:45,299
but the very Basics don't go with the

398
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:48,240
people who are already more advanced

399
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,740
so

400
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,840
if we truly want to say that cyber

401
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,419
security is everyone's business

402
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:57,539
we should not leave anyone out but we

403
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:01,200
would need more targeted content

404
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,020
content that's based on people's

405
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,480
different backgrounds different skill

406
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,620
levels

407
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,020
there are some people who basically born

408
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,780
nowadays with smartphones in their hands

409
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,840
and then there are people who try to

410
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,740
avoid using Digital Services as far as

411
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,880
they can

412
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,700
so obviously the same content is not

413
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,419
going to be effective with both of these

414
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:29,520
Target audiences

415
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,039
of course this is going to

416
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,080
need more resources

417
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,299
maybe some kind of Target group analysis

418
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,620
but still according to studies it would

419
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,780
be much more effective

420
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,679
to have this targeted content based on

421
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:47,760
different

422
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,260
different kind of backgrounds that

423
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,799
people have

424
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,620
so it's obvious by now that home users

425
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,679
do need help and guidance just as people

426
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,559
in work environments but at least right

427
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,639
now here in Finland

428
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,160
can we answer who is responsible of this

429
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,140
this education

430
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,600
because there really isn't

431
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,419
anyone would be clearly disresponsible

432
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:21,900
right now of course the national cyber

433
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,320
security Center here offers

434
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,260
communicational materials for everyone

435
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,460
but

436
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,940
is that sufficient and is if it is for

437
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,860
how long is it's going to be sufficient

438
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,020
I don't have an answer to this question

439
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,940
unfortunately but this is something that

440
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,640
we as a cyber security community and

441
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,559
Society should maybe think about

442
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,740
I just read Mika hoopnan's book Internet

443
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,140
it's a great book by the way I highly

444
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,640
recommend it if there's still someone

445
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,500
who hasn't read it

446
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,400
but um in his book Mikko played with the

447
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,780
idea that

448
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,160
what if

449
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,700
we would take the responsibility

450
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,820
of the cyber security away from those

451
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,179
people who for some reason are not able

452
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,700
to carry that responsibility

453
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,760
and instead we could

454
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,059
put more responsibility on for example

455
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:23,820
service providers that they could carry

456
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,679
more responsibility on our cyber

457
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,940
security

458
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,580
it is a very interesting idea very

459
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,380
interesting thought

460
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,539
I personally believe that

461
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:36,140
in the future we might see more

462
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,539
regulation in this field as well

463
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,940
but until then

464
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,340
the communicational and educational

465
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,520
methods are the only ones that we've had

466
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,320
so

467
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,320
let's focus on them and I believe that

468
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,700
we can still

469
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,720
do a little bit better

470
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:02,159
so if I want you to remember something

471
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,740
about this talk it would be

472
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,039
one size does not fit all and fear does

473
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,900
not get you far

474
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,440
so like I said I personally believe that

475
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,340
we haven't yet reached our very best

476
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,340
when it comes to how we can motivate

477
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,440
people to change their cyber security

478
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,620
Behavior by using communicational and

479
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,760
educational methods

480
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,440
so what I suggest is

481
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,820
let's try a little bit less fear Appeals

482
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,140
because

483
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,720
as I mentioned if people are simply too

484
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,740
scared

485
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,840
it can actually make them more passive

486
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,039
and therefore

487
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:47,039
to fear

488
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,320
um based approach can actually just

489
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,080
damage our course

490
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,500
so let's put more emphasis on making

491
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,200
people feel encouraged

492
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,299
and that they have the self-efficacy

493
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:01,559
needed

494
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,600
that they can have that impact in their

495
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,260
own cyber security

496
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,140
another thing that I suggest is let's

497
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,940
try having more targeted content so

498
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,679
the same

499
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:19,140
educational material same communication

500
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,260
material is not probably going to serve

501
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,720
all target audiences so let's make a

502
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,679
little bit

503
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,980
more Target group analysis or whatever

504
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,200
it's needed to find out what kind of

505
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,000
Target groups we've got

506
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,280
and then have some targeted content

507
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,940
based on that

508
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,640
then I suggest that we could try

509
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,679
using a little bit more social marketing

510
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,240
approach

511
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,720
so whenever we try to promote some

512
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,120
some Behavior

513
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,480
whatever it would be

514
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,059
we could try to think

515
00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:00,000
what is the reward that the person is

516
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,580
going to get if if they choose to adopt

517
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,520
the behavior that we're suggesting and

518
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,460
the more practical the reward is the

519
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,580
better

520
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,299
another thing let's try

521
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:17,700
hiring more skilled communicators and

522
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,580
education Educators in this field

523
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,240
I've I've seen a lot of a lot of this

524
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,760
trend already going on it's very very

525
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,039
nice to see and I hope to see more of it

526
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,340
in the future because obviously

527
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,400
the quality education and communication

528
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,380
they are very valuable to this field as

529
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,059
well

530
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:43,559
and finally let's start forgetting that

531
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,720
human is the weakest link discourse

532
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,980
because

533
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,000
it probably won't be very encouraging to

534
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,679
hear that you are the weakest link in

535
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:55,980
cyber security over and over again so

536
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,159
we could just drop that

537
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:02,580
and then see that bullet point one more

538
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,000
encouragement

539
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,380
so if you're interested to read more my

540
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,159
thesis is available in Finnish

541
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,860
you can also Google my name it will come

542
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,039
up

543
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,360
then I don't know how much time we've

544
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,918
got but if you have any questions

545
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,678
apparently not there is one

546
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,080
both of my time we've been training

547
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,980
companies

548
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,220
I absolutely agree

549
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,520
obviously these like my thesis was made

550
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,880
in the point of view of the home users

551
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,880
but obviously this

552
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,620
for example this

553
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,440
these ideas that I presented here are

554
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,820
not limited to home use obviously people

555
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,020
are still the same people even if

556
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,580
they're in the workplaces OR in their

557
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,700
home environments so obviously these

558
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,039
might be effective in work environments

559
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,860
as well I would like to see this

560
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,080
these ideas tried there as well

561
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,539
obviously that's that's a very good

562
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:50,720
point

563
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,480
another one thank you

564
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,240
foreign

565
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,640
yes

566
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,000
yes

567
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,760
yeah

568
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,100
that's true I I remember when I started

569
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,100
in cyber and it was only a few years ago

570
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,740
when I did my transition from political

571
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,600
science to cyber security

572
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,480
that when when I talked to cyber 2

573
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,240
my friends their response was often this

574
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,799
very famous line

575
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,840
I don't have anything to hide and why

576
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,500
would anyone want to hack me

577
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,059
luckily I don't hear that anymore I

578
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:14,100
don't know if it's vastama or or just

579
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,020
common awareness but

580
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,200
luckily I I haven't heard that anymore

581
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,240
and I hope that

582
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,460
this kind of approach that we tell

583
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,440
people why they should do these things

584
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,860
it's kind of helping in this as well

585
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:33,439
is there a hand yeah please

586
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,820
thank you

587
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,940
I agree

588
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,200
a couple of times

589
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,020
great great question um

590
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:17,640
in in my thesis I used self-efficacy as

591
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,880
a part of protection motivation Theory

592
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,000
it's it has

593
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,159
several different kind of aspects on and

594
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,460
it tries to explain how people behave

595
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,279
and it's very like threat and fear-based

596
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,980
uh approach and Theory

597
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,960
and in that

598
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,960
Theory the idea is basically that

599
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,679
yes you kind of can try to make people a

600
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,200
little bit scared but not too much and

601
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,620
then you should kind of offer people

602
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,360
um

603
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,240
with ways that they can improve their

604
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,840
safety against these threats and and

605
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,659
they according to this Theory

606
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:02,820
people are more likely to act in a

607
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,020
certain way

608
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,659
if they feel like this threat is

609
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:09,539
actually facing them that it's a real

610
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,960
threat for them and that the the counter

611
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,659
measure that we offer is gonna be

612
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:17,460
effective against the threat and that

613
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,679
people feel like

614
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,500
they they have the skills needed to take

615
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,659
that action and that's like how this

616
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:27,000
Theory explains self-efficacy so

617
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,919
self-efficacy in protection motivation

618
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:30,600
theory is basically that people feel

619
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,480
that they have the skills needed to take

620
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,820
whatever action we suggest

621
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:38,520
and how can we do that

622
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,460
I try to use the work your word uh

623
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,039
encouragement here a lot how it's done

624
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,539
in practice

625
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:49,559
is a little bit more tricky

626
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:52,200
because obviously how can you encourage

627
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,700
people and make them feel like they have

628
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,320
the skills needed I don't know it can be

629
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,440
some kind of maybe game place based

630
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,799
approach where people can try and then

631
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:03,600
when they succeed they get this feeling

632
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,820
that I actually know these things

633
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,620
it's a it's a very good question how we

634
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,960
could do this in practice but

635
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,860
at least maybe not be just focused so

636
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,360
much on

637
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,260
this is the threat it's very scary you

638
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,320
can be hacked anytime do something maybe

639
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,140
a little bit moving more encouraging

640
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,779
like maybe saying that okay this is the

641
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:32,940
threat but hey you can change this

642
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,980
for yourself you can go to your settings

643
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,620
you can do these measures

644
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,860
it's basically that you can do this it's

645
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,020
not like that you need a hacker to do it

646
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,059
for you

647
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:47,399
but hey we're running out of time thank

648
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:50,299
you so much for coming
