[Music]

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,030
thank you

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:26,389
[Music]

5
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,429
[Music]

6
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,860
hey everyone it's been a minute

7
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,219
for real it's been a minute uh

8
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,340
last time we were here we're in 2020

9
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,219
like a week before everything shut down

10
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,440
and

11
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,079
I didn't think then uh

12
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,180
how long two years could be I don't

13
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,160
think most of you did either it was

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,880
weird it was really really weird and

15
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,619
I've had a lot of time to think I think

16
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,420
everybody has had a lot of time to think

17
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,439
so let's go back to where it started

18
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,340
this is the first website disobey ever

19
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,560
had it's from September 15 2015.

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,900
this is everything that was available

21
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,659
publicly to the public

22
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,799
this is how we found each other uh it's

23
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,040
a very simple encryption it's Rob 13 or

24
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,979
Caesar Cipher so just shift 13 letters

25
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,200
to the next but that was enough to sell

26
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,140
out a small venue in Robinson

27
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,520
in 2016.

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,399
200 people

29
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:54,540
were weird like me were like interested

30
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,399
in interesting subjects like me like my

31
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,340
kind of people like the the type of

32
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,600
person

33
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,560
that finds themselves here today

34
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,400
but we've changed quite a bit

35
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,760
Everything's changed quite a bit since

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,099
2016. today it seems like that was a

37
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,319
simpler time but then

38
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,860
like the pandemic happened the war in

39
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,660
Ukraine happened

40
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,540
and lately it's been feeling a lot like

41
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,599
the world is either ending or about to

42
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,260
end or just in general going to

43
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,720
like at least from my point of view so

44
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,500
I'm stupidly happy that we're here today

45
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,500
but I still think we need to be reminded

46
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,300
of why we're here what we're actually

47
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,239
trying to accomplish who we actually are

48
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,040
because

49
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,940
for those two years most of us

50
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,940
we're lucky enough to work at home

51
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,540
we're lucky enough to be in a position a

52
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,000
privileged position where we kind of got

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,060
shut in we life didn't maybe change that

54
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,760
much but most of the world wasn't

55
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,640
most of the world actually had to deal

56
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,140
with a lot of

57
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,300
well

58
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,700
and and I think

59
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,700
it makes sense to remind us of reminds

60
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,340
us remind ourselves of that privilege

61
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,360
so uh when we started disobey back in

62
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,819
2015 we figured we need something to

63
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,400
base the community on something that we

64
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,739
can look back on something that we can

65
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,319
use as our Guiding Light are ethos are

66
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,400
create

67
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,840
and we found a book by Stephen Levy with

68
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,360
a passage called the Hacker's Creed

69
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,440
and we took it we adapted it changed it

70
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,959
a bit made it a bit different

71
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,540
and it reads you can create art and

72
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,519
Beauty on a computer

73
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,400
access to computers and anything that

74
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,200
can teach us something about the world

75
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,379
should be free

76
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,900
or unlimited and total

77
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,060
always yield to the Hands-On imperative

78
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,120
so they actually do things

79
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,880
all information should be free

80
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,940
we should not put roadblocks or gatekeep

81
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,940
for things that can push us a society

82
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,300
forward

83
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,500
we should mistrust Authority now I don't

84
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,000
mean that we should actually Rebel or uh

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,580
maybe sometimes it makes sense to Rebel

86
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,259
but

87
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,600
we shouldn't take everything that an

88
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,699
authority figure tells us as granted

89
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,620
something that

90
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,320
is true because they say it's true we

91
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,820
should promote decentralization and

92
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,460
critical thinking within our Mists have

93
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,040
people come to realizations themselves

94
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,740
and not force feed them information

95
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,139
give people the tools to learn give

96
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:02,820
people the tools to understand but not

97
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,020
tell them the solution

98
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,740
we should not judge people by anything

99
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,960
besides their hacking especially in the

100
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,340
hacking community

101
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,020
like

102
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,060
there's a bunch of bogus criteria

103
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,680
there's a bunch of a bunch of like

104
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,080
misconceptions about what it means where

105
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,600
we should go and how we should behave to

106
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,280
be something but we don't need to do

107
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,300
that here

108
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,680
because we're among ourselves we are the

109
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,000
people who

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,080
don't have necessarily a face to a

111
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,699
friendship we've had for an entire life

112
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,580
maybe we only know their handle from IRC

113
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,820
or or Twitter or or even Instagram

114
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,060
it's everything is in the substance of

115
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,020
what they say not in who they are how

116
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,660
they present themselves or who its

117
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,979
Society wants them to be

118
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,919
and we want to believe the computers can

119
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,080
change our life for the better make a

120
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,520
real difference in society make

121
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,380
something worthwhile something important

122
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,479
now that seemed like a really good

123
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,000
starting point for building a community

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,340
on but we quickly realized we need

125
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,900
something more

126
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,960
so we created our code of ethics now

127
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,460
these days this would probably be called

128
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,000
something like a code of conduct or

129
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,699
another type of ethos for us it was very

130
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,240
clear respect privacy

131
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,460
Serve and Protect the community that

132
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,340
means us the people here

133
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,039
share knowledge with the community so

134
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,840
don't sit on something that's important

135
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,440
just to make yourself more valuable

136
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,380
act with integrity and this is a big one

137
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,819
it's

138
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,340
it's easy to have integrity when there's

139
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,860
nothing on the line it's a lot harder to

140
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,419
have integrity when you can lose

141
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,880
something by sticking up for what you

142
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,280
believe is right or standing behind what

143
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,199
you promised or what you

144
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,699
stand for

145
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,240
avoid conflicts of interest now since

146
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,280
most of us are from Finland or the

147
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,600
nordics it's really hard to completely

148
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,520
remove ourselves from conflict of

149
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,620
interest we should avoid them as much as

150
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,479
possible

151
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,360
and especially avoid fear uncertainty

152
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,259
and doubt now a lot of companies some of

153
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,099
our partners unfortunately included

154
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:39,000
sometimes go down the fear uh route in

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,440
their marketing

156
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,900
and every day the security Community

157
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:48,000
manages to succeed every day we we stop

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,460
attacks we investigate we protect

159
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,240
we remediate we mitigate

160
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,900
we build things

161
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,080
we don't need to scare people we can

162
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,780
talk about the facts

163
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,240
We should strive to protect everyone's

164
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,380
data

165
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,520
like not only our own but everyone's

166
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,039
most important and of all it's not hard

167
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,139
to not be an

168
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,139
and that's all it takes like you don't

169
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:23,819
need to be a nice person you don't need

170
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:25,500
you don't even need to be a kind person

171
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,780
just don't be a to everybody

172
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,759
around you and you'll get along just

173
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,080
fine

174
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,719
and that's true here as well so

175
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,059
this is what we built

176
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,159
our community on this is what we built

177
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,140
our

178
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,899
founding thoughts on and now we're here

179
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:43,679
today

180
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,620
at a sold out venue in Maricopa League

181
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,060
where

182
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,680
it seems like we need to get a bigger

183
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,019
one next year so more people can fit in

184
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:56,220
not so we can grow just to grow but so

185
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,140
we don't need to leave anybody outside

186
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,760
so while we are here

187
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,700
it's important that we operate under the

188
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,680
Chatham House rule for those of you who

189
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,200
don't know what that is it essentially

190
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,880
boils down to

191
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,700
feel free to discuss anything and

192
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,260
everything openly

193
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,720
feel sheer fear free to use that

194
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,399
information even share that information

195
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,580
but don't divulge where you got it or

196
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,500
how you got that information

197
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,100
that should lead to a more open exchange

198
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,320
of information and ideas

199
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,600
that should lead to

200
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,260
a better conference for all of us so

201
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,200
feel free to understand that we operate

202
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,660
under the Chatham House rule here today

203
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,880
and tomorrow well in everything we do

204
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,940
but especially here today and tomorrow

205
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,760
that being said

206
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,920
where we are today would not be possible

207
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,560
without our sponsors and our partners

208
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,080
this year's main partner is Accenture

209
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,680
security who has a watering stand down

210
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,700
the hall

211
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,959
we uh are glad to have them as our

212
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,880
partner this year as well and they've

213
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,680
been a partner with us for for a long

214
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,040
time they're not our only partner

215
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,839
we have a bunch of Partners this year

216
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,420
too many to

217
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,660
mention them all but you'll be sure to

218
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,820
find them up on the balcony

219
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,279
where

220
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,220
vartila and Elisa has an operative

221
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,860
technology Lounge where you can try to

222
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,399
hack a factory corner is downstairs

223
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,339
where you can try to hack an elevator

224
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:43,320
I know it's kind of funny to put the

225
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,060
elevator company in the basement but

226
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,680
like

227
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,820
hmm

228
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,300
it works The Finnish Defense Forces are

229
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,720
here they're giving out jelly donuts for

230
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,940
everyone

231
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,820
secure is here

232
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,579
upcloud is sponsoring our CTF

233
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,880
remedy is sponsoring our Network

234
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,880
visualization and true Sac is sponsoring

235
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,560
our after party uh at BT this year next

236
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,940
day after next

237
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,920
now uh

238
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,040
I don't want to spend too much time on

239
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,620
sponsors because they will tell you

240
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,420
everything you need to know about them I

241
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,240
don't need to do the work for them so

242
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,959
let's talk a bit about practicals

243
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:32,640
workshops are happening in the workshop

244
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,240
area which is true to the other side of

245
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,459
the cable Factory it's first come first

246
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,920
serve but it's a large enough area for

247
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,140
everybody to fit in

248
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,200
security can be reached either by

249
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,839
anybody with a staff shirt on it or by

250
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,839
people that have a yellow sign here if

251
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,339
you see somebody being an

252
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:57,959
immediately notify stuff notify security

253
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,180
if we work together we're kind of work

254
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,000
like an immune defense of the

255
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,880
organization where any well adversarial

256
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,519
viruses will be quickly swamped by

257
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,360
the reaction right

258
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,779
respect everyone's privacy here don't go

259
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,180
around taking photos of the general

260
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,700
areas when there's people on stage you

261
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,300
can photo the stage right you can with

262
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,440
explicit permission uh take pictures but

263
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,660
don't take pictures without checking

264
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,899
with everyone first

265
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:40,140
we have a no photos

266
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,380
clock every here and there but it's to

267
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,700
give you the idea that this isn't for

268
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,100
like uh influencers to do Instagram

269
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,139
photo shoots there's nothing wrong with

270
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,540
that but this is the wrong venue for

271
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,480
Instagram photo shoots

272
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,500
if you are a part of the CTF

273
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,540
that's on the other side of the black

274
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,180
Multan

275
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,100
there is a lot of really cool challenges

276
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,139
this year as well

277
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:11,160
um

278
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,560
please do try to solve the balance

279
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,360
challenge it hasn't been solved since

280
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,079
2017. it's the hardest challenge or one

281
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:22,200
of the hardest challenges at the event

282
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,320
you have everything well you have a part

283
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,839
of what you need around your neck

284
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,860
and uh this year we have a community

285
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,620
organized friendly instance so disobeyed

286
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,839
a friendly.io is somewhere no

287
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,639
oh

288
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,399
there is a typo I'm dyslexic by the way

289
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,300
so friendly with an i not a y

290
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,459
where you can find like-minded

291
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:56,279
individuals and organize I think it's

292
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,579
like interest based meat based meetups

293
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:01,620
during the event

294
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,899
so if you want to sign up to that you

295
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:05,120
can

296
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,320
at the end I want to leave you with

297
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,459
three ideas

298
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:12,839
get you to enjoy this as much as

299
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,100
possible

300
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,339
first by

301
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,459
Albert Einstein

302
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,980
we can't change where we are without

303
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,100
changing our thinking and we are where

304
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,339
we are today because of our thinking

305
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:32,820
so maybe it makes sense to take a step

306
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,940
back maybe we're focusing too much on

307
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,459
user interfaces and not enough on user

308
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:39,600
experiences

309
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,600
maybe we're focusing too much on

310
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,579
producing security for security

311
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:48,959
specialists and not enough for the users

312
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,680
maybe we'll continue the ACT to act the

313
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,120
way we're acting

314
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,380
uh

315
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,959
the as long as we continue to think the

316
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,120
way we're thinking so start by changing

317
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,500
your thinking

318
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,180
secondly

319
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,160
Maybe

320
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,199
we should stop thinking about what's

321
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,459
right for us

322
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,320
and start thinking about what's right

323
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,100
for everyone what's right for society as

324
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,139
a whole maybe we should start building

325
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,600
solutions for not the people who are

326
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,160
here now but the people who are coming

327
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,320
after we need to start thinking about

328
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,660
this in terms of sustainability

329
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,300
in terms of

330
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,519
actual

331
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,860
impact on the world

332
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,519
and as a third one maybe the way we can

333
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,920
actually accomplish this

334
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,279
is by hacking the planet

335
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,220
so cool welcome to disobey I hope you

336
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,279
have a wonderful wonderful conference

337
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,519
I'm Benjamin or not my Nick here enjoy

338
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,770
have a lot of fun thank you so much
