1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,300
hello everybody

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,940
my name is Lea avilianen and I'm here to

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,900
talk about audit interviews and hacking

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,540
this is not a technical talk

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,880
so if you are looking for deeply

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,740
technical content

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,680
this is not the place to be

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,619
I'm talking about

9
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:25,380
psychological truths and underpinnings

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,460
of how an auditor

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,120
can make the audit interviews yield

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,040
better results

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,020
and also conversely how the person being

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:44,660
audited can affect that situation

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,219
um

16
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,160
why am I here talking about this thing

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,340
that's a very good question because

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,379
I'm a technical person not a

19
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,980
psychologist or psychiatrist or any kind

20
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,340
of HR person who talks to people a lot

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,159
I start my let's say counting my cyber

22
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,240
security career from 1995 when I was

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,000
employee number 10 in a very small

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,040
company called Nixon

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,320
I had of course been at the University

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,540
before and doing admin stuff and things

27
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,060
like that but that kind of started my

28
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,640
cyber security career

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,040
I did a lot of technical admin stuff and

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,880
things like that was there for 10 years

31
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,579
growing up the cyber security or then it

32
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,380
wasn't called cyber security it was just

33
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,119
security

34
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,560
um

35
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,740
did all kinds of technical audits I came

36
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,520
in 2001 I went to the states and brought

37
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,220
a lot of web application or this

38
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,740
methodology from science to Finland and

39
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,799
we started doing things like that

40
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,619
oh eventually after 10 years I thought

41
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:01,079
okay I need to do something else and

42
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,159
decided to let's say go out of my

43
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,038
technical comfort zone and I want to be

44
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,800
a year and a half for um Chief

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,620
information security officer in in

46
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,319
Finnish government you know organization

47
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,200
called

48
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,120
ministers

49
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,400
which was the sort of I.T organization

50
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
where which

51
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,459
all the Finnish um

52
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,800
um farming subsidies not allows to it

53
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,920
went through so lots of Millions

54
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,780
and that also mandated some security

55
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,860
processes and we did an ISO

56
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,519
27001 certification it wasn't called

57
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:52,080
27001 it was called bs7799 at that time

58
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,220
and in that uh

59
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,319
the seat of the audited person which was

60
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,940
also very interesting

61
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:07,080
so I did that and I thought okay maybe I

62
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,239
don't really like running processes I

63
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,180
like projects I like doing things so I

64
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,060
found it my own one person company love

65
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,239
security you might figure out uh which

66
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,200
letter my second name starts with

67
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,900
um and that's what I'm still doing I

68
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,780
also I'm currently uh

69
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,780
50 of the the people behind

70
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,599
hacker.fi company which does bug

71
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,879
bounties as a service for Finnish

72
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,860
organizations

73
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,440
so I do a lot of technical stuff I do a

74
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,739
lot of technical Audits and things like

75
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:49,980
that so why am I here talking about

76
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,700
psychology

77
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,920
um

78
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,860
okay um

79
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,280
we probably all have been in a situation

80
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,840
where

81
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,420
we need to find out something from

82
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,920
somebody

83
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,980
and it can be very painful actually in

84
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,080
some cases you are sitting opposite

85
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,299
somebody and you got this Excel sheet

86
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,579
that you need to fill and you're asking

87
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,160
these questions and you feel it very

88
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,220
painful and awkward and

89
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,520
and I bet the person answering you is

90
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,820
feeling exactly the same pain

91
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,740
having done that for a while I thought

92
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,800
okay that must be a better ways to doing

93
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,440
this make it more pleasant for both of

94
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,540
the the parties that I start figuring

95
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,759
out how to do this in a more

96
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,960
let's say

97
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:52,919
nice way or or easier way for everyone

98
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,800
but let's go back for a second what I'm

99
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,740
actually talking about about Audits and

100
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,860
assessments and things like that audit

101
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,380
in in some uh

102
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,900
organizations and uh

103
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,720
areas have very specific meaning for

104
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,759
example if you are talking to a

105
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,860
financial person or or a Content or it

106
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,560
has a very specific meaning uh with with

107
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,560
bookkeeping and things like that

108
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,220
um also if you are doing like ISO type

109
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,860
of of all it's it's got very specific

110
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,900
meaning there as well it needs to be

111
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,440
official accredited organization against

112
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,180
certain uh criteria and so on it is

113
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,759
absolutely true but it also most of the

114
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,620
time it is used especially in the

115
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,800
security area very colloquially talking

116
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,100
about any kind of of

117
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,259
fact-finding mission using checklist to

118
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,479
check whether the the organization or

119
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,240
the application or the system fulfills

120
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,940
certain criteria the criteria might not

121
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,940
be exactly written down somewhere for

122
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,100
example

123
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,600
there might not be a specific list of

124
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,940
vulnerabilities with the system needs to

125
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,960
be resistant of but uh

126
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,440
in this talk I'm basically calling audit

127
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,080
something that is quite often called

128
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,020
assessment by other people it's

129
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,400
basically the same thing uh and and uh I

130
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,900
don't care if somebody comes to me

131
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,699
afterwards and say well I'm not really

132
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,780
talking about audits

133
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,300
so now that we are cleared what I mean

134
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,479
by audit the kind of assessment what do

135
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:43,340
I mean by security audit interview

136
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,740
when we're talking about security Audits

137
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,120
and assessments especially from

138
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,580
technical side we might figure out okay

139
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,220
this is something that you put uh take

140
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,500
your uh

141
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,819
birth suit or or uh

142
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:01,979
tools like that and and point it to a

143
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,740
specific application and figure out

144
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,560
whether that is vulnerable or not

145
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,520
absolutely true

146
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,960
however

147
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,639
quite often you can't make a proper

148
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:17,880
assessment or audit without talking to

149
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,960
people

150
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,800
this is especially true with for example

151
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,580
um or what application verification uh

152
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,039
standard nowadays it used to be very

153
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,699
technical the first versions of

154
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,180
asvs were very very technically oriented

155
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,880
check for cross-site scripting check for

156
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,500
SQL injection check for uh insecure

157
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,360
direct topic differences things like

158
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,479
that but

159
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:49,979
some interesting back I think it was

160
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,199
more and more

161
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,900
things were added to it and for example

162
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:00,198
this newest version 4 there's this um

163
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,060
one of the first section actually talks

164
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,819
about architecture design threat

165
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,220
modeling things like that and you can't

166
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,919
actually complete that particular

167
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,860
section without talking to people

168
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,580
so that's why everybody needs to know

169
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,400
how to talk to people and find out

170
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,020
what's going on

171
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,080
of course in the security

172
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,419
auditing it's not enough just to talk to

173
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,240
people the key of the uh or its

174
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,719
interview is basically the aim of the

175
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,360
interview is finding evidence of certain

176
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,820
security practices whether it's the

177
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,099
security in the pipeline whether how

178
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,320
they do threat modeling or things like

179
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,580
that

180
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,060
so I'm coming back to this particular

181
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,080
issue later so uh that's it for example

182
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,480
detecting if somebody's lying is not

183
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,060
really a

184
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,700
like major thing that is is

185
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:05,600
um necessary for you to upskill it

186
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,019
but let's

187
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,260
start with how to get people talk

188
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,700
because the more people talk in general

189
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,519
talk to me the auditor

190
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,220
the more information I get

191
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,660
the better quality the audit will be

192
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,040
so learn to how to get people talking

193
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,839
that's the let's say that the um

194
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,660
whole point of of this talking talk

195
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,279
and of course being from a business side

196
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,860
of things there are certain tools that

197
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,380
are not really available to me as a

198
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,500
technical auditor violence is out I

199
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,320
can't take a baseball bat and and start

200
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,420
hitting people with it I leave that to

201
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,060
the criminals go ahead

202
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:04,500
there's also this whole sex thing which

203
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,200
is absolutely a tool that security

204
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,040
services use to get people talking but

205
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,980
then again uh that's not available for

206
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,600
us in the uh normal professional life

207
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,100
nor is really an intimidation or trying

208
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,480
to lean peep on people and threat

209
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,200
threaten them with negative consequences

210
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,320
that is I don't know well let's leave

211
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,740
that to the American cop shows I don't

212
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,140
think that's very something that that

213
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,700
even Finnish police forces use but those

214
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,940
are not something that we can Leverage

215
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,800
to get people talking

216
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,839
so what is there

217
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,959
so we might look at some social

218
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,760
engineering techniques how do people get

219
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,279
conned in a telephone and getting sent

220
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:05,820
their credentials or sending a hundred

221
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:11,279
thousands of money to a third parties

222
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,700
um for example the social Engineers

223
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,300
might

224
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,180
might leverage things like

225
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,720
Authority that hey this is the CEO of

226
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,459
your company please send hundred

227
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:29,459
thousand of of something of of Euros to

228
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,620
this bank account then they might

229
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,079
actually add some urgencies you need to

230
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,560
do this today or we'll lose huge amount

231
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,040
of money so a pop-up

232
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,220
and some people might go for it these

233
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,019
tools are not very useful to me either

234
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,839
as an auditor because I'm not in author

235
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:53,279
it's a position of the uh to this

236
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,500
particular

237
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,079
person being audited I'm usually a third

238
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,680
party auditor and I'm not in the direct

239
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,260
chain of command of of or any kind of

240
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,620
hierarchy uh in regards to them an

241
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,320
urgency is not really

242
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,800
uh in the play because the audited

243
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,740
person might not even understand why

244
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,660
this is urgent from my point of view

245
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,720
it's probably not uh urgent for their

246
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,160
point of view

247
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,000
so we need to figure out something else

248
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,600
and I'm going to present five

249
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,380
certain ways which help in getting

250
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,200
people to talk and build their secrets

251
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,600
but first of all I need to

252
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,880
um

253
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,060
make this sort of um disclaimer that not

254
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,870
all mixed

255
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,519
[Music]

256
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,120
um

257
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,720
while the these are something that have

258
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,839
the really solid psychological basis

259
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:57,959
they don't always work

260
00:12:57,959 --> 00:12:58,560
um

261
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,639
in the uh in all

262
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,240
interview situations there might be that

263
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,680
some people

264
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,160
are very in their basic nature are not

265
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,899
very forthcoming

266
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:15,839
whatever tricks I want to use

267
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,600
some of the things are not very

268
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,040
culturally

269
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,440
[Music]

270
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,660
transferable for example is emphasis on

271
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,540
truth and being truthful is something

272
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,480
very peculiar to us in the northern

273
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,660
European Zone people in other cultures

274
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,720
have very more fluid understanding of

275
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,620
what is truth and what is

276
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,200
truth like let's say this way

277
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,800
uh my experience is mostly in the in the

278
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,079
uh let's see this northern European

279
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,839
Protestant Zone where where people are

280
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,680
in in the sense uh very um obliging uh

281
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,540
telling the truth but I do have

282
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,519
experience with with other cultures as

283
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,700
well

284
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,579
with that

285
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,660
I'm going to introduce our two actors

286
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,920
the white hat auditor and the black hat

287
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,600
um audited person

288
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,240
and of course I probably

289
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,000
um hexed the weather today because I

290
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,339
decided to use these people symbol

291
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:22,260
instead of hat so sorry about the

292
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,320
blizzard where you're going to need some

293
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,639
um warm headwear

294
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,980
now the question

295
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,500
of course the audits are wanting to find

296
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,019
good things about the company or bad

297
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:38,760
things about the company to write a

298
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,740
report to the company or the

299
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,380
organization can enhance its security

300
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,860
that's a pretty well understood role the

301
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,899
question is now why does that audited

302
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:55,220
person have a black people

303
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,180
what would make that a sort of

304
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,899
black hat thing why would that person

305
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:06,839
want to affect the

306
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,740
um how the audit interview is going

307
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,779
I'm going to give you an example

308
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,480
some years back I was at this client

309
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,120
doing this security for this for this

310
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,180
project and suddenly I get in my email

311
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,190
box a a

312
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,079
[Music]

313
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:25,920
um

314
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,060
appointment from a calendar invite

315
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,740
to a meeting with a person from a yet a

316
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,380
third organization which basically uh

317
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,540
with the label that they want to talk

318
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,160
about the security in this particular

319
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,199
project and it and it's very sort of

320
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,240
like next day or things like that I

321
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,800
didn't pay a lot of attention to that

322
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,560
because I had I was very busy and it

323
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,180
turned out that this particular

324
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,959
third-part party person wanted me to

325
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,639
tell everything about the project

326
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,019
security

327
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:01,860
and I was like whoa okay who are you and

328
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,180
why are you

329
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,519
um

330
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:07,560
wanting to know about this

331
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,600
there are two ways I could have reacted

332
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,820
I could have said basically no I'm not

333
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,339
talking to you before I hear from the

334
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,380
people I work for whether this is okay

335
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,139
or not but since we are in Finland this

336
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:23,279
is high trust uh Society I was I was

337
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,920
thinking this this uh making this threat

338
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,199
analysis and thinking on the Fly that

339
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,240
okay this is probably okay but somebody

340
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,420
had just forgotten to tell me about it

341
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,519
which is probably the the

342
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,880
um reason for this so I said okay I'm

343
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,680
going to take this now the minimal

344
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,380
approach of telling absolutely the bare

345
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,139
minimum of what is uh asked I don't want

346
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,720
to actually block this whole thing but I

347
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,180
will not be very forthcoming on this so

348
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,300
this is one way of looking at this so

349
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,420
sometimes you might be in a position

350
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,880
that you don't actually want to spill

351
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,160
all the secrets there is

352
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,059
so

353
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:08,160
first

354
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,260
basic fact

355
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,500
people like talking about their cells

356
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,900
they really do

357
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,199
there actually is okay it's uh the

358
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,480
reference it's in Black in the very

359
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,419
small but there's actually a Harvard

360
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,780
um uh research done

361
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,260
that says that

362
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,140
talking about yourself

363
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,820
activate the same dopamine system that

364
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,539
is activated when you have good food or

365
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:44,760
even have sex

366
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,059
so it actually gives us a immediate

367
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:49,260
reward

368
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,440
when we talk about ourselves

369
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,440
so this is absolutely something that

370
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,080
plays to the hand of the auditor who

371
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,500
wants to get get the person talking

372
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,460
so why not open the interview with a

373
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,100
simple question well tell me about

374
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,500
yourself and what do you do

375
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,720
and people open up

376
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,760
surprisingly how much

377
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,820
so this is something something that is

378
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,900
absolutely ingrained to our

379
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,840
well-being and in our brain so leverage

380
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,440
this as as much as you can of course

381
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,140
there are people who really don't like

382
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,679
talking about themselves and are very uh

383
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:37,260
very shy and don't want to open any

384
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,620
anything they need and that's fine

385
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,919
but generally speaking people do like

386
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,660
if this uh talk were a bit earlier in

387
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,539
disobey I might have

388
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:54,600
encouraged you to go to the uh hall

389
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,299
right there and talk to a totally uh

390
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,700
unknown person and

391
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,080
see how they react to you asking them

392
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,820
questions about themselves whether they

393
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,280
put autoplay on and if you can extract

394
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,980
yourself for like 15 minutes later from

395
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,260
that flood of information when people

396
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,880
get this reward that somebody's

397
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,799
interested in what I do somebody's

398
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,320
interested

399
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,059
of me as a person

400
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,539
people actually do that

401
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:26,100
and I've been told that this is

402
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,260
something often that happens on dates as

403
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:28,980
well

404
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,140
the people just don't shut up about

405
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,880
themselves

406
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,419
so

407
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,120
oh yes auditor go and and ask you about

408
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,000
yourself what do you do what is your

409
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,760
role in the organization explain that

410
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,539
and and so on and you do that

411
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:50,940
so how can you affect this how can you

412
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,820
not go that deep

413
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,820
there are of course the reason is is uh

414
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,500
trying to keep the talk very

415
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,600
non-personal keeping your boundaries

416
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,720
straight that we are here to talk about

417
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,340
this particular project this particular

418
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,179
system my role in this company and so on

419
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:11,340
so uh this is always a good thing to

420
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,340
keep boundaries uh right

421
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,740
and also do not volunteer any

422
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,940
information

423
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,520
this is actually from the auditor point

424
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,460
of view really uh really not the trick

425
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,799
because if I have to ask

426
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:31,740
every bit of information from you in a

427
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,260
form of a question

428
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,440
it is like pulling teeth

429
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,919
it's absolutely excruciating

430
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:43,740
if your own do not volunteer anything if

431
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,559
you don't talk to me it is going to be

432
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:47,820
painful

433
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,919
so you can inflict that pain on the

434
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,640
auditor if you so wish to

435
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,820
and this is actually uh very much how

436
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,520
like

437
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,260
Universe time situation you've seen all

438
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,140
these movies that The

439
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,559
if you're getting caught by the enemy

440
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,840
this is the name serial right name rank

441
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,820
and steal your number that's the minimal

442
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,559
of information you're going to give them

443
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:17,940
so this trick is is very much uh used

444
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:22,080
uh in in other context as well

445
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,340
the second thing that is very good in

446
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,600
reminding

447
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,500
is that people

448
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,159
really like to be recognized as expert

449
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:37,260
especially in the technical sphere I

450
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,700
found out

451
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,860
that

452
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,659
a lot of people that I've been

453
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:46,559
interviewing are actually very

454
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,799
expert on their particular field

455
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,980
they understand a particular system very

456
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,039
well they have spent years understanding

457
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:57,419
that

458
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:59,520
or honing their craft as software

459
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,679
developers or whatever

460
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,960
and sometimes in bigger organization

461
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,440
especially in Finland you never get a

462
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,640
positive feedback

463
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,159
when have you received positive feedback

464
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,179
of your work uh a rock setting lately no

465
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:19,559
doubt to that

466
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:24,059
so basic recognition is a human basic

467
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:27,480
trait it's in a Maslow's uh hierarchy of

468
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,480
need

469
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,360
so reserving some kind of praise and

470
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,899
recognition

471
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,360
ignites as a sort of warmer fussy

472
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,080
feeling that

473
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,860
is is played in the um is very useful in

474
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,299
the context of that info interview

475
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:52,440
because people usually get to feel

476
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,020
positive towards the person who gives

477
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,559
that compliment or or feedback

478
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,900
so when we when we get this positive

479
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,360
report going on it's going to be good

480
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,080
for volunteering information

481
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,780
of course

482
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,659
you can go very much too far on this so

483
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:16,220
if you are feeling uh slight funny

484
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,380
taste in your mouth

485
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,039
it's stop leaking things that don't get

486
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,799
your tongue very brown but honest

487
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:27,539
Compliments are very actually very easy

488
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:31,500
to find I found out that an auditor when

489
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,780
you have heard or hearing what the

490
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,179
person is doing and how they are doing

491
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:38,280
how they're managing this hugely

492
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,220
important system it's very easy to

493
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,380
actually recognize that without any

494
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,740
false uh false um

495
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:50,880
complement just to say oh you must be a

496
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,280
very uh could developer so you can

497
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,620
manage this project and you have have

498
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,600
you been the lead developer of this

499
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,940
project this is a huge thing for this

500
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,860
organization so on

501
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,919
another trick you could use but it's not

502
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:07,140
necessarily very useful in all the

503
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,460
situation

504
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,580
I do sometimes use that you can also ask

505
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,299
their opinion on something or ask their

506
00:24:14,299 --> 00:24:16,799
advice on something

507
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,260
I usually use that as a sort of kind of

508
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,620
a last minute thing that I asked what is

509
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,299
there something in this organization

510
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:27,780
Security on this particular focus is

511
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,000
that something you want to be changed is

512
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,419
there something you see as a problem

513
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:37,260
it it's not really a a specific audit

514
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:40,200
question but it is something that I uh

515
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,320
value the input I value the opinion and

516
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,059
that sometimes gets put in the audience

517
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,299
report as well

518
00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:51,900
so how can you put your black people on

519
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,360
and counter this

520
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,880
really show your expertise

521
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,120
like flood me with information this is

522
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,000
like denial of service a type of of

523
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,360
flooding information some people really

524
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,419
uh get excited when they start

525
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:11,640
explaining to me about the intricacies

526
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,460
of their system application the

527
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,039
processes of software development or

528
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,340
whatever

529
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,820
and I have to uh interrupt themselves so

530
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,100
could we go back to the this particular

531
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,700
question so uh hold on a bit uh I can't

532
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,100
type fast enough so what did you say

533
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,659
about this so I need to be constantly be

534
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:40,080
aware of the time I have because audits

535
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,120
are time constrained

536
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,600
I don't have hours and hours to talk to

537
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,720
these people as far as they might be

538
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,520
but

539
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,059
um

540
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:55,380
I need to be aware of of that time

541
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,260
so denial of service

542
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:04,620
is absolutely a viable strategy on this

543
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,659
the third one which is a bit uh

544
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:11,940
difficult one to counter but the third

545
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,720
two truth is that we actually prefer

546
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,080
people who are like us

547
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,900
so what does this mean from the audit

548
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,220
perspective

549
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:26,220
the auditor

550
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:31,140
I found it is actually useful to try to

551
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:35,039
find something that is common to us

552
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,380
me and the people who are being

553
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,640
interviewed

554
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,740
and of course the more specific it is

555
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,860
the better it is so if somebody is a

556
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,320
developer and I said okay I've got some

557
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,940
developer background I'm not a

558
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,760
professional but I do this this hobby

559
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,900
thing

560
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,539
or the suicide mean I can say okay I'm

561
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:55,400
also

562
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,400
admin with with certain things if they

563
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,380
are

564
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:02,940
talking about their Hobbies we might

565
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,159
find something to connect them on that

566
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:07,679
level or things like that

567
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,679
it's not absolutely uh

568
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:14,400
uh like mandatory to do this but it it

569
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,400
adds up to some level of trust or or

570
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,460
connection you have and it makes talking

571
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,539
to you easier

572
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:27,539
so if I find that we might not have a

573
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:28,620
lot of

574
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,320
things actually in common like

575
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,720
background work or or

576
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,440
um

577
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,500
things we have seen or or experienced

578
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,299
I can also

579
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:42,900
try to drive the discussion towards

580
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,080
things that we find new Connections in

581
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,039
and if that doesn't work out I can try

582
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:52,559
copy the movements it's called mimicking

583
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,919
so if somebody is is uh

584
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,020
uh sitting like this

585
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,419
I might be start sitting like this as

586
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,960
well so it makes the it's a totally

587
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,299
manufactured thing and this is one of

588
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:08,940
the tricks that you need to uh maybe

589
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,059
want to start learning but if we are

590
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:15,779
having similar postures similar ways of

591
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:19,200
behavior it also adds to the connection

592
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,500
we feel it makes the other thing other

593
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,640
person feel more charitable to us and

594
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,440
probably

595
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,159
gives us more information

596
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,880
um

597
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,039
and it actually there is some research

598
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,500
that it makes the person who is mimicked

599
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,779
to feel more charitable towards the

600
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:43,919
world

601
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,919
in general not just uh towards me

602
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:50,659
there's some research that they can they

603
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:52,919
go and spread the joy in the

604
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:56,299
organization for a while afterwards

605
00:28:56,299 --> 00:29:01,500
so putting the black people on if I find

606
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,260
that I've been trying to be influenced

607
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,520
in this way

608
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,179
well obviously you can start start

609
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:11,340
paying attention if you're being

610
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,500
mimicked

611
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,820
and also be attentive to you how you are

612
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,299
uh so you are not accidentally mimicking

613
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:24,779
the auditor that also happens in the

614
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:25,860
cell

615
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,720
happens sometimes

616
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,880
also if you find out that the the

617
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,980
auditor is trying to find Common Ground

618
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,919
between you common things you might

619
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,760
start to in your answers and discussions

620
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,820
to emphasize the differences of you you

621
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:48,179
have so if I said okay I've been a

622
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:50,640
developer for a while you might said oh

623
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,559
but we are developing in Python you

624
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,480
don't have any python experience do you

625
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,179
I said no no

626
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:59,820
so that is something you can do and it

627
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,740
kind of is a mood killer in the sense

628
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,580
from my uh point of view but um

629
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,460
this is one thing uh some things you can

630
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,640
do

631
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:18,080
so what else can we do

632
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:21,500
thing number four

633
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,080
people talk more when they are relaxed

634
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,740
and comfortable

635
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,820
this is something I've found that

636
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,980
in the past a lot of the audit

637
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,919
interviews were happening in this very

638
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,919
impersonal

639
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,700
meeting rooms with the big table between

640
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:49,200
you and and a gazillion of chairs and

641
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,659
an air conditioning blasting full blast

642
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:54,000
and and whatever

643
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,980
and that's not very relaxed and

644
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,220
uncomfortable situation necessarily you

645
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,700
are sitting opposite somebody who is is

646
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,899
uh keen on pumping you with all the the

647
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:09,779
information you have

648
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:12,419
this is sort of um

649
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:14,460
interesting what has happened with the

650
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,580
pandemic a lot of things things have

651
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,860
gone online

652
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,539
and initially I was totally against

653
00:31:23,539 --> 00:31:26,179
doing any kind of online

654
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:28,980
interviews with a team or Zoom or or

655
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,179
whatever

656
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,000
because

657
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,919
the connection doesn't always

658
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:41,279
convey all the nuances of the person who

659
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,320
was saying something

660
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,380
and it's not the whole experience

661
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,720
there's lots of communication that I

662
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,659
made me might be missing just for the

663
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,779
non-verbal cues and things like that

664
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:58,399
but what I found out that actually

665
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,919
interviewing somebody who is sitting in

666
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,799
their own kitchen

667
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,860
is actually a good way of of making the

668
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,720
other person feel relaxed and

669
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,260
comfortable they are in their home

670
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,100
in their home ground feeling safe secure

671
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,020
they have their favorite coffee cup in

672
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,659
there there's a brew there they can feel

673
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:25,760
uh relaxed and not pressured by anything

674
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,600
and this has a

675
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:32,760
generated some very very good audit

676
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,520
interviews people are really opening up

677
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,940
when they are uh sitting home and this

678
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,760
was a totally surprise uh for me uh

679
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,919
because I thought that maybe this is not

680
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,440
the good way of doing that

681
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,419
but so

682
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:50,520
people do talk more when they are

683
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,940
relaxed and comfortable and in their

684
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:57,080
home feeling safe and secure

685
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,299
so location and and circumstances do

686
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:02,539
matter

687
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,980
so what can can a black black people do

688
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,880
in this particular case well there's not

689
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,700
a lot you can do actually but there's

690
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,899
one thing you probably control

691
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:20,279
is that

692
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:23,760
you are of the organization being

693
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,080
audited

694
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:29,640
which means you control where the audit

695
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,159
interviews are held

696
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,000
usually I arrange the audit interviews

697
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,679
with the contact person from that

698
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,559
organization and they send out the

699
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,620
meeting invites and and say the couple

700
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,410
of of

701
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,620
[Music]

702
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,440
uh of words what is the the purpose of

703
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,840
the interview and the introduces me and

704
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,220
so on

705
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,559
you go to this person and said okay I

706
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:58,679
don't want to do this via Zoom uh I want

707
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:00,779
to uh go to

708
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:04,019
um our premises on Monday morning at

709
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:08,399
seven seven a.m uh in a meeting room

710
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,460
where the air conditioning has been off

711
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,820
all weekend and then we are going to put

712
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,080
the air conditioning on full blast

713
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,879
first thing in the morning

714
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,339
oh it's going to be

715
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:25,639
weird time in the morning

716
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:31,080
in total in a cold and and a very stuffy

717
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,359
meeting room it's not going to be a very

718
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,820
uh Pleasant discussion

719
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,099
um to us

720
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:41,040
so arrange the interview in a

721
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,460
uncomfortable location or time you have

722
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,219
that capability of course there are

723
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,980
restrictions on this if you are located

724
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,260
in let's say Robert Niemi and I'm

725
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,899
located in Helsinki your organization

726
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:59,460
Minot actually uh want to pay me uh to

727
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,040
trip to Romania so there might be some

728
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,040
practical considerations that maybe the

729
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,740
the chip is not

730
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,020
or something that they have budgeted for

731
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,060
but you can try

732
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,700
but especially with the time you have to

733
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,920
figure out whether the person doing the

734
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,900
audit is is a morning person or or

735
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,480
evening person

736
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,000
so you might uh want to check on that

737
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,920
okay and

738
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,460
on one

739
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:35,520
people will absolutely lie to protect

740
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,920
themselves they will also lie for other

741
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,160
reasons as well

742
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,119
but one of the typical reasons why

743
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,040
people lie is self-protection

744
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,920
so as an auditor I

745
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,200
need to be aware of this

746
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,900
I need to understand what kind of

747
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,420
organization it is whether I'm going to

748
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:05,280
encounter this type of of things there's

749
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,640
a different kinds of things I need to

750
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,680
consider first of all is the

751
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,740
organization psychologically safe

752
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,380
for the audience person

753
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,359
so if

754
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:21,960
if they admit they do not follow certain

755
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,220
policies or or practices mandated by

756
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,260
their

757
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,859
manuals how much trouble are they in I

758
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:33,859
need to understand this

759
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:38,220
generally speaking in uh in the Finnish

760
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,400
working life it's very much well

761
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,359
understood that these audits are not

762
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,180
trying to find

763
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,339
problems with certain people's behavior

764
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:54,480
they're looking at process faults if a

765
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,660
person does something wrong it is the

766
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,060
fault of a process of security process

767
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,200
or or something like that it's not

768
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,520
exactly the fault of that single person

769
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,880
but organizations might not be that

770
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,060
smart some organizations might be very

771
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,700
much looking for the blame game and and

772
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,420
trying to find out people that they can

773
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,339
pin on on this person

774
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:27,480
especially if the organization is is

775
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,339
based in countries where the employment

776
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:34,579
is very much

777
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:37,680
sort of hair trigger away from people

778
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,460
getting kicked out of

779
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:44,460
the company like modern Twitter where

780
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,760
single critical things of the head owner

781
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,680
will get you booted out of the company

782
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,560
in 15 minutes something like that that

783
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,040
is not a very healthy environment for

784
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,000
people to admit any kind of of problems

785
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,520
or pointing out the things to be

786
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,820
developed so I would probably expect a

787
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,540
lot of people actually lying about

788
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,520
further things

789
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,900
also the audit situation needs to be

790
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,000
psychologically safe in the sense that I

791
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,339
need to

792
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:23,760
make the person being audited feel

793
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,859
that I'm not going to blame them

794
00:38:27,859 --> 00:38:31,440
individually so usually sometimes I need

795
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,440
to focus on the person said whatever you

796
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,079
say to me is going to be marked as a

797
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:39,180
process failure but I'm not going to

798
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:43,500
name you as a a name your name in this

799
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,520
particular issues

800
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,160
um

801
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:53,760
also I need to understand

802
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,640
who is this person that is sitting

803
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,180
against uh opposite opposite me

804
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:04,980
who I am auditing what is their level of

805
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,440
commitment to the organization

806
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,240
because

807
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,780
if I'm uh talking to like a company

808
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,380
owner

809
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:20,160
their incentive in protecting themselves

810
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,820
and the company is much much more than

811
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:27,119
if I'm the engineer number 15 in a 2000

812
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,940
person uh company

813
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,099
they might not be that committed they

814
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:34,140
are going to Spill the Beans very

815
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,460
eagerly

816
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:39,320
but for example if I had a

817
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,220
interview the the

818
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,460
CTO of Boston for example I'm pretty

819
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,200
sure they would have

820
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,680
um lied there uh eyes and ears full of

821
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,920
things even if they knew that things are

822
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,480
going wrong

823
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,020
but talking about lying that we need to

824
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,320
understand that especially as Finns we

825
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,640
need to understand that they are

826
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,859
actually different kinds of or something

827
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:12,480
they what we feel put under the label of

828
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,579
lying is actually very nuanced thing

829
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:20,760
that lying for a spins is all bad but

830
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,859
there are cases where some people just

831
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:25,260
misremember something they don't they're

832
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,660
not quite sure and they are saying oh

833
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,579
yes this is a fact but they just don't

834
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:32,160
remember exact details I don't consider

835
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,859
that uh like that's not a conscious lie

836
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:36,780
it's a lie it's not the truth but it's

837
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,480
not conscious so it's a different thing

838
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,560
as well

839
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,920
and also

840
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,800
in some cases especially when I talk to

841
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,220
people from different cultures

842
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,000
if I going to

843
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,440
ask them

844
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,740
are you how are you implementing this

845
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:04,439
particular process in your daily work

846
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,260
they might not actually answer the

847
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,359
question

848
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:10,400
because

849
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,880
their superiors have defined that the

850
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,119
only correct answer to this is

851
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:20,339
yes we are doing everything we uh

852
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:22,320
everything mandated whether it's

853
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:25,079
actually factually true or not

854
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:28,320
because In some cultures whatever your

855
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,440
boss says is the truth is the truth

856
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,280
regardless of what evidence might show

857
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,740
so you need to figure out this as well

858
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,680
but generally the audit process

859
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,200
gets this uh

860
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,540
uh right because it really doesn't

861
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,839
matter how much people lie because the

862
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,480
only thing that really matters is uh to

863
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,339
Gathering the evidence

864
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:55,859
so for example I called and say them

865
00:41:55,859 --> 00:41:57,380
okay

866
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,000
do you have any Security checks in your

867
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,180
cicd pipeline and said yes we have and

868
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,359
I'm going to say okay show me the uh the

869
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:09,119
pipeline definition file so they go to

870
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,180
the GitHub or gitlab or wherever they

871
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,760
have the the and they show me that then

872
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,859
I say okay so where so do you use

873
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,079
x-ray or or sonar Cube or whatever

874
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:24,599
you're using there so what are you doing

875
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:26,760
and then they may said okay yes this is

876
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,520
this line that that calls this uh binary

877
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,760
and then I might call it okay so what

878
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,000
happens is the reports this particular

879
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,960
tool generates

880
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,720
and show me the report show me how you

881
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,820
handle that report showing what happens

882
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,460
to these things how do you close these

883
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:47,280
issues or do not so if they're just

884
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,020
saying yes we are doing fine fine

885
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:52,619
everything is uh I need to keep digging

886
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:55,020
so in that sense it really doesn't

887
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:59,400
matter if they uh they said to me that

888
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,880
that the company line is is uh that we

889
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,800
are doing everything and they are not

890
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,579
for example in in one audit I did a

891
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:10,079
while back

892
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,400
um

893
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,220
when I interviewed the people

894
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,680
and then they showed me that there is

895
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,440
actually a CI CD Pipeline with this

896
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,420
tooling installed

897
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:24,300
but it turned out and the the developer

898
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,640
said yes it's not in a blocking mode it

899
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,920
just advises

900
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,560
and and uh and I said okay can you show

901
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,859
me the report of what kind of uh advice

902
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:37,619
is it says and what they're doing it and

903
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:39,420
they were like we don't know where the

904
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,180
reports are

905
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:45,560
so it's not like kind of said okay

906
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,060
that's interesting

907
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,040
um can you find out where the reports

908
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,480
are for me

909
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,720
well they did and and they realized that

910
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,760
oops they haven't looked at the report

911
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,960
like ever

912
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,720
so I had to mark this as a fail

913
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,140
so one thing that I just Illustrated is

914
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,460
what you can do about this well

915
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,920
obviously you can't lie but like I said

916
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,200
a true auditor tries to find the

917
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,359
evidence behind what you're talking

918
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,359
about but you can fumble with the the

919
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:21,060
showing with the evidence like in my

920
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,520
example uh just now

921
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,280
he said that yes we have this the the

922
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,579
tooling gives us reports but we don't

923
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:31,140
know where they are

924
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,720
or you're trying to find them but you

925
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,380
can't find them or or you there's a this

926
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,020
um server that you just can't

927
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,720
access right now for whatever magical

928
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,140
reason there is so it shows that you are

929
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,420
doing or your best to show me the

930
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,780
evidence for but something goes wrong

931
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:55,319
and you can't do that

932
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:58,200
um that is absolutely one way of killing

933
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,940
time

934
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:04,980
and I like I said uh audits is a time

935
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:08,099
constraint process so you might get

936
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:10,520
somewhere with that

937
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,920
but in the end

938
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,200
what happened

939
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,240
when I've done all the interviews

940
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,359
gathered all the evidence

941
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:24,660
uh read all the policy papers and what

942
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:28,020
have you I'm going to write a report

943
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,720
and check all the check boxes in the

944
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,940
Excel that yes I'll talk about this one

945
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,119
here found out about that one

946
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:39,380
um however

947
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,099
um

948
00:45:41,099 --> 00:45:45,720
if I can't find evidence of something

949
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,480
what do I do next

950
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,660
well generally speaking if they saw no

951
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,940
evidence it's a problem

952
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,220
depends on what type of auditor

953
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:59,520
assessment it is it depends on how big

954
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,099
of a problem if you are like being

955
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:04,760
certified against ISO

956
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,700
27001 the absence of of certain

957
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,700
practices

958
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,839
it might be actually a major

959
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:17,760
non-conformity so you are not going to

960
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,060
pass the audit or depending on on the

961
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,099
discussion it might be that you said yes

962
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:26,400
we are actually doing this thing but uh

963
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,740
or or we haven't actually put that in

964
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:30,000
paper

965
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,099
I might put that as a minor a

966
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:34,440
non-conformity and and we'll talk about

967
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,740
that the next time I'm going to round

968
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,780
uh also

969
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:40,619
um

970
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:43,020
I could write depending on what kind of

971
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,420
auditor assessment is that the I can say

972
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,900
that uh the

973
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,640
organization claims that they have this

974
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,740
particular

975
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:55,140
process in place but the evidence could

976
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,780
not be obtained in time

977
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:03,020
because I have a deadline on the the uh

978
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,880
audit report

979
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,859
so

980
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:13,079
what I usually do if there is no if

981
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:15,960
there is something that is going to be

982
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,180
left dangling I don't have any evidence

983
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,800
somebody's saying we are going to

984
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,040
provide that information to me later I'm

985
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,380
going to talk to the people who have

986
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:28,079
ordered the Audits and say okay we can't

987
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,200
uh get this evidence do I put this in

988
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,540
the report or do you want to postpone

989
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:36,440
the report to a later date

990
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,140
depending on on how they answer I might

991
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:44,339
then flag just these things as there's

992
00:47:44,339 --> 00:47:47,160
no evidence of this but they might be

993
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,339
coming later date so leave that kind of

994
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:52,800
dangling in there

995
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,300
but the point is that that however

996
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:59,700
however much you lie

997
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,920
um it might not be enough to actually

998
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,700
throw uh derail the the audit results

999
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,660
so

1000
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:13,020
I've got summary going

1001
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,880
um

1002
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,700
interviewing people is a skill like I

1003
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:18,420
said

1004
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:21,240
I am a technical person I'm not this

1005
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:24,060
hyper focused on on people and this is

1006
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:29,160
something I have had to think a lot

1007
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,760
every time I've had an interview that

1008
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,160
has gone really badly like this I'm

1009
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,440
looking at this Excel row by row and

1010
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,079
asking so what about

1011
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:43,680
wow so what about or

1012
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,079
and the the other uh there is the

1013
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,720
interview he has basically given me one

1014
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,819
syllable answers and I've been looking

1015
00:48:50,819 --> 00:48:54,060
at going back so what went wrong

1016
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,579
and trying to figure out what to make

1017
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:59,280
this better the best audit interviews

1018
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,960
have always been they're more like

1019
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,720
Fireside Chats you have all your cup of

1020
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,520
tea and coffee and you are chatting

1021
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,940
there and the discussion is organically

1022
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:12,359
going in the directions I want because I

1023
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:15,960
make a sort of open-ended questions on

1024
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,980
on things that I want to know about and

1025
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:22,440
then we said okay oh that's interesting

1026
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,260
could you please show me uh like that

1027
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,500
minutes of that meeting or or can we go

1028
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:32,540
now the the code repository to look at

1029
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:35,520
things in there whether there's comments

1030
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,040
on on the unlicensed information on the

1031
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,759
occur or not

1032
00:49:44,099 --> 00:49:46,020
the person being ordered it you can

1033
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,420
somewhat affect the event and how it

1034
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,119
feels but hopefully

1035
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,400
you can't

1036
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,040
affect the actual end result

1037
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,160
because the idea is to gather evidence

1038
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:02,839
of things to do

1039
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,400
with my talk but since we do have a

1040
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,040
couple of minutes uh

1041
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:15,240
left I'm going to actually uh like

1042
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,859
everybody is using chat gbt

1043
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:22,099
chat give it to

1044
00:50:22,099 --> 00:50:24,780
what principles can I use to people to

1045
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:26,700
tell me about the details of the work

1046
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,819
and this is not bad actually build

1047
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:32,579
rapport I've talked about that

1048
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:34,500
or have you haven't gone to the active

1049
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,960
listening part because that's a

1050
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,640
technique

1051
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:40,319
and I'm talking about psychological

1052
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:41,579
principles

1053
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:44,880
and also there is a positive principle

1054
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,720
um

1055
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,380
the favor owing favor it I don't see

1056
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:53,400
that happening in in audit situations

1057
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,040
like foot in the door technique

1058
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,859
and that is actually a valid thing that

1059
00:50:58,859 --> 00:51:02,339
could have been so incrementally

1060
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:06,720
ask them to answer you anyone you build

1061
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,319
this question answer Rhythm it's going

1062
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:13,619
to be natural discussion flow

1063
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:17,220
then uh chat GPT tells me about you I

1064
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:19,980
usually need to use Authority I said no

1065
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,660
that's not going to work

1066
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:26,099
and and the social proof principle

1067
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:26,819
um

1068
00:51:26,819 --> 00:51:30,119
if they they will probably comply if

1069
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:32,579
they see others doing it

1070
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:35,099
haven't thought of that one I did write

1071
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:37,079
this report before I talked to a jet

1072
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:38,880
Jeep it here so

1073
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,079
and also I asked the churchibility what

1074
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:46,380
the the black people would do

1075
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:49,079
uh important to be cooperative and

1076
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:50,540
transparent

1077
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,400
uh this is not really sensible

1078
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,640
understand your rights

1079
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,520
the only good thing is here is to focus

1080
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,500
on the scope of the audit that is

1081
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,660
actually very good if you see the

1082
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,880
discussion going of the scope that's

1083
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,240
good to think but to honesty

1084
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,780
as per timer looking the uh have been uh

1085
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:15,359
discussing about the time constraints

1086
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,059
uh asking for clarification sticking to

1087
00:52:18,059 --> 00:52:19,800
the facts I don't know whether that's

1088
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,579
going to be useful but I will hope at

1089
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:26,280
least some of these things have been

1090
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,980
useful to you

1091
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,420
um do we have a couple of minutes for

1092
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,780
the questions

1093
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:35,819
anyone

1094
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,819
foreign

1095
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,460
this one

1096
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:50,359
um

1097
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,099
yes I've been in a situation for example

1098
00:53:11,099 --> 00:53:15,000
the time manipulation that there and

1099
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,460
there's been obviously an Institute

1100
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:22,579
certain situations where the uh uh

1101
00:53:22,579 --> 00:53:27,359
Oddity is is not really willing to

1102
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,420
answer a question but they will deflect

1103
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:33,480
on that but I haven't actually been a

1104
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,140
sort of major played or if I have I've

1105
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,319
totally ignored it and being happy about

1106
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:44,520
it I don't claim to be a a very good in

1107
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:48,059
in uh necessarily observing things so

1108
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:52,819
it might be that I've been had big time

1109
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,240
anything else

1110
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:59,300
the

1111
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,200
um

1112
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:23,359
well

1113
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,780
yeah but I don't really control

1114
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:29,280
necessarily where they especially when

1115
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,559
it's a remote thing I don't control

1116
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,980
where they choose to be

1117
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,079
yeah yeah

1118
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:39,180
so it's difficult for me to really

1119
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,400
manipulate them to be in a

1120
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,920
freezing outside or something

1121
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,000
and somebody yeah

1122
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,280
I'm not saying that you are stating them

1123
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,079
I want to remind

1124
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:03,660
because if you're a sales guy if you are

1125
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,760
going today if you are meeting someone

1126
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,280
these are likely requirements to have

1127
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,640
like a decent discuss with anyone so

1128
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,058
typically

1129
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,260
helps

1130
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:18,359
yes I agree

1131
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:20,360
thank you

1132
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,199
[Applause]
