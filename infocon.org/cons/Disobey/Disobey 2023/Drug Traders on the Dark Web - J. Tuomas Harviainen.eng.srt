00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,120
thank you

5
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,780
good afternoon dear audience

6
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,480
my name is Thomas harvian and I'm here

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,300
to talk about drug trading on the dark

8
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,379
web

9
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,800
this is a familiar sight

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,440
to us many times over the years we've

11
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,899
been studying this topic because you

12
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,239
can't predict in advance when suddenly

13
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,120
the community vanishes completely and

14
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,980
you have to start over

15
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,840
again

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,799
with it all

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,960
this

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,119
next speech is based on

19
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,720
three research projects I'm a cultural

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,460
scholar so if you have technical

21
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,580
questions I will point you to the

22
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,820
Wizards in our project but what we are

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,580
doing is looking at the community how

24
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,820
they trade what they trade maybe why

25
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,060
they trade and so forth

26
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,000
we run a three-year project

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,060
called extremist networks narcotics and

28
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,560
criminality in dark web environments so

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,360
encode funded by The Academy of Finland

30
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,000
the part on extremist networks and meme

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,619
production could

32
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,640
Merit a talk of its own but today I've

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,619
been asked to talk about

34
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:04,680
the drug trade another source here is

35
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,819
Cuddle talabran where we triangulate

36
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:11,520
from residue

37
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,220
from Wastewater and then online

38
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,980
discussions

39
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,260
on toxic chemicals on the marketplace

40
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,739
and try to prevent people from dying

41
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,920
drug related

42
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,780
deaths and finally there's a current

43
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,420
research project where what I'm going to

44
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,540
be telling you about next is being done

45
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,980
in Poland

46
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,319
and

47
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,020
we are doing this in different areas

48
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,420
because there's there are massive

49
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,739
differences in online drug trading from

50
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,560
one country to the next

51
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,860
Finns have a habit of talking online a

52
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,300
lot giving peer support giving advice in

53
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,120
Poland the market is especially

54
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,280
saturated with uh psychoactive chemicals

55
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,819
new compounds and so forth and since all

56
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,180
of the trading is practically happening

57
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,980
in the local language to which I will

58
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,140
return next

59
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,560
when we move the subject of study from

60
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,800
one culture to another and can access

61
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,220
the local language forums we find very

62
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,159
different cultures very different access

63
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:33,659
points and very different styles

64
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:37,800
of purchasing and especially selling

65
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,860
since some of you in the audience may

66
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,500
not be familiar with the context very

67
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,120
briefly

68
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,659
the dark web so

69
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:50,159
azudo-anonymous part of the net for

70
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,459
those of who you who are not familiar

71
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,260
with it and

72
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,040
I emphasize the Judo anonymity here I

73
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,459
know this is very much a simplification

74
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:05,700
but people expect to have a lot of

75
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,879
privacy a lot of anonymity and how they

76
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,540
navigate it is something we found very

77
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,900
interesting here so how does the typical

78
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,600
buyer

79
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,160
think how much their data it stays

80
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,380
actually private and and what can be

81
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,639
tracked or not and this affects their

82
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,440
behavior and especially the ways in

83
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,400
which people establish trust which as

84
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,740
you can think of within the context of

85
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,580
drug trading is sort of important to

86
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,780
have

87
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,500
the channel types that exist again this

88
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,800
is a simplification first of all we have

89
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,680
your average crypto Market these are the

90
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,560
most studied environments

91
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,000
uh the late

92
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:04,199
the finished Silk Road was one example

93
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,479
of this kind of thing so if you know how

94
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,360
Amazon's basic purchasing function goes

95
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,460
this goes to a lot of these sites as

96
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,120
well you place an order in this case uh

97
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,540
using probably a cryptocurrency and then

98
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,120
you get the stuff delivered either to

99
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,360
your home or to some place where you can

100
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,400
find the local cache so just order get

101
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,860
it not a lot of discussion then we have

102
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,220
vendor shops which are branches that go

103
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,919
off from these ones where you have one

104
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,100
or a few trustied sellers who establish

105
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,520
a brand of their own so again this kind

106
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,479
of

107
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:48,900
shopping opportunity in Finland these

108
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,419
are practically non-existent because the

109
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,940
market is frankly quite small

110
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,360
so doesn't pay off but

111
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,639
from our perspective and from the

112
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,560
finished perspective in a wider scale

113
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,979
the interesting thing are drug image

114
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:07,919
boards so these are places

115
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,720
very much

116
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,560
like a lot of uh open boards people

117
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,919
would post a picture of one of the drugs

118
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,360
they're selling and then have

119
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,259
information next to it like price uh

120
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:23,759
location

121
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,639
some hype words I will talk about this

122
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,979
soon and then

123
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:32,280
you establish the actual face-to-face

124
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,220
trading using an instant messaging

125
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,860
software in in the case of Finland it's

126
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,960
usually weaker

127
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,160
we'll look at this very soon and finally

128
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,039
nowadays the interesting part or closed

129
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,220
messaging app groups so the market is

130
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,280
currently already moving away from the

131
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,100
dark web and more into these my

132
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,340
invitation only groups

133
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,560
that have their own rules but still

134
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,199
follow the principles that I outline

135
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,199
here

136
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:13,139
the date I'm talking based on is mostly

137
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,220
a data set of about three million posts

138
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,560
on one of the major

139
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,800
image boards we've legally obtained it

140
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,099
with permissions to study the material

141
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:30,780
this is from a now defunct board but we

142
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,120
have data from about a dozen other

143
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,960
places and I will not be naming which

144
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,419
ones we are currently scraping in order

145
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:40,800
to

146
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,380
be able to continue the process

147
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,120
so this is what this is what it looks

148
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,699
like in practice this is actually a

149
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,039
picture from years ago and it's already

150
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,979
been published in several places so this

151
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:59,039
is from sipul econava which

152
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,979
existed before toriel Auto which was

153
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,460
mentioned earlier today and which we are

154
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,000
largely studying so first of all you

155
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,259
have the initial post with a picture of

156
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,080
the stuff that is currently on sale you

157
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,940
have details on

158
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,960
what it's supposed to be the location

159
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,919
and then

160
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,979
a request for

161
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:29,180
wicker handles

162
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,399
and as you can note the original poster

163
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,039
does not have their own handle mentioned

164
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,339
here at all so the rest of the line is

165
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,219
just these NYX this is how it's supposed

166
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:45,180
to look in practice this is one of the

167
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,140
weird areas where Finns break the

168
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,839
national stereotype and really want to

169
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,320
talk about stuff

170
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,839
this is a complaint post from an

171
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:58,700
international

172
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,480
drug trading site dread where fins were

173
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,640
overloading with their discussion

174
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,019
messages

175
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:12,060
the systems so that people in charge of

176
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,480
the site had to ask actually say like go

177
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,720
away we'll build you an own house to

178
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,160
play in so that you can continue these

179
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,820
talks but from the perspective of a

180
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,300
social scientist like myself this kind

181
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,480
of extended communication is what allows

182
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,980
us to see the people behind just the

183
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:44,580
initial posts and the short messages and

184
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,279
what we found out is

185
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,839
first of all the buyer culture

186
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,560
this is a lot broader than what the

187
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,459
media would have us believe so you have

188
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:04,320
the high end buyers who usually do not

189
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,920
use the dark web at all to make their

190
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,380
purchases so if you want to smoke uh

191
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,899
score Something Like Cocaine you don't

192
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:16,440
go on the dark web you go to your

193
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,959
contacts in in certain high-priced

194
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,660
circles and everyone else will tell you

195
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,240
that you could get a better High using

196
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,000
some other substance so it's more of a

197
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,160
fad than anything

198
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,100
then you have

199
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,640
recreational users who form the great

200
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,399
majority actually according to our

201
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,820
studies of the Finnish drug market so

202
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,980
these are people who are probably not

203
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,140
addicted

204
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,959
they are people holding steady sources

205
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,980
of income steady jobs and so forth who

206
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,560
will likely just want to have something

207
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,000
on occasion or they are not using any

208
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,779
other kinds of intoxicants we see this

209
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:07,200
especially in spikes during vacation

210
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,640
times so uh when the skiing holiday

211
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,640
comes like it's just around the corner

212
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,620
you can see rises in demand especially

213
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,260
nearby certain Winter Resorts so

214
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,920
suddenly there would be requests for a

215
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,640
buyer in that particular area or these

216
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,540
um

217
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,260
almost desperate shouts like would

218
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,779
anyone be able to sell us something near

219
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:41,940
kitila or things like this

220
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,540
so your typical buyer is a recreational

221
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,560
person not a junkie who has lost control

222
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,079
and those are actually looked down upon

223
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,680
in drug culture so at the time when you

224
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,440
are not seen as being in control of your

225
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,019
life even when you are using substances

226
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:04,380
it means you drop to the bottom of the

227
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,860
hierarchy we see this segment in these

228
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,700
environments still as well but they are

229
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,260
not as said

230
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,339
the majority

231
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,140
the trouble with this kind of business

232
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,560
is that everything is basically a risk

233
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,980
so you can't trust the seller who is

234
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,579
just an anonymous

235
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:31,380
poster somewhere and you're supposed to

236
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,200
meet this person could be a cop

237
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,839
could be someone who's out to rob you

238
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,100
and so forth and the traditional tools

239
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,399
of establishing trust in online trading

240
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,220
are of course used here as well

241
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,680
so you have recommendations you have

242
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,220
buyer feedback on quality and things

243
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,060
like this and you have escrow systems

244
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,279
the problem with all of these of course

245
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,620
from the buyer's perspective especially

246
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,339
is that they can all be faked

247
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:08,880
so you have false recommendations we

248
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,660
know that people look at how soon after

249
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,320
a supposed trade feedback comes or how

250
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,860
quickly after someone advertises a

251
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,639
product there appear to be similar kinds

252
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,220
of posts saying that this is really good

253
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,440
stuff and then you have the angry

254
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,959
comments below like you've probably

255
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,060
faked all of your feedback we're not

256
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,160
buying from you we don't know if they

257
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,800
actually still do but mostly there's a

258
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,639
lot of

259
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,579
hate mail kind of thing same with open

260
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:42,959
feedback

261
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,420
two posts saying that yes this was

262
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,180
really good stuff and then the third one

263
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,480
says this was crap don't trust it this

264
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,639
seller was posting his own

265
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,120
recommendations finally have the we have

266
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,320
the a lot applauded escrow systems you

267
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,320
send in your payments it's released to

268
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,320
the seller once you have received the

269
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,680
product or someone says something has

270
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,160
been received not only untrustworthy it

271
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,040
has the unfortunate side effect of

272
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,540
piling up a lot of online payments

273
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,300
in the control of the site in question

274
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,560
and we've already seen exit scams when

275
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,980
suddenly some millions in cryptocurrency

276
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,620
completely vanish so people are not

277
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,940
likely to trust escrow systems either so

278
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,240
what do they trust is their own personal

279
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,040
readings of the post that they see

280
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,160
so a lot of people seem to be going in

281
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,180
this with next to no trust on actual

282
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,540
operational security so whereas the

283
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,199
people who are maintaining the sites pay

284
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,899
a lot of attention to security issues

285
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,980
your average buyer does not they believe

286
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,220
apparently that the trading is likely

287
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,720
anonymous

288
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,360
which it is not but it would take a lot

289
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,720
of effort to find out who a particular

290
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,980
user is

291
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,040
plus they trust the fact that it's a

292
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,339
small purchase this stands in quite a

293
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:28,740
lot of contrast with the fact that as

294
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,260
mentioned just before a lot of these

295
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,620
people are those who have something to

296
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,860
lose by being caught by the police in

297
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,620
this case so people who hold steady jobs

298
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,079
or other sources of income and so forth

299
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:46,320
so we've been quite surprised by the low

300
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,339
level

301
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:53,120
of paying attention to security issues

302
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,639
people seem to be quite happy for

303
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,940
instance at least some to use the same

304
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,959
names for their uh buying accounts with

305
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:08,540
which they have stuff on Instagram

306
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,300
Tinder their personal blogs and so forth

307
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,920
so

308
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,139
not exactly

309
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:19,019
completely security conscious Behavior

310
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,720
here or maybe they just don't have

311
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,639
anything to lose but what people turn to

312
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,600
as sources of establishing some sort of

313
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,540
a trust system first of all the image

314
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,600
created by the store so choose the right

315
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,620
nickname appear trustworthy shower

316
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,959
Praise on the stuff you're selling hope

317
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,380
to elicit positive feedback

318
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,240
and so forth

319
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,500
so marketing as something that would

320
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,199
establish a sufficient level of trust

321
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,399
until you have a good number enough of

322
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,079
uh steady

323
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:04,380
buyers who know you personally and you

324
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,040
who can contact you directly to make the

325
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,740
purchases the second element for trust

326
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:15,299
is outright racism this is blatant in

327
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:19,919
these forums so your average post is is

328
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,640
almost always stating that I will only

329
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:30,480
sell to people who are born fins it

330
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,140
and I am a member of this demographic

331
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,460
myself

332
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,520
anything else seems to be something that

333
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,940
is definitely not advertised I know from

334
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,059
interviews with people who are either

335
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,880
buying or selling that this is actually

336
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,240
a flexible rule but in this post it

337
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,820
seemed to be like this General Norm that

338
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,899
everyone is saying but

339
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,679
so stress free

340
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,080
finish Trading

341
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,860
and finally we have

342
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,020
convenience so whenever people really

343
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,720
need to score something and they can't

344
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,380
find the right Source then a lot of

345
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,140
these other rules fly straight out from

346
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,260
the window and they just try the seller

347
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,100
who is conveniently nearby so the rule

348
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,600
of actually least effort

349
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,020
is something that functions here as well

350
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,720
and with

351
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,559
buyers side of the equation

352
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:44,400
ethnicity again so emphasizing that the

353
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,640
person coming to do the purchase is a

354
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,179
native fin is seen as a potential

355
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:53,820
element by the sellers it's their first

356
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,900
inclination on whether they will show up

357
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,840
and show their faces for the uh

358
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,419
face-to-face trading to take place so

359
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,820
they give you one look and then decide

360
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,539
whether they can sell to you or not

361
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:12,720
second Criterion is age and I don't mean

362
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,460
the wide range but they do not as a rule

363
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,299
sell to miners this can be an ethical

364
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:24,480
consideration and I personally hope that

365
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,980
it is but it's most likely because you

366
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,440
get punished a lot more severely

367
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,660
according to the Finnish law

368
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,140
and in other countries as well if you

369
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,440
sell to a person who is underage so this

370
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,799
is actually a rule of self-protection

371
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,660
and finally and this is something we've

372
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,679
noticed in whichever country we have

373
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,160
been conducting these studies currently

374
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,200
which is

375
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,299
five six now is the use of language so

376
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,539
the right kind of language

377
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:06,299
opens the doors for being able to trade

378
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:10,380
and for people to take your posts on the

379
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,100
Forum seriously so enough spelling

380
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,620
mistakes

381
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,400
and then the right uses of slang and

382
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,980
also the same thing in the face-to-face

383
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,760
trading so the first thing if you see a

384
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,400
completely polished post that has

385
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,280
perfect finish in its text and describes

386
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,000
the product very well then

387
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,419
the first posts under its state

388
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:43,020
hello copper

389
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,580
so

390
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,059
if you are doing it too well and and are

391
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:51,360
using too good language you look you

392
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,240
stand out from the crowd

393
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,299
this is what a typical

394
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:00,179
post looks like

395
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:03,660
so as a basic rule first you open up

396
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:09,000
with praise so the best acid on this

397
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,440
Market at this price really efficient

398
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,559
then you have a few words like welcome

399
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,240
to trade with me I am a native Finn

400
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,880
located here and either delivering

401
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,840
directly to your door or saying that you

402
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,640
can pick up this stuff from Cornell

403
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,020
making

404
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:35,520
the way it's paid usually no small coins

405
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,620
have the cash ready

406
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,159
then a threat we are prepared for rats

407
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:43,919
this is also part of the the rigor of

408
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,360
everything

409
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,059
I don't know if they're empty or not and

410
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:52,020
finally maybe the seller's username and

411
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,200
the response posts outside of discussion

412
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,460
areas are just usernames

413
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,760
here again you can see this in the

414
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,240
earlier slide in action the basic

415
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,940
formula almost a classic we can annotate

416
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,280
these very quickly

417
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,500
in the data set

418
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,020
then we have the typical doxies whenever

419
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,020
they find the rats they try their best

420
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,720
to share out the information in order to

421
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,140
get this person hurt this is the formula

422
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,980
for that one wicker name rat

423
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,280
a few slurs lives here

424
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,860
reason for harming this person and

425
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,480
finally a wish for Collective

426
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,120
retribution which usually doesn't take

427
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,419
place as Scholars we hate these because

428
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:45,140
think about it three million posts

429
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,179
everyone's Anonymous we can just use the

430
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:50,520
stuff for analysis then you have people

431
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,640
throwing third-party names in it and

432
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,380
suddenly large chunks of the data become

433
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,240
useless we needed to cut

434
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,840
several weeks of material away from this

435
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,000
simply because people were sharing most

436
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,700
common names so all of the data from

437
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,179
those days has completely been removed

438
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:15,860
one final point I want to make on

439
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,120
expertise since we are talking here

440
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,539
about experts whereas I say that some

441
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:25,740
people are really not conscious about

442
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,980
security issues and things like this

443
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,580
you have a small user demographic that

444
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,780
is really really high level expert these

445
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,539
manifest especially in topics about the

446
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,880
site's security

447
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,520
on anything that deals with stolen

448
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,520
Hardware with credits and other types of

449
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,000
Fraud and then

450
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,039
pharmacological Bro Science so there's a

451
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,280
thriving Community giving advice to

452
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,580
others including interestingly on how to

453
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,700
quit certain substances so there's peer

454
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,159
support for those who want to leave the

455
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:08,039
community and the people are

456
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:11,520
University level experts on the co-fe

457
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,340
effects of certain substances and so

458
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,980
forth at the same time these are the

459
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,500
areas where precisely you see the most

460
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,799
clueless posts as well so sort of how do

461
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,799
I get access to stolen bank accounts

462
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,919
kind of things desperate for help or

463
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:33,360
cops looking for easy targets

464
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,720
now I mentioned the groups

465
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,080
early on what we are currently seeing is

466
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,059
a clear move from the dark web forums to

467
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,260
other

468
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,919
media especially closed groups on for

469
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,700
example WhatsApp telegram session and so

470
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,780
forth what platform is adopted seems to

471
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,240
be a question of the local communication

472
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,679
culture again the language matters a lot

473
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,000
so

474
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,820
the Polish market currently using email

475
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,580
who knows what's next in Finland it's

476
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,400
been weaker but now these other things

477
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,799
as well and so forth

478
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:23,179
locating a target for us to study

479
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:26,279
interestingly difficult a lot of fun at

480
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:28,980
the same time and something I was asked

481
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,799
before coming on stage neither the

482
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:36,120
corona nor the war has had a huge impact

483
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,659
on the drug Market even though lines

484
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:42,059
from especially the Russian border have

485
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:44,640
been closed so some substances have been

486
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,679
Vanishing some sites have been Vanishing

487
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:49,080
but that's about it temporary

488
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,779
availability is the only significant

489
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:55,919
change we've seen so far

490
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,100
now my Jeep advertisement very quickly

491
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,960
we're going to be running a cyber crime

492
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,779
mini truck which includes a lot of stuff

493
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:06,720
on the drug trade but also anything that

494
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,000
would be technically oriented I hear

495
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Hawaii is really lovely in January so

496
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,279
consider submitting if you want a good

497
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:18,720
excuse to go there and finally the data

498
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,120
I talk about here

499
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,380
has just been made open for other

500
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,360
researchers on different areas it's

501
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,000
called fin dark and it's these three

502
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,400
million online posts

503
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,200
uh that we've been working on curated

504
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,500
not to contain personal identifiers if

505
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,320
you want access to it send me an email

506
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,720
I'm the gatekeeper who has to be

507
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,580
convinced that what you are going to be

508
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,779
doing with it is useful and legit but it

509
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:55,140
exists out there and you can study the

510
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,860
community a lot more if you want

511
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,559
here's a quick list of Publications the

512
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:04,320
second one is probably the most

513
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,360
interesting here which is our data

514
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,640
policy paper where we talk about the

515
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,440
security

516
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,600
ethics and so forth issues so if you're

517
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,820
interested it's completely open access

518
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,279
and I will not be passing a microphone

519
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:24,299
around here just pull my sleeve in the

520
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:27,059
audience later today if you have any

521
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,100
questions I'll do my best to either

522
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,440
answer or

523
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,679
give you the contact information of the

524
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:36,840
more technically oriented people we've

525
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,960
had in the same project or the linguists

526
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,440
for that matter and I've answered my one

527
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,480
question which comes always from the

528
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,600
audience yes the police are interested

529
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,360
yes they have their own tools and yes

530
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,940
whenever I meet them we do this

531
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,760
interesting dance where both sides are

532
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,559
trying to give something to the other

533
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,500
for discussion's sake but we're actually

534
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,960
not telling anyone anything from the

535
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,860
other side of the discussion so that's

536
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,380
what happens and with this

537
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,070
I thank you

538
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:17,720
[Applause]
