5
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,680
hello everybody Welcome to my talk about

6
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,219
locked Sky boats try to make a joke here

7
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,960
I don't know if anybody recognizes but

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,379
it's from XKCD so the thing explained

9
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,480
are using only 1 000 words so if they're

10
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,879
like the most common 1000 words of the

11
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,100
English language

12
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,719
I'm not gonna do the talk in that way

13
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,699
don't worry I'm gonna use normal words

14
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,159
and it's gonna be all normal English

15
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,659
language I hope

16
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,040
so

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,260
I'm Ben I'm going to introduce myself in

18
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,159
a little bit like a little bit more

19
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,140
detail but

20
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,720
um basically to start off with

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,500
I have this quote about Aviation

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,100
um

23
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,920
I guess somebody might recognize who did

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,119
it

25
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:24,840
um

26
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,520
is there anybody who knows can you raise

27
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,840
your hand maybe just you don't have to

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,020
or you can shout the name of the person

29
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,939
nobody

30
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,340
um so basically electric supersonic

31
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,400
vital heart problem was set by Elon Musk

32
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,860
and

33
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,860
Vito I try to not use abbreviations in

34
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,020
this talk but just on the first slide I

35
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,720
had to because it's a quote so we told

36
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,280
vertical takeoff and Landing basically

37
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,100
is this next generation of aircraft and

38
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,960
as you can see here

39
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,780
people find this not too easy like

40
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,720
people find that building a veto seems

41
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,060
to be like a really hard problem

42
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,259
um

43
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,960
a year later same person

44
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,060
said this no I think it's incredible

45
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,380
difficult to bring an aircraft to

46
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,300
production and meet all the regulatory

47
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,640
requirements worldwide it's a very

48
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,200
difficult thing

49
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,540
so you can see there's like this person

50
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,920
who basically made electrically Vehicles

51
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,160
like cars available for everybody who

52
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,860
introduce space flight and reintroduce

53
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,599
space flight in the US as a really big

54
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,379
thing

55
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,560
but he is saying the aircraft no I won't

56
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,260
touch and over the next years there were

57
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,060
more quotes but I just want to keep it

58
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,180
like that and like yes it is difficult

59
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,940
it seems to be difficult for most of the

60
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,680
people it seems to be not approach

61
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,440
approachable it seems to be like an

62
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,660
problem which is really really hard to

63
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,980
solve

64
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,480
so

65
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,340
everybody knows this car

66
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,840
that's a Delorean from Back to the

67
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,680
Future

68
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,319
it literally was a vital in that sense

69
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,599
it was a car which could fly at some

70
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,940
point a vertical attack of a landing so

71
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,099
it didn't need any Runway or you don't

72
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,440
need roads where you're going

73
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,239
um yes it was a time machine as well but

74
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,280
let's not talk about this like this is a

75
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,319
different topic so

76
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,360
looking back at what Elon Musk says and

77
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,580
like this quote this seems to be like

78
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,720
some some dream some unsolvable thing

79
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,200
um but is it actually is Aviation so

80
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,420
hard and like is it such a difficult

81
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,400
topic to address or like to deal with or

82
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,080
to work in

83
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,420
um it all comes back to the dream of

84
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,659
flying so coming back to XKCD I mean

85
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,640
what else would you expect

86
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,280
it's the dream of everybody to like at

87
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,659
some point like you know you keep

88
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,159
running and at some point you just take

89
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,860
off and you can go wherever you want and

90
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,379
it's like getting from point A to B like

91
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,840
the direct route like you can go like

92
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,500
directly from here to Oslo to Copenhagen

93
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,780
like you don't need to like take the car

94
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,299
somewhere like up Norway or down again

95
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:05,220
or stuff like that you don't have to

96
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,959
cross water in that sense so you just

97
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,420
like go from A to B

98
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,220
um it's three-dimensional that sounds

99
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,680
fun I mean like going up and down and

100
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,918
not just like left and right or straight

101
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:19,858
um they seem to be quite unreachable for

102
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,079
a lot of people as well like it's you

103
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,759
know like this it's a little bit like

104
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,120
gazing at the stars and thinking like

105
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,979
how do I get there like how can I reach

106
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,740
it and planes I mean they are closer you

107
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,900
can see them at airports you can get on

108
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,820
them on airports you can fly with them

109
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,120
but still like how do they work what is

110
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,280
it behind it why do they fly that's all

111
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,919
like kind of for most people Mysteries

112
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,919
and obviously it's fun I don't know like

113
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,440
the feeling of freedom and I mean there

114
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,820
is the simulator upstairs I haven't

115
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,620
flown it yet I was considering to skip

116
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,320
my talk just to take a chance but here I

117
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,340
am

118
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,900
um but I guess it's worthwhile to check

119
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,040
it out upstairs

120
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,720
um probably it's fun and some adrenaline

121
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,400
considering it's like a military

122
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,620
aircraft

123
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,840
um but who am I actually like why do I

124
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,940
talk about Aviation why didn't I

125
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,340
actually mention cyber security yet like

126
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,580
and why am I called cyberband

127
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,419
um

128
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,280
so that's me

129
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,220
or maybe that was me a while ago like 30

130
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,860
plus years maybe I don't know you see I

131
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,440
grew up in a time where you didn't

132
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,060
really have a computer at hand all the

133
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,520
time so there was still analog things

134
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,080
um I've been running from away from

135
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,180
reality since the late 90s 80s sorry

136
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,460
that was when I born um you can see I've

137
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,800
been living in a few countries and I

138
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,539
across the globe you could say I mean

139
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,419
New Zealand was the first I was getting

140
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:44,280
and that's just living in in these

141
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,800
countries um I've been traveling much

142
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,479
more than that

143
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,639
um I claim to be educated in Flight

144
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,080
controls guy board computers and

145
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,300
security what does that mean

146
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,100
um basically

147
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,400
um I studied avionics so

148
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,440
I have like a degree in how to actually

149
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,660
build aircraft systems I I have

150
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,600
developed my uh my own like uh

151
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,060
navigation system for like artificial

152
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,500
aircraft like in a whole group project

153
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,440
with like 90 students and Engineers

154
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,639
um

155
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,699
I know flight controls um yeah I I know

156
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:20,039
how to fly a plane I've been flying a

157
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,500
few types of planes I have a few like

158
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,000
eight or ten flight lessons on a

159
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,639
helicopter don't try this that's just

160
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,539
crazy it just wants to crash immediately

161
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:33,300
um and yeah I I also studied security I

162
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,400
started off like studying embedded

163
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,020
security and specializing in this area

164
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,500
kind of merging the topic of

165
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,660
the computers on an aircraft as well as

166
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,580
like them being a better system the

167
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,979
security of them

168
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:47,880
um

169
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,919
probably not the right phrasing but role

170
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,120
playing experience in a corporate

171
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,020
environment

172
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,740
um

173
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,380
I've been Consulting a lot of Aviation

174
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,780
companies I've done things on a

175
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,400
technical side I've certain risk

176
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,220
assessments I have managed a team of

177
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,199
aircraft security Engineers as an ad

178
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,960
manufacturer like I've been around quite

179
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,060
a bit and I can tell you I haven't seen

180
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,759
the talk before about Mental Health

181
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:13,319
uh Aviation and security is not a

182
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,600
healthy Thing by itself but it's

183
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,280
manageable if you just start focusing on

184
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,199
the right things

185
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,819
and nowadays

186
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:23,639
um living close by I mean

187
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,580
there's somebody from Thailand I guess

188
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,940
uh some more yeah but I moved to

189
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,940
Thailand um because Finland was a little

190
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,800
bit too much of people around me like

191
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,440
the first row kind of

192
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,940
and somewhere over there some more

193
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,280
people like I've been living in Finland

194
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,139
before working for this company called

195
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,080
fcq at that time but now yeah I'm I'm

196
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,300
living in Thailand and I'm actually

197
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,880
having my own company so nowadays I'm

198
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,220
Consulting for like aerospace companies

199
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,300
by myself

200
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,740
because

201
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,539
it is a challenging topic there's a lot

202
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,460
of companies around and the best way to

203
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,639
do it is to just go ahead and build up

204
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,580
your network and like do it by yourself

205
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,340
so yeah I I kind of claim I know this

206
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,340
this world of Aviation and also like the

207
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,740
security world so I've been working in

208
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,800
this domains like both of them for a

209
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,020
while and I have seen a lot of things in

210
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,780
a lot of companies countries

211
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,520
um some of the stuff you don't even want

212
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,680
to know potentially but

213
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,599
if you ask me nicely and I can talk

214
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,699
about it I'm happy to share any insights

215
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,300
or experience

216
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:35,458
um so the news you always have to kind

217
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:39,419
of like make draw a picture on like what

218
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,099
is actually Aviation and cyber security

219
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,520
and what is actually like publicly known

220
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,680
what are people talking about there's

221
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,600
the usual news is about like plain

222
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,980
hacked

223
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,019
airport hacked

224
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,959
Airline hacked

225
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,060
the new one really like fancy is

226
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,740
pictures sent via airdrop like

227
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,600
passengers sitting on the aircraft just

228
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,060
looking for like iPhones which are open

229
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,680
to receive images and just sending them

230
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,720
out they have been like normal pictures

231
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,720
being sent selfies there might have been

232
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,420
some pictures about bombs being on the

233
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,640
aircraft or stuff like that which you

234
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,080
don't want to have on an aircraft which

235
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,420
is about to take off because passengers

236
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,060
don't like that

237
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,019
um

238
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,240
then there's this usual statement like

239
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,339
which comes from a lot of people

240
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:27,540
regulations are changing too slow it's

241
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,440
like

242
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,080
why is there no security or old aircraft

243
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,540
why don't we see what is being done in

244
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,700
security Aviation but if you actually

245
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,560
like working in this area you know

246
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,120
what's going on and what is being done

247
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,459
but the news are the news

248
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,740
and then this usual ransomware at tier 2

249
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,740
supplier like some supplier from the

250
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,720
aviation world having being attacked by

251
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,839
some sophisticated hackers who've

252
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,880
encrypted all the hard drives which was

253
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,440
at the end just a simple mail

254
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,200
attachments and somebody clicked it and

255
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,000
then it just happened

256
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,200
so

257
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,080
today to actually help you a little bit

258
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,380
to understand what this Aviation cyber

259
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,480
security is what is Aviation how does it

260
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,180
work how do we get from a drawing of an

261
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,100
aircraft to an actual aircraft and how

262
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,140
does security actually fit in there so

263
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,000
basically the the engineering

264
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,920
perspective like the cyber security

265
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,800
engineering perspective I try to bring

266
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,019
it to you like open it up for you and

267
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:26,700
give you an idea what this actually is

268
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,720
about

269
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,820
so we're going to talk about Sky boats

270
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,220
like the aircraft like

271
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,100
why they fly how they fly how they

272
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,019
exchange after a while or like how

273
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:39,660
they're being improved and yes we're

274
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,980
going to talk about crush it but it

275
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,660
sounds bad to actually put it out so

276
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,519
it's not that official that we're

277
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,839
talking about crashing aircraft but

278
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,440
there might be some information about it

279
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,060
then

280
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,240
we have like building the sky board so

281
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,920
basically building the aircraft like

282
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,140
what components do you need what kind of

283
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,880
systems are being involved in like

284
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,579
building the sky boat and like how do

285
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,040
you test it how do you break it things

286
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,959
like that so basically end to end like

287
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,700
where does it come from where where does

288
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,740
it end up and then there's like some

289
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,959
security around like how is it actually

290
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,779
being isolated secured how do you

291
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,220
actually test on an aircraft from a

292
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,980
security perspective as well as how do

293
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,779
you when you operate the aircraft how do

294
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:23,040
you manage it

295
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,160
so drafted Builder tested break it again

296
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,140
a quote from a random person from the

297
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,100
internet

298
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,200
um I have a QR code later for him I

299
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,160
think

300
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,899
um it's a nice YouTube channel about a

301
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:35,220
person from America who's building

302
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,220
aircraft but uh fasten your seat belts

303
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,339
nobody has them but literally let's go

304
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:43,860
into the like more technical more

305
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,260
interesting part of it

306
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,380
um

307
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:54,540
abbreviations my day-to-day

308
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,279
um I would assume most of you people

309
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:00,000
recognize maybe a few abbreviations

310
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,220
um I'm gonna have now like 15 slides

311
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,839
with abbreviation of explaining like the

312
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,000
terms so bear with me no just kidding um

313
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,980
it's crazy if you know security

314
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,600
abbreviations and then you go into

315
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,360
Innovation you have three times the

316
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,700
amount of abbreviations and every

317
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,120
manufacturer every supplier is naming

318
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,339
the the system in a different way even

319
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:26,040
though it's the same system so

320
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,779
don't want to scare you with this I'm

321
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,640
not going to talk about it but this is a

322
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,100
reality this is where it is this is what

323
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,000
I deal with on my day-to-day talking to

324
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,839
manufacturers suppliers Airlines

325
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,399
whatever

326
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,200
um but yeah there's not going to be 15

327
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,959
slides species like the veto was the

328
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,680
only abbreviation I hope in the slides

329
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,600
so let's start with the first point fly

330
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,260
it so again just to reconfirm with you

331
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,120
trust me I'm an engineer

332
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,880
I've been working for a certain

333
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,440
manufacturer before I started my own

334
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,120
business so I've been working actually

335
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,940
on vital aircraft I've been the manager

336
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,920
for cyber security there I've been

337
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,480
running the whole team setting up

338
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,120
everything which is needed for security

339
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,480
uh so yes I've been around there

340
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,100
so

341
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,899
referring to those talk which was coming

342
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:19,380
after me about the maritime world

343
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,240
boats float on the water that's the fact

344
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,220
I mean if you look at a boat it floats

345
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,519
it doesn't sink so same applies for

346
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,620
aircraft they float on the air literally

347
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,740
it's just another liquid so there we

348
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,360
have Imperial evidence if you're

349
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,760
wondering why planes fly I'm not going

350
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,320
to explain it to you that sort of

351
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,880
physics about it

352
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,339
um this is just how we have to deal with

353
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:42,839
it right now that should be enough for

354
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,880
us if somebody wants to know more about

355
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,459
it uh that probably would be one of the

356
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,779
points where I would say please don't

357
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:50,760
ask me to explain it to you

358
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,639
I've even I studied avionics the flight

359
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,100
Dynamics and everything behind it

360
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,180
depending on the aircraft I don't even

361
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,880
want to know why they fly and if you

362
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,920
look at these big Beluga aircraft from

363
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,480
Airbus like the ones which can open up

364
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,620
on the front

365
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,360
even the engineers at Airbus sometimes

366
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,100
said like yeah we don't even know why it

367
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,060
flies

368
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,440
it's

369
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,600
just flies we are lucky

370
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,720
and obviously aircraft are not alone

371
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,940
there's a lot of network communication

372
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,399
between the aircraft so you can assume

373
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,100
that these nowadays are well connected

374
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,880
and that's necessary so

375
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,560
maybe if you take a little bit of the

376
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,779
magic out of it while they fly this

377
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,579
image you see there's a lot of magic

378
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,040
involved that's if you ask me how they

379
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,600
fly this is how I would explain to you

380
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,519
why they fly and how they fly

381
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,459
um how do they change over time so kind

382
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:47,100
of the first aircraft first flight

383
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,880
ride buses so we have moved on from

384
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,160
there we have changed the aircraft quite

385
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,260
a bit I mean I don't even know if this

386
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,579
had an engine I think there were like

387
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:00,480
two propellers that's about it and I

388
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,120
wouldn't argue that this is flying in a

389
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,399
sense of nowadays because it's more like

390
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,199
yeah you're gliding above the ground

391
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,120
you're just lucky that you're not

392
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,459
touching it anymore

393
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:14,399
um so you see nowadays the aircraft like

394
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,660
I said they have to communicate so

395
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,160
there's a lot of increase in

396
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,339
connectivity we've gone from where you

397
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:21,480
actually

398
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,760
ping the aircraft and based on the reply

399
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,980
the aircraft knows where it is

400
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,440
that's how it started nowadays there's

401
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,579
GPS there's Galileo for Europe there's

402
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:34,800
internal sensors who calculate your

403
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,720
position pretty precisely for quite a

404
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,920
long time

405
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,620
it all improved and it all connected you

406
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,779
I think in Europe or at least in Germany

407
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,699
as far as I know like nowadays you don't

408
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,139
even have to turn off your phone anymore

409
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:47,399
on the aircraft

410
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,740
so flight mode

411
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,399
is it still necessary so we are changing

412
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,199
constantly we are increasing the

413
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,760
connectivity we are connecting more and

414
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,959
more systems

415
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,779
this comes as well with automation

416
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:03,000
usually I would put this picture of like

417
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,620
an old

418
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,300
um Concord aircraft where you can see

419
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,980
you have two pilots and then you have

420
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,019
the flight engineer and then potentially

421
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:12,180
you have the radio Engineers so you used

422
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,880
to have a lot of people in the cockpit

423
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,980
responsible for a lot of

424
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,620
activities so not a single person was

425
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,980
responsible for at all that changed

426
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,639
um

427
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:25,920
then we're just directly related to the

428
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,079
flight code reduction so basically we

429
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,320
are nowadays at this point in theory so

430
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,899
just one person sitting in front we

431
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,839
trust him to handle any situation and I

432
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:39,779
mean to be honest most of the time

433
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:41,940
who's flying the aircraft

434
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,519
like I mean the pilot is doing takeoff

435
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,560
and landing and besides that there's

436
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,959
like one knob he maybe has to turn

437
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:49,800
um

438
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,820
and that's about it is it still like

439
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,399
this big job and then

440
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,380
look at incidents who are which are

441
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,360
happening or look at things which might

442
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,220
happen in aircraft so what happens if a

443
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,500
system fails so the pilots they're

444
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,199
supposed to know their aircraft really

445
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,720
well because if the system fails they

446
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,579
have they have a checklist how to react

447
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:12,480
to that

448
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,359
but that's like quite a challenging

449
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,160
situation to be in if you're like close

450
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,260
to landing and like it says oh the

451
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,540
landing gear doesn't go down

452
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,260
would you be able to manage like saying

453
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,959
okay I have to keep flying I guess oh I

454
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,240
have to tell somebody that I keep flying

455
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,340
uh and where do I actually go now

456
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,559
because I was supposed to stop at this

457
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,419
end of the runway like

458
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:39,780
how do I do this so even though I say as

459
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,240
a title improve it is it actually

460
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,160
Improvement or is it just like putting

461
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,780
all this Automation in it that actually

462
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,360
the human factor kind of is being

463
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,539
removed or neglected like we will maybe

464
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,100
see

465
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,580
um digitalization uh a big word can mean

466
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,059
a lot and like every other industry

467
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:02,280
it's happening in aviation as well

468
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,440
like you have your phone app with your

469
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,380
boarding pass when you go to the airport

470
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,740
you don't print anything out like

471
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,799
the flight plan is being transmitted

472
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,480
automatically to the aircraft like it's

473
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,419
just a matter of sending some bits over

474
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:21,240
um Pilots used to have this big

475
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,900
Tully like with all the handbooks and

476
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,760
all the paper which was like 20 25

477
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,860
kilograms they had to carry it around

478
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,539
but as you can see in this bottom

479
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,160
picture as well maybe like on the left

480
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,539
hand side basically

481
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:35,460
that's the tablet and all the

482
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,740
information is on a tablet It's All

483
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,539
Digital nowadays there's like barely any

484
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,460
paperwork being done

485
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,380
um I think the most likely thing for

486
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,720
like a plane on the airport with paper

487
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,299
is transferred is when the pilot gets

488
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:49,620
the weight and balance information so

489
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,419
basically how many passengers do we have

490
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,160
on board how many luggage do we have on

491
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,320
board to calculate

492
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,780
what do we need to take off at the point

493
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:00,000
where we need to take off because if you

494
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,380
are too heavy on the front and you try

495
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,299
to take off your aircraft doesn't want

496
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,720
to go up uh that can be quite bad

497
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,000
and then the fancy word of e-enablement

498
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,820
so basically and I'm gonna go a little

499
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,380
bit more into detail when I go more on

500
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,320
the engineering perspective is that the

501
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,000
entity systems on the aircraft are

502
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,419
getting more and more integrated so it

503
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:24,240
used to be this really random boxes or

504
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,500
like a lot of boxes with different

505
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,440
systems that look like a mess it took a

506
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,880
lot of space and nowadays this e

507
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,919
enablement is kind of more integrated

508
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,260
and also again the e and e and

509
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,640
enablement doesn't stand for security

510
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,160
but for

511
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,620
connectivity

512
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,660
I don't even know what it stands for to

513
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,919
be honest

514
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,260
um so let's not talk about crashing an

515
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,820
aircraft

516
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,840
um

517
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,760
crashes are definitely not anticipated

518
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,740
in aviation I mean there's they put

519
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,600
numbers on it like there's this nice

520
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,820
number of 10 to the minus nine there's

521
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,940
talking about catastrophic so

522
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,960
like I don't want to say it's

523
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,880
anticipated but based on like the

524
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,380
calculations

525
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,840
at some point in our field crash and we

526
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,720
have seen that but it should be so low

527
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,460
that like whenever you're doing your

528
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,900
maintenance activities and follow the

529
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,240
processes that at the end like it's

530
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,100
really really unlikely that the plane

531
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,559
will crash because a system fails and

532
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:21,059
this is like really about the systems on

533
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,039
board this doesn't calculate human

534
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,160
factors into account like so it doesn't

535
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,200
anticipate a pilot going crazy on an

536
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,880
aircraft or things like that

537
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,980
but yeah it's like I say I'm not going

538
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,299
to call it anticipated but there's

539
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,240
numbers which are used to actually

540
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,960
like yeah to accept it in a way

541
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,720
and also

542
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,220
not about talking crashing it

543
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,679
necessarily but you would be surprised

544
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,539
if you fly especially like on the

545
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,059
regional flights in Europe like when you

546
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:54,000
fly with an Airbus A320 1921 whatever

547
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,740
it's the same aircraft at the end just

548
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,120
different size

549
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,240
and then you fly with an A320 Neo

550
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,240
um it's actually it the same aircraft

551
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,000
even on the A320 new you could find

552
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,500
floppy disks

553
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,480
because what did they do they just used

554
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,640
the old aircraft put new engines on gave

555
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,799
it a new name it's more efficient here

556
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:14,640
we go

557
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,140
there might be some more changes than

558
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,360
just the engine but it's literally

559
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,640
says next engine option which is like

560
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,980
yes or new engine option so it's a new

561
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,960
one the same is Boeing

562
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,679
um 737 727 Max 727 Ng

563
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:31,080
um and I mean it's sadly fitting on this

564
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,179
slide when I say crash it but

565
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:35,220
the max incident on the boring topic

566
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,780
that's kind of like where all this

567
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,940
engineering plays a role and maybe you

568
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,760
might understand more later how the

569
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,320
Boeing incident if you're aware of that

570
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,740
like the 727 Max issue actually really

571
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,900
relates to the Engineering Process which

572
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,240
is being used in aviation

573
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,400
and obviously like I said like you're

574
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,260
you're learning a lot from these kind of

575
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,600
events and this picture from World War

576
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,159
II is kind of like

577
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,320
also showing like what you might not

578
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,120
learn because this is about like

579
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,940
aircraft returning from from the war and

580
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,220
like you can see the red dots uh like

581
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,720
the positions where the aircraft were

582
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,679
hit

583
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:12,960
and basically the first idea was like oh

584
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,960
we make we have to make it stronger

585
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,580
where the aircraft actually was hit so

586
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,440
actually where the red dots are this is

587
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,760
where we would improve the structure of

588
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,900
the aircraft

589
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,240
but at some point they realized wait a

590
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,020
second

591
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,539
so we only have aircraft returning this

592
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:28,980
like

593
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,720
dots at these positions but we don't

594
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,700
have aircraft returning this actually

595
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,919
hits on the other positions so what

596
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:36,600
happens to them yeah they literally

597
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,360
don't come back they crash so instead of

598
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,980
improving where the dots are you

599
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,020
actually go at the things you don't see

600
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,700
because you have to like put it in in

601
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,900
the context

602
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,280
and

603
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,200
that's also like how safety work like I

604
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,880
mean you learn a lot like from what you

605
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,740
see but you also have to anticipate what

606
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,059
you don't see or what might not be

607
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:57,120
reported so when a pilot reports I'm

608
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,520
saying like it really needs to be

609
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,900
investigated and looked at and like

610
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,120
understood like what's the root cause of

611
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,760
this and how can we improve this

612
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,500
so let's go into like a little bit more

613
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,000
engineering

614
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,640
um actually building an aircraft

615
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,559
um so basically let's just use a Lego

616
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,600
aircraft as an example

617
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,480
um just imagine like each brick is like

618
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,539
one component of an aircraft and to make

619
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,039
it really sound simple you just put them

620
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,240
together and at the end you have an

621
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,500
aircraft flying

622
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,440
easy

623
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,520
but you have to find the right blocks

624
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,539
because

625
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,640
you also have to be able to fly

626
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,440
it has to like work together it has to

627
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,000
communicate so basically interfaces have

628
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,020
to fit

629
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,080
and yeah it's

630
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,580
if it doesn't fit maybe you have to

631
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,559
build some new blocks so I mean in the

632
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,900
Lego example just get a 3D printer and

633
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,940
print the part but um in like

634
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,380
engineering perspective like you have to

635
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,299
potentially develop a new system to meet

636
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:54,120
your needs or you like your concept

637
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,880
and yeah you can do it the fun way if

638
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,320
your Skunk Works and you don't care

639
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,340
about

640
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,860
Pilots returning so that used to be like

641
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,360
the really fun engineering part when you

642
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,400
just start playing and put people on a

643
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,559
plane and yeah they don't return okay

644
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,780
move on next one

645
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,659
um and then and like I said before like

646
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,580
pilots carry a lot of material when it

647
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,960
comes to manuals

648
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,340
you have to put it all together

649
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,799
according according to how we want to

650
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:22,440
put it together so you basically have a

651
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,539
build manual and operation manual like

652
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:27,360
to actually like build it and operate it

653
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,559
and

654
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,299
it's not rocket science it's aerospace

655
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:33,179
engineering so I mean that's difficult

656
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:37,260
maybe easier who knows

657
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,039
um

658
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:40,080
so how do you start like with these

659
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,400
buildings blocks and like where do you

660
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,659
take them from

661
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:45,360
so you start with an idea so you say I

662
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,460
want to have an aircraft I need a

663
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,860
massage supersonic vital aircraft so

664
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,120
what do you need it needs to be able to

665
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,760
fly it needs to go fly supersonic

666
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,799
oh and yeah probably it should be sheep

667
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:57,840
and electric so let's just put it

668
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,179
together it's gonna be fine or you say

669
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,640
like Boeing in Airbus okay

670
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,980
um that was as a new aircraft ours is

671
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,900
not as efficient so maybe we have to put

672
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,179
new engines on our aircraft as well and

673
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:11,340
if you want to do it fast you just put a

674
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,440
building block on the aircraft and

675
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,299
you say it fits

676
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:17,400
um the 7 C7 Max

677
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,640
this definition of it fits was um

678
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,100
find a gray area to do to put it lightly

679
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,720
um at the end like it didn't fit in the

680
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,980
same manner as it should be so like

681
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,900
there was not mature enough evaluation

682
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,940
of that

683
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,520
um surely this supersonic electric vital

684
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,919
is definitely not realistic so obviously

685
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:37,020
like a product should have

686
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,120
a market it should be

687
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,919
being done in a certain time frame you

688
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:42,179
should have the right resources the

689
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:45,179
right money stuff like that and

690
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,100
it's not just a one-person job so it

691
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,600
wouldn't be like that one person sits

692
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,220
there and says like oh this is my idea

693
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,400
now I have an aircraft it's basically a

694
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,520
lot of competing engineering teams and

695
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,039
um as like I said I studied avionics

696
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,919
um actually the avionics group is if you

697
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,480
go to the middle of the second but last

698
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,799
that's basically the how an aircraft

699
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,960
would look like from my perspective if

700
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,100
you can see it but it has a lot of

701
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,679
antennas a lot of like technology to

702
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:12,419
connect and like to compute things but

703
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:14,520
if you then look at other things like

704
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,320
the maintenance group you just have a

705
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,640
lot of letters attached to the aircraft

706
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,140
so people can actually work on the

707
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,840
aircraft so it's not a matter of like

708
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,000
there's just one person or one team

709
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,580
wanting to have a solution it's like a

710
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,220
really big group of people and sadly

711
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,020
this picture doesn't have cyber security

712
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,059
yet because that would be funny as well

713
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,700
I guess I would just put the aircraft in

714
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,279
a final decade and I would be fine

715
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:39,240
um

716
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,460
so yeah it's a lot of teams working

717
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,840
together and

718
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,779
the thing is from my perspective

719
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:47,220
you don't you don't need to know it all

720
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,720
like it's not like you need to know why

721
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,779
Network flies it doesn't need to know

722
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,880
like why we choose this engine like if

723
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,380
you do cyber security it's important

724
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,380
that you know where your area is where

725
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,700
you need to have an impact and where you

726
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,919
need to be involved

727
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,200
building it like I said before take the

728
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,380
right Bridge like put it together and um

729
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,840
oops again doesn't fit

730
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,940
um we do start again like it's an

731
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,860
iterative process and you will see at

732
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,960
some points that things not fit or

733
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,000
doesn't work out so you go back a step

734
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,919
and do it again but that's like the

735
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:22,620
process it's not just like a straight

736
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,679
line and going from one end to the other

737
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,659
it should be for yourself like we talked

738
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:29,580
about this crash in 10 to the minus nine

739
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,919
like it needs to be a safe design so we

740
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,419
need to trust it that it goes from A to

741
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:36,539
B in a way which is accepted by by the

742
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:38,100
industry

743
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,679
um how do you do that

744
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:44,700
um a little bit of Avionics FCC damn I

745
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,440
have another abbreviation

746
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,120
I didn't want that FCC is flight control

747
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,640
computer basically the system which is

748
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,679
controlling the engines as well as the

749
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:54,659
actuators and make sure that like you

750
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:56,460
fly level or you turn right and left go

751
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,640
up and down as you can see

752
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,380
um if you want to be in the wet area I

753
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,740
was like your failure rate like having

754
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,720
a 10 to the minus three or whatever with

755
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,120
like errors or failures of a system you

756
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,400
put one flight control computer and it

757
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,980
will be pretty sure that it fails quite

758
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,320
quickly in a sense of like flying arrows

759
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,320
so what if you put three oh that looks

760
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,940
better that's like this orange part

761
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,039
where like it's acceptable in a certain

762
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,140
way but it's actually not enough

763
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,760
variation like you have to be in the

764
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,679
queen area so

765
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:30,480
you can see you have redundancy again

766
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,640
you have three systems but you can also

767
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,559
see that one box is green

768
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,539
um in this sense like if you can't read

769
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:37,980
the text it's basically about like this

770
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,580
similarity and like actually having a

771
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,020
different system being built so you're

772
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,700
not just building a flight called

773
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,260
computer three times and put it on the

774
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,100
aircraft

775
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,360
you're actually building the flight

776
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,039
called computer twice so you put

777
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:52,140
different engineering teams and say ah

778
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,580
you're building this by control computer

779
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,320
there's this software and you're

780
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,659
building it with that software and then

781
00:28:57,659 --> 00:28:59,640
you have this decimal energy so like if

782
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,700
one system fails it's unlikely that all

783
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,580
three fail because the same error will

784
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,740
not might not be present in one of the

785
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,960
other flight control computers and yes

786
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,400
this can be done by code this can be

787
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,440
done by Hardware as well I mean just put

788
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,360
a different CPU things like that

789
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,440
and I don't see this picture actually on

790
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,279
my laptop but this shows the evolution

791
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,260
of this avionics like I said before you

792
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,260
had like this boxes before which like

793
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,179
just were one system

794
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:31,559
and they represented what's the

795
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:33,120
Justified control computer for example

796
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,460
or just the flight management system or

797
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,100
just the navigation system and like this

798
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,440
time the evolution of these things or

799
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,240
like these systems is that actually you

800
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,159
start to put them in one box so you have

801
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,840
multi-core computers

802
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,340
that's kind of still the future of

803
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,620
Aviation multicore computers but there's

804
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,419
approaches to actually say we have one

805
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:53,940
box multi-core we can run two squeeze

806
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,559
systems on it one might be safety

807
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:57,659
critical and then we have two S3 systems

808
00:29:57,659 --> 00:29:59,580
which are just providing entertainment

809
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,720
with the passengers or something like

810
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,679
that

811
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,260
and some people who have done Aviation

812
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,299
might think now oh you're putting the

813
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,159
flight control computer next to the

814
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,080
entertainment system this is where all

815
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,539
the passengers connect

816
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:13,860
interesting so

817
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,840
security people would be like oh yeah I

818
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,340
can just jump over from here to there

819
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:22,100
and uh that's not gonna be fun

820
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,120
and again

821
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,460
human factors

822
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,559
all these designs is like from

823
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:34,080
perspective that oh we trust the people

824
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,640
who are involved in this processes we

825
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,080
trust the pilots we trust the engineers

826
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,360
we trust the maintenance teams We Trust

827
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,100
The Operators to do the right things for

828
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,840
security

829
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,740
um

830
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,140
but if you come from security well you

831
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,460
probably know that like

832
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,880
humans trusting

833
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,159
maybe not so much so it's something

834
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:55,260
which from my perspective like the

835
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,640
industry is still catching up on like

836
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,140
because for them it's like oh yeah we

837
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,960
just trust the human and then

838
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,440
just ask them like okay but if I would

839
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,260
like hack your software development

840
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,120
environment and like put code in there

841
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,440
what do you see that

842
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,700
maybe okay what if not hmm maybe not so

843
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,220
good so it's something like which

844
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,200
there's a lot of trust boot on humans

845
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,820
right now and that's kind of like a

846
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,039
challenge by itself

847
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,799
um security a bit

848
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:28,500
like I said before putting file control

849
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,500
computer together with an Ife or in fact

850
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,940
Entertainment System

851
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,899
um

852
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:36,299
you don't want to do that and this is

853
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:38,220
where this isolation comes into play so

854
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,440
basically what you're doing is you build

855
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,880
trusted environments where your safety

856
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,220
critical systems are and all the other

857
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,380
stuff like the open domain basically is

858
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,480
far away from that oh not that far away

859
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,120
securely segregated from The Trusted

860
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,580
environment and yes that's going to be

861
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,720
boring for some people considering

862
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,399
there's mostly technical people here you

863
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:01,679
do risk and threaten risk assessments

864
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,480
you go through a whole Loop of like

865
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,100
seeing what could be done who could do

866
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,260
it when could they do it what does the

867
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,120
risk related to that but this is how you

868
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,500
actually evaluate it from security

869
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,480
perspective like at the end you want to

870
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,320
have

871
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,840
Queen colors for security in a way

872
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,720
and yes the Cheese model

873
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,940
also is being used in aviation like most

874
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,679
people know that properly but don't have

875
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:25,080
a single point of failure don't have a

876
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,120
single security vulnerability which

877
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,700
could bring you to the trusted system so

878
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,980
just really basic if you would like go

879
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,539
from left to right on the right hand

880
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:34,740
side you would have the flight control

881
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,840
computer and on the left you would have

882
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,640
the public domain like the inside

883
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,140
Entertainment System the Wi-Fi of the

884
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,620
aircraft and if you look on the aircraft

885
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,240
you would see that actually like there

886
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,679
are several security controls in place

887
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:49,740
between these so-called domains

888
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,919
and yes don't don't overdo security

889
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:53,520
um

890
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,020
it's already challenging enough to

891
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,760
integrate it with safety and not impact

892
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,240
the safety but if you're doing too much

893
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,380
we're still talking about real-time

894
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,380
Computing systems so the aircraft wants

895
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,299
to have the information quickly like if

896
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:08,159
you're turning banking right whatever

897
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,080
and there would be some miscalculation

898
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,360
you want to know or like if you're like

899
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,799
realizing oh I might flip over you want

900
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,059
to know it early enough and not like

901
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:16,380
three seconds later when you actually

902
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,440
can't control the aircraft anymore

903
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,659
um so yeah don't don't build a Swiss

904
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:22,620
Army knife

905
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,399
build an aircraft

906
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:26,880
um

907
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,980
yeah just to summarize these a little

908
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,140
bit like safe design is not equal to

909
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,320
secure design but you could imagine

910
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,940
talking about this this similarity and

911
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,039
flight control computers that this also

912
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:39,419
actually helps security perspective

913
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:40,919
because the same applies for

914
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:42,539
vulnerabilities if I have a

915
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:44,100
vulnerability in one system or one

916
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,419
computer but I know the other two are

917
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:46,620
actually different

918
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,960
this gives me some leverage to work with

919
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,240
this is something I can use for security

920
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,740
you want to have it end to end you don't

921
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,480
want to have like some points where it's

922
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,940
like oh we're getting our software

923
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,760
updates on a floppy disk

924
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,760
thanks not anymore that doesn't work

925
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,500
you need to improve it constantly I mean

926
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,840
with time the sweat landscape changes so

927
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,239
you need to have something in place to

928
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,460
actually improve your systems or like

929
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,580
make them secure again I don't want to

930
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,199
open that box about changing a system

931
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,639
because that's

932
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,219
a long process it's not fun better have

933
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:21,899
defense and depth is one vulnerability

934
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:23,940
shows up once one layer of security

935
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,399
fails you can still rely on the rest of

936
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,219
it and the most boring part obviously

937
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,719
documented

938
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,639
a lot of paperwork being evolved a lot

939
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,699
of like assessments a lot of

940
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:38,339
test plans things like that

941
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:39,659
it's fun

942
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,099
but hey

943
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:42,540
at the end you might get to fly an

944
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,679
aircraft

945
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,500
um try it above upstairs there you

946
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,000
probably can do something like that and

947
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,879
you don't feel the same as he does

948
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:51,780
um

949
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,639
security testing on a flight testing

950
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,099
actually for now it's extensive like I

951
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:58,260
said like you need to actually have test

952
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,180
plans which like I've seen them at

953
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,040
errors they can be hundreds of pages

954
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,660
easily for a single system a single

955
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,280
functionality and you test all the

956
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,020
things through when it comes from safety

957
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,400
perspective and the same nowadays

958
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,960
obviously for security

959
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,700
you need to exploit the limits of the

960
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,200
product so

961
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,940
I mean you shouldn't do that with an

962
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,400
aircraft you're building but you

963
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:20,280
actually do this kind of tests so this

964
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,380
is how you test a wing

965
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,079
have you ever seen an aircraft when

966
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:28,079
bending that much probably not but this

967
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,700
is what they can actually do so if you

968
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,900
ever fly an aircraft and you see the

969
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,579
wing doing a little bit like this

970
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:34,560
uh don't be scared that's what they can

971
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,240
do

972
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,220
and

973
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,900
I put it on the wrong side actually like

974
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,520
I mentioned like this tested build it

975
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,520
break it repeat before like that's

976
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,140
actually YouTube channel about the

977
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,300
person who's building his own short

978
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,520
takeoff and Landing aircraft he's doing

979
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,680
fun stuff he is over engineering a lot

980
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,960
but it's a nice perspective into like

981
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,640
how do you actually build an aircraft

982
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,960
from scratch and he is actually building

983
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,700
them from scratch scratch he's building

984
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,619
all the parts of the aircraft from

985
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:03,240
carbon fiber by himself

986
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,400
and it's crazy like what he does that

987
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,140
definitely recommend it if you want to

988
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,520
know more about like how to build an

989
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,400
aircraft from scratch unlike and more

990
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,960
human level than what the big aircraft

991
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,240
look like and security testing is fun

992
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,040
good can you please not

993
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,420
thank you

994
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,740
um

995
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,480
but is it really

996
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,220
is it even fun if you're sitting in a

997
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,020
faraday cage or like spending a whole

998
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,760
night on an aircraft

999
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,920
um without AC on somewhere in the desert

1000
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,079
yes keep nodding thank you

1001
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:31,980
um

1002
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,780
I mean like how do you actually approach

1003
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,520
security testing for an aircraft it's

1004
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,140
kind of challenging

1005
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,040
um

1006
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,900
if the aircraft is already operational

1007
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,359
that's a challenge by itself if you just

1008
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:44,160
have a prototype or like a development

1009
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,020
aircraft it's actually easier

1010
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,480
the biggest challenge is what do I need

1011
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,520
to test and how do I test it the Pharaoh

1012
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,839
take age is there for a reason because

1013
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,480
this connectivity comes systems which

1014
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,339
you don't want to expose or like you

1015
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,960
don't want to do the security in public

1016
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,240
because you don't want to do GPS jamming

1017
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,920
at an airport

1018
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,320
it's not I mean it's fun but not for

1019
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,000
everybody

1020
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,400
um so yeah it's really depends on like

1021
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,720
what you need to test and how you can

1022
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,339
test it but it's like getting more and

1023
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:13,380
more complex and yeah get the right

1024
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,079
environment and get the time in like

1025
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,300
engineering follows a strict time plan

1026
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,859
so if you don't allocate the time early

1027
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:22,200
enough no

1028
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,740
and like I said time is a factor so

1029
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,660
you need to manage an aircraft while

1030
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,579
it's being operational so you have these

1031
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:31,079
hours interface always until

1032
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:33,359
vulnerability so like that's the

1033
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:35,400
operational perspective into like use

1034
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,839
flying in an aircraft and how to

1035
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,060
actually deal with security and you have

1036
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,579
to react and there's ways to react

1037
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:42,960
um I don't want to mention regulations

1038
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,020
whatever but there's a new European

1039
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,339
regulation about like Information

1040
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:49,740
Security Management so part is is

1041
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,480
actually bringing all these stakeholders

1042
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,180
together to react coordinated to

1043
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,460
security incidents and about sharing

1044
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,380
these kind of insights because you

1045
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,940
haven't seen many talks about Aviation I

1046
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,619
guess that's probably for a reason I

1047
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:02,280
mean

1048
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,339
I'm not really aware of any security

1049
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:07,020
vulnerability that would impact the

1050
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,579
safety of an aircraft like a real one

1051
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:10,740
but there could be one even I don't know

1052
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,000
everything

1053
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,520
um and yeah like it's not risky to smoke

1054
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,440
next to gas and

1055
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,119
I guess nobody's watching this anymore

1056
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,460
like the safety briefings I used to

1057
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,859
listen to them and I watch them because

1058
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:25,920
it is important and sometimes I realize

1059
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,720
oh this aircraft is not like I was

1060
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,099
expecting it to be when it comes to

1061
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:32,820
leaving it so yeah just can recommend it

1062
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,619
and

1063
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:36,420
yeah it's not a unique product

1064
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,040
development lifecycle

1065
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,880
um

1066
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,820
at the end you start at the draft you

1067
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,280
assess like what you need to do

1068
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,980
you consider what is being like required

1069
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,140
by regulations but I mean it's just

1070
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,940
developing another system in that sense

1071
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,740
it's like this is an aircraft It's Gonna

1072
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:56,460
Fly and it's hard in a sense but it's

1073
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,920
not like rocket science

1074
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,300
maybe

1075
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,000
um and the good thing about Aviation

1076
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,859
cyber security especially engineering is

1077
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:06,839
security is not necessarily a cost

1078
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:08,400
center because

1079
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,280
yes we want to do it but also we have to

1080
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,020
do it because if we don't do it we can't

1081
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,579
fly

1082
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:16,740
and like I mentioned before security

1083
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,540
support safety or safety support

1084
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,060
security so they're not the same but

1085
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,800
they are helping each other out if

1086
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,500
required and for the sake of time

1087
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,660
because I also want to do some q a

1088
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,540
um just shortly looking at like the

1089
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,920
product development lifecycle you can

1090
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,619
see I mean this is the aviation one this

1091
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:37,020
is based on a standard but does it

1092
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,520
really look different for like other

1093
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,140
development life cycles

1094
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,300
I would argue that you do the same you

1095
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,040
have a concept you do requirements the

1096
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,839
detail design implementation and then

1097
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,160
all the validation activity is

1098
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,560
interesting I mean not not a big

1099
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,420
difference

1100
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,640
and I'm gonna skip this part this is

1101
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,099
more about like the operational side and

1102
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:57,839
like I said before like this

1103
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,240
Community there is things happening

1104
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,180
there's people talking there is exchange

1105
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,940
of information about security events and

1106
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,440
people actually are helping each other

1107
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,960
so it's not like a private community

1108
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,880
um yeah it's a regular regulatory twist

1109
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,619
the certification always scares people

1110
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,720
off or companies of like Elon Musk

1111
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,980
doesn't do it because of certification

1112
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,480
requirements

1113
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,820
um but it's manageable like you just

1114
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,500
have to approach it in the right way and

1115
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,820
you have to talk to these people as well

1116
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,280
they are really helpful

1117
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,020
um and yeah obviously it's not just

1118
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,640
about aircraft like I've mostly tried to

1119
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,619
focus on aircraft in my presentation but

1120
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:33,960
there's a whole environment around it

1121
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,900
and they all need to do security at the

1122
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,160
end because like I mentioned before

1123
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,800
aircraft communicate so there's

1124
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,579
connectivity and also you get parts from

1125
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:46,680
suppliers and end-to-end security should

1126
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,940
be implemented like you don't want to

1127
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,099
have a software coming from a floppy

1128
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:52,320
disk and then you copy it to some

1129
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,700
windows

1130
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,980
XP computer maybe if you still have one

1131
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,960
and then you connect that to the network

1132
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,460
of your company and then like it all

1133
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,980
goes crazy so end to end is also really

1134
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,420
important

1135
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,180
so how to get started my recommendation

1136
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,320
is like exploit the opportunities

1137
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,820
whenever you get a chance to talk to

1138
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,920
somebody or network or find an

1139
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,119
opportunity go for it if you're

1140
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:14,040
interested in aviation just go go ahead

1141
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,260
try out there's nothing to do wrong

1142
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,839
understand and be understood listen to

1143
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:20,760
the people who try to tell you how

1144
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,859
Aviation is being done

1145
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:25,020
but also explain Security in a way which

1146
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,640
they can understand and not scare them

1147
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,740
off I have had situations where I was

1148
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,720
trying to explain a solution and

1149
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,700
suddenly the next day the engineering

1150
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,780
team said oh we're not doing this

1151
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,460
anymore we don't want to do security for

1152
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,680
it so literally they just by me talking

1153
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,940
to them were too scared to do security

1154
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,880
and just skip the whole system

1155
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,520
and stay calm stay focused stay safe I

1156
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,640
mean don't don't go crazy don't burn

1157
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,920
yourself out doing that it's a

1158
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,420
challenging domain to be in like with

1159
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,460
all the abbreviations especially but

1160
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,020
it's doable

1161
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,119
and it's not just engineering yes I'm an

1162
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,940
engineer but security stuff you don't

1163
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,660
necessarily need this kind of

1164
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,640
engineering background I have

1165
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,980
and yeah

1166
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,839
that's about it

1167
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:07,440
um

1168
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,180
if you want to talk to me just approach

1169
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,099
me after the talk you can ask me

1170
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:12,540
anything about building your own

1171
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,099
aircraft I haven't done it yet but if

1172
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:15,599
somebody is interested

1173
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,180
um sure and anything else Aviation just

1174
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,060
approach me

1175
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,200
thank you

1176
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,980
any questions

1177
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,960
so if you have some questions could you

1178
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,400
please just raise your hand or stand up

1179
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,400
and wait for the microphone so that

1180
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,220
everybody can hear it and I I anticipate

1181
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,540
if you would just like ask it back

1182
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,680
quickly if you have a question to me

1183
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,540
right now because then everybody can

1184
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,460
hear about it and like we can share the

1185
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,640
answer

1186
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,099
was it that simple everybody understood

1187
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:49,400
everything

1188
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,800
thank you for the presentation so where

1189
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,819
does the magic come from

1190
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,140
just disappears okay actually I had a

1191
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:10,380
question about this Automation and the

1192
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,859
security of what the pilots actually do

1193
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:16,500
I think there was recently a case I

1194
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,359
think in Spain where this pilot just

1195
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:21,720
decided to fly a plane into a mountain

1196
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,780
just killing off everybody they think

1197
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:27,660
like automation or like this kind of so

1198
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:30,780
you mean the the incident where like it

1199
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,819
wasn't a German airline um like with the

1200
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:34,260
pilot one of the pilots was outside and

1201
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,400
the other one just crashed into a

1202
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,680
mountain Yeah so basically

1203
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,480
um this is like where this iterative

1204
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,700
like evolution of the aircraft comes

1205
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,800
into play because nowadays if you have a

1206
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,300
new aircraft or a new aircraft they

1207
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,980
actually have a system which is called

1208
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:49,920
Ground proximity warning system gpws

1209
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,160
basically it would warn you if you are

1210
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,540
attempting to crash the aircraft and

1211
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,859
actually it would at some point start to

1212
00:43:55,859 --> 00:43:57,720
react automatically so it would just go

1213
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,359
up so it's it was an aircraft which

1214
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:01,980
didn't have the system so the pilot was

1215
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,540
able to do it

1216
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,180
um and I wouldn't guarantee you that the

1217
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,680
pilot is still able to do it even though

1218
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,359
the system exists because he still has

1219
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,579
to a certain level the power to overrule

1220
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:13,200
the system so if you now also to turn it

1221
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:13,920
off

1222
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,020
doesn't matter now this is a matter of

1223
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,160
like how much should the pilot still

1224
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,920
know and with the Boeing 77 Max it was

1225
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,480
the opposite the pilots didn't know

1226
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,520
enough to react to that and this is like

1227
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,599
well it's like a really challenging

1228
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:26,819
balancing act with like reducing more

1229
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:29,040
and more flight crew from the aircraft

1230
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,900
like the single pilot operation which

1231
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,119
was shown in the picture

1232
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,000
10 years 15 maybe not before it's gonna

1233
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,619
be like too challenging to actually not

1234
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:40,700
have two people on board anymore

1235
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,040
uh in a not so complex aircraft how do

1236
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,200
you prevent somebody of actually sending

1237
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,480
an ILS client slope that is like 10

1238
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,339
meters away and making the airplane

1239
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:51,960
crash

1240
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,520
sorry can you repeat the first part of

1241
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,040
it in a not so complex aircraft very

1242
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,960
different nav AIDS are not compared to

1243
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,640
each other let's say like an old King

1244
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,040
here how do you prevent somebody with a

1245
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,960
transmitter actually not crashing the

1246
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,660
plane or something a faulty Clyde slope

1247
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,880
the these stupid answer I could give you

1248
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,800
is like nobody would get on the on the

1249
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,660
airport to actually tamper with the ILS

1250
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,560
system

1251
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,780
but that would be the wrong answer

1252
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:19,200
um so it's kind of a challenging

1253
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,220
question because I think you can't

1254
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,500
prevent it I mean it depends also on the

1255
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,440
like situation of the flight because if

1256
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,420
it's a clear sky or like the night and

1257
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,099
you see the runway lights and stuff like

1258
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:31,140
that the pilots would see it

1259
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,540
if it's like the visibility visibility

1260
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,660
is really low no and if you come back to

1261
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,220
me later there's actually a research

1262
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,200
paper from the ASA where they actually

1263
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,540
did this kind of simulation on a flight

1264
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,760
simulator with screen Pilots tampering

1265
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,380
with ILS and all these things and

1266
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,240
there's really interesting findings in

1267
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,800
there but I can't summarize it like in

1268
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,700
one sentence

1269
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,099
hi thank you for the talk

1270
00:45:56,099 --> 00:45:57,900
um I was thinking what is a

1271
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,579
vulnerability assessment or a

1272
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:02,040
penetration test for an airline or for

1273
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,079
an airplane look like

1274
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,780
it really depends what you're looking at

1275
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,119
like there's no simple answer to that

1276
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,180
like for like if you like the easiest

1277
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:13,740
example I guess to explain to you is

1278
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,720
like when you look at an infinite

1279
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,040
entertainment system or the Wi-Fi on

1280
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,000
board

1281
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,760
it potentially is just like yeah Wi-Fi

1282
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:23,220
security there's a website a web app a

1283
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,740
web server and this is like pretty basic

1284
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,720
security testing but if you actually

1285
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,760
have some avionics or safety critical

1286
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,640
system it really depends on the system

1287
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,140
and like what your threads are and what

1288
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,119
you need to look at it can be a simple

1289
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:37,500
code review

1290
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,619
it will also be especially like nowadays

1291
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:41,700
and with a move on like the more

1292
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,859
connectivity you would actually have a

1293
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:45,000
test aircraft where you actually would

1294
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,160
tamper with a system on the aircraft in

1295
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:49,200
an isolated environment and this could

1296
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,420
like the testing like did

1297
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,280
it's probably too much for me like to

1298
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,200
just summarize it in that sense but

1299
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,000
anything you can think of basically I

1300
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,339
mean there's web apps there's Hardware

1301
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:00,480
there's anything like from technology

1302
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,300
perspective you can test

1303
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,240
this hello uh great talk thank you so

1304
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,579
much thank you uh I have a question that

1305
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:10,440
uh

1306
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,500
it's a bit of fun maybe uh every time

1307
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,180
when you happen to be on the airplane

1308
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,339
and you have you know the interactive

1309
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:20,760
interface in front of you how often it

1310
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,920
is or How likely it is that you can

1311
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,619
actually do any harm to the system

1312
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:27,300
because I guess the networks are

1313
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,819
segmented so I mean I shouldn't be able

1314
00:47:29,819 --> 00:47:31,800
to mean the system the entertainment

1315
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,540
system itself I mean you can make it

1316
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:37,319
crash I guess easily but going then to

1317
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:39,420
the safety critical part no because they

1318
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,280
are isolated nowadays they have

1319
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,960
basically data diet in it so basically

1320
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,880
it's just unidirectional Network traffic

1321
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,000
going from avionics to the infinite

1322
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,440
entertainment system and an old aircraft

1323
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,319
basically it's actually good to have old

1324
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,540
boxes in there which are all isolated

1325
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,040
only have only directional communication

1326
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,000
so you actually couldn't even

1327
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,640
communicate with it in that direction so

1328
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,920
it's unlikely but but yes you could

1329
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,000
crash it but it doesn't affect the

1330
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,720
flight

1331
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,599
like but do you think there are any uh

1332
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:08,579
Planes in use that don't have the

1333
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:09,780
separation

1334
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,160
unlikely

1335
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,299
I wouldn't say no 100

1336
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,460
if there's nothing else nobody else

1337
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:24,060
thank you of course somebody else please

1338
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:26,300
yeah just a quick question like I know

1339
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,680
like I have some background in aviation

1340
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,920
more background in security but like uh

1341
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,220
how much penetration testing or testing

1342
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,020
of for example the data links the eight

1343
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:39,660
cars and and the others are being done

1344
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,280
since some of them is not much that they

1345
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:43,440
send or that they receive on the plane

1346
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,500
are kind of getting quite close to the

1347
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,619
like more critical avionics Parts yeah

1348
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:51,839
and there is not much being done and I

1349
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,160
think that's something like where it's

1350
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,599
challenging for the aviation industry

1351
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,460
like being in that sense like slow with

1352
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,339
developing the technology because acres

1353
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:01,740
and all this stuff or adsb for Aviation

1354
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,599
it's new and it hasn't been designed for

1355
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,599
security in mind so not not too much fun

1356
00:49:06,599 --> 00:49:09,119
yeah and there's The Duality that you

1357
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,160
kind of especially of all areasb you

1358
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,500
kind of want everybody to be able to

1359
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,180
receive it at the same time you would

1360
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,920
want to kind of prevent everybody from

1361
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,780
receiving so yeah it's a challenging

1362
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,339
thing and like it really also depends

1363
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:21,119
like

1364
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,359
if you talk about Acres it's again the

1365
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:25,680
argument about human factors and you

1366
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,819
would have the pilot to actually check

1367
00:49:26,819 --> 00:49:28,619
the message it would be a process to

1368
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:30,060
actually say the pilot has to check the

1369
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,619
message that everything is correct from

1370
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:34,319
his perspective but

1371
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:35,819
how much does he actually understand it

1372
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:37,560
nowadays and like how much time does he

1373
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,319
spend on that so it's a challenging area

1374
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,800
to be in

1375
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,280
there's one more at the back

1376
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,119
Mr Henry

1377
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,960
hi Ben hi

1378
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,480
nice to meet you again so considering

1379
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,540
the efb's irrigating connectivity you

1380
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:10,380
get the updates and uh gate link as as a

1381
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,180
concept is quite difficult

1382
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,060
to handle the global connective or all

1383
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,280
the airlines in all of the airports how

1384
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,859
do you see the security of it going

1385
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:23,160
forward how do you secure a gate link so

1386
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,359
first of all for everybody who doesn't

1387
00:50:24,359 --> 00:50:26,099
know efb that's electronic flight back

1388
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:28,079
that's basically the handbook thanks for

1389
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,240
using the abbreviation seems like you

1390
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,319
know your stuff

1391
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,280
um

1392
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,079
so

1393
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,480
I might be wrong but actually gate link

1394
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,660
isn't used as much as you would assume

1395
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,540
not a lot of airlines actually use it

1396
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:44,280
and I mean the thing is like

1397
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,500
it's like any other Wi-Fi you shouldn't

1398
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,119
trust it in that sense that whatever

1399
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:50,579
information comes over it is trustworthy

1400
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:53,700
by default so there's and I don't know

1401
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,319
how many companies or airlines are

1402
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:56,520
actually doing that but the Integrity

1403
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,839
check should be independent from the

1404
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:58,740
interface

1405
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,180
in that sense and I know company is

1406
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:01,920
doing that and also they're having their

1407
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,780
own Wi-Fi and stuff like that so gate

1408
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:05,520
link is not the single solution actually

1409
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,160
for that use case but yeah don't don't

1410
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,440
trust the interface but make sure that

1411
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,420
you have end-to-end security

1412
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,140
in place

1413
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:23,420
it seems like that's it

1414
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:27,240
thank you everybody

1415
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,300
enjoy the maritime talk

1416
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,650
um I hope it's more grounded than mine

1417
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:35,829
[Applause]
