1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:04,100
okay hello everybody

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,919
talking about operational operational

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,900
technology and in particular device

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,580
security there

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,240
and there are lots of standards in the

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,560
area so

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,160
they create sometimes quite a moments to

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,119
remember the numbers

9
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,680
my content is first I introduce

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,539
operational technology so if you know it

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,099
you are great very you are going to get

12
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:30,300
very bored

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,579
sorry then I'm a little bit talking

14
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,559
about the standard itself it's a big

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,960
thing I'm not going to go at to any

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,200
depth in the standard itself and then

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,879
I'm going to talk about a little bit a

18
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,160
bit about the device part of the

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,760
standard and process part

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,739
and finally we end up with missing parts

21
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,780
because these standards really don't

22
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,379
cover everything there is in security

23
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,960
my background is I started with smart

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,780
cards so I have started all my life I

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,520
have been doing Security in a way or

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,420
another

27
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,760
doing Hardware software

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,939
and processes even some business

29
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:11,340
development and lately I have been doing

30
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,380
industrial device security Enterprise

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,780
so

32
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,119
I didn't actually make any pictures

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,240
about industrial devices because they

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,979
are gray boxes and they are put into

35
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,479
three cabinets

36
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,100
if you want to see them go downstairs

37
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,200
there is a corner Department there are

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,840
some kind of Standards some of them and

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,280
if you really want to see something go

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,880
towards vertical so the they stand and

41
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,740
solve the capture the flag and see even

42
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,119
more of them

43
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,700
I don't think I don't want to show you

44
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,159
10 different gray boxes doing different

45
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,720
things I wouldn't make the difference

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,659
only colorful thing is the manufacturer

47
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:54,180
logo even if the if that is even colored

48
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,439
one

49
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,180
what is important in operational

50
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,780
technology typically availability you

51
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,220
have to work

52
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,619
if you stop working people are either

53
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,340
highly annoyed like in elevator or then

54
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,160
you lose a lot of money like in Factory

55
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,500
because factories if they stop working

56
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,700
they are fixing some things of money

57
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,440
and

58
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,959
even more lots of people will get

59
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,319
annoyed when you don't have electricity

60
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,360
of course electricity may have some

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,520
other problems like in Ukraine they are

62
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,860
having but uh

63
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,959
during peaceful times

64
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,540
Industrial Automation is the most risky

65
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,540
thing in the in the electronics in the

66
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,940
in the electric grid

67
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,160
an electric techniquely handling big

68
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,580
Eminence of energy it's easy to forget

69
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,140
there are

70
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,540
even one wind mile is 10 megawatt

71
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,060
compared to home electronics Home

72
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,060
Electrics doesn't consume anything so if

73
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,400
something starts to go wrong it may go

74
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,300
wrong the big way

75
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,459
and even worse it can go if you are

76
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,480
having a let's say a big containers if

77
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,159
it has

78
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:14,580
10 times four magnitudes of more energy

79
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,060
in its motion compared to car in Highway

80
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,760
so when it hits some some solid object

81
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,920
there is really a mess

82
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,300
and maybe environmental problems if it's

83
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,540
oil you are going to have big problems

84
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,239
and in mining side if things go wrong

85
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,620
you will get people killed that easily

86
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,739
and going to extremes some kind of oil

87
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,459
refinery there is a hot stuff there I

88
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,019
know very little about those but there

89
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,420
are some hot stuff and if you don't shut

90
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,099
it down correctly

91
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,700
it will make a lot of problems there is

92
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,760
in oil refinery contents about the

93
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,760
energy of atomic bomb at the refinery

94
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,280
site of course it doesn't explode as

95
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,200
quickly as atomic bomb but still when

96
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,879
it's burning it's better to go the other

97
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,640
way it's not going deep you are not

98
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,899
going to go closer to it

99
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,299
that is what operates all these are

100
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,220
operational technology things so they

101
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,100
basically follow same pattern

102
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,199
and I'm going to present it from Network

103
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,419
point of view just to give you the idea

104
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:25,680
what are the real problems in

105
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,780
operational technology

106
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,360
at the lowest level you have

107
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,880
actual things that are doing something

108
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,840
or moving something Motors

109
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,940
conveyor belt

110
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,520
pumps and things that are measuring

111
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,220
the connections are typically analog or

112
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,860
serial port or proprietary there is all

113
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,380
kind of weird stuff going there it's not

114
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,160
really

115
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,639
uh standardized or anything when vendors

116
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,620
do really different things and of course

117
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,660
there it's enough to have a physical

118
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,540
access to be able to do evil things you

119
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,400
can't really attack those connections

120
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,080
remotely because they don't wrote anyway

121
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,500
or you just have to go into place to do

122
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,419
some evil things Hammer is pretty good

123
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,880
there of course you could leave some

124
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,919
nice things they are also doing later

125
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,900
something active but that's a different

126
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,040
thing

127
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,919
then there is some field Network it's

128
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,720
typically real time

129
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,300
soft or hard so it's controlling that

130
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,520
things are going right if it's not

131
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,960
controlling then things are not going

132
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,300
right and uh

133
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,240
it doesn't really do anything like TLS

134
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,380
today it it's it is highly unsecure if

135
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,479
you can connect to it

136
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:42,960
usually it's only beginning to get TLS

137
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,440
like things

138
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,539
then there is a plant Network this is

139
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:50,160
now looking already a bit more like

140
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,919
ethernet it's not typically ethernet and

141
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,160
connecting whole stuff together

142
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,380
firewalls in between they are typically

143
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,600
application firewalls they could be also

144
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,759
normal firewalls but often they really

145
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,740
inspect what he's going through

146
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,340
and of course as tuknik told us good way

147
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,039
to attack this kind of system is USB

148
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,900
when you don't have any connections

149
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,039
outside

150
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:17,340
I mean you have to somehow bring in your

151
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,560
Malabar

152
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,440
also you can have supply chain attacks

153
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,560
so you obtain the device is going in the

154
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,840
facility I don't know how much this

155
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,539
really today happen but at least in

156
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:33,360
electric grid they are considerable risk

157
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,720
I think

158
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,639
and then of course today vendors are

159
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,460
bringing their laptops their phones

160
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,220
in order to serve the thing you have

161
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,900
some problem there so vendor wants to

162
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,340
debug it so they're bringing their

163
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,080
laptop they connect they need something

164
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,259
from the corporate networks how they

165
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,120
connect it through their phones to that

166
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,100
and suddenly this whole thing is in the

167
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,800
internet in the worst case I mean it

168
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,479
almost anything can happen at that point

169
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:04,319
then

170
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,660
it Network

171
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,759
every every I think almost everywhere

172
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,440
and

173
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,120
operational network is nowadays

174
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,699
connected to some bigger network with

175
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,039
through a Gateway and then the bigger

176
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,740
network is of course called go into

177
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,539
Cloud our internet

178
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:23,580
and of course there are random or

179
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,560
they're running in the ID Network so

180
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,840
only question is when these guys making

181
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,240
ransomware will go to the operational

182
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,240
side and start to stress that also

183
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,099
because it might be good business I

184
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:36,240
don't know if it's good business for

185
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,120
ransomware because if a ransomware would

186
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,039
attack the plant Network and field

187
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,680
Network I don't think most

188
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,400
factories would recover by getting the

189
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,680
keys from the ransomware vendor they

190
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,900
would buy new devices the device is

191
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,120
associative compared to rest of the

192
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,099
stuff they are running so they probably

193
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:59,099
throw out all the stuff and buy new one

194
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:00,780
of course they might have trouble

195
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,880
getting those stuff so

196
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,080
then it's a different story

197
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,400
then

198
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,740
for a reason another many of these two

199
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,560
stems actually connect through VPN to

200
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,380
some place it might be vendor that is

201
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,360
offering them some automation or

202
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,520
collecting some data or then it might be

203
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,039
a second

204
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:25,500
plant where they

205
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,840
where they have where they want to

206
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,400
coordinate things

207
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,379
and well

208
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,240
we have already seen attacks coming

209
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,360
through these vpns VPN is something so

210
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,580
it doesn't itself protect that much you

211
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,659
can go through with an attack

212
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,219
and then final and most recent funny

213
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,740
thing is this iot devices that uh

214
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,380
sometimes bypassing all of these nice

215
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,620
layers that try to offer security

216
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,959
uh this uh

217
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,880
this kind of uh

218
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,339
connection is really confusing that

219
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,740
think about in this model

220
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,060
so we have plenty of standards

221
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,180
this is only random set I did look at

222
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,680
the actual product but then I realized

223
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,180
that if I put the actual product list

224
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,459
here you will you can work out what

225
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,560
product it is so I didn't want to do

226
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,940
that

227
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,500
standard Dairy standard for almost

228
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,240
everything there is even standard for

229
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,060
markings in the device that what kind of

230
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,000
marking symbols did you use there

231
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,040
and of and for example there is security

232
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,920
standard for grid there that tells how

233
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,640
TCP uh who have TLS should be used in

234
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,920
that context what kind of things and all

235
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,660
kind of details pretty much everything

236
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,760
is standardized

237
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,440
by standards

238
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,500
for example electric many many interface

239
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,660
you want to have this kind of basic Hue

240
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,360
again just not to have anything too

241
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,100
awful there

242
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,140
you may have safety

243
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,019
so you want to know that safety is

244
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:00,600
properly reliable then it's not about

245
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,480
liability when you can say that I follow

246
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,019
with this standard I'm not liable

247
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:09,480
and the guy who buys your device can

248
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,700
also say that this was made according to

249
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,640
standards so we made it good care of it

250
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,519
we are not liable either

251
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,680
and then there is this funny places like

252
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,540
explosive environments where you can

253
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,959
have Sparks which where you actually

254
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:26,459
want to prepare this year that it's not

255
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,459
going to have any Sparks so this at x114

256
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:32,220
is I think that kind of thing

257
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,260
there are different levels of mandatory

258
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,019
and it's not very clear yet what the

259
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,700
role of this kind of security standards

260
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,200
will have here

261
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,839
for example Maritime Insurance costs

262
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,120
will go up if you don't certify so there

263
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,980
they will definitely use certified

264
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,720
devices

265
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,120
in critical infrastructure there is also

266
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,560
it's coming

267
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,480
that you need to certify the device it's

268
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,279
very likely that you need to certify the

269
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,040
devices that make electric work

270
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,380
but other than that I don't know what

271
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,519
will happen

272
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,200
customers might buy the certified

273
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,120
devices because they must be more better

274
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,339
than the non-certified but they don't

275
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:09,779
think they actually don't certify the

276
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,760
plant at all which makes it pretty much

277
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,320
useless

278
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,579
but I don't know that time been so

279
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:21,480
so what kind of thing is this standard

280
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,019
itself

281
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,959
okay

282
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,279
not working okay we have their

283
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,940
uh in the asset owner is the guy who

284
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,980
owns the stuff

285
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,320
they said policies how the things would

286
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,279
behave

287
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,459
how it what kind of things are done and

288
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:49,740
how how are they done then and they

289
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,839
seldom know what they are buying what

290
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,640
they are running they want to get system

291
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,740
integrators who can pull together the

292
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,019
stuff others otherwise it doesn't really

293
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:59,459
make sense

294
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:02,700
them it doesn't work and this system

295
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,519
integrators have already

296
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,040
kind of making all these configurations

297
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,860
that you need to do to make the thing

298
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,540
work

299
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,880
but actual products they are not they

300
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,519
are much much manufactured so they are

301
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,380
not configurated yet and product

302
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,779
supplier produces this kind of general

303
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:24,959
purpose devices that can be used they

304
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,760
can be applications embedded devices

305
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,120
Network or host but they are anyway kind

306
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,940
of general purpose they are not made for

307
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,880
specifically this case it might be made

308
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,740
for some general use case like wind

309
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,500
turbine but still it's uh

310
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,920
uh for many kinds of winter events in a

311
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,720
way

312
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,399
and

313
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,040
there are two standards here that are

314
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,100
now getting I would say that companies

315
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,959
are competing to implement them right

316
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,000
now the first companies have them

317
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,459
certifications for some products some

318
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:03,000
companies have pretty have all only

319
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,540
started the road to certify them

320
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,420
and they're when creating certified

321
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,300
product you need to also certify your

322
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,920
development process

323
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,180
so you must have process that is also

324
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,740
validated

325
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,440
that it seems to work

326
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,420
there are multiple significance themes

327
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,760
multiple certifiers so it's

328
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,380
that side is

329
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,639
uh

330
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,060
pretty much mess I would say

331
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,040
there is probably situation that some

332
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,920
certifiers are better than others and

333
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,620
here we go

334
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,139
the standard specifies security levels

335
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:46,139
what it what the device can resist

336
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:49,320
SL1 is lowest you can't hack it

337
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,079
accidentally but if you intend to hack

338
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,000
it you are allowed to it it doesn't have

339
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,620
to resist that anymore

340
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,060
okay good pretty secure then SL2 is it's

341
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,560
the most common level I have seen

342
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,380
companies certifying devices now is

343
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,300
Hackers with

344
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,700
simple means and Furious this is General

345
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,680
skills a lot of motivation

346
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,420
so

347
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,360
everybody here has high motivation

348
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,399
has more uh and some industry specific

349
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,660
knowledge probably after this

350
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,820
presentation and they have high

351
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,959
motivation so it can't stop you sorry

352
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,120
according to standard

353
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,920
well tough luck and these

354
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,899
goals are really interesting because

355
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:39,000
they don't really tell what the standard

356
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,639
is aiming at they don't reflect really

357
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,620
content of the standard but still

358
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,300
standard says that these are the levels

359
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,639
that are being aimed at

360
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,519
I don't think any I haven't yet seen SL

361
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,260
for highest level

362
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:56,880
uh project myself but I doubt this

363
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,940
this certification model will work very

364
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,360
well there

365
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,980
it won't really give guarantees that

366
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,199
nation state attacker wouldn't be able

367
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,760
to compromise something

368
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,600
no way

369
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,760
and on the other hand starting point in

370
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,139
industrial

371
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,839
security is pretty low lots of devices

372
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,579
are really such that you can

373
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:23,639
accidentally hack them if you run animap

374
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,800
scan to network the network will go down

375
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,839
sorry

376
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,540
so maybe these goals are not so wrong

377
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,880
after all maybe they are reasonable

378
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,519
goals as a first step

379
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,639
and in actual product security is there

380
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,260
is also a huge variation Linux devices

381
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,839
tend to be reasonably okay the closer

382
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,940
you go to the up real-time operation

383
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,720
system that is custom fit by company the

384
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,459
more likely it is that it fails pretty

385
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:53,239
miserably

386
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,820
about the requirements the actual tech

387
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,620
device security requirements are

388
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,560
actually mostly functional requirements

389
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,139
so these are telling what kind of

390
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:06,300
functionality device implements so you

391
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,120
can verify them by functional testing

392
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,519
pretty easy to verify that yes it is

393
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,220
very implementing TLS it doesn't say how

394
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,079
many bugs TLS implementation has

395
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,980
and security level changes what exact

396
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,139
functionality you need to implement

397
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:27,480
but funny thing this is in the standard

398
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,279
this is pretty much the only thing that

399
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,600
changes with the security level

400
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,620
so in sl3 I think you need to implement

401
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,000
multi-factor out indication or was it

402
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,940
tesl for the exactly remember but these

403
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,380
kind of things pop up more and more

404
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,720
there when you write them

405
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,519
and then when you don't can't do

406
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,199
something or don't want to do something

407
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,259
for example you don't want to do CQ boot

408
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:54,540
then you document that you didn't do it

409
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,240
and customer needs to protect against it

410
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,459
and that's I think really valuable thing

411
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:02,040
because now you should know what vendor

412
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,919
has Triad to do what they what is the

413
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,480
best they even think they could have

414
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,720
done

415
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,160
and do they call most common challenges

416
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,919
well encrypted communication or lack of

417
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:18,000
encryption

418
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,240
it is there or then it's not it's very

419
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,140
slot then the standard at SL2 at least

420
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,780
requires per user accounts

421
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,059
but I don't know how sensibility is to

422
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:32,520
have a user per user accounts on motor

423
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,179
control that is controlling some motor

424
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,620
it doesn't make sense to me but it

425
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,419
standard requires that

426
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:42,419
it's a little bit flat in it thinking

427
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,760
that everything is similar

428
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,520
maybe third one is that it requires

429
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,419
secure boot pretty much everywhere but I

430
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:53,100
don't think absolutely every device

431
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:56,000
requires that

432
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,740
the process thing is

433
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,660
complex

434
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,720
I mean I try try to draw this kind of

435
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,120
simple and it this is simplified version

436
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,280
this is heavily simplified version of it

437
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,380
there is threat modeling security

438
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,660
requirements

439
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,760
that's okay that modeling is driving

440
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,679
security requirements and then we have

441
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,840
verification validation with lots of

442
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,280
different kind of tests and then

443
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,140
implementation

444
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,240
many thing for third-party components

445
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,280
and check your pie design and coding

446
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,380
standard stuff

447
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,600
we have plenty of reviews

448
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,520
I would say everything is reviewed and

449
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,220
preferable once a year

450
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,160
so there will be this it cannot be

451
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,320
implemented very lightly or then you

452
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,900
have to explain away a lot of stuff

453
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,320
so if you are making this kind of device

454
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,140
that is secure against accidental misuse

455
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,419
it might make it doesn't really adapt

456
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:55,799
that you have heavy process to make

457
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,480
rather insecure device

458
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,000
but when when going higher second levels

459
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,220
it makes a lot of sense

460
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,380
there is a traceability of requirements

461
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,720
I have heard that this is one of the

462
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,760
tricky parts for development teams that

463
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,260
they don't

464
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,120
they can't really make

465
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,280
this kind of security test traceable to

466
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,760
security requirements well yes I

467
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,500
understand it and uh

468
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,080
in many parts it's a document in pretty

469
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,419
obvious things that are not not really

470
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:27,299
adding value but

471
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:30,059
but the main problem is probably that

472
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:32,640
well there's the tested Independence

473
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,860
test that is really good thing to have

474
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,559
you can put your development team to do

475
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:39,840
pen testing of your device that just

476
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,059
doesn't fly you have to get maybe not

477
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:44,160
some external but at least different

478
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,960
department in your

479
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,419
company to do it

480
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:50,100
but then there is comes the negative

481
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,460
side I mean nothing really verifies in

482
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,340
the standard or puts any kind of quality

483
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,919
requirements for this so as soon as you

484
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:00,900
have threat model it's pretty much okay

485
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,360
and I can promise to you that the pro

486
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,580
direct modules are so complex that no

487
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,260
accessories ever going to read them

488
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,160
through

489
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,059
they are they are way too big

490
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:15,120
lots of stuff and lots of this kind of

491
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,959
details that

492
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:21,299
that make really difficult to read of

493
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:22,919
course you can make simple threat model

494
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:24,480
out of it but then it doesn't really add

495
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,700
much value either

496
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,480
also requirements and testing is kind of

497
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,860
thing that

498
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,799
there is not really way to handle them

499
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,960
very well and there is for example there

500
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,059
is no feedback to developers nothing

501
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:40,980
says that you have to tell to fit

502
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,220
developers how did did they do did they

503
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,020
Implement city code or did they do it

504
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,580
correctly

505
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,460
and of course there is no weird culture

506
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,919
in whole documentation why there should

507
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,080
be because cultures don't make software

508
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,620
right

509
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,600
and even worse security level is not

510
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,340
impacting the process

511
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,500
so this process is pretty good if you

512
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,179
aim at

513
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:09,299
some kind of SL2 sl3 but if you aim at

514
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:12,000
SL1 it's complete Overkill and if you

515
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,760
aim at sl4 it's not sufficient I would

516
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,220
say it's not nearly sufficient

517
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,500
it's lacking too much Human Side

518
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,860
so it really one of the cool things it

519
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,380
standard really does though it enables

520
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,320
organizations to spend money these

521
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,360
companies can't use money to security

522
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,480
unless it has standard that's impossible

523
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,700
I mean if it's requirement it has to

524
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,200
have standard

525
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,419
that's the way thinking goes

526
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:44,220
I'm really surprised by that myself

527
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,720
because I have been working in

528
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,159
completely different environments before

529
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:49,620
but it's the way it is

530
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,720
and it addressed this worst of the

531
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,780
current problems you won't see any more

532
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,760
this kind of device that crashes when

533
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,740
you do any map after this

534
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,960
and it helps users they will know what

535
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,460
they get a little bit better than before

536
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,559
right now they have no glue but ticket

537
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,960
and security levels do not really really

538
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,720
reflect the work needed or this kind of

539
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,659
thing that that Gap is there that it it

540
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:20,760
has at least it has at most two meaning

541
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,940
at most two meaningful security levels

542
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,100
the first and last are not that

543
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,539
meaningful in the standard at all

544
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:32,760
I know Nick at this nixo has tried to

545
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,520
apply this outside industrial sector

546
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,760
car for evaluating car but they reported

547
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,100
that it's awfully tied to Industrial

548
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,380
things it wouldn't it didn't work very

549
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,559
well

550
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,720
things in future

551
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,059
there will be race to put them people

552
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:52,919
will try to implement the standard as

553
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:55,799
cheaply and simply as they can and they

554
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,780
will be good at that

555
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,940
they will be good

556
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,820
environment will change so what is now

557
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,280
industrial environment it's not famous

558
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,059
today it wasn't famous yesterday either

559
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:11,039
and there are huge differences between

560
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,039
evaluators I'm already hearing that how

561
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:15,480
on Earth these guys did get this

562
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,559
evaluated

563
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,380
well it was evaluator evaluators take so

564
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,539
much different stand and problem is that

565
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:23,640
this standard doesn't say how cool you

566
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,280
have to do things

567
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,799
so real standard evil what do you think

568
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,140
will there be revisions of standard to

569
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,880
match the changing things

570
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,740
I don't think so

571
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,440
so we will see more and more different

572
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,140
interpretations and certification teams

573
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,059
will start to interpret things

574
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:44,159
differently

575
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,520
this doesn't make standard failed but it

576
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,440
makes it that you have to pay for

577
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,480
certifying the stuff

578
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,059
if it was somebody known to make very

579
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,799
strict certifications then it's probably

580
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,140
high security if it was somebody from

581
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,360
somewhere you don't know about then it

582
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,919
might not be as good

583
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,360
it might be not good at all

584
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,320
typical discuss an inside company goes

585
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,760
this way when starting this kind of

586
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,380
where customers want to have secure

587
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,179
devices

588
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:17,760
they really want to have okay let's make

589
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,740
so secret devices that we can make it

590
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,900
competitive Advantage I have heard this

591
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,520
mirror several times

592
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,059
yeah good idea but actually customers

593
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:29,340
want to have certified devices

594
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,900
they don't know what the secular device

595
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,600
they can misery they can taste it they

596
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,179
just don't know what they secure device

597
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:40,140
I actually made a test with the daily I

598
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,860
asked edit to draw security

599
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,200
secure devices it made a lock on top of

600
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,120
the devices or something like that okay

601
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,120
good I ask Eddie to draw insecure device

602
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,600
well it gave the same as with with the

603
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,480
devices only so that thinks that every

604
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,600
device is in Secure device well might be

605
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,179
can't make difference

606
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:05,880
unfortunately pictures were so boring

607
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,900
that I didn't take them here

608
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,860
the fight between compliance and

609
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,559
security you need both of them you need

610
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,179
to have compliance to make customers

611
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:18,419
happy and you need to have security to

612
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:21,299
make customers happy after five years

613
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:24,000
once they go because compliance doesn't

614
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,559
really protect you against hackers

615
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,840
particularly does but customers can buy

616
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,600
security they can only buy compliance so

617
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,400
vendors should really do both of them

618
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,840
but they are a little bit different

619
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,100
things

620
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,100
compliance is about measurable things

621
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,919
easy to measure things typically

622
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:42,779
valuable things have for example this

623
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:45,080
fit these secret features resourcing

624
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,760
documentation then whether the process

625
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,279
actually works exactly it as it should

626
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,620
maybe not that important it's nice to

627
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,940
have but

628
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,240
not always so important whereas getting

629
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,480
things to be secure you need motivation

630
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,240
people must be motivated without that

631
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,860
they will fake it because it's so much

632
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,100
easier

633
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,260
also they must get feedback

634
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,900
and in general they they are quite

635
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,299
different things

636
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:17,039
and you need to think which one is

637
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,679
driving company

638
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,500
many process oriented companies are

639
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,419
really driving by compliance and then

640
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:25,860
they do the compliance and then they

641
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,900
want their why disagree wasn't that good

642
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,380
after all

643
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,500
when you have certified your device

644
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,900
is it secure does your Emperor have the

645
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,059
clothes

646
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:42,360
you actually cannot really get know

647
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,539
the things that I really need to pay

648
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:49,158
that instance deal is the feedback

649
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,220
and also motivating the team in other

650
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,559
ways though the other willing to tell

651
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,480
the problems they know most of the teams

652
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,860
no problems

653
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,240
are they talking about those

654
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:12,120
and I have heard some disobey conference

655
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,860
that talks about this kind of things

656
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,100
have you heard about it maybe maybe

657
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,539
because

658
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:21,059
even if you are individual developer

659
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:23,700
inside this kind of making this kind of

660
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,299
iot devices or or or or industrial

661
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:30,299
devices you still can apply these nice

662
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:31,260
things

663
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,860
you really still can apply

664
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,760
go on look at what your product does do

665
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,980
and tell about it within company

666
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,860
and share information and don't be

667
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,740
 because that will kill your

668
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,580
effort but I have heard from one manager

669
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,760
of uh industrial device manufacturer

670
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,340
that why on Earth we can't have more

671
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,320
this kind of hacker people

672
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,480
they would love having more of them but

673
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,820
their culture is killing it

674
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,679
so maybe we should have this kind of

675
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,020
hacker inside sticker after all that

676
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,700
corporate would tell that we have these

677
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,919
