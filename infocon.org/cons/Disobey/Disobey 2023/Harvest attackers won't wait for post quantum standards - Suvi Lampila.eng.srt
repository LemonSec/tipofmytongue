6
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,739
okay hi everyone good evening I'm very

7
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,020
pleased to be here to talk about a bit

8
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,120
about post Quantum cryptography and how

9
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,559
it can be used

10
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,440
with

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,020
existing Network infrastructures

12
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,039
to get this pesty quantum computers and

13
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,660
their threat to our

14
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,819
cyber security under control

15
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,020
so I work as an SSH fellow at sh

16
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,900
communication security so a disclaimer

17
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,580
that

18
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,740
um that's what I've been doing for the

19
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,420
past 20 years

20
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,520
uh they're in various different

21
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,799
positions working with

22
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,000
large organizations around the world and

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,100
this post Quantum stuff has been

24
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,619
something that we as a company

25
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,159
have started investing heavily in 2019

26
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,280
and before that we have done some

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,799
research stuff on it but

28
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,340
we're as a company known obviously for

29
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,400
secure shell as the name implies so our

30
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,000
invent founder that we learning invented

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,920
secure shell protocol but we have

32
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,700
contributed quite a lot to other

33
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,320
ipsecond pki standards as well

34
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,540
the post Quantum cryptography is

35
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,000
essentially just a Quantum say

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,920
cryptography there's nothing special

37
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,720
about it from that point of view it

38
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,920
doesn't do anything uh Magic in any way

39
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,220
it is just mathematics trying to come up

40
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,140
with a hard problem for the quantum

41
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,200
computers to solve that we can use in

42
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,780
cryptography

43
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,940
and there's two distinct problems that

44
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,280
need to be fixed with public key

45
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,739
cryptography in particular there's the

46
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,500
key exchange side of things so we need

47
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,720
to protect the session keys and that is

48
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,599
the problem that is the most pressing

49
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,900
right now and then at some point we need

50
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,420
to figure out also something for the

51
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,879
signature

52
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,519
algorithms so they're needed next but

53
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,459
for now we need to focus on the key

54
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,739
exchange side of things now you might

55
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:57,900
ask why post Quantum cryptography and

56
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,720
nothing else well it's something that's

57
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,360
compatible with our current networks and

58
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,060
our proven network communication

59
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,940
protocols like TLS ipsack and secure

60
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,019
shell so it doesn't require anything

61
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,540
um special hardware for this and it's

62
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,580
kind of important like we just don't

63
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,700
have the

64
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,000
resources like as a on a global internet

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,760
scale to plank at the whole earth with

66
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,060
optic fibers to get the blind fibers in

67
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,800
that would be required for something

68
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,440
like Quantum key distribution

69
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,120
and also it like the real life use cases

70
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,659
for those new technologies are kind of

71
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,700
limited also from the point of view that

72
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,120
they come with kind of a built-in man in

73
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,159
the middle so the attacker in the middle

74
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,400
in those Solutions

75
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,680
or something that unless you're able to

76
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,920
do a laser beam to a satellite or so the

77
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,099
line of sight signal base

78
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:07,500
um you still need some sort of jump from

79
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,560
those two devices like mobile phones or

80
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,080
laptops so personally at least I'm not

81
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,879
willing to go back to the world where I

82
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,798
would have to use a telephone with the

83
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,560
optic fiber cord plugged into it and I

84
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,779
don't want to be doing this line of

85
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,080
sight stuff with my phone either so

86
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,720
um that is one

87
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,840
and then even if in this ideal situation

88
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,180
if you have like a very small Geographic

89
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,639
aerialist and 100 kilometers where you

90
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,979
could potentially if you had all the

91
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:39,840
money in the world to throw into these

92
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,199
new gadgets and new optic fibers it

93
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,419
would still leave the very crucial point

94
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,479
which would be the end-to-end security

95
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:50,639
so post Quantum cryptography is able to

96
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,400
provide that other solutions that I

97
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,580
tackle that session key protection might

98
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,800
not so they

99
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,580
um

100
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,060
they would end up that fiber cord would

101
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,400
end up at that

102
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,800
server room or in like a best case

103
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,020
scenario into some sort of device right

104
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,800
beside your Workstation

105
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,440
and what is our Nemesis in this

106
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,380
presentation is really that little pesky

107
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,960
quantum computer chip thingy so that's

108
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,840
iqms a baby picture of a superconducting

109
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,320
quantum computer chip and um I believe

110
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,699
that's the 12 qubit one so it is no way

111
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:39,180
at right now threatening to our existing

112
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,720
cryptography in this baby stage but IBM

113
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,419
is has kept up with their promise of

114
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:48,120
delivering more powerful quantum

115
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,479
computers they're on track on their

116
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:56,300
Osprey is over 400 qubits right now and

117
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,220
iqm that's the finished small startup

118
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,320
that does on-premise quantum computers

119
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,160
they have also promised to deliver

120
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,160
uh logic

121
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,979
computers every year after year or so

122
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:15,300
we're getting there when um

123
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,400
while we're not there yet so

124
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,759
now

125
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,639
all these kind of questions like how

126
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,860
much time do we have there's kind of a

127
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,800
mute point in the sense that we don't

128
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,479
really have that much time to prepare

129
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,660
anymore it's the ship has sailed for

130
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,240
many of these things already when you

131
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,580
think about that that Harvest attackers

132
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,160
they know this thing that this is their

133
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,160
window of opportunity to

134
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,400
um record right now the data that's

135
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,400
going in transit and then just sit on it

136
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,400
and they can do it because it's cheap to

137
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,500
store data in large quantities it's

138
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,220
getting cheaper every year and

139
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,340
um it's just something that

140
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,039
um you can then decrypt later so the

141
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,180
attack on this key exchange is

142
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,160
retrospective so we should have done

143
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,360
something about it already a while ago

144
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,340
and then if you're wondering does this

145
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,220
really affect me in any way or like

146
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,400
yourselves like the wholehearted answer

147
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,620
is that yes it affects everything like

148
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,900
I'm talking mostly about the network

149
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,759
communication protocols and stuff but

150
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,259
anything that uses public key

151
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,419
cryptography it might not call itself

152
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,639
publicly cryptography but rest assured

153
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,699
it's used in every single laptop mobile

154
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,580
device doesn't matter if you just spun

155
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,139
up some sort of

156
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,860
Cloud Server somewhere uh you know it's

157
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,919
vulnerable all the way to the ancient

158
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,139
mainframes that are still used heavily

159
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,639
today in the large organizations

160
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,240
now

161
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,380
this nist project of selecting the new

162
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,000
um

163
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,759
algorithms the pqc algorithms to replace

164
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,800
our

165
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,199
existing cryptography that started

166
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,660
already years ago but last year was a

167
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,419
pivotal moment when in July they chose

168
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,759
the preferred algorithms that will be

169
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,319
standardized

170
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,800
and then if you looked at these

171
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,300
presentations that for instance the

172
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,360
American Homeland Security and

173
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,479
Cesar and niece came out just a few

174
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,539
years ago so in 2021 when they projected

175
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,059
that okay we have this decade to get

176
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,240
this thing sorted out that by 2030 we

177
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,140
should have these uh algorithms in place

178
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,740
that kind of timeline has shrunk uh all

179
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,120
the time so the cyber security

180
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,940
preparedness act that passed the U.S

181
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,120
Congress last year uh already mandates

182
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,640
now that this spring the all the U.S

183
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,500
government agencies have to have some

184
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,120
sort of plan in place how they're going

185
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,399
to do this migration to post Quantum

186
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,100
cryptography and

187
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,420
um the 2024 is for many of these things

188
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,720
as the like the pivotal moment when we

189
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,899
should have the finalized standards when

190
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,100
certain

191
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:17,760
um

192
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,019
organizations are expected to be fully

193
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:26,040
migrating to the post Quantum perfect

194
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,000
algorithms

195
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,380
now how bad is this situation so we see

196
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,080
the clouds forming we kind of know that

197
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,820
we have to prepare for this Quantum

198
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,160
typhoon but just like with these

199
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,019
real-life tropical storms it's very

200
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,240
difficult to predict exactly when and

201
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,360
where this Quantum typhoon will hit we

202
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,640
know what the conditions have to be met

203
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,300
in order this to happen but um it's like

204
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,140
weather forecasting very tricky so we do

205
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,080
know how this will proceed it will be

206
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,660
that public key cryptography will be the

207
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,060
first casualty of this

208
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,399
the key exchange part needs to be

209
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,980
fortified already now then the

210
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,839
authentication keys and certificates

211
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,540
will follow and then there is this thing

212
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,240
where it is not in the best interest of

213
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,279
some of the actors in this world to tell

214
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:22,260
us when they have reached that

215
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,300
capabilities I have colleagues who

216
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,240
believe that we will know when this has

217
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,620
happened

218
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,279
um when some of the Bitcoin and other

219
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,980
cryptocurrencies uh will start showing

220
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,700
uh interesting uh trades and they get

221
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,040
broken but then there are others who

222
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,200
believe that it's the actors in this

223
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,140
world who have the both the resources

224
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,140
from the money perspective and and

225
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,019
otherwise that they would just keep it

226
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,480
to themselves like back in the olden

227
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,940
days when Enigma was broken the Ally did

228
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,060
not let um

229
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,260
you know everyone know that they had

230
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,320
they let their own ships sink to protect

231
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,060
the secret that they had already broken

232
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,779
the encryption machine

233
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,040
so

234
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,079
it is likely that these weather

235
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,779
conditions change fast we have that

236
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,880
little scare a few months ago when the

237
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,399
Chinese research came out saying that

238
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,800
RSA uh 2048 it was broken and well that

239
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,260
turned out to be not quite the case but

240
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,959
when that happens we don't want to be

241
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,880
caught in the storm

242
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,120
now this is just in no way in scale or

243
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,980
anything it's just to give an idea how

244
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,200
this thing progresses from the classical

245
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,779
threat to this Quantum threat so we had

246
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,600
it easy back in the day when RSA was

247
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,399
pretty much the only algorithm we needed

248
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,420
to worry about and whenever things got

249
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,339
um hairy with it we could just double

250
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,860
the key size and we were good to go for

251
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,220
some time so it's a bit like you would

252
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,459
be wearing a angle high boots and before

253
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:07,560
the water level Rose you would switch to

254
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,300
knee-high boots and now we're at the

255
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,160
stage where we're wearing these kind of

256
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,380
fishing pants very uncomfortable not

257
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,279
nice at all very unpractical

258
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,440
but that's what we are stuck with right

259
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,279
now

260
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,260
but then at the end of the day all of

261
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,180
these algorithms Divi Helm and elev

262
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,620
divky different Hillman RSA ecdsa and

263
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,540
well DSA shouldn't be used in any case

264
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,160
these days but

265
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,980
um all of these have to be replaced

266
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,680
the quantum safe key exchange stuff so

267
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,820
in the middle

268
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,459
that has that the retroactive

269
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:44,279
um situation going on there so we need

270
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,920
to act before the cryptograph quantum

271
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,120
computers are available and then and

272
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,279
then that's kind of the last date when

273
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,660
we have to switch from the old

274
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,820
authentication keys to the quantum safe

275
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:57,839
ones

276
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,180
the only silver lining in all this is

277
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,060
that AES that's the symmetric encryption

278
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,720
algorithm is believed to be safe long

279
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,200
into the like it's 128-bit versions and

280
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,360
especially

281
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,079
256-bit AES is believed to be safe until

282
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:18,480
uh foreseeable future but it might be

283
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,519
that you know at some point in that

284
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,399
Quantum uh fancy world we need to figure

285
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,380
out something with those as well

286
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,339
now the industry has taken largely this

287
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:35,519
hybrid key exchange approach and why do

288
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,120
we want to do this at SSH and why others

289
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,040
have done it like cloudflare when they

290
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,620
uh came out last year with their TLS 1.3

291
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,200
uh version having support for pqc

292
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,360
algorithm the Crystal skyper and the

293
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,660
elliptic Kirky development combined we

294
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,820
have come to this conclusion from the

295
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,160
point of view that those pqc algorithms

296
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,420
are quite new

297
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,820
so they haven't gone through that sort

298
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,579
of mathematical scrutiny like our

299
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:08,040
classical counterparts that just hasn't

300
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,380
simply been enough time to do that so we

301
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,220
are a bit iffy about them so we rather

302
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,040
combine the classical algorithm and the

303
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,980
pqc algorithm so that you get the best

304
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,839
of the Both Worlds so

305
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,060
if there's something wrong with either

306
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,519
of the algorithms there's still the

307
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,560
other one and it's going to be at least

308
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,360
as hard to break as either one of them

309
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,519
alone most likely a bit more difficult

310
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,700
because there's they're combined and

311
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,760
then from the point of view like for SSH

312
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,860
when we deal with customers all around

313
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,899
the world who have different kinds of

314
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:48,240
compliance requirements and these are

315
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,339
the largest organizations that have like

316
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:54,120
very strict things the last point which

317
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,519
probably not sure if it's even visible

318
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,279
for all of you but compliance while the

319
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,920
standardization is Gone Going can be

320
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,040
achieved when you do this combination

321
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,199
which wouldn't be because if you would

322
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,079
just go with the pqc algorithms Alone

323
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,420
um while they're being standardized they

324
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,899
wouldn't be compliant

325
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:19,380
now you could it's there's no reason why

326
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,240
it has to be elective quirky different

327
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,579
helmet you could combine several pqc

328
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:26,360
algorithms or you could combine

329
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,740
the classical development the classical

330
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,320
development is just uh slow so it's not

331
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,600
kind of recommended for that point of

332
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,440
view

333
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,500
but more on that

334
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,199
on the next slide

335
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:43,260
so the previous one looked quite nice we

336
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,600
just do the hybrid key exchange so why

337
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,699
the heck do we have like this whole list

338
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:50,160
of all these different pqc algorithms so

339
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,680
in real life what ends up happening is

340
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,320
that even though nist is going with

341
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,880
Crystal skiber

342
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,160
and we have combined that with the nist

343
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,740
curve that uh matches the level five

344
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,339
security parameters so that is like the

345
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:08,699
256-bit security uh leveled that it aims

346
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:11,880
um it's not what all the world is

347
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,579
looking at so Germany has chosen in

348
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:17,399
their BCI they recommend frodochem uh

349
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,519
the French follow the suit so that we

350
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,199
have combined then with the Edwards

351
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:25,079
curve uh David Helman

352
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:28,320
and then open SSH has taken a slightly

353
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,000
different approach they've gone with the

354
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,880
Streamline intro Prime

355
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,800
and that's combined also with Edward's

356
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,079
curve and then in our textia Quantum

357
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,060
safe Edition

358
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:43,680
um we also support uh fire saber

359
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,959
um and that's retained for backwards

360
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:48,779
compatibility because we had to come out

361
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:51,600
with this version before nist had made

362
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,420
their round three selection so we made

363
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,940
an educated guess that they're going to

364
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,040
choose either Crystal Skype or saber and

365
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,680
implemented them both uh for that but

366
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,020
then nowadays in the latest versions We

367
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,780
don't uh by default support sniper

368
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,459
because it's not really recommended by

369
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:13,160
any uh anyone at this point anymore

370
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,199
so that's how the security side of

371
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,359
things is with the commercial tactia and

372
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,179
open SSH supports uh just the Streamline

373
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:24,240
Android Prime then with ipsec the

374
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,240
internet key exchange in that is

375
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,760
furthest along in iatf of becoming

376
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,440
standardized like this method the

377
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,520
framework work how you can combine

378
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,940
these classical

379
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,340
development or the pqc algorithm so it's

380
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,000
not so much about specifying which pqc

381
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,240
algorithms to use it's just the

382
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,700
framework how you're able to do that so

383
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,820
what that allows in the ipsec world is

384
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,580
to get into this situation where if you

385
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,220
need to have Americans communicating

386
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,440
with the Germans and everybody wants to

387
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,000
be compliant within their own

388
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,340
jurisdiction we can have for instance

389
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,860
elliptic division combined with Crystal

390
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,720
skyper and Frodo okay

391
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,539
now all of these are lattice space

392
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:16,559
algorithms there's some differences on

393
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,900
the underlying mathematics like what

394
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,820
kind of learning with errors these are

395
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,240
so the protochem it kind of stands apart

396
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,160
from the pack because it's a more

397
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,220
conservative Choice it's not structured

398
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,320
lattice but because they're all ladder

399
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,120
space algorithms where there's still

400
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,039
that sort of inherit thing that if

401
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,400
there's any issue with the lattices with

402
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,020
the quantum computers that gets

403
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,480
discovered at some point

404
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,419
um most likely will affect all of these

405
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:48,240
so the nist is still looking in this

406
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,440
round four that is ongoing until 2024

407
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,320
um these algorithms that would be based

408
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,660
on some other mathematical problem than

409
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,520
the learning with errors on lattices

410
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,640
and this is just the key exchange side

411
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,820
of things so then

412
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,700
what we the need to worry about at some

413
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,440
point is these Quantum save

414
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,220
authentication keys for online use the

415
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,100
crystals the lithium that's the primary

416
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,100
candidate that was selected last summer

417
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,340
uh it it's fine in most cases Falcon is

418
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,799
usable if you need something that has

419
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,799
smaller signatures than delithium but

420
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,360
then I have this question mark here

421
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,460
because

422
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,020
unprecedentedly at least open up the

423
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,140
conversation Midway for new submissions

424
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,380
so by June 2023 we so this year we

425
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,960
should have more candidates and ideally

426
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,059
something that is not lattice based

427
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:48,960
because

428
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,780
I'm sure many of you read about what

429
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,299
happened to Rainbow a year ago

430
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:58,320
um and many of the other candidates that

431
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,559
they just did not survive uh not even

432
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:02,880
our

433
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,419
measles laptop so

434
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:10,440
um we need ideally something that would

435
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,200
be based on some other

436
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,039
mathematical heart problem

437
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,500
now what can you then do with these uh

438
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,320
like the Bedrock of these protocols so

439
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,960
with secure shell and with ipsec you can

440
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,880
make any connection

441
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,520
um Quantum safe so you can do the

442
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,340
various tunneling features that exist in

443
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,919
our Tech tier in open associations port

444
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,100
forwarding so essentially you take any

445
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,640
TCP connection and you uh tunnel it

446
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,860
through secure shell connection so

447
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,380
you're able to get almost end-to-end so

448
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,280
in node to node security with that

449
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,660
and then

450
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,620
this is kind of um important part of it

451
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,700
that you have to be um with open SSH it

452
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,580
has to be the version 9.0 which is not

453
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,220
available right now everywhere but where

454
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,919
it is like for instance on the latest

455
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:14,220
versions of Mac OS it uses already open

456
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,640
SSH 9.0 so that's kind of an easy thing

457
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,320
but there's a whole bunch of

458
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,840
infrastructure out there that is not the

459
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,400
latest and greatest

460
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,880
so there you have to start thinking how

461
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,120
are you going to be able to do this

462
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,299
uh on those platforms and then if you

463
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,100
need something that is like entire

464
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,580
network then so you need your UDP

465
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,500
connections you don't necessarily even

466
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,740
care what's in the network uh you just

467
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,960
want everything to be Quantum safe and

468
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,700
you could go with the network level

469
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,340
encrypter that's like for from us we

470
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,760
have nqx for that and it's ipsec based

471
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,539
solution

472
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,520
now

473
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,159
I think I skipped something yes the

474
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:08,460
quantum safe journey so these very first

475
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,440
steps are something that probably has

476
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,780
already happened even if you haven't

477
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,940
thought about Quantum safe itself you

478
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,100
have probably figured out where the

479
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,820
valuable assets are and now when you put

480
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,220
the quantum safe journey glasses on you

481
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,500
start looking at your assets then you

482
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,380
need to look at like what the data that

483
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,780
is in transit how is protected currently

484
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,840
so pretty much any protocol that has the

485
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,120
plaintix version and the S version you

486
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,480
know that you have to tackle that

487
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,240
and the prioritization plan when

488
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,159
everything has to be updated it then

489
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,740
comes down to how do you choose what to

490
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,280
update first and many of these

491
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,500
um migration plans they have that how

492
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,480
long the data needs to be kept secret as

493
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,340
the last bullet point but I think you

494
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,840
should start with that because that

495
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,780
informs you where you where your pain

496
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,500
points are and what really uh what makes

497
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,679
sense so if you have extremely uh

498
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,280
sensitive confidential data that will be

499
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,860
public in a few months time you don't

500
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,780
really need to worry about that at this

501
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:18,539
stage but if it's data that you know has

502
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:19,820
a long

503
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,020
validity period from that point of view

504
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,260
that it's sensitive going uh you know

505
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,260
that we talk about years then you have

506
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,799
to start protecting those so

507
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:36,360
I would love if like personally if the

508
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,059
medical industry if that was if the

509
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:41,039
healthcare industry was deleting this

510
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,840
thing because they have the most

511
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,659
sensitive data like yesterday's keynote

512
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:48,000
speech about was the about the vastama

513
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,919
case so that data will never expire it's

514
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:56,059
uh should be indefinitely kept a secret

515
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,740
but our world doesn't work function

516
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,740
unfortunately that way so mostly what we

517
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,780
see in our customer base it's the

518
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,039
financial

519
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,380
industry they have been regulated for

520
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,600
such a long time that they have and they

521
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,780
have good incentives to do so they're

522
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:15,659
um they have this costly compliance

523
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:19,320
failure model where it's if they lose

524
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,720
their primary account numbers of their

525
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,539
customers it's existential crisis for

526
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:27,419
banks it's also the compliance violation

527
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:30,120
fights are astronomical so they have a

528
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,760
very good uh incentive to get this thing

529
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,760
going over now

530
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,919
and then something if you've ever been

531
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,559
involved in any of these sha One Shot

532
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,600
Two transitions for instance that have

533
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,440
taken started already eons ago and have

534
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,080
dragged on and on you know that there's

535
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,460
you have these great plans how it's

536
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,960
going to go and then at the end of the

537
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,159
day you're not going to meet the

538
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,820
deadlines and there's still stuff uh

539
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,640
running out there that it's using show

540
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,740
one that is not supposed to and so forth

541
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,539
so I'm kind of telling you the bad news

542
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:06,600
here we have this long tail with that

543
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,720
Char one to sha2 transition uh this

544
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,059
would have to happen quicker like you

545
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:14,940
cannot dilly-dally uh with this

546
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,480
transition as we have been doing with

547
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,419
the child want to show two transition

548
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:24,240
and the fine print when you start

549
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,400
looking at your applications that use

550
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,919
for instance TLS the the difficult part

551
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:30,900
is that even though

552
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,600
um like vendors like cloudflare for

553
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,220
instance when they have

554
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,100
put that out there that they're going to

555
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:43,260
support the crystal skyper with ecdh out

556
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,620
of the box it applies only to TLS 1.3 so

557
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,240
you have to start planning how do you

558
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,000
get all your TLS 1.2 applications

559
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,940
upgraded to 1.3 to be able to benefit

560
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,640
from this and if you cannot you know

561
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,039
deal with all the embedded TLS and the

562
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,659
Legacy systems that are about to be

563
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,460
decommissioned because you've decided to

564
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,400
go to cloud or whatever reason there is

565
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,080
or come back from the cloud to

566
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,059
on-premise when you figure out that not

567
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:11,340
all things are sunny and great over

568
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,600
there

569
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,299
um it's a great thing to start planning

570
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:18,120
at least some sort of temporary Quantum

571
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,720
safe solution to tackle that

572
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,700
and then chances are that you're going

573
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,340
to be using that for for a long time to

574
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,100
come but at least uh plan for it and

575
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,820
then

576
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:34,380
when we get that uh news that RSA has

577
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,600
been broken then you better have a

578
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,120
prepared some sort of emergency plan how

579
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,919
are you going to go into production if

580
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:43,679
it has to happen faster than what you

581
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,260
anticipated in the first place

582
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,039
now our company deals mostly with

583
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:52,320
encryption software so we provide that

584
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,960
kind of tools but we do also do some

585
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,059
Professional Services in terms of risk

586
00:26:57,059 --> 00:26:59,940
management so so for secular State sort

587
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,340
of things we're able to do stuff and if

588
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,799
you're more like I'm sure most of you

589
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,500
here are more like let me do it myself

590
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,679
we have also Sherlock tool that you can

591
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:13,740
download for free and um use in your own

592
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,200
environment to figure out your post

593
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,840
Quantum resiliency situation as well as

594
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,740
other uh essential information about the

595
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,080
secure shall estate

596
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,260
foreign

597
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,539
securing the key exchange when it comes

598
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:38,340
to the security side of it is that it's

599
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,900
just a simple software upgrade

600
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,880
everything happens kind of under the

601
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,340
hood there's very little things that can

602
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,220
go wrong and and can break

603
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,100
um so there's really no reason to delay

604
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,620
because all these hybrid systems also

605
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,200
support the classical case so you can if

606
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,440
you want enforce the pqc already now in

607
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,240
which case if you try

608
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,700
some older clients that don't support

609
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,880
any of the

610
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,179
server algorithms listed here

611
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:11,460
um that they would fail to connect but

612
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:13,559
when you have

613
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:17,340
newer stuff like open SSH 9.0 it would

614
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,700
uh select the Streamline enter Prime and

615
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,279
our privileged access management privex

616
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,860
would choose Crystal skyper Azteca and

617
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,400
few other of our Solutions and

618
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,159
then you're able from your logs you're

619
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,980
able to see what's the situation also in

620
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,320
your environment so if you don't need

621
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,440
the full-blown uh stuff and and you're

622
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,299
dealing with just few you're you're good

623
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:43,679
with just

624
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:44,539
um

625
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:47,279
figuring out just from the locks where

626
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,440
you are along the transition at what

627
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,380
point are you able to switch to that uh

628
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,000
pqc only

629
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,380
uh configuration

630
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:59,760
and then when you kind of dealt with the

631
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,059
key exchange side of this then from the

632
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:04,919
quantum safe journey perspective the

633
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:06,360
next step is the monitoring the current

634
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,340
authentication Keys now this might be

635
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,779
something that you have already done for

636
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:11,820
the past 10 years because you have

637
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,760
compliance requirements to get the key

638
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,919
inventory and all the

639
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,020
uh Keys need to meet the current

640
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,360
standards and and so forth the

641
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,000
entitlement management uh it helps if

642
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,340
you use some sort of privilege access

643
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,059
management or other things where you

644
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,720
you're able to uh kind of have a clear

645
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,520
uh clear picture what the credentials

646
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,380
that are used in the environment are and

647
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:44,460
who who are using them and then my tube

648
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,500
sense here is that please exceed the

649
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,480
minimum standards if you have to still

650
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,960
create existing RSA keys or elliptive

651
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,600
curve keys so you don't want to be the

652
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,380
the easy target going forward

653
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,559
um with the the smallest key sizes but

654
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:04,260
know that it will not save you in the

655
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,200
long run but in the in the short term at

656
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,580
least it will make it a bit more

657
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,880
difficult for the attackers

658
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,059
foreign

659
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:18,659
step because even though on paper it

660
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:20,399
looks pretty much the same you update

661
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,500
the software again all that but

662
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,659
unfortunately this requires a whole lot

663
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:28,140
of more industry uh effort to get this

664
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,960
step going so all the cas so

665
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,820
certification authorities everything

666
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,419
needs to be updated and

667
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:39,179
um there's also this unfortunate thing

668
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:42,299
with this authentication keys that need

669
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:43,740
to be replaced in public key

670
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,440
cryptography that ideally they should be

671
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,480
able to stand on their own merits so

672
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,360
there is no easy hybrid Solutions when

673
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,820
it comes to the authentication keys they

674
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,980
would become very cumbersome for users

675
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,559
or machines to use if we need to require

676
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,640
first for instance uh long enough RSA

677
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,860
key and then you have to authenticate

678
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:09,899
also with some pqc like delithium key at

679
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:12,539
the same time to gain access

680
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:16,200
but you will probably end up seeing

681
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,779
these environments where you have this

682
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:20,700
mixed environment so you still have the

683
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,740
old keys in place used in some place you

684
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:27,059
start to use new pqc keys in some assets

685
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:30,000
and it might be at that point that if

686
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,039
you have gone through the zero trust

687
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,559
approach with the authentication key so

688
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,720
you do not have any more these

689
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,500
long-standing Keys like SSH keys or the

690
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,580
uh AWS

691
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,159
API keys that would be

692
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,899
persistent so if you have gone already

693
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:53,340
tills just in time uh keys that are

694
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,679
uh generated uh and kind of disappear

695
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,500
automatically after 15 minutes or eight

696
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,240
hours or something you're kind of in a

697
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,640
better position at this transition phase

698
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,860
when you don't have to deal with the

699
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,779
entire environment and all of those

700
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:12,960
persistent Keys you have a kind of a

701
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,240
um you can sleep better at night when

702
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,399
knowing that even if somebody steals

703
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:20,580
your current uh ephemeral authentication

704
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:25,080
key is not going to be usable anymore

705
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,620
um you know after today or

706
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:32,220
whatever the timeline for that is

707
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:36,059
then when we eventually get to this post

708
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:38,580
Quantum world

709
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,140
you know it's good to know that the

710
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,539
sufficient alone classical keys are good

711
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:44,340
until the day one

712
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,539
so

713
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:49,559
so that's the the point when you have to

714
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:52,799
disable them last and I as I mentioned

715
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,360
the AES is kind of good until on on

716
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,640
future unless new attack vectors are

717
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,340
found on those and then that's kind of

718
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,580
also the last ditch place where you

719
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:10,380
really have to uh let go of all the old

720
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,779
key exchange algorithms as well but

721
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:16,140
ideally the last bit that you have

722
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,080
uh chosen one of the hybrid pqc

723
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,820
algorithms to be used in the environment

724
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,620
it should have happened already now

725
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,179
because

726
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:27,059
um well you don't want to be the one who

727
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:29,039
then tries to explain to somebody how

728
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,980
did this recording attack happen uh and

729
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,860
why are your sensitive information out

730
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,179
there

731
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:38,279
years after the fact when it was

732
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,820
captured

733
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:48,480
so if you have any questions there's I

734
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,860
think there are people with microphones

735
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,700
who can run around and catch them or if

736
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,100
you need to

737
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,299
digest this a little bit more you can

738
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:01,399
always go to see the resources that are

739
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,460
www.ssh.com Academy site

740
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,779
uh

741
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:09,960
maybe one question so I I was taking

742
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,119
some notes from your presentation and

743
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:17,219
this plan of action for migrating you

744
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:19,260
mentioned data that needs to be

745
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:22,339
protected for many years to come

746
00:34:22,339 --> 00:34:24,839
like medical data

747
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:28,440
isn't it that this is anyways data at

748
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,020
rest like on hard disks or some

749
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,379
databases in the cloud which is mostly

750
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:36,839
protected with symmetric Keys anyways

751
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:38,480
and as you mentioned in your talk

752
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,060
symmetric AES is

753
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,760
not vulnerable when quantum computers

754
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,859
become available so I don't really need

755
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:48,599
to worry about my medical data because

756
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:51,320
it's protected with AES

757
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,418
when it's addressed often that's the

758
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:57,480
case in ideal situation but then this is

759
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,460
like data in transit so that medical

760
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,599
data still gets washed around over the

761
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,839
internet and

762
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:09,119
that's where you would really ideally

763
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,400
like to see the pqc algorithms being

764
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,500
deployed already now

765
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,320
sure the other question was about this

766
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,720
embedded TLS where upgrades are hard

767
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,980
um

768
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,220
there was not really so much mention of

769
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,320
what kind of

770
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,140
key sizes and message sizes are we

771
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,260
talking about when we have this post

772
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,900
Quantum stuff like

773
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,200
I would think like embedded TLS is

774
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,180
anyways restricted

775
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,180
by how much key and message sizes it can

776
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,140
handle so if like I'm trying to migrate

777
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,380
some small sensor device to post Quantum

778
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,740
is it the right target to to migrate or

779
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,540
is there maybe better things that I

780
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,660
should plan for migrating

781
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,060
and maybe my final question was in your

782
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,099
presentation there was mention about key

783
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,640
exchanges and

784
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,740
uh certificates and signatures used in

785
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,599
certificates

786
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,599
um should I care about software updates

787
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:23,460
if my like software packages are signed

788
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:27,240
and there is like this whole secure boot

789
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,599
process and boot loaders and and yes yes

790
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:34,220
definitely you should care about your

791
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,560
New York's like the for instance the

792
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,280
cnsa 2.0 that is uh I think it was

793
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,800
published the the final draft for the

794
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,040
last September it uh does not actually

795
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,380
recommend the pqc algorithms because

796
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,619
they don't see that they would be

797
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:55,260
available in a timely manner so it has

798
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,380
some

799
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,960
uh old uh

800
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:03,619
algorithms that are considered to be

801
00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:07,500
Quantum resilient enough to be used and

802
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,680
I think the deadline for those to be put

803
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,680
into place at least for the governmental

804
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,700
agencies in the US is 2024. so yes you

805
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,800
should definitely worry about also that

806
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,280
sort of things I just um talked mostly

807
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,400
about the communication protocols in

808
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,780
this presentation

809
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,579
but check out the cnsa 2.0 for those

810
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:34,619
and you did ask something in the middle

811
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,540
which I already saw about the embedded

812
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:40,020
stuff yeah so yeah obviously that is a

813
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,540
tricky thing like so it was actually on

814
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,520
the nist last

815
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,680
um

816
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,220
uh kind of a workshop I guess I could

817
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,160
call it it was called upon that you know

818
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,140
please when they are trying to figure

819
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,079
out like what sort of submissions to get

820
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,520
in uh June for these uh authentication

821
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,140
Keys the signature algorithms they were

822
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,599
actually calling out for some stuff that

823
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:10,200
would have a very small signatures or uh

824
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,420
something that would be mostly and and

825
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,180
to try to describe the use cases where

826
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,980
we should try to find the alternative

827
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,660
that would kind of replace the question

828
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,520
marks there because Falcon even though

829
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,980
with smaller signature sizes it's not

830
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,660
ideal in in all applications

831
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,379
any other questions

832
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:39,950
okay thank you everyone

833
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:43,739
[Applause]
