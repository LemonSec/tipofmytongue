00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,940
thank you

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:30,059
[Music]

4
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,900
thank you

5
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,819
[Music]

6
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,199
how the are you disobey

7
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,500
oh man it's been a rough two days uh

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,760
I've had fun have you had fun

9
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,780
for Real uh well that's brilliant I have

10
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,000
some thoughts though

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,640
just a few I won't bore you with too

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,760
much ranting and rambling but

13
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,020
this year we've had mental health as one

14
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,680
of our spearhead topics

15
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,860
had a really courageous moment very

16
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,500
warnable moment on stage and I think

17
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,400
that deserves a special mention at this

18
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,520
point

19
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,259
it's it's incredible that we can have

20
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,420
this

21
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,799
sessions that we can have these talks

22
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,700
that we can have this community uh where

23
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,340
this is possible where people feel safe

24
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,240
on stage to share something so personal

25
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,060
with a huge amount of people

26
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,780
I I was moved I hope some of you were

27
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,140
moved

28
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,600
we've had a lot of technical talks we

29
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,759
had visitors from other

30
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,139
countries we've had amazing connections

31
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,239
we met friends

32
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,760
people we haven't seen for a really long

33
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,780
time

34
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,480
and

35
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,280
I'm I'm getting emotional thinking about

36
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,340
it twice we had to cancel

37
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,800
twice we were this close to being here

38
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,879
again

39
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,000
but now we are and it's coming to an end

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,660
and I almost kinda don't want it to but

41
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,140
I also have really tired feet and I kind

42
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,420
of get around and get my

43
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,540
toes in the sand right

44
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,800
so

45
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,060
I hope you feel a sense of

46
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,239
belonging a sense of accomplishment a

47
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,680
sense of

48
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,379
finding your people

49
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:58,560
as uh closely as I do

50
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,920
if not then let's drink some more and

51
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,920
maybe we will become better friends

52
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,540
some statistics from this year

53
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,159
1714 participants

54
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,379
that's a new record for us

55
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,360
228 CTF players that's also a new record

56
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,680
for us

57
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,439
[Applause]

58
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:36,959
57 Flags in the CTF now how many of you

59
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,560

61
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,560
brilliant

62
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,440
many many many minutes of talks many

63
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,959
many minutes of workshops

64
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,159
a lot of hacking a lot of lock picking

65
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,080
a lot of laughs

66
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,580
we have

67
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,860
as usual

68
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,840
some awards that we want to give out

69
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,760
this year

70
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,120
we're gonna start with handing out uh

71
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,120
the stealthiest solve

72
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,019
from the Elisa and varzilla

73
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,120
OT Village

74
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,780
I want to welcome to Stage uh Elisa

75
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,180
people I'm gonna jump off because this

76
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,280
stage is too small for all of us

77
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,380
gonna grab my beer okay greetings

78
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,680
everybody uh greeting from upstairs so

79
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,680
we have a privilege of hosting the

80
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,300
OT delays challenge together with

81
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,940
varachilla so I would say it has been

82
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,120
quite a success a lot of attendees a lot

83
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,639
of happy people trying out their skills

84
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,620
uh

85
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,020
if you try to attend it you might know

86
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,199
that the end goal was to basically print

87
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,940
out the batch that gives you access

88
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,580
behind the closed doors on your way

89
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,280
there you might have maybe set off a

90
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,699
fire alarm on a factory level uh maybe

91
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:14,220
misuse the robotic arm to kill a Barbie

92
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,720
doll somebody might have made it happen

93
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,580
but uh

94
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,220
kind of like the special Source 47 was

95
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,500
that we had a pool demo also from LS

96
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,860
side trying to see how what the hawk is

97
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,639
doing and and how stealthy they might be

98
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,880
and we had interesting learning and and

99
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,259
so we wanna give a a small price to the

100
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:43,440
one particular team that from our

101
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,960
perspective uh

102
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,800
beat the things right so what go what

103
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,720
was the end result

104
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,660
the end result was it was amazing

105
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,720
obviously it wasn't the fastest team

106
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,120
that did the challenge

107
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,660
but it was indeed this stealthiest and

108
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,800
um

109
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,039
they did things in a way that based on

110
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,199
running on memory so

111
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,940
they left

112
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,780
very minimal tracks for us to monitor

113
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,960
and if um

114
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,660
the automation wasn't able to track them

115
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,940
and the sock should have done manual

116
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,940
operations in order to just basically

117
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,860
stop them

118
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,720
so um

119
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,639
as Ben said

120
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,120
me as well my feet are very sore at the

121
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,819
moment so um we would like to hand this

122
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,280
price over to the team that is called

123
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,040
Sask 69.

124
00:06:44,040 --> 00:07:01,829
[Applause]

125
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,060
thank you congratulations thank you

126
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,319
congrats thank you

127
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,520
how did you do it how did you do it

128
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,380
laughs

129
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,099
so

130
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,300
um yeah we started enumerating the

131
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,340
machines

132
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,800
but we try not to use so much like these

133
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,539
automatic tools because we knew that

134
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:34,380
this will be like very noisy

135
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,099
um

136
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:37,740
after some point we start to do maybe to

137
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,599
try

138
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:42,660
we noticed that there were some specific

139
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,360
uh oh it's called extension using the in

140
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,060
application and we start to do some very

141
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,020
like easier or maybe common uh buff and

142
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,759
we got the first flag

143
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,919
then the next ones require a little less

144
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,818
noise in general so

145
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,180
I don't know okay we just I mean we just

146
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,759
went with a flow with a bit of our noise

147
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,620
yeah yeah so

148
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,039
yeah I think nothing really fancier

149
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,199
particular we just yep

150
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,599
is a bit of our knowledge but nothing

151
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,940
super special for you

152
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,680
excellent hey uh kudos to Sask 69 and as

153
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,760
a final remarks upstairs we still have

154
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,319
beer welcome

155
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,279
[Applause]

156
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:51,779
okay uh so one down one to go nixo also

157
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,700
had a scavenger hunt

158
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,899
now I'm not 100 sure where the

159
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:00,440
here

160
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,480
guys are uh this year they actually

161
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,240
asked for permission last year

162
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,160
they had me uh and because no in 2020 uh

163
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,440
they had me amiko hupman and as part of

164
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,839
the scavenger hunt without asking our

165
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,019
permission which was a lot more in line

166
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,480
with the spirit of the event to be

167
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,160
honest

168
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,980
a lot more fun so I kind of feel like

169
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,140
you dropped the ball on that one I'm

170
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:31,560
sorry but you kind of did

171
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,160
I don't know where the uh

172

she found me uh without using her

270
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,720
bracelet and badge but because there was

271
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,600
no risk I can't award her the win

272
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,420
the same is true for energy are you here

273
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,160

274
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,459
now he's probably left and a special

275
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,260
mansion

276
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,860
to T2 or Tommy tubing and

277
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,760
who managed to get inside the event five

278
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,620
minutes before the opening of The Doors

279
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:26,720
dressed as a vault delivery person

280
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,899
requiring a signature from The Av team

281
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,360
because he was delivering medicine

282
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,240
now if that isn't social engineering

283
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,639
just for shits and giggles I don't know

284
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,980
what is

285
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,740
on top of it he actually bought a

286
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,519
support pass which is the ticket price

287
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,079
uh which this event could cost without

288
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,399
sponsors so big up to T2 I really

289
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,040

296
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,160
competition the main challenge or the

297
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,720

298
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,480

306
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:51,740
no

307

say that the flags were really fun this

317
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,660

318
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,900
things to figure out and

319
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,120

320
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,010

00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,919
this challenge has not been solved

there has not been a winner presented

407
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,640
this challenge takes place in the

408
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,799
fictional city of coaster

409

00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,240
is a state where

411
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,960
we see police brutality

412
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,419
overreaching governmental

413
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:12,539
insight and spying

414
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:15,780
corruption on the highest levels

415
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,659
and a telecom provider that provides

416
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:21,500
Concrete service

417
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,480
this year

418
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,179
in the badge challenge

419
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:29,059
we had

420
00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:33,299
4032 transactions now unfortunately for

421
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:34,980
the central bank

422
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,179
of call hostelito they had made a small

423
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:42,840
problem by buying their banking software

424
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,820
from the

425
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,740
bidder with the lowest price

426
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,320
they also forgot

427
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,059
to do input validation which led to

428
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:59,340
a overdraft

429
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:03,360
or a possibility for anybody who sent a

430
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,280
negative amount of money to another

431
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,799
account of actually getting that same

432
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:11,460
amount of money into their own account

433
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,740
now it seems

434
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,080
our friends at kuha

435
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,539
the call was the underground hacking

436
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:20,820
Alliance

437
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,840
took some liberties with this

438
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,580
vulnerability

439
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,940
and managed to well

440
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,440
completely tank the entire economy of

441
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,419
goldostalita

442
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:40,320
because they are now minus uh let's see

443
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,120
if I can read this right one trillion

444
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,919
495

445
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:52,400
billion 800 wide not one million 1011

446
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,340
416 coaster box in that

447
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:00,960
I think they need financial regulation

448
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,600
the highest amount of money any one

449
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,220
account

450
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,740
well most of it was stolen by one

451
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,039
account

452
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,658
has almost the same number

453
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:18,720
the account with the most transactions

454
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,860
uh has 1553 and

455
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,919
they are some of you figured out that

456
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,720
there was a leak Market where you could

457
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,820
buy hints to the puzzle you could do

458
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,918
well purchases on the system

459
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,380
1268 of you actually created an account

460
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,360
whether or not you realized it by

461
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,700

462
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,659

co-host or intelligence agency

466
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:59,059
I needed to re-initialize your batch

467
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,799
this year

468
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,330

the show I would humbly ask every single

516
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:15,659
volunteer to join me not on stage but at

517
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:17,760
the proximity of the stage

518
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,059
I couldn't do well we can try to fit on

519
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:24,000
the stage I suppose I couldn't do any of

520
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,940
this without any of you this is a group

521
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,200
effort

522
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,539
yeah let's try to get as many on the

523
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,220
stage as possible this will be

524
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,440
impossible very quickly

525
00:30:36,779 --> 00:30:39,779
these people deserve your thanks

526
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:42,360
they make this happen

527
00:30:42,360 --> 00:31:28,208
[Applause]

528
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,559

529
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:34,559
so thank you from the bottom of our

530

year there's an after party at BTC where

534
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,559
you can get your feet in the sand the

535
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,240
joke is to put the hackers in the

536
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,200
sandbox so

537
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,910
