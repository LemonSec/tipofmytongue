00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:26,420
[Music]

4
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,260
good evening everybody and welcome to

5
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,620
listen to the story of swan or

6
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,100
how I stop worrying and learn to build

7
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,079
cyber security in the maritime world

8
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,620
so this is a story

9
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,039
and play in three acts which begins

10
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,680
somewhere in late 2017.

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,420
and

12
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,680
continues until the December of 2018.

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,020
and how we build

14
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,619
basically the world's first autonomous

15
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,840
passenger ship in the world

16
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,759
so

17
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,479
what is autonomy and Maritime world and

18
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,400
what the heck do I have to do with it

19
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,840
little background

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,520
I'm

21
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,159
security generalist

22
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,740
field of cyber security from the early

23
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,500
2000s

24
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,860
uh previous life in Finnish Navy

25
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,740
have been Americans Mariner

26
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,159
on General Tinker on

27
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,100
based on the children's poem I think

28
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,079
what my next career move will be

29
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,020
so in

30
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,060
2017 late

31
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,640
2017 somewhere around

32
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,360
October March or October November

33
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,239
I joined the Rolls-Royce Maritime

34
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,660
Research Center for remote control and

35
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,599
autonomous ships which was

36
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,239
established in Turk Finland

37
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,760
about the year before the

38
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,200
uh

39
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,300
event of me joining

40
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,580
I became the cyber security lead for a

41
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,120
project Swan which is uh

42
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,900
acronym for safer vessel with other most

43
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,440
navigation

44
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,459
so project swan

45
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,040
previously Rolls-Royce had a research

46
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,500
Department in Copenhagen

47
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,660
and the Copenhagen Department had been

48
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,660
building a remote controlled vessels but

49
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,519
not autonomous vessels

50
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,420
they had a remote controlled talk called

51
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,920
Spitzer hermit

52
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,379
and it was a demonstrator piece for

53
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:12,840
maritime remote control

54
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,560
basically a talk which could be used

55
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,480
unmanned or on crude

56
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,840
as for example a firefighting vessel in

57
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,760
in uh

58
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,840
ports in a case of ship fire or or

59
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,120
similar accident situation where you

60
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,640
don't want to send people to close

61
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,620
the switcher hermit was

62
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,459
class approved on on late 2017

63
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,900
and based on that Rolls-Royce decided to

64
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,879
continue the research for autonomous

65
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:53,040
side of the maritime industry

66
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,940
and

67
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:01,799
as a Continuum uh The Finnish to r d

68
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,319
Center started building

69
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,179
this one itself

70
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,319
Swan was

71
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,019
built on top of our already existing

72
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:18,180
pool it was a finfery's la Falco

73
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,418
54 meter long Ferry operating in the

74
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:24,660
parallel now Waterway

75
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,639
and

76
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,139
Falco was

77
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:33,240
modified extensively to be able to

78
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,100
handle autonomous navigation situations

79
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,160
most importantly it was redesigned to

80
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,040
have a dual Azimuth trusters 360 degree

81
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,860
capable propulsion system

82
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,520
on on uh eventually this kind of spoils

83
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,800
the whole story but eventually Falco

84
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,100
became the first passenger ship in the

85
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,540
world with the class approval for

86
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,800
autonomous

87
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,960
Voyage with passenger capacity

88
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,460
so at this point we are living in in

89
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:17,940
2008 2017 and Rolls-Royce r d gave the

90
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,060
kind of ultimate goal for the project to

91
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,800
demonstrate the capability for

92
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,560
autonomous navigation

93
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,080
on

94
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,820
from the very beginning of the project

95
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,320
it was clear that this was a

96
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,500
demonstrator it was not meant to stay in

97
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,479
use it was a

98
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,500
piece to show that this is possible

99
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,720
and

100
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,120
we started thinking that what is the

101
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,820
actual goal for the cyber security part

102
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,600
of this project and the whole cyber

103
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,440
security goal was

104
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,000
eventually

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,680
crystallized in a question

106
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,759
is it safe to continue a current mission

107
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,100
if something happens

108
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,039
is the ship still capable of continuing

109
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:11,639
what it is doing right now or do we need

110
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,600
to abort the mission do we need to start

111
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,520
doing some kind of Fail-Safe procedure

112
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,220
so a couple of words from the sailor's

113
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,860
perspective my background before joining

114
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,460
Rolls-Royce was American Mariner

115
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,680
uh specializing in liquid bulk cargos

116
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,020
AKA oil tankers

117
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,220
on for sailor the ship itself is a place

118
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,840
to live it's a place to work you spend

119
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,500
four to six weeks at a time in the

120
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,020
vessel and you have a very little

121
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,419
connectivity to outside world

122
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,479
so already at this point you can

123
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,300
kind of guess that connectivity plays an

124
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,780
important role in all these

125
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,780
maritime

126
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,219
areas

127
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,740
from cyber security point of view

128
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,220
sheet is basically just a huge

129
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,940
floating power plant

130
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,280
and some ICS and OT networks attached to

131
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,440
it

132
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,039
most of the time quite complicated most

133
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,380
of the time quite old

134
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,880
and

135
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,360
connectivity to the outside world from

136
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,620
Modern even still modern vessels is is

137
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,880
MF radios age of radios vhfs satellite

138
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,380
connections

139
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,900
if you are close to the Shoreline

140
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,380
perhaps mobile networks

141
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,639
that depends on the location

142
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,979
but for the Sailor

143
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,319
that's the lifeline

144
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,099
having a connection to your family

145
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:09,419
having some kind of connection to the

146
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:11,960
outside world

147
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,020
and this is the kind of a discrepancy

148
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,599
between the Sailor point of view and the

149
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,599
cyber security point of view in the

150
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,660
Maritime side

151
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,259
so

152
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,660
before we actually started building

153
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,599
anything we started defining what

154
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,740
actually autonomous means and and we

155
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,380
came up with

156
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,120
kind of a

157
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,660
four stages or four definitions for

158
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,459
maritime autonomy at the time

159
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,839
if you nowadays go and Google this stuff

160
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,540
you probably want uh will find more

161
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,980
definitions different kind of

162
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,700
definitions more steps and and

163
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,620
such but

164
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,100
uh traditional vessel traditional ship

165
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,580
is is automated to some extent

166
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,760
there is autopilot

167
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,200
uh

168
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,100
there are some kind of decision support

169
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,140
systems uh of course our parade or they

170
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,660
can automatically track other vessels

171
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,420
for you you have AIS systems that give

172
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,300
you information about other vessels but

173
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,000
key point is is that seafarers are on

174
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,120
board they operate and control all the

175
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,800
systems

176
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,120
on on

177
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,940
they utilize the automation that's the

178
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,800
still even today the most common

179
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,740
situation with most vessels

180
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,380
the second stage of path towards

181
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,820
autonomy is is

182
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,420
remotely controlled vessel that still

183
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,720
has Sailors on board they can take over

184
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,820
they can control the ship at any point

185
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,240
when they fail to do so

186
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,000
but the ship is capable of being

187
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,620
controlled

188
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,380
from remote control center

189
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,580
or somewhere else some other system or

190
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,959
some other vessel perhaps

191
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,660
third stage

192
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,480
is remotely controlled vessel without

193
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,959
the seafarers on board

194
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,940
ship is still

195
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,320
all the time controlled by human but not

196
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,959
from on board the human might be again

197
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,500
on the shore it can be on

198
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,140
oil platform it can be on other vessels

199
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,880
somewhere else but not on board the

200
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,560
current vessel being controlled

201
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,440
on the final stage would be then of

202
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,600
course the fully automobile ship

203
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,600
and the main difference between the

204
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,600
fully automated fully automobile ship

205
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,480
compared to the three other stages is a

206
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,420
decision-making the system is capable of

207
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,959
making decisions how to avoid other

208
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,360
vessels

209
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,579
how to approach a port

210
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:21,120
basically all those decisions that uh

211
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,180
humans are currently making on board the

212
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,599
vessel

213
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,399
important distinction is that there is a

214
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,540
difference

215
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,740
between autonomous vessel and uncrewed

216
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:45,000
vessel these are often they are

217
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,660
talk together they are seen as the same

218
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,100
thing

219
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,820
but it's not necessarily so there are

220
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,640
several locations where the system the

221
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,200
ship itself

222
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,320
might be capable of completely

223
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,019
autonomous operation but still have a

224
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,640
crew on board

225
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,019
uh

226
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,560
good example would be platform Supply

227
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,959
vessels

228
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:15,240
providing support to the oil refineries

229
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,240
and an oil drilling platforms their

230
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,420
mission profiles very commonly are such

231
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,779
that they spend weeks and weeks four to

232
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,959
six sometimes 10 weeks at a time out in

233
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,680
the sea but the mission critical point

234
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,320
takes perhaps few days

235
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,720
you are providing the support some

236
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,839
repairs some supplies something else to

237
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,440
the oil trading platform and then you

238
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,899
proceed towards the next Target you

239
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,540
might have a transition leg that takes

240
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,279
several days

241
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:53,279
and at this point

242
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,100
uh there might be

243
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,300
kind of a no point of having a human on

244
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,700
the bridge or or human controlling the

245
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,459
vessel if there are no other vessels

246
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,019
around

247
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:11,279
and the ship odomos capability can take

248
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,220
some of the burden off from the actual

249
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,079
crew of The Vessel they can get some

250
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,899
rest they can do something else make

251
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,760
preparations for the next critical

252
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,920
Mission phase something else

253
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,300
so

254
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,300
some of the vessels in the future they

255
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,860
might be completely autonomous

256
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,200
completely uncrewed

257
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,380
some other vessels are probably partly

258
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,839
autonomous

259
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,660
or fully autonomous but still have a

260
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,980
crew on board

261
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,180
these are are not uh strictly set in

262
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,459
stone how they how they will be in in

263
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,760
the future

264
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,160
one thing that that defined what we were

265
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,019
doing

266
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:03,540
in in the uh

267
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,300
Rolls-Royce was

268
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:10,200
uh focus on the safety in the maritime

269
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,339
World safety is everything

270
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:16,380
is is revolving around the concept of

271
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,500
safety and it is said that Mariners

272
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,200
Bible is called Solas

273
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,959
solos is a convention for safety of Life

274
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,760
at sea

275
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:31,620
was written in in 1914 after the Titanic

276
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,760
incident

277
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,399
and it's one of the

278
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,459
defining conventions from the uh

279
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:40,980
International Maritime organization that

280
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,740
defines how ships are built how they are

281
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,339
operated how crew is operating on board

282
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:50,040
and and we had to take everything from

283
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,279
the solos conventions

284
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:54,720
uh into account when we were starting

285
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,500
thinking how do we build a ship that is

286
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,899
capable for for autonomous operations

287
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:06,360
also every sheet has to have a class

288
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,699
Society approval so

289
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,760
in in the world of Maritime they are the

290
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,639
class societies are the instances that

291
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,300
Define when the ship is seaworthy when

292
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,240
when the ship is capable of going uh

293
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,920
going out to sea

294
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,699
on on idea is that

295
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,339
we have handed over this kind of a

296
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:32,220
inspection responsibility to the class

297
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,740
societies so that they are

298
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,440
they are same and similar from country

299
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,699
to Country

300
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:42,300
so instead of having a ship that is is

301
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,800
rated

302
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,980
good here in Finland but not Sea World

303
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,579
in in Sweden for example instead we kind

304
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:54,480
of gone on the class Society definitions

305
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,620
and their approvals

306
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:00,240
every crew member of course have to be

307
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,820
qualified according the IMO sdcw rules

308
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,320
but

309
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,199
one of our main kind of uh

310
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,480
how to say problem points was that these

311
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,380
IMO conventions they don't really tell

312
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:21,060
much actually anything about autonomous

313
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,360
vessels or on crude vessels IMO so far

314
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,880
has made a statement that something

315
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,680
needs to be done

316
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,120
but there is no IMO convention yet

317
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,339
defining how to build how to operate how

318
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:38,820
to man uh how how to do anything with

319
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,920
with these kind of autonomous ships

320
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:45,839
so

321
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,620
we started to design for the security

322
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,279
no class

323
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,779
definitions at that point yet

324
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,360
uh

325
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,440
tnv and pnv from Norway and Bureau

326
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,660
Veritas from France

327
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,640
story to build their own class

328
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,160
definitions for the cyber security side

329
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,540
around 2018 but when we were building

330
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,720
this project and and

331
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,299
creating the design documents they were

332
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,400
not yet available they they were in

333
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,040
draft forms of course we had some

334
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,319
influences from them

335
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:28,260
so we started evaluating the common

336
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,260
industry

337
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,440
documents common industry standards

338
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,100
least cyber security framework

339
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:41,820
IEC 62443 for industrial standards ISO

340
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,400
so on

341
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,179
and by chance

342
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:50,160
we found out that

343
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,280
U.S Coast Guard was actually thinking

344
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,260
these exactly the same things they they

345
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,320
had taken the uh needs cyber security

346
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,520
framework

347
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,880
and started building a maritime profile

348
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,860
on top of that

349
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:09,320
so the maritime profile for nist CSF

350
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:14,280
became our kind of a guiding document

351
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,260
but

352
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,660
still we took some influences from the

353
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,039
other documents

354
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,620
six two four four three

355
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,340
mainly

356
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:32,520
at that time we had some idea on design

357
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,419
what we do what kind of framework do we

358
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:39,120
actually utilize to figure out how to

359
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,940
build a secure and safe

360
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,760
shape that can operate without

361
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,780
human on board

362
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,400
and

363
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,640
we realized that Rolls-Royce had a

364
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,900
really strong safety culture already

365
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,880
Rolls-Royce is a company that does

366
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,740
processes

367
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,480
and they do them well so their initial

368
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,460
design and safety process was done

369
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,280
somewhere around 1942 for the

370
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,760
Rolls-Royce Maryland engine and it was

371
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,480
updated almost immediately after in 1972

372
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,000
for the Rolls-Royce Olympus engine for

373
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,940
the Concorde and

374
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,039
they Define that that's good let's go

375
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,840
with that one

376
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,860
but the safety processes were really

377
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,980
comprehensive and strong they used

378
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,020
failure mode effective analyzes

379
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,900
everywhere they had a hazard processes

380
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,120
for every component in the aircraft

381
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,960
engine and and all these processes were

382
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,480
done really meticulously

383
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,440
so we decided to start

384
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,559
taking these same processes and mapping

385
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,840
them into the cyber security side

386
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,460
and

387
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,080
we built threat modeling processes

388
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,980
in the form to follow the ethnica with

389
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,380
story building risk analyzes to follow

390
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,160
the same process of hazop uh

391
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,280
basically our idea is that

392
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,860
build a process that they already know

393
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,080
they are familiar with their safety

394
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,580
processes

395
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,120
build a security process that flows

396
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,340
through exactly the same way as their

397
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,500
safety process

398
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,240
we had a lot of help from the

399
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,100
Rolls-Royce Aerospace or kind of uh

400
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,460
grand old man was was the Aerospace site

401
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,340
cyber security cyber security lead

402
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,140
Robert Oates

403
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,220
fantastic guy

404
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:54,679
this way we actually were able to

405
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:57,780
introduce the cyber security model

406
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,720
much faster inside the company than we

407
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,760
actually anticipated on the maritime

408
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,000
side

409
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,200
and then

410
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,080
we ran into this

411
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,600
ethical and moral dilemma

412
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,120
what to do when the Coalition avoidance

413
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,000
becomes Coalition assurance

414
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,460
this is a topic that would warrant its

415
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,280
own speak on itself I could probably

416
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,120
speak about hours of this

417
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,720
so I won't be diving too deep here but

418
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,620
the main point is is that eventually one

419
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,059
day

420
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:41,340
autonomous or remote controlled vessel

421
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,320
will be in a situation that it cannot

422
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,280
avoid a coalition it will have to decide

423
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,860
not to avoid the Coalition but where do

424
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,480
I collide

425
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,000
and

426
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,640
no legal Frameworks no regulatory

427
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,960
coordinates or anything like this exist

428
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,020
and the burden of making that decision

429
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,260
lies on the engineers building the

430
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,400
vessel

431
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,700
and it's it's a

432
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,740
it's a difficult choice

433
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,320
for a single software engineer to decide

434
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,039
who one does

435
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,059
our solution was rather simplified and

436
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:26,880
straightforward The Vessel decided

437
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,000
always the path that minimizes the

438
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,940
kinetic impact between two vessels or

439
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,159
vessel and Shore

440
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:37,440
it's not a perfect solution but it was

441
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,799
at the moment the one we came up with

442
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,640
so

443
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:52,440
the lesson learned

444
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:57,600
around late 17 early 18 was that

445
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,240
Safety and Security

446
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,419
are very closely coupled in in Maritime

447
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:07,020
environment and a security incident

448
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:11,039
almost always becomes a safety incident

449
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,039
and I'm pretty sure that this actually

450
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:16,200
applies to many other areas if we are

451
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,520
talking about Aviation railroads uh

452
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,900
self-driving cars even probably many

453
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,659
Factory Networks

454
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:30,679
many areas

455
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,440
so

456
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,620
story proceeds and we are now living

457
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,280
somewhere around early 2018.

458
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,880
and at this part

459
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,400
how we actually dream that everything

460
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,200
would go

461
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,900
when we started building things and and

462
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,320
how we planned it

463
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,539
the initial stage where we are planning

464
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,480
everything we had

465
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,860
really wild all kind of cool Concepts

466
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:16,380
videos ideas we presented videos about

467
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,080
autonomous drones flying around the ship

468
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,659
inspecting for failures like Eye in the

469
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:25,799
Sky situation all kinds of augmented

470
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,659
reality stuff

471
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:31,080
real-time remote audio from the axi

472
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,720
shafts and and such

473
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,539
nothing of this actually became reality

474
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:39,539
so

475
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,900
from the really cool Concepts

476
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,360
we kind of backed it down into the

477
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,860
reality

478
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,580
and and

479
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,419
we started thinking what are the actual

480
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,700
subsystems that are needed for the

481
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,980
autonomous system so that we can

482
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,720
actually build this vessel and and the

483
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,299
immediate answer of course is we need to

484
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:07,799
have the autonomous navigation system

485
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,900
the brains of the ship that makes the

486
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,940
decision where to navigate how to avoid

487
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,700
coalitions and so on and so on

488
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,760
but the autonomous navigation system is

489
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,299
unable to do anything on itself if it

490
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:23,520
doesn't have decent situational

491
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,779
awareness

492
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:27,600
it needs to have connectivity

493
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,360
when it needs it needs to have some kind

494
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,419
of a cyber security system

495
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:35,640
so we decided to call it

496
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,779
very into a Innovative name cyber

497
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:41,640
security subsystem

498
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,460
but also engineering need to be

499
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,799
automated so that we can provide enough

500
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,080
information from the engineering and and

501
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,600
Machinery space

502
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,120
to the autonomous navigation system do

503
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,220
we have a propulsion failure do we have

504
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,860
some something that prevents us on

505
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,840
moving on One Direction or the other

506
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,200
the shape needed sensors we we

507
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,240
eventually came up with

508
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,799
three different

509
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,900
basic sensor suits

510
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,659
traditional Maritime radars

511
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:21,779
they they are being used for long range

512
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:26,059
detection long-range tracking and and uh

513
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:29,460
uh in in some cases also identification

514
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,020
of the targets

515
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,799
but the problem with radar is that it's

516
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,860
not nearly accurate enough in short

517
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,059
ranges

518
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:42,059
there is all all kind of of distortions

519
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:45,840
and all kind of uh uh animalies in short

520
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,980
range

521
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,140
it's very good in tracking long-range

522
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,820
targets

523
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,919
we needed something else we needed

524
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:56,000
something to actually

525
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,460
correctly track something that was

526
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,080
reasonably close

527
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,178
to the ship itself so

528
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,820
for that that reason we have had a

529
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,799
leader

530
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,799
which was capable of of Point Cloud

531
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:18,000
mapping and and creating reasonably good

532
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,240
images

533
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,120
approximately to one nautical mile

534
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,820
depending on the weather and for example

535
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,340
raining of course some some problems

536
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,039
with the leader then we had

537
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:34,559
traditional daylight cameras infrared

538
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,919
cameras thermals for close range

539
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,440
tracking identification and

540
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,860
classification of the vessels there are

541
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,380
lots of research was done on on image

542
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:50,220
recognition ship classifications and and

543
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,880
similar Technologies to identify what

544
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,980
kind of a Target we are actually dealing

545
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,020
with in the close range is it another

546
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,440
vessel uh if it's a vessel is it

547
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,000
actually a cargo tanker sailing vessel

548
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,600
something else

549
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,260
the security side

550
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,880
was

551
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,799
let's say

552
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,840
interesting

553
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,860
our original thought and idea was to

554
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,980
build a unified architecture Unified

555
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,159
uh structure for everything

556
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:30,840
and

557
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,760
quite soon we realized that the ship

558
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,559
itself

559
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:40,640
and the shore side remote control

560
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,400
stations are so different

561
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,860
that they actually need their own

562
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,380
individual Solutions

563
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,940
the ship

564
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,880
it needs to be able to fail to save

565
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,039
without a human in the loop if you if

566
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,200
we're talking about autonomous system it

567
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,140
needs to be able to do the uh Fail-Safe

568
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,740
without without human on the other hand

569
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,900
the remote control station is always

570
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,980
crude

571
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,200
there there's always someone available

572
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,740
to make the human decision in the end

573
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,100
we started hunting all kinds of

574
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,320
solutions we decided that we need to

575
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,679
have an external security operators

576
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,940
Operation Center

577
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,440
on

578
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,860
in the end we realized that there is no

579
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:36,240
solution for the ship side so

580
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,140
we got all the cool boss words we got

581
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:44,940
AI we got ML and and whatnot

582
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,659
and remember this was 2018.

583
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:52,799
most of the stuff was uh PowerPoint

584
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,120
where at that stage during that time

585
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,000
pretty much nothing worked actually the

586
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,159
way they were marketed

587
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,440
on

588
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,860
almost all the systems were designed to

589
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:12,200
operate in a relatively standard

590
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,659
corporate type of network

591
00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:18,380
they assumed always on connectivity

592
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,820
which is not

593
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,860
guaranteed out in the blue sea

594
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,419
and pretty much every system defaulted

595
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:32,340
descending

596
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,460
most difficult cases to a human analyst

597
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,580
and especially in the case of the vessel

598
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:43,580
side this was kind of a no-go for us

599
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,440
so we

600
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,600
started thinking how how do we build

601
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,860
this

602
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,659
uh

603
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:53,940
we evaluated

604
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,919
five or six different vendors and

605
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,899
options

606
00:30:57,899 --> 00:30:59,700
and

607
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,260
our selection criteria eventually became

608
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,200
uh the one with the most Cooperative

609
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,559
attitude instead of best detection rates

610
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,299
so

611
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,740
we started designing started building

612
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,980
the system uh

613
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,440
we need to have a fault tolerance as

614
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,659
every Maritime system need to be

615
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:33,000
basically duplicated or or some other

616
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,120
way made

617
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,520
fault tolerant enough that it passes all

618
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,340
the safety uh regulations

619
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,799
and and uh

620
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:45,179
we started

621
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:47,039
building

622
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,539
containers

623
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:52,980
in in the docker sense and containers in

624
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,559
the shipping sense so the system was

625
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,240
uh

626
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,340
containerized and orchestrating the

627
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,659
containers

628
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:07,220
and then building that on fault

629
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,960
redundant cluster which was actually

630
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,120
built in a shipping container which was

631
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,740
then welded on the deck of the ship

632
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,159
itself

633
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,980
and and

634
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,039
we started thinking how do we

635
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,080
how do we do the security part this is

636
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,020
kind of the safety part on on what do we

637
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,580
do with the security part how do we

638
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,860
guarantee that

639
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,580
on

640
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:39,539
we came into a real realization that

641
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:44,100
these security products can get us only

642
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,020
so far

643
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,740
but

644
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,179
the only actually

645
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:52,919
what we consider to be a really

646
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:57,179
effective way of of uh improving the

647
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:00,000
overall Security State of the ship

648
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,980
itself was to

649
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,179
minimize it

650
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,179
in June so

651
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:11,600
reasonably as low as reasonably possible

652
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,880
take down take off everything that is

653
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,940
not absolutely needed minimize minimize

654
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,940
the attack surface of the vessel itself

655
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,140
so that it is

656
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:28,019
as freedom and and as resilient as as

657
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:30,240
possible

658
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,159
we

659
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,260
started talking about die rule as us

660
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:40,679
everybody knows the cyber security CIA

661
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:42,720
Triad confidentially the Integrity

662
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,419
availability but

663
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:49,080
those are those are goals those are

664
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,320
something you try to get to those are

665
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,000
ideals

666
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,519
how do you get there

667
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:00,960
we had already decided that uh most of

668
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,179
the subsystems are running in a

669
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:05,220
containerized environment they are

670
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,940
orchestrated uh

671
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,219
honestly I don't anymore remember who

672
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:15,020
came up with the acronym die comes from

673
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,460
distributed immutable and ephemeral

674
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,199
systems

675
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,098
on on

676
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,780
all the systems need to be distributed

677
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,699
so that they are available all the time

678
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:30,359
even if some part of the vessel fails

679
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,859
uh

680
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:34,139
they are immutable when the container

681
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,480
starts running it cannot be changed

682
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,699
anymore if you want to make changes you

683
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:41,639
kill the container and and spin up a new

684
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,599
one

685
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:44,940
in the case of for example attack

686
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:47,699
situation you shouldn't be able to make

687
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:50,520
any changes into the currently running

688
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,940
part of the system

689
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,918
and ephemeral

690
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,800
kill the container immediately when you

691
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,200
don't need it anymore spinning up

692
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,980
do your task dial away if there is no

693
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,800
one responding to your attack

694
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,079
you have less attack surface available

695
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,560
and

696
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,920
kind of our conclusion is is that if you

697
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,660
want to do autonomous cyber it's

698
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:25,440
actually really damn difficult

699
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,780
there is always a situation when the

700
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:32,760
attacker can push your system outside of

701
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,780
its

702
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,380
design parameters of its decision limits

703
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,339
and at that point if there is no

704
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:42,900
connectivity

705
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,020
to kind of get the input from the human

706
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,780
what do I need to do at this point

707
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,619
the system is is in an fault state that

708
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:54,960
it cannot resolve itself

709
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,820
and

710
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,339
these are really tedious problems and

711
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:01,859
tedious situations to solve

712
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,740
long failure mode trees

713
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:08,940
hundreds of nodes on the trees and each

714
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,180
and every one of them should end in a

715
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,480
state that is considered to be

716
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,780
failed safe

717
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,260
in the maritime environment

718
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,119
this kind of a situation where the

719
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,460
attacker pushes the system out of its

720
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,180
design boundary is is a situation where

721
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,359
the strip can be stranded for example in

722
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:38,640
a busy Waterway it can be stranded

723
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,400
floating in a current some other

724
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,400
situation and and we started saying that

725
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,800
we are in a business where a denial of

726
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,500
service can actually kill people

727
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,880
any unexpected situation this vessel

728
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,640
tries to make a connection towards the

729
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,820
remote control center but the window of

730
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,680
opportunity to actually make the

731
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,619
connection so that the uh officer of the

732
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:05,460
watch

733
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,740
on the remote control center can

734
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,200
actually take over and remediate the

735
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,300
situation can be very narrow it can be

736
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,880
short and

737
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,940
this kind of situation can in worst case

738
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,619
lead into

739
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:24,200
Coalition and people die

740
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,780
and of course we have all the other

741
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,740
Maritime area

742
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,560
problems uh

743
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,320
connectivity as I already previously

744
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,839
mentioned one of our most precious

745
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,980
resource in indeed Maritime area cannot

746
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,960
be guaranteed out in the blue seat there

747
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,320
is perhaps a satellite they are very low

748
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,760
band with very high latency links if you

749
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,720
need to make remote control operation

750
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,579
across

751
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:01,980
a link that has two and a half second

752
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,740
round trip time and 64 kilobits of

753
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,960
bandwidth it's it's

754
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,820
basically an undoable situation

755
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:13,020
uh

756
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,599
at this stage we started implementing

757
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,540
similar procedures that Aviation does uh

758
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,240
etops Fail-Safe zones so if the system

759
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,480
cannot resolve the situation and cannot

760
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,000
make a connection it tries to

761
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,760
get itself into a safe Zone and

762
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,920
basically wait to someone come and pick

763
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,940
it up

764
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,060
but it's also not always always possible

765
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,980
and then of course there's the

766
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,440
environment it's a humid

767
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,680
sea water corrodes everything the ship

768
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,440
is constantly rolling if you have a

769
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,060
traditional hard drive it will fail

770
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,680
immediately

771
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,160
there's all kind of shaking and

772
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,359
all that stuff

773
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:05,820
this is a short case of connectivity

774
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:10,920
uh it's a scores resource and and we

775
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,460
can't select if it's available or not

776
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:17,460
and we started thinking that is there a

777
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,160
way of actually working around bad

778
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,240
connection

779
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,480
do can we actually make uh remote

780
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,780
operation with a really bad quality slow

781
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,780
link and and

782
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,180
one thing that we can affect is the

783
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,980
computing power on the ship itself and

784
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,560
the computing power on the on the shore

785
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,900
side remote control station

786
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,760
and we have a leader

787
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,119
it can create very quickly very accurate

788
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,040
Point Cloud image of the target ahead of

789
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,540
the ship

790
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:52,260
we can convert that one into a wireframe

791
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,980
so we have wireframe model of the target

792
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,599
ahead of us

793
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,859
we can present that one with the point

794
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:04,500
coordinates and vectors

795
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,780
that can be actually transferred across

796
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,900
low latency or low speed high latency

797
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,740
link

798
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,680
and on the receiving end we can

799
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,900
reconstruct the image

800
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,000
it was actually a

801
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,839
GTA 5 engine that reconstructed image

802
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,599
but that gave the remote operator

803
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:27,900
officer of the watch enough information

804
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,859
so instead of having a video of the

805
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:33,660
target ahead of

806
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,099
the Sheep

807
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:38,520
there was a computer generated image but

808
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,540
it gave the distance to the vessel it

809
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:46,140
gave the position Vector movement Vector

810
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:50,339
speed uh attitude of the Target and it

811
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:52,859
enabled

812
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:54,839
the remote operator to make the decision

813
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:56,460
which way

814
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,280
do we start our movement to avoid the

815
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,180
college coalition

816
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,160
so

817
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,520
the lesson learned from this stage is is

818
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,859
work with what you can affect

819
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,740
don't spend your resources in the areas

820
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,980
that are out of your control

821
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,500
use what you have and use that to

822
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,000
mitigate

823
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,740
the systems that you cannot affect

824
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:40,500
and now we get to the late 2018.

825
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,640
how it actually went

826
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,060
so

827
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,280
as I mentioned previously we realized

828
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,220
that we cannot use a single similar

829
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,740
architecture on the remote control

830
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:02,940
station and on the ship itself so

831
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:07,440
the project was kind of split into we

832
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,660
had the swan itself

833
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,760
and we had the RCs the remote control

834
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,500
station

835
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,599
the

836
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,660
building of these setups began somewhere

837
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:22,140
approximately half an half year before

838
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,540
the demonstrate demonstration day was

839
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,119
set up the shore side remote control

840
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,000
station was built on on Turk on on the

841
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,460
filmfare's premises

842
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,900
and the chip itself was stationed in the

843
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,880
parallel Waterway the distance between

844
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,560
these two stations was approximately 50

845
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,660
to 55 kilometers somewhere around that

846
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,720
the swan or Falco itself

847
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,760
one part of traditional ship building

848
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,740
new propulsion and such one part of

849
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:04,640
purpose-built technology

850
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:07,440
the subsystems that I mentioned earlier

851
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,359
were all

852
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,300
separated in their end uh

853
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:15,240
own dedicated Networks

854
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,300
uh separate cyber security subsystem was

855
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,800
built

856
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,020
it was isolated from the rest of the

857
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,020
ship rest of the subsystems with one-way

858
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,480
links

859
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,420
most of the Technologies we used we

860
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,160
tried to select them from commercial

861
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,359
off-the-shelf stuff whenever possible

862
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:39,920
some of them we had to build ourselves

863
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,560
following the

864
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,720
class regulations Maritime regulations

865
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:48,920
all the subsystems were duplicated in in

866
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,540
Maritime environment we talk about left

867
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,980
and right

868
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,260
left watch right watch and and left

869
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,720
system right systems they're basically

870
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,040
identical

871
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,200
on on

872
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,280
both sides of name comes from this idea

873
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,859
that they actually originally wear on on

874
00:44:07,859 --> 00:44:09,420
the other other

875
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,640
Parts there was a port on starboard

876
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,020
systems nowadays they don't necessarily

877
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,540
or so

878
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:21,180
some of the subsystems were not at the

879
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,640
time present on the class regulations

880
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,520
like the cyber security subsystem but we

881
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,319
use that to further divide the

882
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,780
segmentation

883
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:34,980
the hardware selection for maritime use

884
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,339
was

885
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,900
a really narrow selection of Hardware

886
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:43,859
that is rated to be used on board ships

887
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:46,800
most of the stock was was coming from

888
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,599
Dell at the point they they were

889
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:53,400
actually making a line of uh computers

890
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,680
that were rated for maritime news

891
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,420
and

892
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,680
not just

893
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,200
minimizing the attack surface we also

894
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,119
decided that

895
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:08,400
there is no way to actually connect the

896
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,640
ship connect to the ship itself so the

897
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,040
vessel always initiates connection

898
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,660
towards the shore

899
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,880
so there's no no way of actually

900
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,560
connecting into the vessel

901
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,640
a lot of testing we had

902
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,660
70c going days for testing the vessel

903
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,160
of course

904
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,319
mechanical testing all kinds of stuff

905
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:38,940
but also

906
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:42,359
a lot of cyber security testing

907
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:44,099
and

908
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:46,319
many of the stuff we used integrated

909
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:49,260
navigation system as a prime example

910
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:52,880
ins has the inertial navigation

911
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,720
satellite navigation position keeping

912
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,880
these are systems that are not really

913
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,200
designed

914
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,900
to withstand any any kind of cyber

915
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,319
attacks and and several on several

916
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:10,339
occasions we were actually managed to we

917
00:46:10,339 --> 00:46:13,079
managed to find a vulnerability that

918
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:16,260
allowed us to deviate the actual

919
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,660
position of the vessel as a

920
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,400
demonstration we actually

921
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,560
watched from our electronic chart

922
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,960
display as the vessel Drive 35

923
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,359
kilometers inland

924
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:32,700
as the position keeping device failed

925
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,619
on

926
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:39,440
the OCS or OT ICS side had a lot of

927
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,540
traditional programmable Logics that

928
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,240
that control for example electricity

929
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,780
conduits and such and many many of them

930
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:50,579
were failing

931
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:53,819
good thing was that our uh company

932
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:56,520
working with was was very helpful and

933
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,660
fixed these problems

934
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,460
okay

935
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,680
the remote control station itself was

936
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,480
basically a

937
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,980
breach of a ship built built in lands it

938
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,599
had everything the same that the ship

939
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:15,660
actually all the knobs and buttons and

940
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,400
and sticks and everything were exactly

941
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,540
the same

942
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:21,480
but instead of Windows you had several

943
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,859
screens

944
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:26,460
overlaying the video video View

945
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,020
please begin the central connection

946
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,759
point for the vessel itself

947
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,619
also very highly segmented Network

948
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:41,940
and and uh we decided to separate

949
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,280
not just segmental networks itself but

950
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,500
have two different categories of

951
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,720
networks we had the actual operational

952
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,839
networks that had the services needed

953
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,180
for the navigation and then we had

954
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,880
auxiliary networks that had this kind of

955
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,359
traditional you have ntp servers and

956
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:02,339
whatnotes

957
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:04,560
and and they were they were then

958
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,160
separated in two different categories

959
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,020
uh

960
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,380
also extensive testing on this side but

961
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,819
uh

962
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:17,460
for the RCs side we actually were able

963
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:20,339
to find outside uh security testing

964
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:23,400
companies so we outsourced some of the

965
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,760
security testing at this stage to save

966
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,780
time mostly

967
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,280
and and we had the

968
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,180
f-secure RDS at that point selected as a

969
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:42,419
sock provider

970
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,640
so

971
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,560
almost at the end of the presentation

972
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,880
but

973
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,359
two weeks before the final maiden voyage

974
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,780
two weeks time to the

975
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:57,000
December 3rd

976
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,240
and a wild connection to Ukraine appears

977
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,119
we were on the very end of the testing

978
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:08,700
runs we were basically preparing the

979
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,400
vessel already for the demonstration

980
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,599
Voyage made in voyage

981
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:17,099
120 people

982
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:20,180
coming on board making the first

983
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:22,920
autonomous voyage

984
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,420
and

985
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,420
our network monitoring says that we have

986
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:31,200
an incoming connection from a Ukrainian

987
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,619
server that is identified as very

988
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:37,859
reasoned command and control server for

989
00:49:37,859 --> 00:49:40,079
some malware can't remember the name

990
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,680
anyone so at this point

991
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,200
we went into a panic mode all the

992
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,640
Finnish speakers

993
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:51,859
recognize the proverb

994
00:49:51,859 --> 00:49:55,560
that was me at the time

995
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:00,060
and uh at that point I I made the only

996
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:04,079
possible decision left and I I called

997
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,420
this

998
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,319
on

999
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:15,000
roughly in in five days time uh he

1000
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,940
figured out what was going on

1001
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,920
uh

1002
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,220
unfortunately we had a network

1003
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,540
misconfiguration and an ntp server

1004
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,940
misconfiguration at the same time which

1005
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,280
led into a situation that

1006
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,380
our ntp

1007
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,800
made a connection to pool ntp York

1008
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:38,300
instead of midterate in Finland

1009
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:42,660
and it's by chance randomly selected

1010
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:47,220
that breached Ukrainian ntp server and

1011
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,200
the network misconfiguration led us into

1012
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,700
a situation that we didn't see the

1013
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,980
outgoing package we only saw the return

1014
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,800
package which made us think that it's

1015
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,480
actually

1016
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,900
connection initiated from outside

1017
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:04,440
so you can probably understand that we

1018
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,640
were in a panic mode

1019
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:12,359
so

1020
00:51:12,359 --> 00:51:14,579
don't do everything yourself

1021
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:17,579
when you need help call for help there

1022
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:18,780
are always

1023
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,660
the brighter guys that can solve the

1024
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:24,500
problems that you can't and

1025
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,780
every possible plan

1026
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,099
tested

1027
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:30,240
because

1028
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,240
what we found out Mr Murphy it will

1029
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,440
visit you

1030
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:37,880
on every occasion possible

1031
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:41,339
so

1032
00:51:41,339 --> 00:51:44,579
December 3rd 2018.

1033
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:48,839
uh Swan weighted maiden voyage it's only

1034
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,220
voyage

1035
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,900
it was clear from the very beginning

1036
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,480
that this ship was never intended to

1037
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,520
stay in service it was a technology

1038
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,960
demonstrator

1039
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,119
and it served the single purpose of

1040
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:02,700
showing that this can be done

1041
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:03,960
uh

1042
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:07,500
roughly 120 passengers were on board

1043
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,619
can't remember the exact amount

1044
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:15,260
Voyage was done on a very bad weather

1045
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:18,540
Sub-Zero temperatures snowing

1046
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:22,380
on on the poets took total of 42 minutes

1047
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,900
which were the longest 42 minutes in my

1048
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,140
life

1049
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:29,819
half of that Voyage the ship was in

1050
00:52:29,819 --> 00:52:32,640
autonomous mode no humans touching any

1051
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:38,460
controls uh shape made three uh

1052
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:41,040
moves to avoid coalition

1053
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,099
during that time the sea area was not

1054
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:46,140
cleared of other traffic so there was

1055
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,720
other all the normal traffic in that sea

1056
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,079
area all the time going on

1057
00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:55,079
the second half was done uh on on remote

1058
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:57,540
control mode and the vessel was

1059
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:00,900
controlled from the field ferries remote

1060
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:04,640
control center from turko

1061
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:06,660
so

1062
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:09,240
I was told I have 55 minutes it's gone

1063
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,280
