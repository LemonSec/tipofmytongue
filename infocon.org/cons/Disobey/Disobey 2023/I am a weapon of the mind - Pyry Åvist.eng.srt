1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,140

[Music]

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,510
[Music]

4
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,429
[Music]

5
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,040
all right

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,200
uh

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,300
let's get started

8
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,140
so first of all uh I would like to

9
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,739
apologize the length of my topic

10
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,680
but to my defense I can say that I

11
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,660
didn't even write that topic

12
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,660
and actually uh now is maybe a good time

13
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,699
to admit that I didn't even write the

14
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,099
application to Target this opaque

15
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,780
someone else did

16
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,200
so uh what I'm today going to talk about

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,680
is about using large language models

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,740
chat GPT in context of social

19
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,460
engineering

20
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,259
so a little bit about myself

21
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,080
my name is puriovest I'm one of the

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,880
co-founders and chief technology

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,280
officers at hoxhant

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,400
so to get a little bit context where

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,619
this data and the kind of stuff I'm

26
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,259
gonna present comes from hawksand helps

27
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,380
large companies medium-sized smaller

28
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,220
companies to reduce human risk and part

29
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,920
of that is

30
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,740
sending large amount of phishing emails

31
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,979
to end users globally from tens of

32
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,720
thousands to hundreds of thousands per

33
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,100
day

34
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,979
and that gives us tool to test different

35
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,399
ideas

36
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,420
a couple of acknowledgments before I

37
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,200
continue so first of all

38
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,179
a lot of people help me in kind of

39
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,520
making this experiment presentation real

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,360
so first of all got big thanks to our

41
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,800
amazing event offensive red team and

42
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,840
some of the developers and product

43
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,060
analysts who helped me kind of getting

44
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,540
this done

45
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,280
so agenda

46
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,959
first we're going to talk about okay

47
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,660
what is this fuss about regarding chat

48
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,680
GPT AI in terms of cyber security

49
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,080
then we're gonna like a little bit talk

50
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,000
about how do they work so I'm sure many

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,860
of in the audience knows this probably

52
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,200
better than I do but still we're gonna

53
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,840
get some kind of idea how these kind of

54
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,700
models work how do you train them what

55
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,379
do they actually do

56
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,540
and then we're gonna kind of talk about

57
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,300
the experiment what was the setup for

58
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,780
our experiment and uh results

59
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,120
and then okay so what what does this

60
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,459
mean what should we kind of use this

61
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,120
information for

62
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,739
so

63
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,680
what is this first about so

64
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,480
uh

65
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,019
our customers as soon as Chachi PT came

66
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:21,720
out our customers started asking us that

67
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,480
hey how does this change kind of the

68
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,940
landscape of social engineering will be

69
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,780
we'll ask uh kind of uh kind of will the

70
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,540
attacks change radically will

71
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,540
adversaries start using chat GP to to

72
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,680
actually

73
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,680
uh send attacks how does it how should

74
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,819
we prepare

75
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:43,799
and for us we kind of thought okay

76
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,040
there's fear and doubt uh in this kind

77
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,900
of flood within our customers and our

78
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,000
users so let's test it out let's do our

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,060
experiment let's see how the AI fares

80
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,060
against the human in task of uh creating

81
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,080
phishing attacks

82
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,400
so very briefly how does a large

83
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,140
language model work

84
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,480
so I'm sure you all read the amazing

85
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,220
hacker Creed that is actually mentioned

86
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,959
on this obey website

87
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,799
uh you have a sentence in here you can

88
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,940
create art and Beauty Ona and then blank

89
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,279
so of course all of you can actually

90
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,199
think some kind of a continuation there

91
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,840
and a kind of hint uh in the hacker Grid

92
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,280
it's a computer

93
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,400
and basically the large language models

94
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,380
which are from a mathematical Point very

95
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,900
simple what they are able to do is is

96
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,840
take this kind of set of tokens a list

97
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,080
of tokens words and predict what could

98
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,740
come next and they can give you kind of

99
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,580
uh

100
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,220
one prediction but actually multiple and

101
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,800
probabilities what is the likelihood of

102
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,240
a certain word

103
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,360
so this is for example

104
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,660
output for this sentence using GPT 2.5

105
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,520
which isn't the latest and the greatest

106
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,800
but still a quite formidable model so

107
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,740
you can see the most probable word is uh

108
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,600
you can create art and Beauty on a

109
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,919
computer

110
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,560
on a whim daily

111
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,199
on a budget and of course on a canvas

112
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,180
and if you plot the 100 most probable

113
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,720
words you get something like this

114
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,120
it's in a logarithmic format so actually

115
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,880
the probabilities drop uh quite

116
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,100
significantly quite fast

117
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,280
and the thing here is that

118
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,320
all of you have seen some examples of

119
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,740
how abstract questions Chachi BT can

120
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,600
answer how abstract thinks it can

121
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,740
perform

122
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,919
and at least I was amazed and you kind

123
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,840
of think that we have this notion that

124
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,560
human language and human nature is

125
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,560
unpredictable and complex but if you

126
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,600
really start to think about it like

127
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,960
do you use the same words do you use the

128
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,419
same sentence says do you kind of like

129
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:02,460
if you have a sentence do you use the

130
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,139
same sentence next

131
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,500
at least I do so you kind of like can

132
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,020
imagine that if you have the capability

133
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,780
meaning the money meaning kind of the

134
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,060
compute power I mean the energy to

135
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,520
scrape the entire text what is available

136
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,020
publicly

137
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,759
on the internet

138
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,120
and actually use that to train this kind

139
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,259
of model

140
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,900
you're able to create something that is

141
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,300
kind of very effective on mimicking

142
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,720
humans

143
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,380
so

144
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,139
then you take this model and you run it

145
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,120
over and over again

146
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,060
and you're kind of like ask it what is

147
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,860
the next word based on the previous

148
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,979
input and here lies of course lot of the

149
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,979
kind of fine-tuning you need to do so of

150
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:51,539
course you could always select the most

151
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:53,759
probable next word but that would be

152
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,979
really boring it would be basically kind

153
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,500
of always output the same text so here

154
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,560
you need to like insert Randomness and

155
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,139
uh do kind of certain selections so here

156
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:06,780
just a single Run for the model it

157
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,639
decided to kind of come up with you can

158
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,800
create art and Beauty on a computer and

159
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,479
build your own

160
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,099
so what that is we don't know

161
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,919
of course you can use this for other

162
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,479
things as well

163
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:25,560
human natural language and of course

164
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,259
programming languages which are

165
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,740
in a way just the extension of uh kind

166
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,259
of like a way for us to code our intent

167
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,560
into something that we can kind of give

168
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,440
to a computer turn it into silicon

169
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,199
so here are a couple examples uh on the

170
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,080
left left side your kind of standard uh

171
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,400
uh uh kind of fast repeat from C uh and

172
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,319
like the continuation what the model

173
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,560
thinks and on the right side uh kind of

174
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,539
example of a composing SQL sentence and

175
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:01,680
uh

176
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,199
of course this will open up super

177
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,139
interesting opportunities and also kind

178
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,259
of challenges so especially on the right

179
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,479
example I don't think they're kind of

180
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,699
like there might be something wrong with

181
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:17,460
that and uh I'm sure when you like

182
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,160
scrape the internet for all the uh code

183
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,160
there is feed that into a model you will

184
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,860
actually kind of get something that uh

185
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,440
kind of might have interesting problems

186
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,080
let's say that and uh kind of challenges

187
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,640
for us as a community to solve

188
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:39,599
so that was how the model works so it's

189
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,779
a tool to kind of like uh we think it's

190
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,940
uh kind of uh at least I thought it was

191
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,640
like kind of impossible to do this task

192
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,380
but when you think about at the scale

193
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,779
and at the magnitude level uh

194
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:55,440
unfortunately humans are quite

195
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,200
predictable and that's the interesting

196
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
development here to me at least so

197
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,720
the experiment we wanted to pit our

198
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,899
amazing uh kind of red team against the

199
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,260
AI and see how

200
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,560
team who has built thousands of fishing

201
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,240
attacks executed millions of simulations

202
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,339
they know how to build hard fishing

203
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:21,660
attacks they know how to build easy

204
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,360
fishing attacks how that will perform

205
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,620
against Chachi PT uh in a task of

206
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,140
getting people to click links which they

207
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,880
shouldn't

208
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,160
and this is the kind of the experiment

209
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,959
we did

210
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,680
and this is the setup so first we took

211
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,839
kind of like we took our this amazing

212
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:44,459
team

213
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,820
and we put them into a dark room and

214
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,680
close the door and it's actually the

215
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,260
same room day every day work uh strange

216
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,360
bunch of people we have bigger and

217
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,040
better rooms but they decide to work in

218
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,600
that room for some reason

219
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,360
and we asked them that hey

220
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,180
could you create first a prompt an idea

221
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,279
of attack phishing attack you think

222
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,860
would be relatively hard

223
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,500
and then create an attack of it

224
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,500
and then we took the same prompt and we

225
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,740
fed this into an AI and asked the AI to

226
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,959
create attack as well

227
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,320
and then we took these two attacks put

228
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,800
that into our engine and basically then

229
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,180
it started fishing our end users and we

230
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,220
could start getting data out of like

231
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,459
okay how well does the human team with

232
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,380
experience several years of experience

233
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,640
perform against the AI

234
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,079
and the kind of question like what is a

235
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,200
hard fishing attack there's a lot of

236
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,940
nuance in that

237
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,720
uh how I would like the kind of simplest

238
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,720
way describe it is that a good fishing

239
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,140
attack which converts people is like a

240
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,860
good lie more truth there is more

241
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,600
probable you're the kind of believe the

242
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,360
one hook in that kind of lie

243
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,680
so more contextual more relevant it is

244
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,019
to you at this time more likely you're

245
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,019
gonna believe it more emotions it works

246
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:22,500
in you more scared you get more likely

247
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,839
you're gonna just do something and kind

248
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,720
of don't think about it

249
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,660
so so that's one thing but of course you

250
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,720
see quite a lot of very naive attacks as

251
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,320
well in your Gmail or in your work email

252
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,540
but there the attackers the adversaries

253
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,660
they are not stupid far from it actually

254
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,480
for them this is a business and a

255
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,300
business always presents a funnel where

256
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,279
you take something in and you convert

257
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,279
those two steps so the attackers knows

258
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,500
that if a person falls for a knife

259
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,440
attack they're most likely convert The

260
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,380
Next Step so for them it's actually

261
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,480
optimization technique because they need

262
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,120
to use resources if it's a money scam

263
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,040
Etc so it's better to get the more

264
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,519
gullible people in so what is hard what

265
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,079
is good phishing attack really depends

266
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:16,459
what you're trying to achieve

267
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,820
so here's an example one of the attacks

268
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,940
one of the prompts so the prompt is

269
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,160
create an email to contact a person

270
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,579
working at Acme Incorporated explaining

271
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:31,320
that they might have accidentally

272
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,779
scratched my car at parking a lot

273
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:35,760
and so on

274
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,260
so here's an example what are human uh

275
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,139
Team created it's an email from Jack

276
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:46,620
Falk to me uh kind of contacting me that

277
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,839
I have actually kind of scratched

278
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:50,399
potentially someone's cars at the

279
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,660
parking lot

280
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,300
uh and uh kind of you can say check the

281
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,720
pictures here if it's my car

282
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,660
and here's the AI version of it pretty

283
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,980
similar

284
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,519
some changes there you can already spot

285
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,279
changes in the language it's using but

286
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,279
still uh kind of like it goes to the

287
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,459
point

288
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,079
so

289
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,240
in total we did four simulation pairs

290
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,519
four by humans and then four

291
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,339
corresponding by AI

292
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:26,339
over in English very simple text-based

293
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,200
attacks we didn't want to at this stage

294
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,260
test visual effects Etc kind of keep it

295
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,680
simple and uh kind of see see how all

296
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,680
these very very simple attacks works and

297
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,120
make it data a little bit more

298
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,160
comparable

299
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,519
in total in this experience we sent

300
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,579
quite a small amount over 53 000

301
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:50,399
simulations

302
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,160
uh the Excellence is still ongoing our

303
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,899
users are still receiving some of these

304
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:57,180
uh but at the time when I did the data

305
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,399
extract this was the amount

306
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,040
and we had users uh from over 100

307
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,000
countries so uh quite a good uh kind of

308
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,639
uh set of people and I'll share some

309
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,079
control results at the end as well

310
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,040
so

311
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,700
then result uh I'm not sure if I can get

312
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,300
some drum roll here but uh

313
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,160
first let's look at the AI

314
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,720
so the AI in average over uh all of

315
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,700
those simulations achieved a failure

316
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,480
rate of 2.9 percent so out of the

317
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,060
Thousand emails or two thousand users we

318
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,760
sent the attack uh close to three

319
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,220
percent click the link convert it to

320
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,199
next phase

321
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,820
and uh we had a reporting rate of 86.5

322
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,980
and uh for me working in kind of the

323
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,480
business of behavior which is this is

324
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,399
much more important than the failure

325
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,279
rate failure is about failure reporting

326
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,220
is about defense so more people actually

327
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,680
report those who spot the attack report

328
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,720
the attack they can actually protect the

329
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,120
other ones who failed the three percent

330
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,120
who failed so these are pretty good

331
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,440
numbers

332
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,800
and then if you look at our humans uh

333
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,959
our very experienced the the results

334
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:19,560
were this so 4.2 percent failure rate

335
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,519
and Reporting rate of 85.1 percent so

336
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,000
our experienced team who has done this

337
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,120
for several years was actually better at

338
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,420
these stage uh on creating attacks than

339
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,820
the AI so there was a clear difference

340
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,459
of course the reporting rate was also a

341
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,680
little bit smaller because of course you

342
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,060
have more people falling for the attack

343
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,459
more people actually not detecting that

344
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:47,760
hey this isn't a real your car hasn't

345
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,920
been scratched actually this is this

346
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,480
isn't a real email this is actually

347
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,740
actually a phishing attack

348
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,680
second interesting thing that we looked

349
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,199
at is that how does user experience

350
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,560
affect this so we have a lot of users in

351
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,240
our platform with varying backgrounds

352
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,279
from security to

353
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:13,440
to kind of uh HR legal sales Etc and we

354
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,440
have users who have been exposed to less

355
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,480
phishing attacks and we have users who

356
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,060
have been exposed to more attacks they

357
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,760
have more experience they have seen

358
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,920
sophisticated spearfishing attacks uh

359
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,199
credential Harvesters they have seen it

360
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,720
all so if you look at the failure rate

361
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,980
of the kind of uh how it goes down uh

362
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,199
the more the experience uh the user is

363
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,180
it's pretty similar for both of these so

364
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,399
we start in a very high number of like

365
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,680
15 so like if you have a really

366
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,860
inexperienced users 15 of them convert

367
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,540
actually and

368
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,940
it goes down the interesting bit

369
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,860
actually here is that when you go to the

370
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,940
more experienced users the the AI and

371
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,519
the humans start to converge together

372
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,699
and uh I don't know but one hypothesis

373
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:04,140
we have is that

374
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,079
those users who are experienced and fall

375
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,640
for these attacks

376
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,160
it it kind of really hits them maybe

377
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,679
they just drove to the parking lot and

378
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,419
maybe they hit someone there so it's

379
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:16,859
like really kind of like you know

380
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,599
someone would send you an email about

381
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,020
like you bumped into me or like

382
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,699
of course I did it and you don't read it

383
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:27,540
and you just click it so so then

384
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,940
it doesn't really matter too much the

385
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,860
email content it's more about the

386
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,840
context if it's if there's a person like

387
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,660
who just drove to the parking lot Etc so

388
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,400
it works much more effectively

389
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,580
a little bit about the countries so we

390
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,600
had 100 countries I picked several here

391
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,880
so uh

392
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,960
sorted by the biggest failure rate uh

393
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,600
uh by kind of the human attacks so

394
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,860
Sweden

395
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,419
had the uh kind of highest failure rate

396
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:07,020
6.1 percent Finland 2.6 percent yay and

397
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,840
we won that match uh and Then followed

398
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,440
by United States UK Norway Finland and

399
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,720
Germany had the smallest and the Finland

400
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,400
actually had that we had the smallest

401
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,160
one with the AI based attacks

402
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,080
and uh of course there's a couple of

403
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,700
things you need to know the attacks were

404
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,660
in English so I would assume uh kind of

405
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,660
like in of course in us and UK that's

406
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,600
much more relevant to them but uh in

407
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,580
Sweden as well they're most likely gonna

408
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,620
use English as a kind of language which

409
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,780
they operate at work versus Norway

410
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,360
Finland and Germany so I I think that

411
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,820
kind of tells the difference between

412
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,820
these uh two cohorts of countries

413
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,080
and uh interestingly kind of the Germany

414
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,700
also had the smallest difference between

415
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,380
these two so they were quite close

416
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,679
together

417
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,700
so that was the

418
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,299
experiment we did and uh this we are

419
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:09,059
really happy that we kind of did this

420
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:12,299
that uh we kind of understand okay what

421
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,820
these can do and let's talk about it

422
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,740
what this could mean

423
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,799
So based on this we can totally say that

424
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:21,660
large language models can be used to

425
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,960
tool to craft phishing attacks that's uh

426
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,440
kind of uh obvious here so you get not

427
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,620
as big failure rates not as effective

428
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,559
attacks but you do get attacks that

429
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,980
convert uh humans and get them to click

430
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,559
links and that's something that wasn't

431
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,200
possible maybe eight months ago and

432
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,539
that's uh kind of really interesting

433
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,640
I said currently an experienced human

434
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,799
red team can create more effective

435
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,380
attacks that's that's for sure

436
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,600
as of now

437
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,120
some of anecdotal analysis on the

438
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,220
differences of the attacks when we

439
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,100
looked at them kind of side by side is

440
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,179
that

441
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:09,059
we know that that chat GP tended to

442
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:11,400
create two formal texts it wasn't a text

443
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,200
that could come from your colleague or

444
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,360
from the I.T Department it was maybe

445
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,360
like two kind of uh too long it wasn't

446
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,640
to the point

447
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,700
other thing was that our humans as they

448
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,160
know this business they were much more

449
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,620
aggressive they were Des the language

450
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,840
was desperate when there was a call for

451
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,600
desperation and it was accusatory so

452
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,419
you're kind of like our red team went

453
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:39,360
pretty much all in invoking motions and

454
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,740
reactions in the users with this and

455
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,919
kind of the AIS if someone has followed

456
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:48,539
like the kind of the aggressive language

457
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,000
being is kind of producing Etc there is

458
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,380
probably like a tendency for the

459
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,360
developers to actually tone down the

460
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,200
language

461
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,700
but I think these two things are

462
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,860
something with proper prompt engineering

463
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,559
you can easily overcome and get the AI

464
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,799
to be in the language model to be

465
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,820
aggressive enough

466
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,020
and

467
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,820
and of course it might be that some of

468
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,500
these models will be eventually open

469
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,960
source so you can train them you can use

470
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,940
that models yourself and train them to a

471
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,600
specific task

472
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,179
one other very interesting error which

473
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,340
we are definitely looking is kind of how

474
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,440
can you use this to create much more

475
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,240
contextual attack so you feed some

476
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,080
information about the Target and uh

477
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,580
potentially use these to create better

478
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,620
translation especially in the countries

479
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,280
uh where kind of like the English isn't

480
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,840
the kind of first language you speak we

481
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,700
all have seen maybe at least in Finland

482
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,860
kind of poorly translated attacks you

483
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,720
can easily spot either from the language

484
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,059
translation or the context that you

485
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:49,679
don't have the kind of nuances there

486
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,679
that this is not a real uh text message

487
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,760
from a police Etc or a bank so these

488
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,220
tools can potentially give you a way to

489
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,100
turn very broken English into a very

490
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,580
good let's say polish or Finnish and get

491
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,960
a much more effective attack

492
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:11,820
second question is the cost of course

493
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,919
like training these models at the moment

494
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,039
is only possible for the companies who

495
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,659
have the money and the resource to

496
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:21,240
scrape the entire internet uh but I

497
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,120
believe that will change uh right now

498
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,580
open AI has forced the hands of Google

499
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,880
it has forced the hands of beta to react

500
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,500
they need to come up with kind of

501
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,059
counters to this

502
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:36,120
One Way Google actually back in the day

503
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,480
countered AWS was to open source

504
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,880
kubernetes so we might really actually

505
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,080
see

506
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:46,080
in future if these models aren't too

507
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,360
dangerous or deemed too dangerous that

508
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,059
one play is to open source it all to

509
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:52,260
kind of make sure that the kind of

510
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,820
competition so this might become

511
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,179
available as to anyone and then you can

512
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:58,500
find them this

513
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,500
and whereas previously you would send

514
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,799
same attack to 1000 users the adversary

515
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,620
and hold three percent convert with this

516
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,260
tool you can actually create attack to

517
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,820
everyone

518
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,059
so that's kind of really interesting and

519
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:16,500
that changes the landscape a little bit

520
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,820
what we have seen so far

521
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:25,020
but on the other hand I feel that the

522
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,659
the current controls and calendar

523
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:29,159
measures this is the kind of good part

524
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:31,620
so so fear not in my mind at the moment

525
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,780
so the current controls and counter

526
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,080
measures which we have are designed to

527
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,500
actually kind of work in a human to

528
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,539
human communication detect attacks

529
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:45,179
detect attacks that a human creates and

530
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:46,799
what does these models are trying to do

531
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,480
they're trying to behave kind of mimic

532
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,760
human behavior so

533
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,039
the technical layer the filtering

534
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,200
Solutions we have in place and the

535
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,940
behavior change programs we have in

536
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,799
place they actually work against this

537
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,860
stuff we of course need to kind of look

538
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,220
at them train them make them better

539
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,159
but they actually kind of like in my

540
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,980
mind you can add up to them so it isn't

541
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,919
like a kind of fundamental shift that

542
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,659
any everyone should be panicking about

543
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:19,020
this so uh just kind of doing basically

544
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,480
the things that you have done if you

545
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,780
have proper controls and defenses will

546
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,000
help you against this kind of way if

547
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,159
it's to happen

548
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:31,380
and uh

549
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,600
like more experimenting is definitely

550
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,179
needed we're gonna uh definitely do a

551
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:38,480
lot of experiments using AI we're gonna

552
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,220
uh I'm already using it daily in my job

553
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,860
we're gonna make sure our red team uh

554
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,600
kind of has full access to all of these

555
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,820
models they will use use it to kind of

556
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,520
see how better we can actually what kind

557
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,960
of failure rate we can get with the

558
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,480
human machine combination uh what kind

559
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,100
of reporting rate how can we make our

560
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,200
users more better at detecting this

561
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,120
stuff so we're gonna continue

562
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,919
experimenting if you see me on the floor

563
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,299
at some point happy to discuss

564
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:05,340
investment ideas how to use this I'm

565
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,620
kind of super super excited to hear and

566
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,159
discuss about it and uh

567
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,080
I'm kind of

568
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,360
um super excited to see maybe in one

569
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,059
year what are other areas that these

570
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:19,980
kind of models how they change the cyber

571
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,380
security both for us as Defenders both

572
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,020
for the adversary and uh kind of seeing

573
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,000
the talks maybe at the next year this

574
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,980
will pay and I believe there will be

575
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,900
quite many regarding this and there are

576
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,880
so many interesting topics from ethics

577
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,679
to how do you reverse engineer these

578
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:38,659
models to do your bidding Etc

579
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:41,039
that was my talk

580
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:41,760
um

581
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,760
I am we have couple minutes left so if

582
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,279
there are some burning questions I'm

583
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,850
happy to take them

584
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,720
[Music]

585
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,400
so I guess we have a mic so if there's a

586
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,380
question so put your hand up

587
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,820
there's a question

588
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,539
hello uh have you considered running

589
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:12,720
this experiment Again by asking the open

590
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,760
AI to reformat the letter into a more

591
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,179
casual or more more friendly format so

592
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,100
that would make the user more

593
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,720
comfortable in reading it and

594
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,600
understanding the subject which was more

595
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,299
more seen in the red team generated

596
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:34,260
messages yeah so to keep the test simple

597
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,179
we we didn't do much of prompt

598
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,919
engineering we used the kind of like the

599
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,539
prompt that the human righted and

600
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:41,100
basically the output of the model pretty

601
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,820
much as it so I'm totally agree just a

602
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,500
little bit of like you know

603
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,380
uh asking it to hey don't be so formal

604
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,480
maybe keep it a little bit shorter be

605
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,860
more aggressive you could get better

606
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,299
results uh fully agree

607
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:01,140
thanks for the talk uh how would you

608
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,360
describe the cost between these two

609
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,900
approaches uh can you say louder course

610
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,039
cost

611
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:10,860
how much did it cost cost ah yeah that's

612
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,340
good question well uh uh kind of like we

613
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,779
will have the salary discussions with

614
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:17,340
the team later today after a few beers

615
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,120
but uh of course if you have humans that

616
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,120
uh you know take quite a long time to

617
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,880
develop to a red team uh from like from

618
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,880
bird to being uh like well

619
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,159
I would say we have adult people working

620
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,279
on this so uh so it's it's uh of course

621
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,559
the course for us with the AI we could

622
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:40,740
create this in a 15 minutes with our

623
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,960
human team they have

624
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,480
several years of experience on this so

625
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,260
uh I would say uh kind of far for us at

626
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,820
the moment to cause difference is

627
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,100
radical of course if you would account

628
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,960
the kind of how much would it cost to

629
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,480
create this model then then uh there's a

630
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,140
kind of uh uh tip for the human side but

631
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,260
uh I think this will become something

632
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,720
that anyone can use and it will not cost

633
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,340
it will be zero cost almost

634
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:19,740
all right uh thank you and uh uh once

635
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,120
again if you have good ideas just

636
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,460
comment uh take me from the sleeve happy

637
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,900
to discuss anything regarding social

638
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,600
engineering Ai and have a great uh rest

639
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,379
of this obey
