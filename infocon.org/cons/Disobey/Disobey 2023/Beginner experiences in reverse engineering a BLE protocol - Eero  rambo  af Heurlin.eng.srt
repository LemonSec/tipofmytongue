1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,620
okay welcome everyone and good morning

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,420
it's a bit late too late to do the last

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,660
last Talk of the day but yeah uh this is

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,820
about my experience in reverse

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,980
engineering in the end rather simple

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,560
Bluetooth low energy protocol

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,279
and I am a total beginner at this

8
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,800
but yeah I have been doing Electronics

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,779
since I was a kid

10
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,539
taking things apart sometimes managing

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,119
to put them back together as well

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,980
sometimes they even worked after that

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,960
and yeah maker nerd also motorcyclist

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,200
which will become important soon enough

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,360
and hackerspace is Helsinki hack lab

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,940
hack laptop therefore you have seen me

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,460
at the Heckler if I stand doing things

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,719
playing music Etc

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,160
I work at a

20
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,680
consulting company doing machine recent

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,239
computer vision stuff

22
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,420
so if anyone has a need for that time

23
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,480
things at their workplace remember that

24
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,519
and remember me

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,520
I also do volunteer work for the Finnish

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,760
difference forces in this project called

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,820
uh doker terraform

28
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,979
and back in back-end web services

29
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,159
development stuff and if you are a full

30
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,000
stack developer or Azure specialist

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,460
especially CI CD for GitHub

32
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,140
contact me

33
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,240
we need more good people

34
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,100
and yeah there's a bunch of links maybe

35
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,840
the slides will come

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,200
available somewhere

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,140
so the basic idea is that uh

38
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,439
it's a company that makes this very nice

39
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:44,820
electroluminescent decorations for

40
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,320
helmets

41
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,259
and then they finally figured out how to

42
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,700
make a decent uh RGB declaration as well

43
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,979
so of course I had to get one actually I

44
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,600
had to get two of them

45
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,960
from their original Kickstarter thingy

46
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,240
and they control them by phone

47
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,860
application the problem is the phone

48
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,899
application isn't all that great

49
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,780
and also I have a dream of making a

50
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,879
handheld controller for them

51
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,180
so something small that fits fits in

52
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,340
your in your palm basically

53
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,319
or or you can mount mount on The

54
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,720
Handlebar of the bike though

55
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,879
you wouldn't be using this when actually

56
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,400
writing in in traffic but I mean there

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,239
are

58
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,099
hacker camps for example where at

59
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:34,620
may contain hackers uh my bike was there

60
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,739
at the actual Village and it has some

61
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:40,860
extra RGB Lids on the bike as well

62
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,959
that are properly interlocked so that

63
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,840
they cannot get power if the motorcycle

64
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,080
is in actual riding condition

65
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,519
and

66
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,459
yeah I tried to ask for documentation on

67
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,940
the protocol and they denied

68
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,680
no we are not going to publish the

69
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,700
protocol so challenge accepted

70
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,879
uh I knew that Mirage existed

71
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,140
and I had dabbled with it once before

72
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,940
a little bit

73
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,700
and then I needed to get some Hardware

74
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,200
to

75
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,800
use Mirage to get actual captures

76
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,400
and then I needed to start analyzing the

77
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,540
captures

78
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,060
and once I had the captures analyzed I

79
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,200
could start

80
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,540
replaying commands modifying the

81
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,680
commands

82
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,680
doing the usual

83
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,080
usual thing that change something and

84
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,900
observe the observe what changes

85
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,000
and as Adam service this the only

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,500
difference between screwing around and

87
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,659
science is writing it down so make notes

88
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,819
so Mirage uh

89
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:53,700
originally when I played with it uh I

90
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,760
was using BBC micro bit boards

91
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,299
but I have only one and the problem is

92
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:01,260
that

93
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,440
at that time only the very first version

94
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,440
of the micro bit work would work because

95
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,480
it has a radio chip that has a very

96
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,659
specific Hardware bug and Mirage abuses

97
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,420
that Hardware bug to be able to do

98
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,099
horrible things to Bluetooth low energy

99
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,899
and the newer version boards do not work

100
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:25,259
for this which sucked but I have heard

101
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:27,419
rumors that the newer versions boards

102
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,000
have since been

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,479
made to work

104
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,340
and so I did a bunch of research trying

105
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,460
to find which actual

106
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,160
load of low energy boards development

107
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,100
boards Etc have the correct radio chip

108
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,820
and a mirage website also helps with

109
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,840
this a lot

110
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,500
so they say that this ble-400 module or

111
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,660
development kit from

112
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,340
from wave share Works uh and the bla400

113
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,520
is used with this it actually the

114
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,660
development kit comes with this core

115
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,080
51822 model and you only need the 51822

116
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,259
model here for this thing

117
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,320
and you need three of them uh for for

118
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,120
reasons

119
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,340
so I made this

120
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,060
made this fancy fancy Contraption or the

121
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,460
3D printed case for for three three of

122
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,259
the wave share boards with

123
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:32,940
soldered ftdi yards you need RTS and CTS

124
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,419
so you need to need a good working uart

125
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,340
for this

126
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,900
um

127
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,020
in the end this revision of the encloser

128
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,060
has a critical bug it doesn't have any

129
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,400
strain relief for the actual USB cables

130
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,620
and I managed to rip out half of the USB

131
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,960
connector so I can't demo this thing

132
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,320
actually working live the capture stuff

133
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,340
so yeah

134
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,600
and the basic process with mirrors you

135
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,340
start the Mirage then you configure it

136
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,940
tell it that you you have BBC micro bit

137
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,520
type type devices at these USB ports

138
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,759
and then you start the capture and then

139
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,780
here

140
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,520
then you turn on the application you

141
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,100
turn on the device and you hope that you

142
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,340
catch the initial negotiation so that

143
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,419
Mirage can track the session key

144
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:33,300
and it works most of the time

145
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,380
and yeah then what I did is that I

146
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,199
captured a video of me working on the

147
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,960
phone application and also having the

148
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,840
screen mirror screen visible

149
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,360
visible so that I can get a Time

150
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,699
synchronization between the captured

151
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:51,840
packets

152
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,060
and what I was actually doing at that

153
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,080
time

154
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,639
so

155
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,100
and yeah there's a link to the video if

156
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,440
someone wants to look at it later I'm

157
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,419
not showing it no

158
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,479
and then we have a lots of P caps

159
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,780
loads and lots of P caps and

160
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,680
this screenshot is after I had spent a

161
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,919
lot of time reading Gatt documentation

162
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:18,660
and so on the

163
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,539
the capture start starts in a much much

164
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:24,419
worse place and you just have basically

165
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,759
binary garbage

166
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,580
and tons and tons of binary garbage and

167
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,139
then you start

168
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,360
reading the protocol documentation for

169
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,840
ble gitt and then you

170
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,020
try to get to get an idea that what what

171
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,940
are the package that you actually should

172
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,979
be looking at because there's a torn off

173
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:48,080
package or packets that are not actually

174
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,699
in any way really I want

175
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,460
to what you want to see

176
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,960
and

177
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,539
and after we have figured that out

178
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:00,840
then we could find the correct correct

179
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,840
packages that contain the actual

180
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,479
payloads that we are interested in and

181
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,639
it turns out it's an actual very simple

182
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,000
ASCII serial Port protocol could be done

183
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,580
with just standard Bluetooth serial Port

184
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,800
profile but of course low energy is low

185
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,180
energy

186
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,060
so that's it

187
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,500
so I made a python script to talk talk

188
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,440
with the device using bleak which is a

189
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,379
multi-platform ble

190
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:35,520
Ed and also server bla doesn't really

191
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,500
have clients and servers in that sense

192
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,799
and I was talking using Bleak to talk to

193
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,959
it and making experiments like if I

194
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,680
start sending

195
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:51,360
first of course start just sending

196
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,000
values that you have seen before

197
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,640
and then start modifying the values

198
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,860
and see what happens

199
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,920
and keep doing that on

200
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,920
and that way that way you get

201
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,140
so in the end we start okay these are

202
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,300
the pattern commands we have seen and

203
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,680
these are like

204
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,500
now I have enumerated that patterns go

205
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,760
from

206
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,880
1 to 999 and so on

207
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,980
and most of the patterns pattern numbers

208
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,959
do nothing

209
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:25,140
but yeah and also like what are the

210
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,600
actual valid values for the HSV color

211
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,800
colors and so on

212
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,500
and then

213
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,380
I made an actual command line tool to do

214
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,140
like a proper command line tool that

215
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,980
runs both a service

216
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,580
that continuously calls ble for new

217
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,779
devices

218
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:50,940
and connects to them and then keeps

219
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,620
alive the connection because the device

220
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,540
also has this

221
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,480
maybe maybe good idea maybe but maybe a

222
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,760
bad idea but at least it's annoying for

223
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,580
in my point of view is that once you

224
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,160
disconnect from the device it will

225
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,019
completely shut down the ble you can't

226
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:09,180
connect to it again without rebooting

227
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,760
the device and putting it to the ble

228
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,680
connection mode

229
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,120
so

230
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,080
and also

231
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,600
make make it by Sonic make like you have

232
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,019
method that takes actual HSB from like

233
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,680
360 and 100 100 and 100.

234
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,140
instead of the weird values that they

235
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,839
actually map to in in the protocol

236
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,120
and yeah

237
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,459
and then there's a

238
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:41,399
command line tool that is used to tell

239
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,820
the service to send commands to the

240
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,160
Bluetooth low energy layer

241
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,740
and yeah

242
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,720
so let's see if we can make a demo

243
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,320
all right

244
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,140
can you see anything

245
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,519
I think

246
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,560
no

247
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,399
okay classic demo effect

248
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,000
doesn't want to

249
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,760
okay now we have blue light and we have

250
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,399
a station

251
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,300
and

252
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,839
that's not it

253
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:03,620
it's not either

254
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,940
this looks

255
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,060
looks like the window

256
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,599
okay

257
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,480
make it

258
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,839
so

259
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,980
basically I can say that okay I want

260
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,620
pattern two and it will change the

261
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,800
pattern and if I get my

262
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,079
fine

263
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,079
demo camera working

264
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,979
yes yes yes yes yes

265
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,560
no

266
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,180
don't

267
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,680
open capture device

268
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:08,060
uh

269
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,880
okay

270
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,480
better demo effect okay anyway uh

271
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,139
I wonder if you can see anything but

272
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:31,500
basic idea is that let's make it maybe

273
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,100
brighter

274
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:56,160
thank you so okay it should be brighter

275
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,120
now good

276
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,260
and then we can do different patterns

277
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,399
and yeah

278
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,200
so yeah and we could change the colors

279
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,820
as well but then I would have to

280
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,519
remember HSV values for some cool colors

281
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,380
but yeah this

282
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,980
rainbow Sunset pattern is pretty cool

283
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,420
so yeah it works next I just need to fix

284
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:29,660
it with esp32 there is a question there

285
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,220
uh well I mean you can go to light

286
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,500
mode.com for their fancy fancy demo

287
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,120
videos I haven't yet put this on my

288
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,300
helmet because I still have the uh

289
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,260
uh El wire so the

290
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,800
so so

291
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,680
this is my helmet with the El wire

292
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,560
so something something a bit similar but

293
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,399
with RGB

294
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,720
and

295
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,839
it's documented now

296
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,980
[Applause]

297
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,160
and yeah there's some links there the QR

298
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,980
code should take to the repo with the

299
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,699
with the actual python code

300
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:38,639
uh the nightshift btre is the working

301
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,040
repository for the actual reverse

302
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,320
engineering it has the P caps it has

303
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,820
links to the

304
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,360
videos Etc so if anyone wants to try

305
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,699
their own hand at this all the material

306
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,380
is over there

307
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,000
and

308
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,180
yeah and then there's the 3D model that

309
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,660
I need to make a better one

310
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,680
any more questions

311
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,519
there

312
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,639
oh yes the reason for three three

313
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:18,120
Bluetooth low energy modules uh is that

314
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,760
there are three main channels where the

315
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:24,180
initial negotiation can start

316
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,300
and so so you need three modules to have

317
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,240
the best chance of catching catching the

318
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,459
initial negotiation because you might

319
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,740
miss it this is all doing horrible

320
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,240
things with undocumented Hardware

321
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,779
features on the radio chips

322
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:40,800
so um

323
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,199
so if if you only have one module then

324
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,579
you have like

325
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:47,459
30 percent chance in the first place and

326
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,019
then it might fail because of other

327
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:51,500
reasons

328
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:56,000
any other questions

329
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,120
uh yeah just stream your question

330
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,860
because I can't see you the lights are

331
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,740
so so the question was did they respond

332
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,299
to the last email no they did not

333
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:12,299
respond to the last thing

334
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,299
shame

335
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,799
and yeah

336
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:24,660
that's basically it it's I am an idiot

337
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,079
and you can too to quote Debbie and Olaf

338
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,500
so so don't don't be scared

339
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,960
just just get to get there and the

340
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,700
hardware is cheap like it's I don't

341
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,460
remember it's like 15 dollars for the

342
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,620
for the wave share module and then

343
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,539
whatever

344
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:45,600
whatever you use for the uart well

345
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,820
that's that's your budget the ftdi chips

346
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,260
are a bit more expensive than some

347
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,940
others but at least I know that they

348
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,320
will work

349
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,820
yes

350
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,929
[Music]

351
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,440
have you used or do you have

352
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,260
tried you know Uber to one how does it

353
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,500
compare you know so the question

354
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,860
so the question was uh have I used Uber

355
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,860
toot one uh or compared to that I know I

356
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,900
haven't used Uber tooth when I don't

357
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,539
have one and it's expensive these are

358
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:20,840
cheap

359
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,500
so yeah that's that's one of the one of

360
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,780
the reasons why it was very easy to get

361
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,120
started with it it's like it's like 50

362
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,660
euros of investment for the hardware and

363
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,340
and time

364
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,679
and hobbyist time is of course free as

365
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,039
We Know

366
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,460
okay are we done

367
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,039
uh yeah if someone wants to look at

368
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:53,960
Network captures I can show you some

369
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,210
