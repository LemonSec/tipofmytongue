1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,659
uh-huh apparently it's 4 30 so we'll

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:04,560
start

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,540
welcome everybody and first of all thank

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,039
you very much for being here instead of

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,320
having dinner at this time

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,200
and my name is Walter Belhurst or in

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,199
Finland it will be uh valtteri I suppose

8
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,180
and this talk will be about successes

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,939
and failures uh when I did a bit of

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,980
research on a particular type of a lock

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,960
so I will be telling you the stories

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,060
about what I tried to find out with the

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,460
lock and I think it's important to also

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,040
tell what fails because on the internet

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,380
you read a lot of stuff about things

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,840
that were an instant success but of

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,180
course in reality research also means

18
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,460
failing sometimes and sometimes

19
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,040
succeeding

20
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,500
good to be back here in Finland I was

21
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,719
here last time in 2015 that's a

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,300
wonderful T2 conference and at that

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,219
conference I opened and upload a classic

24
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,879
classic on stage but the abloy talk if

25
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,500
you went to the talk by Eden who

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,620
yesterday you saw him creating wonderful

27
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,979
tools to uh to open all the new uh abloy

28
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,780
logs but I will be talking about a

29
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,640
completely different lock

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,700
the miwa or Anker 3800 miwa is a

31
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,159
Japanese firm they invented this lock

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,619
and it's also called anchor there's a

33
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,640
Dutch firm and I'm Dutch they sell the

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,040
same cylinder

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,740
that they licensed for Mira now I had a

36
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,140
few of those in my attic and I thought

37
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,460
well that might be an interesting

38
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,960
project to look at because they have

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,000
magnets inside them and I didn't know

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,439
too much about it and I wanted to know

41
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,020
how does it work and can we defeat this

42
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,700
lock

43
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,380
the fact that I had these locks in my

44
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,939
possession was not completely strange

45
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:45,180
because I am a lock picker I've been

46
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,960
hacking stuff for over 25 years it's

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,640
also my profession

48
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,460
and I've also been president of tool the

49
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,100
open organization of lock Pickers

50
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,680
and I'm actually currently in the

51
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,119
process of writing a book about lock

52
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,640
Sport with a few friends of mine

53
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,758
so to get back to the subject of this

54
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,400
lecture the anchor lock and issue look

55
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,280
inside the lock you will see that here

56
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,400
we have four pins which are what you

57
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,220
will find in many standard lockswell not

58
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,660
so standard in Finland because you have

59
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,459
all these nice disk detainer locks but

60
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:25,800
in other parts of Europe you will find

61
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,140
logs that normally have pins but apart

62
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,580
from the pins there's also some stuff

63
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,599
going on up here at the top on the top

64
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,879
and you can see that also the key is a

65
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,879
bit weird on one side of the key you

66
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,879
have bidding which looks like a regular

67
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,700
key that operates the pins but on the

68
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,379
other side of the key you will find

69
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:49,620
these eight black blobs and those are

70
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,120
magnets

71
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,540
and actually those are four sets of two

72
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,500
magnets

73
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,860
and they can also be fakes so it each

74
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,540
block could be a magnet or could be a

75
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,220
fake

76
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,239
the magnets move Sliders in the lock so

77
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,480
in the the plug this is the plug

78
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,060
that needs to rotate and you see these

79
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,159
sliders two of them move one side and to

80
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,800
move the other side and they are spring

81
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,360
loaded they have a little spring and

82
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,920
they can move back and forth

83
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,260
and they move with the magnets in the

84
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,440
key

85
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,840
the four pins are not very special

86
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,480
here's an example of how that works in a

87
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,659
lock this is a five pin lock

88
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:39,720
and how that works is that the key has a

89
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,780
bidding where the depth of the cuts

90
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,099
match exactly the length of the pins

91
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:49,500
at least the red part of the pins

92
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,580
and if these length match then the pins

93
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,000
will be exactly at the shear line

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,099
freeing up the plug and it can rotate

95
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,599
now that's also what's happening in this

96
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,159
lock that's not very interesting because

97
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,920
this is quite normal so the interesting

98
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,400
part that's the magnetic sliders on the

99
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,040
other side and here I've shown them so

100
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,959
I've taken them out of the plug and put

101
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,700
them on the key so you can see that

102
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,540
actually there is four sliders and each

103
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,358
slider sits on top of two of those blobs

104
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,260
that can be magnets

105
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,000
how does this work so here's my first

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,860
success I did something in Photoshop

107
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,419
it's not really very good but it'll do

108
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:39,960
on the left depicted is a lock where

109
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,960
there is no key inserted and you can see

110
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,380
that the uh the pin here is not at the

111
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,780
shear line and you also see that this

112
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,720
slider is is blocking here in the in the

113
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,800
plug

114
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,320
and this red and green thing that's the

115
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,520
magnets

116
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,740
so let's suppose green is north and

117
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,900
rather South then it's pointing to the

118
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,660
left North to the left and it's it's

119
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,800
blocking

120
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,900
if you insert a correct key then first

121
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,120
of all the

122
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,419
pins are being pushed down to the shear

123
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:13,139
line

124
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,440
and also this slider the yellow slider

125
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,600
is moved out of the way so it doesn't

126
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,860
doesn't block here anymore

127
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,840
and you see that in this case I've drawn

128
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,500
a key where there's only a magnet here

129
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,419
on the on the left side of the key and

130
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,300
not on the right side that's a fake

131
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,460
and you can also see that if you put a

132
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,220
piece of magnetic paper onto the key you

133
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,020
can see if you look closely where the

134
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,720
magnets are and you can also tell a

135
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,699
little bit which way they are pointing

136
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:47,220
and there's two big blobs they are

137
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,580
pointing either North or South up and

138
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,380
the other two they are facing left right

139
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,080
here's the plug with an incorrect key so

140
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,520
this key has the wrong

141
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,940
bidding and the wrong magnets so some

142
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,400
pins will stick out and some sliders

143
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,660
will stick out

144
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,460
that doesn't work

145
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,860
and with the correct key everything

146
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,300
perfectly aligns and it it'll open

147
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,240
so that in a nutshell is how this Lock

148
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,220
Works

149
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,400
now I thought about uh ways to defeat

150
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,620
the security of this locker and when you

151
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,900
say defeating security you have to ask

152
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,539
yourself what is your threat model

153
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,000
um I'm totally not interested in

154
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,800
Breaking the lock in any way that's not

155
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,780
really what lock picking or lock sport

156
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,860
is about

157
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,960
so I'm trying to open the lock without a

158
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,259
key but without damaging it and we can

159
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,479
do lock picking or other techniques

160
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,919
which I will show

161
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,199
but another

162
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,639
risk could be that somebody might be

163
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,919
able to quickly copy your key if they

164
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,240
have it in their possession for a few

165
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,800
seconds

166
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,100
the first thing I looked for was can we

167
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,500
pick this lock with well then we have

168
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,139
the the four regular pins yes they can

169
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,300
be picked they work like a

170
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,240
standard lock and what about the magnets

171
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,419
well you could insert a tool with a

172
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,940
magnet on top so you could just make a

173
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,000
toothpick like thing put a magnet on top

174
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,099
put it in the cylinder and move the

175
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:27,380
magnets sorry the sliders one by one

176
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,360
actually I started my investigation

177
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,340
already in 2000 uh of 19

178
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,220
or now earlier even and I stopped for a

179
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,060
while

180
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,220
and then picked it up in the covert

181
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,780
times because they had time

182
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,479
and at the time I started there were no

183
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,759
videos about people opening the MUA but

184
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,960
meanwhile people have done this so it is

185
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,460
proven that it can be packed picked

186
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,720
so the oldest videos are about two years

187
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,000
old nowadays of people doing this and

188
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,699
sometimes they use audio amplification

189
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,860
to make it easier to pick it so you put

190
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,020
a mic on the cylinder and you can hear

191
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,460
the sliders move about

192
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,800
now I didn't pursue this at first at

193
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,479
first I thought let's see if we can do

194
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,180
key duplication and I took one cylinder

195
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,940
and I opened it up and the problem is if

196
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,099
you open them up you I I at least I

197
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:24,960
cannot really assemble them correctly

198
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,620
but I sacrificed this one to to only

199
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,900
keep magnet magnetic sliders on one side

200
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,820
and the pins on the other side so I can

201
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,039
do my research

202
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,700
and to be able to copy a key we need to

203
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,799
know what magnets are in the key of

204
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,380
course so we need some kind of device to

205
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,480
read out the magnets which is called a

206
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,980
magnetometer so I Googled for a

207
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,680
magnetometer and I find this a really

208
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,019
nice old-school Electronics schematics

209
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,060
and I like Electronics so I thought

210
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,519
let's let's build this

211
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,279
and this is the start the thing that I

212
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,440
built which is actually quite an

213
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,880
interesting tool to take with you

214
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,420
through the airport

215
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:08,700
so what it does is it is well it's very

216
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,620
simple you have a sensor called the

217
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,540
whole sensor you put it over the magnets

218
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,540
and it will indicate whether it is north

219
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,279
or south

220
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,140
and you see I'm moving the magnet the

221
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,839
sensor left and right because some

222
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,300
magnets are facing left right and some

223
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,920
are facing up down

224
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,500
and that I can determine by using this

225
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,420
device

226
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,420
so I have that here

227
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,459
okay so we can read out the magnets we

228
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:37,320
can also see the bidding so now we need

229
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,560
to copy it copy it how do we do this and

230
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,839
here's the problem you cannot get the

231
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,000
blank keys

232
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,980
manufacturers normally get when they

233
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,740
have a new lock they get a patent

234
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,779
the pattern is valid for maybe 20 for 20

235
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,940
years and during that time only the

236
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,760
manufacturer can make the blank keys but

237
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,560
in this case this lock is already from

238
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,779
the 1980s so the patent has expired so

239
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:03,660
anybody could just make blankies but

240
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,399
there is absolutely no market for it

241
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,140
because well if you have the blank key

242
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,820
you also have to have the Machinery to

243
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,279
make the cuts and this is quite quite a

244
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,480
specialized lock

245
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,940
so there's nobody selling these uh blank

246
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,640
keys so they are unobtainium

247
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,860
so my idea was to take an existing key

248
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,200
and just

249
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,240
use this key to take out the existing

250
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,640
magnets and put in different magnets so

251
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,180
I tried to cut away the the middle part

252
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,940
the bidding part so my idea was maybe we

253
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,720
can

254
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,000
pick the pins

255
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,860
and use the the holes to do the magnet

256
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,100
part

257
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,740
now that was a fail because if you

258
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,279
insert the key with just the middle slot

259
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,980
taken out there's not enough room for

260
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,800
the lock pick to enter and yeah pick the

261
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,380
lock because if you insert a tool the

262
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,420
space is so tight that you already push

263
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,339
down the pins too far so that didn't

264
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:03,300
work

265
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,000
but I thought well let's continue anyway

266
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,060
we need to do the magnets as well so can

267
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:13,160
I put new magnets in an existing key

268
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,940
I bought some Two by Two by Two

269
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,980
millimeter magnets

270
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,120
and try to make a setup key so I took an

271
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,820
existing key took out the magnets

272
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,680
and as you can see my metal working

273
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,899
skills are not very good and I don't

274
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:29,579
have the machinery for this

275
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:31,320
so that was actually quite frustrating

276
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,660
this was filled horribly

277
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,480
but I was just determined to

278
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,700
to go on and I said well you know let's

279
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,860
suppose we are able and we will fix this

280
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,079
problem in the future let's suppose I'm

281
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,600
able to put the Magnus in the key then

282
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,180
we still need to copy the bidding

283
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:48,839
um

284
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,079
if we want to make a key copy so how do

285
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,100
we do that

286
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,620
and then I saw thought well what we can

287
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,820
do is do molding

288
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,579
with many keys you can just take the key

289
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:05,579
put it in a in a device so this is a

290
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,519
holding holder device you put in a two

291
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,980
component putty put it in there put the

292
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,260
key in there and you get a mold

293
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,000
and then you can pour molten metal in

294
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,800
there you get a copy

295
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,440
so yes you can copy upload your keys for

296
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,880
instance

297
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,399
and I thought we can use this to copy

298
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:26,579
the bidding so let's suppose we have a

299
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,620
key with the correct magnets

300
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,079
and now we want to copy the bidding so I

301
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:33,600
put the key that I want to bidding off

302
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,260
in this thing in the the make a mold out

303
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,339
of it

304
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:41,220
and combine this with the existing setup

305
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,360
key

306
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,600
so here I have the mold I put in the

307
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,100
setup key

308
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,060
and the mold then has the bedding so I

309
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,560
can pour in the metal

310
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,740
and what comes out is this

311
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,079
and I tried this on the cylinder that

312
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,260
only has the pins on one side and it did

313
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,300
work on that cylinder

314
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,519
so the proof of concept is there

315
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,760
I can make a copy if

316
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:14,339
I can make a magnet setup key

317
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:17,420
so where are we now

318
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,740
making the magnet set of key is really

319
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,600
frustrating

320
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,120
because you yeah really have to have to

321
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,160
have good metal working skills

322
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,740
and also these magnets that I bought are

323
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,720
two by two by two millimeter

324
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,180
and they are almost as thick as the key

325
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,060
that makes it extremely hard to get that

326
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,160
into the setup key

327
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,740
and that was actually when I stopped the

328
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,360
project I thought well for this you

329
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,639
would really need to have a 3D printer I

330
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,040
didn't have access to a 3D printer I

331
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,100
left it but then came covid and I had

332
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,540
time I still had a little bit of money

333
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,560
in the bank

334
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,380
so I bought a 3D printer and I continued

335
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,880
the project

336
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,639
and I chose this one this is a resin

337
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,320
printer you have resin printers there

338
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,120
are filament printers the resin printer

339
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,500
has a better

340
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,240
um

341
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,579
what do you call it it's more precise a

342
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:09,839
bit

343
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,700
right better resolution of what you

344
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,399
print and I thought that was needed for

345
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,380
these keys

346
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,899
so I bought these uh the print there's a

347
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,360
printer and a curing station because the

348
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,019
the resin needs to cure under UV light

349
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,940
so it's a bit of a laborious process to

350
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,500
print for that printer

351
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,019
and I thought well uh well actually I

352
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:33,300
was still I had this train of thought

353
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,820
that I wanted to have that setup key

354
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,160
with just the magnets in there so I

355
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,459
started to uh to do that

356
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:44,760
and for that I unlocked a new skill I

357
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,760
needed to learn a couple of design so I

358
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,459
used open ascat the tool and try to

359
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:53,160
duplicate the way this key looks into my

360
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,699
cat program

361
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,040
and as you can see here I have the slits

362
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,100
in between for picking and this was

363
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,980
well one of the first keys I I actually

364
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,980
got out of the printer

365
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,500
and so that went quite well the the

366
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,560
model was not completely right so I had

367
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,720
to do a little bit of filing to get the

368
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,940
key to work but the magnets fitted in

369
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,680
very well

370
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,040
it did work on the uh

371
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,620
the half that only has the magnetic

372
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,040
Sliders in so again

373
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,500
proof of concept it works

374
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,380
here's a later iteration where I changed

375
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,180
my model a little bit so now it prints

376
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,439
keys that fit straight away

377
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,760
um

378
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,100
in the meantime I I had seen those

379
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,800
videos online of people picking the

380
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,260
uncle lock and from those videos I

381
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,480
learned that the pins are first to bind

382
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,360
which means that if you apply tension it

383
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,860
will be the four pins that block first

384
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,959
and if you get them in the correct

385
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,639
position the lock will turn a little bit

386
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,680
and it's only then that the four sliders

387
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,199
start a block so you can do them in

388
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,540
succession first you do the four pins it

389
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,860
turns a little bit and then you can do

390
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,620
the four sliders and then it opens

391
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,440
so that solves my problem that the the

392
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,139
little slit is doesn't give enough room

393
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,839
to pick the lock because I can pick

394
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:22,019
first without caring about the magnets

395
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:24,600
so I apply tension I I pick the lock

396
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,399
coming from the side so now I have

397
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,980
enough room to get to the pins

398
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,560
and once the four pins are in position

399
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,180
I can insert my uh my my magnet setup

400
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,079
key

401
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,800
push it in

402
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,120
while keeping it under tension and then

403
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,600
it should open

404
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,100
arthritis it worked so lock picking is

405
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,800
possible this way

406
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,860
but actually it was very hard it was

407
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,720
surprisingly hard I thought this this

408
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,320
must be very easy it's only four pins

409
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,320
um I can yeah I can pick this but it was

410
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,520
quite hard the pins do have uh some you

411
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,839
know on the top you can see little

412
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,099
notches

413
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,619
they are on anti-picking notches to make

414
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,119
picking more difficult but still it's

415
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,500
only four pins but

416
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,959
yeah

417
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:17,699
but we do have an attack Factor the

418
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:19,439
attack factor is that if you have

419
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,599
temporary access to the key you can use

420
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,119
the magnetometer to read out magnets

421
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,500
you can

422
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,199
print of a set of key and so it's the

423
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:29,160
magnets

424
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,679
pick the lock put in the magnets and

425
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,040
open it

426
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,500
um but of course by this time I was 3D

427
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,720
printing keys so you can also print of

428
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,400
course the bidding why would I worry

429
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,580
about all the picking stuff

430
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,980
so I changed my model again and included

431
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,600
the bidding of the key

432
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,380
and

433
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,320
in the model you can also type in what

434
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,580
betting you would like to have on the

435
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,080
key and it will automatically generate

436
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,440
the correct depth of the pins

437
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,179
which you will see here Happening Here

438
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,740
so that's a different key

439
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,660
and this is an example that I printed

440
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,360
and that works on both sides so I can

441
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,840
now with my model make copies of keys

442
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,200
so that's that is a real Attack Vector I

443
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,000
can now if I have temporary access to

444
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,900
your key I can now read out the magnets

445
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,360
look at the bidding and make a copy

446
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,539
and the bidding those pins four pins

447
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:36,179
only have four different depths so

448
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:38,280
there's not much in many logs that you

449
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,020
will you will find maybe nine positions

450
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,780
but since it's only four you can

451
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,000
actually see The Code by the naked eye

452
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,340
I've seen so many of these Keys now that

453
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,539
I can just

454
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:51,299
see what bathing this is I don't have to

455
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,340
measure it

456
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,400
so if I have maybe 30 seconds with your

457
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,400
key and I have my magnetometer with me I

458
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,919
can do the the check and I can make a

459
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,220
copy

460
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,240
now the keys that I made with a resin

461
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,200
printer

462
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,600
did work but I found out that the resin

463
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,700
is very brittle so that's a problem

464
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,980
first of all if you would insert it in a

465
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,700
lock

466
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,799
and turn it it could snap

467
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,020
and if I would drop it from here it

468
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,720
would also break in two

469
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,799
even if it is cured well so I needed

470
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,020
to do something about that problem

471
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,020
and I thought about this and I thought

472
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,080
let's go to smaller magnets so I bought

473
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,140
one by one by one millimeter magnets but

474
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,179
that is a total failure because they are

475
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,460
so small you cannot even pick them up

476
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,500
with your tweezers without them turning

477
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,700
all kinds of ways and you don't know

478
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,460
which way is up anymore and it's it's

479
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,740
just horrible

480
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,720
um but then I talked with a with a

481
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,919
colleague about this and he said well

482
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:54,660
you know I have a filament printer I can

483
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,700
try and print a key let's see if that'll

484
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,380
work and I thought it it wouldn't work

485
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,600
because it the the tolerances

486
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,160
but he printed the key and it actually

487
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,299
did work

488
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:06,000
so I I could have bought a standard

489
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,020
printer to do the same things

490
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,140
and also an improvement is that is the

491
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,380
use of disk magnets because they are

492
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,900
they take up less space they are two by

493
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,940
one millimeter but that does mean of

494
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,980
course that some need to go flat and

495
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,179
some need to go on their sides but since

496
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:28,919
we're printing a key anyway that doesn't

497
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,780
really matter we just print the correct

498
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,539
hole for the magnet that goes in that

499
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:34,440
position

500
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,140
and while we're at it we can also leave

501
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,840
out the holes where no magnet is needed

502
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,580
remember there are some of those magnets

503
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,340
are fakes so we just don't put a magnet

504
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,280
in and the key will be more sturdy

505
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,200
so that key actually works

506
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,539
good so we can copy keys let's make it a

507
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:55,980
bit more interesting

508
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,900
I want to

509
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,740
um

510
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,240
explain how the key and the cylinder

511
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,440
match up

512
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,600
because in the end I would like to open

513
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,940
a cylinder if I do not have the key

514
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,179
that's also an interesting attack

515
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,299
so here more of my fantastic Photoshop

516
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:18,179
and here you'll see that the sliders

517
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,760
have magnets in them that correspond to

518
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,400
the magnets in the key so here you see

519
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,840
that the magnet in the key is uh south

520
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,080
facing up and the slider has a North

521
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,640
facing left

522
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,400
and it has to be that way otherwise it

523
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,500
the slider wouldn't work

524
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,860
there's five possibilities North to the

525
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,780
left North to the right North up north

526
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,240
down or no magnet

527
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,120
and there's also five corresponding

528
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,380
possibilities for the magnet in the

529
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,860
slider

530
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,559
but that means that if you

531
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,860
have a key and you read it out

532
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,440
okay what I also should say is that the

533
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,179
sliders I already told you that two of

534
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:04,799
them go one side the other two go the

535
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,539
other side and there's always the same

536
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:10,700
sliders that go the same direction

537
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,559
now if I have a

538
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:16,380
key and I read out the magnets then I

539
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,400
know

540
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,860
what the magnets in the cylinder must be

541
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,640
this is the only possible uh the

542
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,200
possible only possibility for the

543
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,820
magnets in the sliders to work with this

544
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,000
key

545
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,520
because only then will the sliders go to

546
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,000
the correct position

547
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,900
of course we can always also turn this

548
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,500
around if I know the magnets in the

549
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,580
cylinder

550
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,640
then I know the magnets in the key

551
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,020
because there's a one-to-one relation

552
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,179
there

553
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:51,659
so if I take my magnetometer and I go to

554
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:53,340
the cylinder where I don't have a key

555
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,159
for and I read the magnets in the

556
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,860
cylinder I know the magnets in the key

557
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,500
so that's interesting

558
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,840
so that's what I try to do but again

559
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,980
horrible feel because this hole sensor

560
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:13,039
is too big to fit into the keyhole

561
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,860
so I needed to do something about that

562
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,840
so what I did was I found out that there

563
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,600
are smaller hole sensors in the salt 23

564
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,039
Packaging

565
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,900
and uh

566
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,299
I also needed and this should fit into

567
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:28,559
the lock

568
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,760
and I then needed to print a PCB to put

569
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,919
the sensor on to insert it into the

570
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:36,480
cylinder

571
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,799
so I learned keycot to design a fairly

572
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,240
simple PCB

573
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,299
I bought some flexible PCB that's only

574
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:50,580
0.6.4.6 millimeters thick

575
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,860
and I was told by somebody that if you

576
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,260
print your PCB design with a laser

577
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,780
printer on inkjet print paper you can

578
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:01,020
then use an iron iron to transfer to the

579
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,039
PCB

580
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:04,799
and you can etch it so I did so but this

581
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,659
was also fail I don't know why maybe

582
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:07,980
there are some people here that have

583
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,960
experience with doing this but I

584
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,880
couldn't get it to work but luckily this

585
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,860
is such a simple PCB that I could just

586
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,600
take a sharpie

587
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,440
as you can see here and uh manually draw

588
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,940
the traces

589
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,820
I put it in some sodium parasulfate to

590
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,799
etch it

591
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,780
I forgot to take this away so I etched

592
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,299
the complete the Box away unfortunately

593
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:31,919
but

594
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,900
and I put it in a bit too long so you

595
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,760
can see that the traces are starting to

596
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,760
disappear but it was still working

597
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,460
and I put the little sensor there at the

598
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,400
end but that was a fill well so it was a

599
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,780
successful Edge but it was a fill

600
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,240
because that still didn't fit so this

601
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,419
sensor was was very tiny the PCB was

602
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:53,760
very tiny but still that was too thick

603
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,700
to get into my cylinder

604
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,960
so what I did was I put the sensor knot

605
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,720
on top of the PCB but I glued it at the

606
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,280
end of the PCB

607
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,400
so that saved me 0.6 millimeters and

608
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,260
this was the hardest part of my whole

609
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,500
project to take this 0.1 millimeter wire

610
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,679
and hand solder the device to the PCB

611
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,840
but it it worked so in the end the

612
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,299
sensor

613
00:25:23,299 --> 00:25:27,240
fit I also used some epoxy as you can

614
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,400
see to make sure that there is no Short

615
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,960
Circuit

616
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,900
try to insert it try to hook it up to my

617
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,480
magnetometer and it didn't work because

618
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,520
this new sensor had different voltage

619
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,679
levels than the old one so I couldn't

620
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:44,100
use my same magnetometer

621
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,320
so I thought oh what the heck let's use

622
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,299
an Arduino I think it's a bit Overkill

623
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:51,179
Arduino is like an old-school 386

624
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:53,400
computer when it comes to processing

625
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,080
power and that's a bit much for just

626
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,620
turning on one or two LEDs but

627
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,720
I built a

628
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,940
all the same

629
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,700
so you see I'm also wiggling the sensor

630
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,460
a little bit because it's still so tight

631
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,760
that I cannot move the sensor over the

632
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,400
magnet to feel if it is pointing left

633
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,080
right so I need to wiggle it a little

634
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,260
bit

635
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,200
and that gives me the readings of the

636
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,820
cylinder

637
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,740
so that was a success

638
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,600
and then I thought well since we're

639
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,760
doing Arduino

640
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:32,460
let's make this better so I bought a

641
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,799
cheap

642
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,480
Shield

643
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,960
and I've written some code

644
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,159
so that's a new sensor

645
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:48,659
and with this I can just type in what I

646
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:52,080
see in the cylinder or

647
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,520
on the key

648
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,679
and it will compute for me what is the

649
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,900
corresponding magnet that goes into the

650
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,059
key or the cylinder

651
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,620
all right so the cylinder has a red

652
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,080
green over there so now I know what

653
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,940
needs to be in the key and it depends on

654
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:11,179
which slider you are looking for

655
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,600
and you can also it says an SD card so

656
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,700
you can save the the keys that you

657
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,240
decode and it also has an analog mode

658
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,820
some old logs the magnets are a bit hard

659
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,460
to read and by putting it in analog mode

660
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,640
it it yeah it helps in identifying the

661
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,279
correct magnets you can see the check to

662
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:35,640
see if the key is is the same and indeed

663
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,559
the key corresponds to what I have read

664
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:40,740
great so what can we do now if I have

665
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,600
temporary access to the cylinder but I

666
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,860
don't have the key

667
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,320
then I can at least read out the magnets

668
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,059
from the cylinder so I know exactly

669
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:50,880
which magnets I should put in the key

670
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,640
but there is a problem because I don't

671
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,740
have the bidding and I cannot really

672
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,039
read it from the cylinder very easily

673
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,860
well what I could do is use the picking

674
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,840
technique pick the pins

675
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,760
and then use a setup key with the

676
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,080
magnets to open it

677
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,440
or I could print 256 keys because as I

678
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,940
said there's only four pins with four

679
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,320
possibilities

680
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,940
so well depending on your thread model

681
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,880
that might be doable

682
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,880
but do we have alternatives to open a

683
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,520
lock quickly without using lock picking

684
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,100
single pin picking yes we do

685
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,620
there is a technique called bumping

686
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,940
where you have a key that is cut deep

687
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,640
enough for the pins to go all the way

688
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,679
down but these little teeth in between

689
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,840
the cuttings they are high enough to

690
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,120
touch the pins and when you smash on it

691
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,880
then it's Newton's law the the energy

692
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,919
gets transferred and the pins will

693
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:48,539
separate

694
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:51,360
for fractions of a moment and in that

695
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,120
time you can open the cylinder

696
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,760
so I tried that

697
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,100
these resin printed keys if you would

698
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,140
bump them they would break in a million

699
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,080
pieces but I tried it with the Blaster

700
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,220
keys

701
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,640
and that works so of course I need to

702
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,260
have the correct magnets in there so I

703
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,620
need to print a bump key matching

704
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,200
the magnets in the cylinder

705
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,120
and of course I took the video where it

706
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,460
works in one go normally it will take

707
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,640
maybe five or six bumps but it's not too

708
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,919
bad it does work quite nicely and here

709
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:31,020
you can see so it has the incorrect

710
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,640
bidding but these teeth are still high

711
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,020
enough to touch the pins so that works

712
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,000
now what else can we do to get a lock

713
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,360
opened not using picking and not using a

714
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,700
bump key there is another method which

715
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,440
is impressioning

716
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,419
and this is really cool Technique we

717
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,600
also have competitions and impressioning

718
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,360
at the tool or at the Lock in lock sport

719
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,600
and it means that you wiggle the key and

720
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,640
if you take a blank key

721
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,380
so all the bidding is at the highest

722
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,299
position you wiggle it in the lock and

723
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:05,880
then the pins that are too high up will

724
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,940
push into the key and if you take a key

725
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,159
that's made out of brass that is soft

726
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:13,919
enough to leave a visible trace and you

727
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,299
use a magnifying glass you see the

728
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:16,860
traces you find a little bit of material

729
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,700
away

730
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,159
until you get the key so this picture I

731
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,000
made at the French championships in 2019

732
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,620
I think

733
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,679
where I file the key so you can see my

734
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:31,799
filing and yeah it looks a bit weird

735
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:33,960
because I've filed straight over the key

736
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,880
but it doesn't really matter what I file

737
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,860
away from the key as long as the place

738
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,419
where the pin goes down it goes to the

739
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:41,779
correct position

740
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,640
now can we do the same thing with the

741
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,020
anchor lock

742
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,600
well we need to have a material that is

743
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,960
like brass

744
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,899
and these pictures show aluminum which

745
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:56,820
was for another test that I did for the

746
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,799
bumping test but these are the only

747
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,320
pictures I have of the fabrication of it

748
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,360
this was done by this colleague of mine

749
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,340
who had a little CNC machine at home

750
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,080
a metal key

751
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,059
from the cut model

752
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:14,220
and here is a brass key

753
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,279
where that are used for impressioning

754
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,159
so this key has all the bidding at the

755
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,620
highest level you put it in the lock you

756
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,320
wiggle it you get tiny markings that you

757
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,779
can see there with a red circle and

758
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:30,480
there you file away a little material

759
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,539
and you try again and again and again

760
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:37,440
until you end up with the correct key

761
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,140
it did work but again just as with the

762
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,659
lock picking it was very very hard and I

763
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:46,500
I have no idea really what makes it so

764
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,360
hard in this lock because I didn't find

765
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,059
anything that would defeat impressioning

766
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:53,279
but matter of the fact is this was this

767
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,860
was quite hard to do

768
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,440
but the attack Factor at this moment is

769
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,240
that if we have access to the cylinder

770
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,559
but not the key

771
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:04,080
we can read out the magnets and then we

772
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,600
can create a setup key and bump for one

773
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,399
time opening so I think that's quite

774
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,020
feasible the bumping works well enough

775
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,240
for this to work

776
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,100
or we can do impressioning but I don't

777
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,380
think that's a real life attack because

778
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,580
it's just too hard

779
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,880
now let's make it a little bit more

780
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,559
interesting these

781
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:28,799
locks are were sold or are still sold as

782
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,960
high security locks and they are quite

783
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,200
expensive they cost maybe 300 Euros per

784
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,500
cylinder so it's not really used by end

785
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,720
users where you will find these logs is

786
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,539
in large facilities like uh big

787
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:45,299
companies or hospitals or whatever

788
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:47,580
and those will normally want to use them

789
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,700
in a master keyed system

790
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,740
which means Master keying in general

791
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:55,260
means that you have a bunch of cylinders

792
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,600
and they all have their own key which

793
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,500
you which also are called user keys

794
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,240
that will only operate on that one

795
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,820
cylinder and then there's also a key

796
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,880
that operates on multiple cylinders

797
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,980
so you can have a different levels so

798
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,860
this key is a key that operates these

799
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,179
three cylinders

800
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:18,000
and this key operates that those three

801
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,860
cylinders and then you can even have

802
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,980
another key that operates on all six

803
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,059
and yeah you have multiple levels in the

804
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:29,700
system a whole hierarchy

805
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,500
but to explain how this works in a

806
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,200
regular in a simple system let's focus

807
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,419
on two individual cylinders with an

808
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:39,720
individual user key and one master key

809
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,360
and I'll show you how this works for a

810
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:46,039
generic pin tumbler first

811
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,140
now we have two users Alice and Andy and

812
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,179
they have their own lock their own

813
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:53,880
cylinder so Alice has a cylinder LED has

814
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,700
a cylinder and Alice tries her key on

815
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,320
both cylinders

816
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,720
and as you can see it works on this lock

817
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,720
because all the pins are at the shear

818
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,679
line

819
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:06,419
but it doesn't work in Andy's lock

820
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,359
because the second and last pin

821
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,300
are still blocking

822
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,460
and you now also see how Master keying

823
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,320
is implemented in these locks you take

824
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,300
the pin stack and you just cut the pin

825
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,739
in half once more

826
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,480
and then you get two positions where the

827
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,239
pin May sit for it to open so you can

828
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,460
create two keys that will work

829
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,020
and one is the user key in the other is

830
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,619
the master key

831
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,560
so this is the key of Alice that only

832
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,239
works on Alice's lock

833
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,879
then of course Andy also has a key

834
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,040
and you will see here that this key will

835
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,739
work on the on Andy's lock on the top

836
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:45,060
right

837
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,460
but it will not work on Alice's lock

838
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,918
because the again the second and fourth

839
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:54,259
bin fifth bin are blocking

840
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:58,859
and then we can create a master key that

841
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:02,779
will operate both cylinders

842
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,780
now there's also a code there that's the

843
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,400
the bidding code so the higher the

844
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,400
number the deeper the cut

845
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,700
and if we take LS and and these keys and

846
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,040
the master key you will see that they

847
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,380
only differ in two positions

848
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,740
and you will also see that the master

849
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:26,040
key has more material in those places

850
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,140
than the user keys

851
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,780
and that is for a reason the reason is

852
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,700
that you don't want the user you don't

853
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,280
want the ls or ND to just file away a

854
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,780
little bit from their key and suddenly

855
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,940
get a master key

856
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,220
you cannot just file a material on top

857
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,780
of there so if you want to have the

858
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,520
master key you need to buy a blank key

859
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,079
and the idea is that if you have a good

860
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,119
system you cannot just easily buy a

861
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:50,220
blank key so there's an extra security

862
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,800
measure

863
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,440
it also means that the way to defeat

864
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,180
Master keying is the following suppose

865
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:01,320
you are Alice and you are at work in

866
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,359
your if your own office and you have

867
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,480
your own lock your key works on the lock

868
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,339
and you have the code of your own key

869
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:11,280
what you can do is you can make print

870
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,400
keys that differ in one position

871
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,980
so the first position is a cut three you

872
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,280
print two keys with positions one and

873
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,099
two and you can try them both out in

874
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:25,560
your in your own cylinder and see which

875
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,020
one works maybe none of these work

876
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,359
okay and then you do the same for this

877
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:32,820
for the second cut so you have a cut six

878
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,000
so you try one two three four five

879
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,920
we don't need to go deeper because the

880
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,380
master key is higher up you try them all

881
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,140
out and you will find maybe the one key

882
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,700
works

883
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,160
so that gives you information

884
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,500
and you go on for the Third

885
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,420
the fourth

886
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,339
and the fifth so you can do that in

887
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:54,780
sequence because you start with a

888
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,280
working key you can vary only one

889
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:01,859
pin at a time check all the different

890
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:03,680
heights

891
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,000
and this will give you information of

892
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,359
possible other biddings

893
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:11,460
and then you know that the master key

894
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,140
is like this because you take the four

895
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,300
cut there you take the one cut there and

896
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,280
you have the master key

897
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,619
so master key and gives you more

898
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:21,839
functionality but at the cost of of

899
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,140
security

900
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:27,720
and actually if you know that that there

901
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,880
is only one master key only only one

902
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,339
other key that will fit on your lock you

903
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:34,880
don't even have to bother

904
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,020
trying out these keys because you

905
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:41,240
already had the different cut

906
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,619
but what about this Uncle lock

907
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:45,839
because in here we have magnets and yes

908
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,180
they can also be used for for master key

909
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,339
so that's the reason why the sliders

910
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:53,280
have can have two magnets and why we

911
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,500
have magnet pairs

912
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,480
right so here you see a slider and

913
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,000
there's two spots where a magnet can be

914
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,619
how does this work in practice well

915
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:07,560
suppose again I am a user I have my own

916
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,760
key to my own office and I can read out

917
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,859
the magnets from my own key

918
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:16,619
they are printed there and I already

919
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:19,440
know what needs to be in the cylinder

920
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,440
so it works with my key right because

921
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,320
I'm there's a one-to-one mapping so to

922
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,960
up to to have this key work I know that

923
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,839
these green magnets must be in the

924
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:32,880
cylinder

925
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,220
foreign

926
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,220
now let's find out what the master key

927
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,200
looks like looks like yeah

928
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,820
I have read the magnets from the key but

929
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,619
next what I'll do is read the magnets

930
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:49,619
using the small magnetometer from my

931
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:50,880
cylinder

932
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,260
and see what's in there of course the

933
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,359
green ones are in there but I might find

934
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:57,060
some other stuff as well so by reading

935
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,339
out the cylinder I find out that there

936
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:01,500
is two more magnets so what does that

937
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,859
tell me

938
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,320
now the master key

939
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,960
will have to have magnets to operate

940
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,579
each slider each slider needs to be

941
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:13,380
moved to the correct position

942
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,720
so these middle two sliders

943
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,119
they only have one magnet so the master

944
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,020
key

945
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,300
must have these magnets otherwise that

946
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,140
lock would not open

947
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:31,980
now the blue magnets they are in this

948
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,300
cylinder for a reason

949
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,880
so if my key does not operate the the

950
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,460
blue magnet and there is one other key

951
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,320
that does the master key

952
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,020
then yeah it's the master key that

953
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,839
operates those blue magnets so I know

954
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:51,540
for sure that these magnets will be in

955
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,140
the master key

956
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,320
now what to do with the sliders with two

957
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,420
magnets should we put the other magnet

958
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,859
in as well or shouldn't we

959
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,420
we shouldn't let me show you why suppose

960
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,579
this is my uh this is still my cylinder

961
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:13,500
and my my key now I have a neighbor key

962
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,339
b a neighboring office and they have

963
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:19,140
their own cylinder and as you can see

964
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,400
that cylinder is a little bit different

965
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,640
and you can also see that key a does not

966
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,040
work on cylinder B and vice versa

967
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,740
and the reason is that we have here we

968
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,680
have there

969
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,140
it's all bottom right is the South and

970
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,920
here bottom right is a North

971
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,380
and so this key has bottom right and

972
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,420
north south and this one has South North

973
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:46,140
so they are not interchangeable

974
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:50,220
now if I go to my neighbor's door and I

975
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,099
read out their the magnets in that door

976
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:56,240
then I learned something new I learn

977
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,920
that well ah the neighbor has a north

978
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,960
and I have a South

979
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,880
so I know that here is no magnet

980
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,599
can't be

981
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,540
what about the one here on top

982
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,619
I don't know the neighbor has the same

983
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:18,780
magnet as my door

984
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,020
so I just don't know I only know that

985
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,060
if there is a magnet there it's a north

986
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,079
south

987
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:27,000
but otherwise yeah I need more

988
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,220
information I need to go to more doors

989
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,260
to to

990
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:34,160
read them out

991
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:38,040
then there's two spots left

992
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,680
and yeah one I don't know because I

993
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,180
haven't seen any lock with a magnet

994
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,320
there

995
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,859
and the last one yeah I don't know it

996
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:48,960
could be South North because in the

997
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,480
neighbor's door I saw a magnet there so

998
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,119
yeah it could be a South North nothing

999
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:56,400
else or it could be nothing

1000
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,140
but by going to more and more and more

1001
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,180
doors the more and more I will learn and

1002
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:04,160
the better my master key will be

1003
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:07,800
the problem is though that they do not

1004
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,020
just do Master keying in the magnets but

1005
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,480
also in the pins so that works like a

1006
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,060
generic mosquito system so you have pins

1007
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,980
in different lengths so this these are

1008
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,440
the pins one two three four deep and you

1009
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,900
have a spacers one two and three that

1010
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,000
you can combine with the pins to get

1011
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,480
multiple Shear lines and in this example

1012
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,940
we see that it's now lying flat there is

1013
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,820
one pin that has a spacer in it so it is

1014
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,839
from a Master Key System

1015
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:38,520
but the issue is that this whole story

1016
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,480
about we can go deeper and and check cut

1017
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,880
by cuts to see which one is higher

1018
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,000
that doesn't really work anymore because

1019
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,780
we also have the magnets which means if

1020
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,839
I have the key

1021
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,520
I could maybe file it down so the

1022
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,859
bidding is that of the master key but it

1023
00:42:58,859 --> 00:43:00,060
wouldn't work because maybe the magnets

1024
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,980
are different so the manufacturer does

1025
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,800
not have to take into account that all

1026
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,180
the betting needs to be higher than

1027
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:10,040
lower than that of the master key

1028
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,240
so that trick doesn't work

1029
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,000
so how does it work then in practice so

1030
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,940
to show you I

1031
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,640
got from my friend a bunch of uh old

1032
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,880
cylinders five of them that came from a

1033
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,040
from an organization in the Netherlands

1034
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,980
and that'll replace their logs and these

1035
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,079
were Master keyed but I did not have any

1036
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:33,859
key to them

1037
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,440
so what did I do I made a schematic

1038
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,200
and I'm on I'm trying to figure out the

1039
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,599
setup of the all five keys and all five

1040
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:44,280
cylinders

1041
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,900
step one

1042
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,760
I have no keys the only thing I can do

1043
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,859
is measure magnets

1044
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:52,800
so I took my magnetometer and I measured

1045
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,079
all the magnets in all of five of the

1046
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:56,940
cylinders

1047
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,859
and put them in here

1048
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:02,040
and you can see already that the middle

1049
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,500
two sliders they have the same magnets

1050
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,220
everywhere you know in all the the logs

1051
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,319
and only the bottom and top slider they

1052
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:13,759
are different for each lock

1053
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,599
so using that information I can figure

1054
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,359
out what a mouse key looks like

1055
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:19,819
these are the

1056
00:44:19,819 --> 00:44:22,560
magnets in the

1057
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,440
in the key in the master key

1058
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,200
and I know this because the The Mask key

1059
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,140
cannot have the top left magnet because

1060
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,800
it is RG here and gr there green red and

1061
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,220
red green

1062
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:40,680
so by using the Magnus there on the top

1063
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,720
right I know that those magnets will

1064
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,780
work on all five cylinders

1065
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,420
foreign that also means by knowing that

1066
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,760
I can figure out what the magnets are in

1067
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,819
the individual user keys because the

1068
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:55,619
user Keys must differ as much as

1069
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:58,200
possible from the master key

1070
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,380
in other words if there is a magnet in a

1071
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,660
mass in the cylinder that is not used by

1072
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,700
the master key it must be there for a

1073
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,619
reason the reason being that the user

1074
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:10,920
individual user key must use it

1075
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,680
so we're taking the master key and the

1076
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,240
magnets in all the cylinders I can

1077
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,220
figure out exactly the magnets of all

1078
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,920
the individual keys so those are the

1079
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,300
ones that differ most from the master

1080
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,319
key

1081
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:26,400
and still operate these cylinders

1082
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,200
and now comes the hard part I need to

1083
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,599
know the bidding and I don't know I

1084
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:32,640
don't have a key to start with if you

1085
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,440
have a key to start with it's much more

1086
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,400
easy but I didn't but luckily of these

1087
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,579
five cylinders one was a half cylinder

1088
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:43,319
number five

1089
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:46,280
and what I did was I used the

1090
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,020
a bump key with the magnets that I found

1091
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:53,220
out to bump open this cylinder and why

1092
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,839
did I open this one because the half

1093
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:57,240
cylinder I can disassemble and

1094
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,599
reassemble for it to work again and I

1095
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:02,579
can't do that with the full with the

1096
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:05,280
cylinder that has two sides I cannot get

1097
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,560
them to get back together

1098
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,480
but with a half cylinder I can so I was

1099
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,920
lucky to have a half cylinder in there

1100
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,440
and then you can open it up and you can

1101
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,380
just look at all the pins that are

1102
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,480
coming out and you know exactly what the

1103
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,640
correct meetings are in this lock and I

1104
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,280
can see that there are three pins that

1105
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,119
have two possibilities

1106
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,000
so that means that there are two times

1107
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,819
two times two is eight possibilities for

1108
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:34,560
the master key bidding

1109
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,800
well eight is doable so you just print

1110
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,440
Eight Keys with all the correct magnets

1111
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,680
and try them out in all the cylinders

1112
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,020
and then I found out that only the

1113
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:49,200
combination listed here would open all

1114
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,520
cylinders

1115
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,339
so I know that's the master key I

1116
00:46:53,339 --> 00:46:55,440
I'm already done actually because I have

1117
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,119
the master key to open all the cylinders

1118
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,700
but I'd also like to know what all the

1119
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,220
individual user keys are

1120
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,920
so I'm using this master key trick again

1121
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,040
what I do is I have the on top you see

1122
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,920
the real master key bidding and

1123
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,780
so I know that this key will work in all

1124
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,880
cylinders and then I'm going to vary

1125
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,160
each pin individually to all different

1126
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,300
depths

1127
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,040
and try them out in all the different

1128
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,560
cylinders and see which one works and

1129
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,680
with that I can decode exactly all the

1130
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,480
biddings in all the cylinders

1131
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:33,240
and what I actually did was I printed

1132
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,160
only four keys

1133
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,380
tested them all out wrote down the

1134
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,800
results filed away the debating to the

1135
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,520
next

1136
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,319
try them out

1137
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:46,140
and with these 12 keys I was able to get

1138
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,760
all the different biddings in all the

1139
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,420
different cylinders

1140
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,680
again

1141
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,660
these um

1142
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,640
biddings are in the cylinder for a

1143
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,119
reason so if I find a possible bidding

1144
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:01,920
that works on the cylinder but is not in

1145
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,599
a master key it must be there for a

1146
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,940
reason reason being it is used by the

1147
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,980
user key

1148
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,540
so knowing the master key and all the

1149
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,640
bittings I can figure out what the keys

1150
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,200
are the individual keys

1151
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,660
I then printed them

1152
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:23,899
and of course they all nicely work

1153
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
and I now also have the master key that

1154
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,460
of course is called

1155
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:33,300
uh that goes and the fun thing is I can

1156
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,940
now even create keys that work on a

1157
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:39,660
specific subset of cylinders uh not all

1158
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,880
permutations are possible but I can make

1159
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,480
those as well

1160
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,540
so for the master key

1161
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,640
to get to the master key you will need

1162
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,200
this is the difficult part you will need

1163
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,040
one key to start off with

1164
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,599
because then you can change the bidding

1165
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,359
per per pin

1166
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:03,420
so if you work at a place or where you

1167
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:05,520
have one key and you know which cylinder

1168
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,839
it is in you can start and do the attack

1169
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:12,960
by decoding all the biddings you have a

1170
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,339
limited set of possible master key

1171
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:16,560
biddings depending on how many Cuts

1172
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:20,280
maybe it's two maybe it's eight eight as

1173
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,560
in my example

1174
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:25,440
theoretically it could go up to 81.

1175
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,540
and then you go to other cylinders and

1176
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:30,720
try out which keys still work and if if

1177
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,180
you have eight keys and four no longer

1178
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,520
work there's four left that can be the

1179
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,079
possible master key combination and if

1180
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:38,640
you go to a new cylinder you will learn

1181
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,560
more and maybe then only two will work

1182
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,900
throw away two and remaining two one of

1183
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,000
them is the correct one

1184
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,579
so it is a matter of going to more and

1185
00:49:47,579 --> 00:49:48,780
more cylinders

1186
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,599
and which each one you see you get more

1187
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,119
information about getting the master key

1188
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:56,160
it is still quite a bit of work

1189
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,800
more work than with a regular old system

1190
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,800
but I think it's it's quite doable if

1191
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:06,420
you're a bit handy and have a 3D print

1192
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,460
so to summarize

1193
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:12,319
and let's make this this a bit visual

1194
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,940
we start the question is do we have a

1195
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,020
key

1196
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:19,260
if you have the key it's now easy to

1197
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,260
measure the magnets decode the bidding

1198
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:25,440
by the naked eye put it in the cat model

1199
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,319
printer key and it'll work

1200
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,440
so we can copy a key

1201
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,540
um

1202
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,900
and the fun thing is that uh

1203
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,920
if you do not if you see a picture of a

1204
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,560
key I'll explain it later first let's

1205
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,119
let me do this

1206
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,339
so if you have a key you can make a copy

1207
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:50,099
if you don't have the key we have a few

1208
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:52,200
possibilities first of all we can decode

1209
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,819
the magnets because we can read them out

1210
00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:55,380
from the cylinder

1211
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:58,140
but then we need to open the lock so we

1212
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,119
need the bidding what you can do is make

1213
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:03,300
a setup key and pick the lock

1214
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,920
but I've made it light blue because

1215
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,660
that's quite hard

1216
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,640
you can do impressioning it's also quite

1217
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,500
hard but the advantage is that it will

1218
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,140
and end up with giving you a correct

1219
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,480
working key

1220
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,960
you can try 256 different keys and one

1221
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,339
will work that will also give you a

1222
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:21,960
working key

1223
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,059
or you can bump which is quite easy to

1224
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:26,640
do and open the lock once

1225
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,640
and only if you are able to disassemble

1226
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,880
it then you can look at the insights and

1227
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,619
also get the bidding and get a working

1228
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:36,920
key

1229
00:51:37,319 --> 00:51:40,079
if that is then Master kit

1230
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,079
then what you can do is decode all the

1231
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:45,720
possible buildings in your cylinder by

1232
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,160
using 12 keys

1233
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,040
and then you can do

1234
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:55,020
by process of elimination you can go to

1235
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,460
the next cylinder the next one the next

1236
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:57,960
one and each time you measure the

1237
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,540
magnets find out more information and

1238
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:02,339
narrow down what the master key will

1239
00:52:02,339 --> 00:52:04,700
look like

1240
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,020
and you're happy

1241
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,140
so conclusion

1242
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,839
I think this cylinder is still a

1243
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,720
quite interesting it it still requires

1244
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,300
some work to uh to get it open and it's

1245
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:24,000
it's fairly uh big resistant but of

1246
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,460
course with 3D printers nowadays yeah it

1247
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,020
becomes

1248
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,480
well not not to say very easy but quite

1249
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,760
easy to make a duplicate of a key

1250
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,380
and this is a problem that all the

1251
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,260
manufacturers face

1252
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,520
so also the uploads if you have a

1253
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,440
picture of that you could make a

1254
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,140
duplicate key

1255
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,839
it is still non-trivial for the magnet

1256
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:48,619
so if you have a picture

1257
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:49,740
um

1258
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,140
of the key yeah you don't know where the

1259
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:53,880
magnets are which one are fakes which

1260
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,680
one are magnets and which position they

1261
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,800
have but of course if you go to the if

1262
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,599
you know which cylinder the key works on

1263
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:02,099
you can just go to the cylinder and read

1264
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:03,420
out the magnets from the cylinder

1265
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,460
instead of the key and then you also

1266
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,940
have that information

1267
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,740
so that's a that's an issue companies

1268
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:12,319
are trying to

1269
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:17,220
prevent 3D copying uh printing keys

1270
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,319
and uh

1271
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:20,819
yeah one of the things that they are

1272
00:53:20,819 --> 00:53:23,339
doing uh also for patent reasons is put

1273
00:53:23,339 --> 00:53:25,260
all kinds of movable elements into the

1274
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,780
key that are hard to print you cannot

1275
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,640
really easily print something that moves

1276
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:30,900
within the key

1277
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:33,000
although there are also ways to defeat

1278
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,859
this it was a nice talk last year about

1279
00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:37,220
this

1280
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,500
so conclusion

1281
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,359
our master key still requires quite a

1282
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:44,400
bit of work it's not like you're done in

1283
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,500
in 10 minutes more than with

1284
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,660
conventional locks but it certainly is

1285
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,220
doable

1286
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:53,160
and my last advice is to only do testing

1287
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,200
on your own cylinders as we do in lock

1288
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,420
sport

1289
00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:00,240
I mean I've had these Keys break in my

1290
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,940
own cylinders and then I had to uh yeah

1291
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:04,319
I could no longer use my cylinder

1292
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:06,180
because it was the key was stuck inside

1293
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:07,980
couldn't get it out

1294
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,740
so don't try that on cylinders that are

1295
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,660
really in use

1296
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:14,880
I would also like to thank my colleague

1297
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,059
hido who did tcnc work but also anchor

1298
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:20,640
slot because that's a Dutch company that

1299
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,839
builds these cylinders in the

1300
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:24,960
Netherlands licensed by miwa

1301
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,980
and I contacted contacted them before I

1302
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,839
did a presentation about the log saying

1303
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:33,000
well I I've been doing some research

1304
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,040
maybe it would be good to talk with you

1305
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,020
and see what you think about this and if

1306
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,880
there is the if there is stuff that I

1307
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,579
cannot really disclose and I said oh

1308
00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:43,020
sure come on over so I went to their

1309
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,780
Factory I got a nice walk through the

1310
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,540
factory they showed me everything

1311
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:50,339
they only have one head developer

1312
00:54:50,339 --> 00:54:52,200
and that was really uh cool they even

1313
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,319
gave me some an optaneium blank keys so

1314
00:54:55,319 --> 00:54:57,380
I can now do bumping with the original

1315
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:00,900
Anchor Key with the anchor magnet

1316
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,540
um and of course they they knew that

1317
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:07,280
this these techniques are possible

1318
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,960
it's also not a cylinder that has been

1319
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,240
actively

1320
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,099
worked on to get it redesigned the

1321
00:55:14,099 --> 00:55:18,180
ankara's other locks that they work on

1322
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:21,480
