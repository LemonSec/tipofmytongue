6
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,680

7
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,320
a lot of people really awesome to be

8
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,420
here thank you all for coming

9
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,640
I've got an interesting story that I

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,680
wanted to tell you it's the story of

11
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,140
vostomo so just let's have a show of

12
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,358
hands who hasn't heard about vastama

13
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,280
seriously we got one where are you from

14
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,220
sir

15
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,880
yeah

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,360
very far from Finland

17
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,000
it's understandable but anyway I thought

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,159
I'd I'd tell you the story

19
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,840
because there's a lot of details about

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,000
this case out there a lot of news

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,820
articles a lot of false information some

22
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,400
of it falls because well

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,100
journalists don't do due diligence or

24
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,400
just somebody posting stuff online so I

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,960
gathered all of that stuff into one

26
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,460
story and that's the story I want to

27
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,500
tell you about

28
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,900
well that's my name work as a security

29
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,000
operations manager for a Finnish company

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,979
called Ivan

31
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,100
this is a kind of a story about a

32
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,320
database and we do databases but I'm not

33
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,780
here to sell you a managed database but

34
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,460
if you're thinking about databases Ivan

35
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,860
does manage databases

36
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,520
so a small sales pitch there work as a

37
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,380
security operations manager for the EU

38
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,280
area

39
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,619
some of you who listen to podcasts might

40
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,840
have heard me speak previously on turba

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,800
karayat

42
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,099
oh thank you which is briefly on a pass

43
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,620
we did a new new episode just before

44
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,120
this sober because we thought it would

45
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,819
be a cool thing to do it turned out just

46
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:22,800
like all the other episodes so sorry

47
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,800
about that but fun to do and I do it

48
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,599
with you who is actually the next

49
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,520
speaker I'm warming up the crowd for him

50
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,739
he's going to talk about mental health

51
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,920
and how I helped him lose it and Laura

52
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,379
kankala who is also our very valuable

53
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,300
and loved co-host

54
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,000
so check it out there's a 106 episodes

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,879
of us chatting about topical stuff and

56
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,800
if you're interested what we thought

57
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,260
about Corona when it came out it's all

58
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,500
there

59
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,900
one approach the

60
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,599
case of vastava not really from

61
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,519
a technical perspective I don't want to

62
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,200
talk about that well I'll talk about the

63
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,580
tech too but I don't want to just talk

64
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,800
about the database or the breach I

65
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,060
rather

66
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,180
want to frame this as a story kind of a

67
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,360
classical story a sort of a tragedy and

68
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,280
I think when I thought about the whole

69
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,200
thing there was a

70
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,780
kind of a narrative Arc to it it was

71
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,120
kind of like a Greek tragedy there was

72
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,220
like three parts to it and that's how I

73
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,900
built this presentation

74
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,819
and I did have

75
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,860
access to a lot of information about

76
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,959
this case because I used to work at nixu

77
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,120
when we did the forensic investigation

78
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,599
of the server that got breached but I'm

79
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,060
not going to use that information here

80
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,819
where it is not in the public domain

81
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:44,040
because a lot of the stuff that we put

82
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,780
in the report that we delivered to the

83
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,540
customer was actually published

84
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,640
and I'll tell you when later in the

85
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,319
presentation but it's you can go to

86
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,720
finlex and find a lot of Snippets which

87
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,159
you can almost use to build the whole

88
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,680
repair report out but everything you see

89
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,780
here is public

90
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,879
possibly not available anymore but it

91
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,018
was public at some time

92
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,159
if you think about a tragedy

93
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,939
usually the arc is that there is a

94
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,680
there is a hero

95
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,019
who does something and then there's the

96
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,418
downfall and then there's the the end of

97
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,340
the tragedy it follows this kind of an

98
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,720
arc and this word this hybrids

99
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,800
I think I'm not using this word to say

100
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,620
that vastum or its leadership were

101
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,259
arrogant or insolent I'm just using it

102
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,720
kind of to

103
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,540
I'm going to try to capture

104
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,880
the inbuilt arrogance in being

105
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,919
successful in a world where most people

106
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,320
aren't it doesn't mean that these people

107
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,000
did something wrong so please don't read

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,320
this wrong

109
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,280
but I think the

110
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,560
let's say arrogance before the gods is

111
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,380
probably the best thing that I can use

112
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,540
to describe what I mean by this word so

113
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,919
I'm going to tell you first about how

114
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:06,960
vastama got started

115
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,500
it was founded in 2010 the idea brewed

116
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,100
in 2008 by Villa tapio and his mother

117
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,639
Nina tapio Villa has been

118
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,240
uh in the media he has been portrayed as

119
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,160
some kind of a computer guy a computer

120
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,020
wizard like a self-made software

121
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,020
developer that's not exactly true he has

122
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,960
background in I.T but he's a business

123
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,479
guy first and foremost and I'm just

124
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,940
gonna have to say the the claim that he

125
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,039
actually programmed the vastama systems

126
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,320
that's not true that's false they had

127
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,840
outside people do that professional

128
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,720
programmers to create the

129
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,820
system that we're going to talk about

130
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,759
but they had an idea back like well 15

131
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,280
years ago really like how can we combine

132
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,280
the Psychotherapy business and the

133
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,800
online world we would call in Finland

134
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,300
digilorika which is like probably

135
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,539
digital leap like digital digitalize

136
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,880
something that wasn't digital before and

137
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,460
they had this business idea for Boston

138
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,120
when they wanted to offer things online

139
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,680
it was very very successful by 18

140
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,919
they had already 25 locations they had

141
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,979
400 employees at that point as they have

142
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:24,479
I have the old slides here it's actually

143
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,660
221 employees that's a mistake

144
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,100
and

145
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,340
Villa was the CEO from 2013.

146
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,460
and let's not emphasize too much his I.T

147
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,740
background but that got him

148
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,360
the idea of combining these two worlds

149
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,100
so the original idea was to serve

150
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,620
clients over the internet I'm not sure

151
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,360
if you've heard about this idea that you

152
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,620
have a business and then you take it to

153
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,020
the internet but they had that idea and

154
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,000
that was actually really good but I'm

155
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,860
not sure

156
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,020
what what actually just didn't make it

157
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,580
take off maybe the technology wasn't

158
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,039
ready maybe the customer base wasn't

159
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,539
ready maybe people didn't trust the

160
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:05,220
technology enough now it's commonplace

161
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,500
you can have like Google meets with a

162
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,060
therapist or or whatever but that's

163
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,460
where they started quickly they realized

164
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,580
that the types of stuff that people come

165
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,680
to a therapist to talk about actually

166
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,960
just having a teams meeting is really

167
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,199
not enough as we all know having had

168
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,080
this terrible remote work situation for

169
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,699
a couple of years

170
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:29,699
some of us like it personally I do my

171
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,160
team is abroad anyway so it's not like

172
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,199
I'm gonna go to the office and meet them

173
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,780
but for a lot of people

174
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,180
I kind of realized that the discussion

175
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,220
over teams or Google meet or whatever

176
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,319
your company uses just isn't the same

177
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,020
thing as sitting across the table from

178
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,960
somebody so they opened locations

179
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,720
they'll open 25 of those a lot of

180
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,139
locations just to have the therapists

181
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:57,419
meet with their patients and they

182
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,699
gathered a hundreds hundreds of those

183
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:02,759
therapists in one location because the

184
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,580
usually the profession of psychotherapy

185
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,160
is uh sort of a single entrepreneur

186
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,099
business so you get your license you get

187
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,900
your training and then you have your own

188
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,759
business and you meet clients and you

189
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:15,900
build them and there's a lot of that

190
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,120
overhead so Gathering them all and

191
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,280
having them as salaried employees was a

192
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,900
relief for a lot of the therapists

193
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,520
because they could focus on patient work

194
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,919
instead of doing things like bookkeeping

195
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,120
and billing

196
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,460
and all of the marketing and all that

197
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,020
stuff

198
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,179
they were during actually very well and

199
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,820
I think this has been overlooked

200
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,440
a lot

201
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,539
that how well they were doing and how

202
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:42,479
big of a player they were in the in the

203
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,640
space that they were operating in

204
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,160
and the association of Finnish work gave

205
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,300
them

206
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,720
uh recognition as a Finnish social

207
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,820
Enterprise and this was one of their

208
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,459
goals they wanted to open

209
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:59,580
centers or sure what to call them not

210
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,680
really clinics but like locations for

211
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,959
therapists to meet patients even in

212
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,459
cities that were didn't really make

213
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,620
Financial sense because if you want to

214
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:10,140
cover like 90 percent of Finland you

215
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,760
need to go to like four big cities and

216
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,920
that's it but they had 25 locations

217
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,019
because their mission was to bring

218
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,980
Psychotherapy more available for people

219
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,959
and this really bugged me when I read

220
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:23,580
the articles about it because it just

221
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,060
felt like

222
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,860
felt like people are looking to blame

223
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,980
somebody when this hack happened and

224
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,899
they of course started blaming vastama

225
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,220
because they didn't have anybody else

226
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,940
and we had all these articles about

227
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,080
psychotherapists say that vastama was a

228
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,540
 place to work and the CEO was a

229
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,000
bad guy and it was all about money and

230
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,339
the facts that I've gathered about this

231
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,620
don't really support that black and

232
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,360
white narrative it was more complicated

233
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,800
than that

234
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,120
so

235
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,220
the old saying that

236
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,680
news articles are usually accurate

237
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,180
unless they write about something you

238
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,140
know about

239
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,080
well prove to be true again here so it's

240
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,180
more complicated than that because you

241
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,339
don't get that Mark of a Finnish social

242
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,740
Enterprise by trying to maximize profits

243
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,360
and being an to your employees

244
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,680
just doesn't happen

245
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,180
so later in June 219 uh intera partners

246
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,820
which is uh Venture Capital firm they

247
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,820
bought the majority share of Boss Tamil

248
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,120
they wanted to fund the business and

249
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,620
have it grow quickly

250
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,920
and of course Villa tapio and his family

251
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,140
others were majority shareholders and it

252
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,140
was already a good business so they they

253
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,600
got wealthy in the process

254
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,579
and they wanted to grow the business

255
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:48,739
so this is going to be relevant later

256
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,420
so in my opinion just reading up on it

257
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,000
it was treated as a success story up

258
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,399
until the crime when it was

259
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,339
kind of recast as a villain or some kind

260
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:00,779
of a problem

261
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:02,640
company in the space

262
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,380
they innovated on Digital Services

263
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,420
that's good

264
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,120
Rising need for mental health care

265
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,800
obviously and growing as a business so

266
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,779
if you don't have to do anything wrong

267
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,800
to kind of succumb the hybrids in that

268
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,839
kind of a situation just have the

269
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,980
audience audacity of being successful

270
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,320
and that's the way most of us know

271
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,480
in a few years everything

272
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,880
took a very dark turn

273
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,060
it was very different

274
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,060
and in a Greek tragedy this first

275
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,260
hybrids

276
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,959
and hybris invites a visitation from the

277
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,459
nemesis

278
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,440
which is

279
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,360
the goddess who enacts retribution to

280
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,420
those who show arrogance before the Gods

281
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,000
this is this was interesting because in

282
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,500
this case

283
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,500
this actually happened in the form of a

284
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,339
cyber attacker

285
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,959
they made themselves known in a bunch of

286
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,399
Finnish forums

287
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,220
there was Uli lauta which most of us

288
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,620
know are Swami from Reddit which all of

289
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,500
us probably know and Tori lauta which is

290
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,800
a dark web site

291
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,300
specifically Finnish language websites

292
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,279
and they approached the Finnish public

293
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,440
by posting into all of these places with

294
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,420
a message like this they said that

295
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,860
they've hacked the Psychotherapy clinic

296
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,620
and they want 40 Bitcoins

297
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,540
and if not

298
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,240
met if their conditions are not met they

299
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,880
are going to gradually release patient

300
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,079
records

301
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:38,880
they said that they're going to release

302
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,160
a hundred records per day

303
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,740
and they had tens of thousands of them

304
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,240
at this point the police Nick so the

305
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,339
cyber security Center of Finland had all

306
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,680
been investigating this case for a month

307
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,500
because we got contacted pretty early on

308
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,720
Nixon's job was to actually just do an

309
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,060
autopsy on the server that's it black

310
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,279
box everything else we weren't a part of

311
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,500
the criminal investigation we weren't a

312
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,000
part of anything else we just did the

313
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,339
forensics on the server as these things

314
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,300
go the public-private partnership is

315
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,820
quite guarded because of course the

316
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,620
police want to make sure that nothing

317
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,660
that they release is going to impend

318
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,399
their investigation an ongoing

319
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,519
investigation and a very serious one so

320
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,560
that was our role

321
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,779
I was the head of Investigation for that

322
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:30,720
forensics work I didn't actually do the

323
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,940
work I had a couple of much more

324
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,680
talented people than me do the physical

325
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,620
work but I signed the report and that's

326
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,459
why

327
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:42,319
I'm also here talking about it because

328
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,980
uh

329
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,260
like other dfir reports you just send

330
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,480
them you get send the bill you get paid

331
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,220
and that's it but this story of course

332
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,860
keeps living on

333
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,680
so discussion starts in torilota which

334
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,880
is a finish

335
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,380
darknet

336
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,779
website and they post it there and you

337
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,160
can see the first reactions from

338
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,620
Anonymous and I'll translate for you and

339
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,300
I hope nobody brought their small

340
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,720
children it says

341
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,579
which basically means what is this

342
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:12,779


343
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:16,440
and let's say that the reaction from the

344
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,060
lay internet user was hostile or more so

345
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,320
Ransom man

346
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,139
the attacker was using that name

347
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:27,420
did not gain a lot of sympathy even in

348
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,760
the dark net marketplaces where people

349
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,260
routinely

350
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,560
engage in illicit activities

351
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,019
but the point was of course to to put

352
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,060
public pressure on the company and make

353
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,459
them more likely to pay

354
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:43,620
and at this point um

355
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,360
we have been following this for several

356
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,180
weeks and I just kind of had the feeling

357
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,420
that the attacker is probably from

358
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,420
Finland based on a number of things

359
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,820
because none of the actual individual

360
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,959
facts

361
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,420
were enough to just I didn't have a

362
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,820
picture of his passport for example but

363
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,500
just the fact that he chose the places

364
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,720
he chose

365
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,880
I'm pretty sure it's not popular outside

366
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,139
of Finland or Swami well discoverable

367
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:15,720
maybe but probably not popular and Tori

368
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,880
lauta it even has the Swami captcha

369
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,760
where there are Estonian language

370
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,120
sentences and Finnish sentences and you

371
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,639
have to tell the difference

372
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,800
basically you have to be either Estonian

373
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,040
or Finnish to be able to do that or use

374
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,600
machine translation or whatever but

375
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,220
anyway the point is that there were

376
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,019
several things pointing towards the fact

377
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,120
that the attacker might be finished and

378
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,920
that was at least my working assumption

379
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,740
didn't change anything just um

380
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,839
can't stop thinking about like who this

381
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,199
might be

382
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,600
they removed the threads immediately

383
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,160
because they were also sharing a link to

384
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,920
the patient records

385
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,740
being a dark website they didn't close

386
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,680
or or shut down the threads at that time

387
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,839
but they had set a timer

388
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,899
and the Cesar of Tori lauta had said

389
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,579
even in the beginning of the whole dark

390
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:10,139
web Enterprise that he's going to run

391
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:12,720
this for three years because the closer

392
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,000
that let's say the longer you run a

393
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,459
website like this the more likely it is

394
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:19,139
that you're gonna get caught

395
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:21,000
which is actually really smart so in

396
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,339
November and 2020 three years was up he

397
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,620
closed story louder uh dropped the mic

398
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,420
and walked away

399
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,540
so not a lot of discussion pads were

400
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,180
available for for ransoman anymore but

401
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,639
he was active on Tori Lauda discussing

402
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:38,639
with people having chats with them

403
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,160
and then 100 patient records actually do

404
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,680
appear on tour

405
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,100
these are text files that contain

406
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,440
the social security number the phone

407
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,940
number

408
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,920
and the

409
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,500
email address not sure if it had their

410
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,959
home address don't remember that detail

411
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:00,480
probably not but all of these details

412
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,899
and the psychiatrist

413
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:05,520
psychiatrists note from all of their

414
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,980
visits just written down there in plain

415
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,500
finish for anyone to read

416
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,359
and they just published a hundred of

417
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,520
those

418
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,720
and inside the folder there was this

419
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,540
file000 readme.txt

420
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,980
where they say that they've been trying

421
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,459
to negotiate but vastama does not want

422
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,260
to negotiate

423
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,299
I have no information what was going on

424
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,460
with vastama in the background but I

425
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,840
know the police were involved at this

426
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,880
time of course

427
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,160
and they're just trying to put more

428
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,799
pressure and as you can see

429
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,960
they even set up an email for press

430
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,120
because they were trying to go to

431
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,880
through the publicity route just let's

432
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,360
let's put pressure on making this public

433
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,500
I'm not sure if that ever works Maybe

434
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,600
maybe just this uh

435
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,720
of course it's a known TTP this double

436
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,600
extortion just first you pay to regain

437
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,460
your data and then you pay so that we

438
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,440
don't leak it and I think they just kind

439
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,179
of tore

440
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:12,179
a page from The Playbook of let's let's

441
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:14,880
just start extorting with leaking the

442
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,280
data but for a company like this like

443
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,200
just the fact that somebody has the data

444
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,299
that's the problem not that somebody is

445
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:22,440
saying that they're going to leak it

446
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,559
it's already lost from their opinion

447
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:28,140
from their point of view

448
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,120
and another thing that

449
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,860
paid attention to because of course we

450
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,419
were watching this very carefully what's

451
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:34,860
what's happening

452
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,559
and I I checked the patient records and

453
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,660
mostly the discussion about the patient

454
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,720
records that were released the first 100

455
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,760
ones and it wasn't like they started

456
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,260
alphabetically

457
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,440
or that they started uh by date of visit

458
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,299
or anything like that it just seemed

459
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:52,919
like they've been going through the data

460
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,919
and picked individual ones

461
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,080
it doesn't seem random

462
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,640
and

463
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,679
to read finish

464
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,980
therapist notes

465
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,080
well I guess machine translation is good

466
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,880
enough to kind of get the gist of it but

467
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,260
are you going to just feed those back

468
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,860
and forth to find more most damaging

469
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,960
ones like how are you going to identify

470
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,059
the people I just got the feeling that

471
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:19,620
these are not professional ransomware

472
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,760
operators

473
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,380
I'm not even sure if there's many of

474
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,880
them or just one

475
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,140
and they're probably finished

476
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,000
so some people contact the attacker at

477
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,799
Tori lauta

478
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,320
and ask him to remove their individual

479
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,900
files and just permanently delete my

480
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,100
information

481
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,179
and he keeps using the same this uh the

482
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:46,919
green text with the double hashtags is

483
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,260
called a trip code and you can register

484
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,760
that because otherwise you can just set

485
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,440
your username but your trip code is

486
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,840
unique so he's been using that one to

487
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,580
communicate and talk about this case as

488
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,559
a sort of a proof of identity

489
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,900
and he's naming his price to removing

490
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,539
one file and sending a Bitcoin address

491
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:06,780
and a cock.li

492
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,400
some kind of a

493
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,559
reference to roosters possibly I'm not

494
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,380
sure email address

495
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,880
and I checked

496
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,860
a lot later he didn't he never received

497
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,140
the payment so just selling this removal

498
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,600
service doesn't seem to take off very

499
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,480
well but obviously people who have their

500
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,520
information there who know that they

501
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,740
were patients at past demo are already

502
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,880
worried at this point

503
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,000
and he lost his email account so he set

504
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,980
up a new one and um

505
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,320
a bit of a back and forth

506
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,260
and people are

507
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,419
are asking about like um

508
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,700
just starting to hint about the fact

509
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,320
that what kind of information they've

510
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,780
discussed with their therapists and if

511
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,539
you think about it like what is a

512
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:57,120
therapist for like what is the purpose

513
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,280
of you going to talk to them instead of

514
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,260
having two beers and talking to your

515
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,240
body it's like there's stuff you don't

516
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,880
want to talk with people you know

517
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,500
if something you want to get off your

518
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,460
chest

519
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,100
and the therapist relationship is built

520
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,740
on Trust on the absolute trust that they

521
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,860
have a legal requirement and an ethical

522
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,440
obligation never to tell anybody what

523
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,980
you tell them

524
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,799
so this is the most private information

525
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:28,200
that you can emit basically in this

526
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,159
situation

527
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:31,320
the discussion is um not very

528
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,820
enthusiastic so it doesn't seem like

529
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,059
Ransom money is that interested

530
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:38,340
in dealing with individual people and

531
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,520
collecting like 0.05 Bitcoins which is

532
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,880
worth what today I don't even know

533
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,280
but he continues this stuff

534
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,280
and on the second day as promised Helix

535
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,159
another 100 patient files

536
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:56,039
and then on the third day not of

537
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,799
Christmas of this crime

538
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,080
something amazing happens

539
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,820
like absolutely amazing because we've

540
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,280
been watching this tour site like Hawks

541
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,220
and we had a scraper script that went

542
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,080
through it every hour just to see if

543
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,380
there's new files and on the 23rd our

544
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,240
scraper script which started three

545
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,640
minutes past the full hour notice that

546
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,919
there's an almost 11 gigabyte file there

547
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,900
called vastama.tar

548
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,120
and anybody who knows anything about

549
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,860
computers which is I'm guessing at least

550
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,679
half of you people knows that a 100 text

551
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,980
files is not 11 gigabytes so extremely

552
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,900
interested in what's what's just been

553
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,240
uploaded like thirty thousand forty

554
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,860
thousand text files don't take 11

555
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,559
gigabytes so our script starts

556
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,720
downloading the file

557
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,360
turns out it's his entire home folder

558
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,100
so it's been running the tar command in

559
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,480
a different folder than he was supposed

560
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,500
to

561
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,900
in his home folder and he packed it all

562
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,020
and this being torso

563
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,539
traffic is slow takes us a while we

564
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:59,820
managed to grab a good chunk of it

565
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,419
and other people too as you can see from

566
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:05,039
the comments if you speak the Elvish

567
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:05,940
language

568
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,240
it says like uh somebody got

569
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,460
that was the previous one 16 megabytes

570
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,740
somebody else says that he has like 5

571
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,720
000 patient files

572
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,919
this is his reaction

573
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,140
after working

574
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,600
through this extortion

575
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,280
having

576
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,559
the most private secrets of tens of

577
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,120
thousands of people trying to extort

578
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,120
half a million and then just bungling it

579
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,580
all up like this like accidentally

580
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,880
just putting his home folder in a tar

581
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,980
file and sharing it this is his reaction

582
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,200
whoopsie it's like

583
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,960
okay this is this these are not

584
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,720
professional ransomware operators as I

585
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,919
said

586
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:56,159
so what was in the file

587
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,980
power paint mistakes obviously

588
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,659
don't know why that's doing that but

589
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:02,640
anyway uh

590
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,159
there was all of the patient data

591
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,440
and the file was a DOT tar which is

592
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,740
short for tape archive and I think it's

593
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,159
a file format that dates around the

594
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,799
first world war so it's very old it just

595
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,780
basically you put one file after the

596
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,980
another no compression which was perfect

597
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,020
for us when we were downloading it

598
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,179
because you can download a partial and

599
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:29,220
just open every file that it that's in

600
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,419
that tar file

601
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:33,240
even if it's an incomplete download if

602
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,799
it were compressed

603
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,740
much harder if not impossible

604
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,140
to decompress a partial file especially

605
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,299
a file that you only grab a

606
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:45,059
less than half for example

607
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,700
but the sad thing is that the tar file

608
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,620
started with all of the patient records

609
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,559
so anybody who downloaded

610
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:55,620
let's say more than a 500 megabytes of

611
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,879
it had them all

612
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,740
so when you're running

613
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,080
sort of a ransom operation

614
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,000
which you shouldn't that's illegal but

615
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,220
if you are

616
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,400
it shouldn't but if you are one of the

617
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,260
things is that you have leverage and

618
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,039
then you have a victim

619
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,720
if you lose your Leverage

620
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,340
it's really hard to victimize the victim

621
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,380
because they've been victimized at that

622
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,159
point

623
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:24,659
and the patient passed where the

624
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:27,240
leverage and he lost it so no point in

625
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,460
trying to Ransom them anymore it's

626
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,559
effectively public so we all know the

627
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:33,900
data on the Internet it's like dropping

628
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,240
oil in water just spreads everywhere

629
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,059
there's no way to collect it all or get

630
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:41,880
it cleaned it's just not possible so

631
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,799
it's out there we have no idea how many

632
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:46,620
people downloaded it

633
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,840
so the web server disappears

634
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,000
ransomman stops communicating on Tori

635
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,679
lauta

636
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:54,539
next day I hope he had a terrible

637
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:56,279
hangover

638
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,659
and

639
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:00,480
he still tries this last ditch effort

640
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,400
effort because he has everybody's email

641
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,400
address so he sends all of the patients

642
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,100
an email with a personalized Ransom

643
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,159
message like pay me and I will remove

644
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:12,919
your files because most of the people

645
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:15,240
affected at this point they don't know

646
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,400
that it's already gone the data's out

647
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,919
there he has no leverage towards the

648
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,960
company because of course he realizes

649
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,419
that we've realized at this point that

650
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:26,340
the data is gone and he's got nothing on

651
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,320
us anymore but individual people don't

652
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,580
know that

653
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,600
but luckily

654
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:35,760
doesn't seem to work very well this is

655
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,320
the message that he sent

656
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,860
Mr Mrs first name surname and their

657
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,840
social security number just to prove

658
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,580
that they know who they are and blah

659
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,559
blah blah blah blah another page from

660
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,900
the uh your friendly neighborhood black

661
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,340
hat Playbook

662
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,159
trying just this long explanation

663
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:57,440
and a ridiculous 24-hour

664
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,720
uh Cliff I think might be the word until

665
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,460
the payment is more

666
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,039
so if you haven't ever used Bitcoin

667
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,559
if you don't sleep at all 24 hours is

668
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,360
barely enough to start understanding how

669
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,880
to pie it and use it and pay with it at

670
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,159
least for me but I'm I'm a bit dumb some

671
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,460
are smarter but unrealistic and again

672
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,059
just sort of a Mad Dash effort

673
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:23,460
but most people decline the offer

674
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,559
because the information security

675
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:28,100
Community was collecting these

676
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,840
personalized Bitcoin addresses

677
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,900
and trying to see how much money Ransom

678
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,380
man made with this whole terrible attack

679
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,740
and it was a very paltrism

680
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,720
maybe a few thousand Euros I don't

681
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,880
remember the exact sum but it he's not

682
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,100
buying a Bugatti with that money he's

683
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,539
not even buying a

684
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:51,559
nice jacket

685
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:53,460
and then it's all over

686
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,559
just disappears

687
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,299
everybody knows that the data is out

688
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:00,059
there the extortion is pointless and it

689
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:02,899
all goes quiet

690
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:05,460
I'll come back to what happened

691
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,440
after that but I want to talk a bit

692
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,539
about

693
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:10,860
vastava's systems because I'm sure this

694
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,900
interests a lot of people most of you

695
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,279
probably know a part of this

696
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,240
this is uh gathered from the parts that

697
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,340
are available at a government official

698
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,539
website

699
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,880
that state facts about the system and I

700
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,260
will treat those facts as public

701
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,840
information as they are de facto public

702
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,139
information

703
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,200
had a website called portillas registry

704
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,659
which means patient registry it was just

705
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:42,179
a web site running on a server somewhere

706
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:46,380
which had a web application and a mySQL

707
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,700
database

708
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,340
the web application was used for the

709
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,440
therapist to gather their notes and this

710
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,320
was probably one of the big draws for a

711
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,820
lot of the therapists they had this

712
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,039
let's say digitalization leap kind of

713
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,260
thing 10 years ago that you could all

714
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,240
just write your notes here and you could

715
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,480
do your billing here and all of this was

716
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,240
I've been I've been told that it was a

717
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,919
big draw for a lot of the therapists to

718
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:12,059
join them so you don't have to figure

719
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:14,400
this out yourself like where do I put

720
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,260
the notes and how do I do billing and do

721
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,020
I buy pastely from Austin or

722
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,120
how do I do this so

723
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,980
this was it and this was the vulnerable

724
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:27,320
server this was the one that was bridged

725
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:30,960
if we go back we see that the

726
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,179
IP address has some history this doesn't

727
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:35,159
go back all the way and I tried

728
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:36,779
searching Showdown when I was making

729
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,340
this presentation and there was a

730
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,159
website for it which showed which ports

731
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:44,940
had been open and accessible to the

732
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,020
internet

733
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,399
at least from the point of view of

734
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:49,740
shoden but no results were found of

735
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,000
course because the server wasn't live

736
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,640
anymore but luckily shoden has a

737
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,020
historical search

738
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:58,559
which has less data and uh doesn't

739
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,960
actually capture things like banners

740
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,539
but it will show you a timeline of when

741
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:04,980
ports are open

742
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,760
and 3306 is the MySQL port and it was

743
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,960
opened in November 2017 bound

744
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,539
to the internet facing interface so with

745
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:17,760
internet accessible

746
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,559
they've remained open for a very long

747
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,960
time so we can see it was closed only in

748
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,700
March 19.

749
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,620
it's okay you have a MySQL portal open

750
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,080
to the Internet so what there's five

751
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,140
million of them who cares

752
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,260
um fair enough Security Professionals We

753
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,539
Care shouldn't do that unless you have

754
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:38,100
an absolutely good reason and no way to

755
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,679
get around it which you shouldn't even

756
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:42,899
have but if you've painted yourself into

757
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:44,779
the corner

758
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:48,120
architecturally then I guess yeah

759
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,520
but

760
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,260
I'm not sure what the 5 million excuses

761
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,539
are here

762
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:56,279
I'm not sure what the excuse was at

763
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:59,059
vastamo either

764
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,799
there was some discussion on why it was

765
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:02,880
opened

766
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,399
but those are probably things that will

767
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:07,799
become public later on

768
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,480
the next question is of course okay an

769
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,100
open port to the internet there's a

770
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,140
bunch of those is that a problem

771
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,140
well the problem was that the root

772
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,220
account

773
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,559
was available

774
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,360
would accept connections from the

775
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,360
internet and had no password set

776
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,419
because this is from vastavuda tar the

777
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:30,000
file that the attacker leaked and there

778
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,860
was a file called MySQL logins which had

779
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,080
2171 lines and each of those lines were

780
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,679
an IP address username and password

781
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:44,159
and with this patient registry database

782
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,720
server

783
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,940
we can see this line which just has a

784
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,980
blank password

785
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,600
found some evidence that the blank

786
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,760
password was there even from the

787
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,620
forensic investigation which was

788
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,260
difficult because of course what's a log

789
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,120
and why do I need it

790
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:04,158
so there weren't a lot of those

791
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,720
but yeah the stories you've heard about

792
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,820
the default password that's not actually

793
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,799
true they did not have a default

794
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,000
password Here

795
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,960
they had no password

796
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,899
so we did the investigation and

797
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:22,200
identified at least two unauthorized

798
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,240
accesses

799
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,299
one in December 18 another one on March

800
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:28,740
19.

801
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,179
let's just call them breach one and

802
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:34,039
preach two just to make this simple

803
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,899
it was made more difficult than it

804
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:39,419
should have been just by the fact that

805
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:41,159
there were no logs it was just a couple

806
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,860
of weeks back some some programs had

807
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,140
more logs so we could look back at the

808
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,299
times of some of these events but there

809
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,460
was no really really no let's say

810
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,200
centralized logging structure that we

811
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,179
could go to to see what kind of access

812
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:57,779
there has been to this MySQL account

813
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:00,840
server sorry and there's there was a lot

814
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,419
of obstacles there but we could really

815
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:07,260
recover any any signs of activity other

816
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,120
than a login

817
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,880
and then an exit for the December 18

818
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,260
access

819
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,019
but March 19 was something

820
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:18,899
actually had an effect on vastama's

821
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:19,679
business

822
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,960
because it was a drive-by extortion

823
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,880
at that time there was somebody who was

824
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,860
active doing this drive-by extortions

825
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,240
they would go to Showdown or whatever

826
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,840
and scan a bunch of mysqls and then try

827
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,460
to log into those using default

828
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,220
credentials like prudentials spraying

829
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,559
and stuffing and all that stuff brute

830
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,059
forcing their way in and when they

831
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,860
managed to get in they would drop the

832
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,159
tables and re leave a message called

833
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,220
please read me xmg

834
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,799
and that message

835
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,899
could be found on a bunch of people this

836
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:53,940
is somebody on GitHub complaining about

837
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,760
the fact that their database is lost

838
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,980
and this is the exact same message that

839
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,720
we found

840
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,320
had appeared on vastama server on the

841
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,580
15th of March in 19.

842
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,918
so of course when your database

843
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:13,619
gets dropped your web application starts

844
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:16,139
malfunctioning and that is something

845
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,760
that usually

846
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,280
alerts the system administrators to do

847
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,379
something so they realize that this

848
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:23,699
thing is going on

849
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:26,099
they rebuilt the server they just kind

850
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:28,440
of they have backups thank God so they

851
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,980
well yeah thank God

852
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,199
and they recreated the database and then

853
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,179
they realized that their MySQL port is

854
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,099
open to the Internet so they close it as

855
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:40,739
we could see on the see on The Showdown

856
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:43,679
slide March 15th

857
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,020
after that Showdown doesn't see that

858
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,359
it's open anymore and they add some

859
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:49,918
security software

860
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,379
and do some basic hardening

861
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:54,780
so after that point in time it wasn't

862
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,200
World accessible anymore but the problem

863
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,140
is that neither of these attacks Point

864
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,560
towards Ransom man or the attack that

865
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,260
yielded him the database there was still

866
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,720
an open question that when did the data

867
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,119
leak because the server held no clues

868
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,200
for that

869
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,260
but we had a couple of outside data

870
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,579
sources

871
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:19,980
the most important of them was ISP net

872
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,940
flow

873
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,579
which we could see a large Spike going

874
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:26,760
into a Swedish IP address owned by the

875
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,880
mulova VPN service provider so that's

876
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,099
suspicious

877
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:35,880
and also thanks to ransomman being a

878
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,940
klotz we also had the patient database

879
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,260
that he had

880
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,480
at least the text files that he ran from

881
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,760
it and we could do a correlation and see

882
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,400
what are the latest

883
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,520
patient registry entries in the database

884
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,859
and they happen to coincide with this

885
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,780
bike to Malvern VPN

886
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,599
so putting one plus one together

887
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,480
I think it's likely the most likely time

888
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,940
that this attack happened

889
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,320
was in

890
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,520
2018 by the end of the year

891
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,440
and Technical root cause is a

892
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,300
misconfigured server

893
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,760
that's it basically there's like that

894
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,000
was the Magnificent bustamo hack

895
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,400
this is why he's being called

896
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,380
hacker genius

897
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,460
it's ransomman

898
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,280
I don't agree but you know this kind of

899
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,560
stuff happens this is pretty

900
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,200
pretty standard stuff in a lot of small

901
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,880
and middle-sized companies which first

902
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,160
time wasn't really at that point but you

903
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,880
know there is a lot of talk and theories

904
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,660
of why the server was misconfigured

905
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,760
I have no idea

906
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,400
not gonna let's say entertain any of

907
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,260
those theories because that's really

908
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,420
beyond what I know about this case or

909
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,700
are even interested in taking part on

910
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,220
but maybe it will become public at some

911
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,599
point maybe there's a police

912
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:02,220
investigation that really gets to the

913
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,560
bottom of this maybe there's a root

914
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,839
cause for it other than just

915
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:10,920
incompetence or a mistake

916
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,260
but yeah there you have it that was the

917
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,040
reason

918
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,780
of course about the the question is

919
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,940
always about regulation like surely

920
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,740
there's regulation you just can't put

921
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:23,579
all of this uh mental nuclear stuff into

922
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:25,320
a database and then just have it open to

923
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,579
the internet that nobody's going to

924
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,619
intervene but that's the finished person

925
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:30,119
and you're thinking that the authorities

926
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:32,400
have got your back whatever happens they

927
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,720
don't

928
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,060
the regulation

929
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,240
splits into two parts is category a and

930
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,880
category B and category a is when you

931
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,720
connect

932
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,480
your software to the National

933
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,900
patient registered database called kanta

934
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,000
which is

935
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,060
which is actually quite

936
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,280
regulated there needs to be a data

937
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,079
security audit you need to get a

938
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,420
certificate you need to have testing you

939
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,359
need to make sure that everything is

940
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,940
compatible with Conta and your systems

941
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,760
need to be secured basically before you

942
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,859
can actually access that

943
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:13,980
a category B is for

944
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:18,060
things like appointment booking which is

945
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,220
technically patient data because it has

946
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:23,820
times of appointments and stuff but it

947
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,000
is not as hardly regulated as systems

948
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,220
that directly connect to contact

949
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,680
and the problem that vastamo had at this

950
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,720
time was that there was no specific

951
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:38,099
regulation on psychiatric therapy notes

952
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:42,300
and they were trying to get something

953
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,079
from the authorities some kind of a

954
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,700
understanding of how they should treat

955
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,440
this kind of stuff because a lot of

956
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,020
patients did not want their notes in

957
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,119
contact alongside all of their other

958
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:55,920
information so that their general

959
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,320
practitioner could go and read about

960
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,900
their psychiatric problems

961
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,020
so the there was a

962
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,880
it's a very deep subject I'm not going

963
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,220
to go further into it but let's just say

964
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,260
this was just this was not their choice

965
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,480
by default they didn't just go let's go

966
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,960
with category B and YOLO and whatever

967
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,240
so but this was not directly connected

968
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,820
system so it had its own database

969
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,260
and

970
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,060
didn't generate documents that are

971
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:27,060
stored in contact no need to audit it

972
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,700
technically risk assessments auditing

973
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,520
all of this stuff is done for a company

974
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,540
like that they had

975
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,640
uh authorities and come and check that

976
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,400
they have the correct amount of fire

977
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,740
extinguishers and there are the exits

978
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,480
are not blocked and that they have the

979
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,880
brochures both in Finnish and Swedish

980
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,000
but nobody scanned their mysqls to see

981
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,119
if the ports open for example or try to

982
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:55,980
do a penetration testing

983
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,079
that's just not part of auditing in this

984
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,560
kind of a thing

985
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,900
so that's that's basically it that that

986
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,839
is the hack in the nutshell

987
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,579
of course it brings us back to the

988
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:13,260
thought that

989
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,440
data is really not just data because

990
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,859
when you read like press loves numbers

991
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:21,720
and when they can tell you that there's

992
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,320
a 300 million personal files of uh

993
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,839
dentist appointments lost on the

994
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,599
internet that's one thing but numbers

995
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:32,760
never really grasp

996
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,980
what that data is because if it's your

997
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,060
phone number and a date like who cares

998
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,220
but in this case the numbers were both

999
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:44,099
high but the quality of the data what

1000
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:45,720
the data was

1001
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,780
just people's Secrets basically

1002
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,540
and um

1003
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,579
it's just really hard to kind of wrap

1004
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:54,780
your head around this because this

1005
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,280
turned out to be the biggest crime in

1006
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,140
Finland

1007
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,799
to date hopefully

1008
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,320
to the ages but

1009
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,040
we'll see

1010
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,119
act three is a

1011
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:14,040
catharsis

1012
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:18,540
refers to the purifying element of going

1013
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,119
through large emotions

1014
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,800
it's also

1015
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,099
usually the part of play where the

1016
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:28,200
tragic end happens

1017
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,119
and when I made this presentation this

1018
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:32,099
actual version two

1019
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:34,079
the situation was different than what it

1020
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,180
is today I'm not sure this fits fully

1021
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,660
but I'll let you be the judge of it

1022
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,820
but the whole point of this why what

1023
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,560
happened with vastamo is that they dealt

1024
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,520
in Trust

1025
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,460
because the trust was essentially

1026
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,320
what made the therapeutic relationship

1027
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,320
work what made it possible for you to

1028
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,300
actually go through

1029
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,300
the process that helps you

1030
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,240
and that trust was broken so it was

1031
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,920
quite obvious that the business can't

1032
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,720
withstand that

1033
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,960
so it took four months

1034
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,599
from the hack for vastama to file for

1035
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:14,640
bankruptcy

1036
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,740
just four months that's not a very long

1037
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:18,960
time if you think that they had the

1038
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,780
business idea in 2008 and grew the

1039
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,579
business

1040
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:25,740
actually quite a sustainable way over

1041
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:28,079
the years and they they all had hundreds

1042
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,480
of people working for them and then in

1043
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,579
just four months it's all gone just like

1044
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:34,200
that

1045
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,599
somebody forgot to set the good password

1046
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:39,060
for the root account or whatever the

1047
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,040
reason is

1048
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,200
that's kind of amazing because we've

1049
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,480
seen a lot of big companies

1050
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,300
get breached and you can see their stock

1051
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,339
prices go down a bit and then

1052
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:52,920
everybody's like hey so what and goes

1053
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,760
back up

1054
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,980
usually a bit higher than it was before

1055
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,319
it must be all of those public messages

1056
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,180
how they take security and privacy

1057
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,579
seriously that they always send after a

1058
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:04,640
hack

1059
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,000
wasn't that lucky

1060
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:10,560
the data protection officials in Finland

1061
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,960
of course took an interest

1062
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,720
and they find sanctioned

1063
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,060
sure which one is the right word here so

1064
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,560
I'll say them both

1065
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,740
timer for 608 thousand

1066
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,180
euros

1067
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,880
and once when they did this

1068
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,460
they used the next report extensively to

1069
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,740
justify it and that is where most of it

1070
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,560
is readable you can go to finnlex and

1071
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,380
find the whole thing it's very long but

1072
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,180
if you're into legalese and you've got

1073
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:41,099
like four hours and a couple of good

1074
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:42,960
beers

1075
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,579
um go for it and go read it it's

1076
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:47,720
actually quite interesting

1077
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,440
of course

1078
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,599
there's a complicating factor in Terra

1079
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,099
as we remember

1080
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:55,079
both the majority share of Boss Tamil

1081
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:56,700
but they disputed the sale of those

1082
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,240
shares because they said

1083
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,040
and I'm not sure

1084
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,160
what's factual here because there are

1085
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,140
claims made both ways but they say that

1086
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,720
Villa Tapia was aware of the March 15th

1087
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,880
hack not the boss tomoh hack but the

1088
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,400
March 15th hack at the time that they

1089
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,400
did the trade he disputes that he says

1090
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,359
that he was not told

1091
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,579
it's not really for me to say it's still

1092
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:26,460
an ongoing thing uh the Press has been

1093
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,800
at least misleading in this because at

1094
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,500
least based on my information

1095
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,980
it's not final and uh

1096
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,079
there are still disputes ongoing

1097
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,359
and then in August 21 just to show that

1098
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:43,740
there is no limit

1099
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,200
to what

1100
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,000
Psychopathology is freely expressed over

1101
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,180
the Internet somebody sets up a search

1102
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,500
engine

1103
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,500
for all of the patient files and puts it

1104
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,740
on tour and then gets a finish domain

1105
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,839
address to point towards it

1106
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:02,880
just lowering the barrier of getting

1107
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,800
access to all of that information that's

1108
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,140
supposed to be private

1109
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,579
because at this point it had been

1110
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:10,859
popping up here and there and the big

1111
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:12,240
worry was that the social security

1112
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,240
numbers could be used for identity theft

1113
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,640
of course that was the worry for those

1114
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,200
people who didn't really talk about

1115
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,880
anything that sensitive with the

1116
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,540
therapists but for all of those lucillus

1117
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,819
who want to go and put their neighbor's

1118
00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:28,140
name there and see if they have some

1119
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:32,700
dark secrets some put this up

1120
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,099
this was actually on and off online on

1121
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,920
the Tor address for quite a while

1122
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,319
and the Press helped get it publicity by

1123
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:42,960
actually writing

1124
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,220
an article about it

1125
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,079
the CEO of vostomo

1126
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,839
who I rank among one of the main victims

1127
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:56,280
of this whole crime

1128
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,319
of course as the CEO of this kind of a

1129
00:45:58,319 --> 00:45:59,579
company

1130
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:03,000
with big reward comes big risk was it

1131
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,980
the other way around but anyway

1132
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,260
he was ultimately responsible to make

1133
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:08,880
sure that the trust that the patients

1134
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,720
placed on the company

1135
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,460
was

1136
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:15,839
handled carefully

1137
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,060
there has been a lot of discussion about

1138
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,700
who did what who knew about what what

1139
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,339
did the system admins do what did Villa

1140
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:27,359
do a bunch of it has been hashed out

1141
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:30,300
in the press and just I don't even know

1142
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,440
what to

1143
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,480
what to make of it because there's a lot

1144
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,060
of information that I know

1145
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,760
is probably not accurate

1146
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,380
but anyway

1147
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,300
in September

1148
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,460
really is indicted

1149
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,800
and the systems administrators were also

1150
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,359
investigated

1151
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:50,640
but no charges were brought against them

1152
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,859
the two people who were responsible for

1153
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:55,740
Securities uh maintaining the server

1154
00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:00,859
which I would argue includes securing it

1155
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,200
22 000 criminal complaints was the

1156
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,140
number that I found in the newspaper

1157
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,880
previously I had 25

1158
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,740
000 here I'm not sure if that's accurate

1159
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,200
either but whatever

1160
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,740
the number is this is still the biggest

1161
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,060
individual crime that has happened in

1162
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,920
Finland when you count the number of

1163
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,240
victims

1164
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,119
and well this being the digital leap of

1165
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:28,200
course upscaling things is easy

1166
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,760
but this

1167
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,160
just

1168
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,960
well yeah I have a small background in

1169
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,460
law enforcement I used to be a police

1170
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,260
officer for a couple of years I'm

1171
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,880
increasingly embarrassed to bring it up

1172
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,160
but it's relevant here because the

1173
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,619
system that was used back then

1174
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:47,099
defile criminal reports still the same

1175
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:49,740
it's not good it's manual

1176
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,740
so I really felt for the guys for having

1177
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,920
to feed 22 000 criminal complaints into

1178
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,720
that system I'm not sure they might have

1179
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,819
changed it I don't get an update when

1180
00:47:59,819 --> 00:48:00,839
they do

1181
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:03,599
but if it's still the same thing I would

1182
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,720
count the investigators

1183
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,619
as among the victims of this crime

1184
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:13,079
and they were expected to receive less

1185
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:14,940
than a thousand Euros per person for

1186
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:17,640
damages because the company is bankrupt

1187
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,640
doesn't exist anymore and it has a lot

1188
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,780
of debt

1189
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,880
and in bankruptcy you settle your debts

1190
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,280
and whatever is left you know what

1191
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,680
happens with that but when you have more

1192
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,859
debt than collectors then cash reserves

1193
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:33,780
basically that just means you're not

1194
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,640
going to pay all your debts and you're

1195
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,839
not going to pay

1196
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:39,859
damages either

1197
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:43,079
and it's it gets

1198
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:45,660
pretty quiet of course the national

1199
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,900
discussion over data security and data

1200
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,819
protection and all of this and

1201
00:48:50,819 --> 00:48:53,520
legislation and auditing and all this

1202
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,099
kind of continues during this time but

1203
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,020
the thing I'm watching for is like when

1204
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,880
when do they catch the guy

1205
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,560
because I want to know when they catch

1206
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,240
the guy because that is what really

1207
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,680
interests me because I want to put a

1208
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:07,578
name on the nemesis

1209
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,420
because even if

1210
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,400
people don't think about it as a story

1211
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,859
this is a story and when you don't have

1212
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:16,619
a proper bad guy in a story The Nemesis

1213
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:18,480
then you're gonna just put somebody in

1214
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,400
there this way kind of psychologically

1215
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,520
we need to see a bad guy in everything

1216
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,319
you need to just have somebody to blame

1217
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:27,420
so a lot of that blame was placed on

1218
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:30,000
Villa tapio personally on vastama as a

1219
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,760
company and Ransom Man became almost

1220
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,500
like this uh Sideshow comical figure

1221
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,400
like uh

1222
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,560
not even a real person

1223
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,200
I just wanted to put a name on it just

1224
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,579
to see who it is

1225
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:47,220
I took them two years with periodical

1226
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:50,240
updates of police being very close to

1227
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,020
catching him

1228
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:56,579
and in November 2022 the Police Issue a

1229
00:49:56,579 --> 00:49:58,500
European arrest warrant for a 20 year

1230
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,400
old Finnish man

1231
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,560
which was expected

1232
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,450
not yet next slide

1233
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:11,339
[Laughter]

1234
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:14,640
anyway I made the conscious decision not

1235
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,859
to name any names here

1236
00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:19,319
on this issue because

1237
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:22,560
on the court of public opinion

1238
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:26,040
the person was judged already

1239
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,960
and uh

1240
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,599
still a suspect like to remind everybody

1241
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:32,460
of the fact that

1242
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,640
we live in a lawful society and somebody

1243
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,040
is charged and then they're found guilty

1244
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,759
at a court of law

1245
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:43,740
the other reason is that if he did it I

1246
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,240
don't want to just give him the glory of

1247
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,520
saying his name out loud on stage but

1248
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,559
two weeks ago he was arrested in France

1249
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:51,420
and is currently waiting transportation

1250
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:54,079
to Finland

1251
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,119
he has not contested that

1252
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,220
so we'll see what happens because I

1253
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:00,900
really can't wait for the trial I want

1254
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,819
to see what happens in that and I hope

1255
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:06,900
that the police have a very solid case

1256
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,359
and then we see Justice Done in this

1257
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,460
situation because

1258
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,859
all of the victims all of the tens of

1259
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:15,480
thousands of people

1260
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,700
who had their privacy broken and

1261
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,900
violated

1262
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:24,000
by this callous and uncaring individual

1263
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,559
really deserve that closure

1264
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,640
that's it

1265
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,940
I won't take any questions because

1266
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,880
I'm not sure I have the answers if I do

1267
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,160
just rather come talk to me privately if

1268
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,020
you have something you want to say thank

1269
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,460
you very much for listening to this case

1270
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,780
I hope you learned something new today

1271
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,470
and enjoy disobey

1272
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:52,140
[Applause]
