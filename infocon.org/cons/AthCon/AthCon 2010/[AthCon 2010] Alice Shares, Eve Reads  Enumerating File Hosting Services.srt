1
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:03,919
so

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,730
I financing for example you're not
tonight

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,750
I PG students

4
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:15,620
in Hamilton I'm going those signatures
foreign languages is seeing the first

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,109
class

6
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,720
and sometimes a likable littlest and
this is one of these times

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,300
so that I don't know his shares

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,439
deliveries integrating my witnesses and
for those of you that don't know I was

9
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,429
being serious is

10
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:34,809
our services wind in which are usually
says he will say

11
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:38,670
and you just can't go I don't know their
files shipmates

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,800
with other users so the other than 100

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,270
is more or less this I'll talk a little
bit about two hours

14
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,890
what it is vehicle specific about what
they say this is how they wear

15
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,410
how they generate a lens that the
binding files

16
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:58,899
the usual blows and the the privacy
issues behind these services

17
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:03,390
I will vote was feeling great and then
that is actually quite easy

18
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,270
with the results and how these results a
securities

19
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:11,080
and they wouldn't do it so

20
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,380
I'm guessing you'll hear does the clouds
you know it's

21
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,509
the coolest thing that people needed a I

22
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:21,159
doubt it is very clear that everyone is
a distinct and in the last %uh couple

23
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,130
years

24
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,689
alls companies have started the lighting
things on the go out so you have

25
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:31,430
I'm storage and as I love you have sold
well as a series on the ballot

26
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,860
you have banking on the cloud you have
been working on the cloud everything is

27
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,479
on the lower

28
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,270
and they should be able to recognize
some is those like

29
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,430
back on my which is a lot simpler look
at what size

30
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,479
iraqis is a space by like to be in which
are

31
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,710
I'll filehosting services and with more
detail

32
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,070
Amazon Web Services and so on so

33
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,180
essentially what daisy's share resources
on-demand

34
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,729
it's great you know for startup
companies that just started high school

35
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:01,560
ATM

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,890
but here's another interested in
investing don't mind I hardly know mind

37
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,509
their own data storage centers

38
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:11,930
buying their own that movie goers little
they just want to employ ASE

39
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:17,580
words and get my know that so I'm class
saying resources

40
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,300
that I shared among many users and they
have this pay as you go style so

41
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,390
sign up for the service and use a little
bit you may if his morning maybe more

42
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,739
so it's really great for startups and

43
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:35,420
no storage needed no I don't know if
they sell the Holy Lands

44
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,760
coming to ladies but there's no denying
that beautiful private data

45
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,970
because once you lose control of your
data want to send them away then you're

46
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,470
not really sure what happens then

47
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,769
you know you just hope that they're
taking a relief to know their backing of

48
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:53,950
that they're giving them secure the
potential and these are old

49
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,900
real problems so I we already have some
estimates

50
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,440
for example data losses in 2007 I

51
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,599
said last flowers just announced the

52
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,269
several customers that soaring we'll ask
you to navigation data

53
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:14,050
and you know the nation was the there
was some growing anger and

54
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,080
we really have no one to blame because
hearing that

55
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,310
and then 2009 even worse you have

56
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,510
mike says he's parading the biosafety

57
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,870
just lost I also today the dow over

58
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,540
well as its predecessors SMS's calendars
binges

59
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,790
fundamentals what have you and resonated
these are not feeling is it is but

60
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,950
this is hale and hearty where we're
going to have to let you put in anything

61
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:40,599
without

62
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:44,470
not going to hide his and eight how the
speakeasies which they have

63
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:48,819
on their offices and every knowing that
you will be able to go through the

64
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:49,459
office

65
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:53,010
and then if thats which means just
freely everyone

66
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,459
so let me say this is W

67
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,799
as cloud storage for the classes because
it's been out there

68
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,840
for at least five years starting rights
here can you use it without really

69
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,670
thinking about

70
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:08,920
so although there are also a lot of
people still looking at least four weeks

71
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:14,209
like I their over it may be an ongoing
success

72
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:18,699
ass old you know a lot you just got in
the way of saying I'm not allowed to get

73
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:20,769
away and you should update your address

74
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,320
and their use both for sharing the
public and private class

75
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,650
and that they have been great success
because they

76
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,020
people feel it basically means that
users happened that's the need to share

77
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,850
and people that you have other means
shares as I

78
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,639
be in a few minutes but is it was for
like this

79
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,780
I negotiated you send miles I

80
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,650
everyone I only know one you can say it
was just a couple of people who is this

81
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,229
is basically saying just forget about
this with your friends

82
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:52,220
initiate we have a lot of that was
connected on this time it was when I

83
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,690
don't mind why it was going toward

84
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,990
so I already know this but the

85
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,120
this more they say heading over to your
house hey we're

86
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,160
he just go to the website is I use a
wellington-based known in da Luz

87
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,440
drive is a mess and so on usual I love
you out notices

88
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,419
and anything the say race put it
somewhere without you knowing where

89
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:22,460
and it is OK in binding to the finally
the size of the file

90
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,530
and it is still going to the user you
are a little

91
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,259
and depending on whether the

92
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:32,919
files are private about me what happens
to the best

93
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:36,169
I Italy huber's so

94
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,990
it's going to be nothing so it's so and
loneliness and he is something I did or

95
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:41,410
not

96
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,509
people posting some web-sites that most
important thing for spam

97
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:51,479
on their social profiles they generally
most and where they have his practice

98
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:52,320
today they said

99
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,590
throughout 2011 I think singers

100
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,630
email I am coastal regions

101
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,780
doesn't matter just 11 so

102
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,449
I privacy you is the levees even a
single

103
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,630
sees most of them are based not on its
axis they cannot

104
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,169
give you privacy and unprotected miles
based on your account

105
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:16,150
so it was a losing you does your images
generate so is

106
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,479
and they are not denying that his
services are not searchable

107
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,600
so unless you have someone Gaby

108
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,000
you know that you are a little while you
can I dont know that I'll

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,750
and this is what I want to challenge
today that this is not true

110
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,250
and was enough so for their service

111
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,660
conference I created the done by local

112
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:43,199
often does it i jus a popular about what
they say this is from Google

113
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,270
and I have no that allows twice so in
the first column

114
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:51,590
I have done because I don't know what
happened as they just want to let me

115
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,220
just say

116
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,919
CNN via postings there is one too late
and then you have the first goal in the

117
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:57,819
second load

118
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:01,099
and if we think you know a day

119
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:04,169
this is the first one you can see that
the sixties

120
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:07,349
I 3 7-6 5 6-7

121
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:10,440
on the same and he will be there if I

122
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,210
you will see that they're actually
special and the reason why have they are

123
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,400
so far parties because this is all here
that

124
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,990
in the few seconds but it's okay to not
lose my living alone again

125
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,970
a least 100 people ability that allows
got the

126
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,380
intermediate days if you look at the
second one

127
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,680
it doesn't sequential ladies they just
they have

128
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,250
I shorter I fired by using also
characters is that they're just numbers

129
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,259
I 3 floral I had the same

130
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:45,460
sequential though is and they have six
and seven which appears to be random

131
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,810
and I have increases morning these
because I well

132
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,150
I didn't mean to and the last one is
just amazing one

133
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,940
that he just a this is just crossed a
special the bio

134
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,490
saying she has nice the was remaining
anything by already exists

135
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,479
without violating just putting on this
board and an incremental number

136
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,340
so going to litigate raising that
something is wrong with the

137
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,509
first five in the last one and some
people will think at this point that

138
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:13,590
okay you have

139
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:17,270
sequential I you know and he's but lose
their filings

140
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:21,139
so you cannot access the right and I'm
saying wrong

141
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:26,030
because in the eye with the morning if I
only the first posing serious inquires

142
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,870
I the filename in the AM Best all the
other one just putting their horniness

143
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,919
services because they know that most
people don't know if I'll similar to

144
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,899
share them

145
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:37,919
you know that within web sites and such
there

146
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,940
company so when you sitting I Google

147
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,890
we're not going to see you land and you
will do it was these days but they're

148
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,580
actually not requiring and

149
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,570
indicating West to get the file so

150
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,200
you can get hit by a bus just thinking
about providing sequential numbers

151
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,500
and this can be generalized nice
predictability

152
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,209
if they told me that I signed by I was
he saying something that will

153
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,730
than the attack and stuff about me so im
and that's not get anything out about to

154
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:07,330
exit

155
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,720
came shouldn't have access to and these

156
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,940
can you can access to tens of millions
of class

157
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,110
and not to lose losses we chose a
Sicilian 3

158
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,110
believe is border and

159
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,339
you know it sideways I file this was a
lot lately

160
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:29,910
extracting wind is what it was about 18
as a sideline

161
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:34,140
and it was another 1980 and this is in
the order these

162
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,399
and basicity the same just create
another thing that you know is that this

163
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,769
is like the one you bring some

164
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:44,720
going down like happiness and delight
and you can see that he's

165
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,330
eighty because you have on than others

166
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,800
and eight characters in the morrow said:
so you have

167
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,670
and not the space more than 600 million
miles away where you downloaded without

168
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,930
having an original access to them and

169
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,100
yeah I just started reading then we
created the

170
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,800
just the to the gym to outsource so the

171
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,920
problems in mind we have nothing nice to
say they're like yeah this is

172
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,760
and that we will be set on the main page
unless so that we wouldn't get at least

173
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,170
and because they say this as a lawyer
are request to leniently we

174
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,700
pencil in the midwest so we could always
for days without getting let me say that

175
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,589
you're not getting any plans

176
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:32,019
so using this method and a steal a

177
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:35,690
you can get from Hawaii 08648

178
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:39,500
it's payday is a this so using it to

179
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,820
I was is that you know i think is to MSP

180
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:47,209
with you will hold you to hear a
selection you can get access

181
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:52,170
to more than 16,000 file a respirator
day

182
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,500
and the anything about it the PBA for us

183
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,980
is that all the services provided by
owning and bioscience before downloading

184
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,029
them I'll

185
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:05,420
so you can just right down to the file
extension is violating the size and then

186
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,410
you can just download which everyone's

187
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:11,670
you think there's anything go to lunch
you actually want

188
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,279
so I I'm these landings 1 I'm just
having his knee

189
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,720
all the output in the first photo you
see the

190
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,410
decreasing I dolenz the second goal is
the

191
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:26,390
I'll filing extension and the last one
is the size

192
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,550
and what I get my amazing things we're
not really

193
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,810
interested in modeling stuff you know
this is just by reading about you can

194
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,800
find it using Google already

195
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,029
but whatever it is that easy private
things that people share using 11

196
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:43,279
emails and IM's and they were not meant
for them to the money they were not

197
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,230
meant for us

198
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,140
to ask them so I like it

199
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,810
I say last and the last one and you can
see that we're talking about a document

200
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,100
NJ and most people realize that

201
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,709
Beijing bank stocks with the SC which is
the underlying

202
00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:03,670
I'm prepping stuff the single sign-on
bonus pools

203
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:08,690
on Monday pictures so it is something to
his family is about whatever

204
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:13,110
share it with people who have their and
we not just sleazy we should have

205
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,870
and just be the same and not now we're
getting axis killed

206
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,079
spaces just two days

207
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,139
so we're going to close hundreds of
thousands

208
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:27,010
already in the media is all files and
it's just too much stayed in order to go

209
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:27,959
then you know just

210
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:32,980
by hand so we decided the we need an
automatic thing and we're just focusing

211
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,260
lady and

212
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,250
I in May 20 means for either did not
think

213
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,579
he was just upload it and then post
these are

214
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:44,620
URL somehow or someway cezanne whenever

215
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,829
so if you search for that I and you will
find you will get a search results

216
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:52,170
but he says we didn't get zero it means
i think is right

217
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,730
and is what we do we chose this sexy
where

218
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,450
up my privacy classification engine and
for all their whole article by records

219
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,120
which is

220
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,959
wearing Shaz and checking this is us

221
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,980
and this is the results are 0 it means
that I was private

222
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,260
so was I doing with Google think when
you got this

223
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,500
and used Apple which provides a GI and
they gave us

224
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,959
by 2020 spend a so

225
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,990
I getting access a federal appeals
16,000 miles

226
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:27,570
and being muslim-dominated I 2011 Verde

227
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:31,899
so I from when we stop this pain when we
had all

228
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:36,490
400,000 and its allies so from then we
will do once

229
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,709
that we knew that they would crap so we
moved up

230
00:13:39,709 --> 00:13:44,019
and agrees with the routes leading with
excess and things like that

231
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:47,240
and from those arrest me just getting
them

232
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,350
in Arlington I justification engine

233
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,449
and we find out that one in my eyes
private in the sense that

234
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:57,930
today no search results and what with
its pilots

235
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,680
it uses as in the 1i showed you idiot
when documents

236
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,389
there was precious though he teaches
people how their website by uploading

237
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:10,279
PHP cold to my what he says is

238
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:13,670
anywhere is then uploaded on from the
MySQL

239
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,579
so is well baskets tables organization

240
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:21,110
the Holy is waiting people you know last

241
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,250
and I'm getting actually not

242
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:30,290
yeah so people that I we also the sex
education hope to adopt and my eyes

243
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,899

then you're going down to je ne sais

244
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:36,350
PDAs and so on

245
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,820
and in order to I

246
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,320
find out is what we gonna let me
download it was actually probably just

247
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,100
chill 1

248
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,949
which shows the first 100 greatest from
means by like

249
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:52,149
and he saw the we like you know that and
we like to inspect them

250
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:55,420
and how many many things in which these
are the most memorable

251
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:00,040
solely bombast statements transactions I
love my house

252

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,709
everything in it final density that
we're not expecting to find

256
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:21,300
process i put a lot of things that we
have been experiencing a basket

257
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,829
something doesn't go out in public and
this is the worst thing that should make

258
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:26,100
you feel uneasy

259
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,980
with mom doctors diagnose precise

260
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,529
leave that check up on case with metal
leashes

261
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:36,910
and you know they are reporting that a
and

262
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,290
once is on the same day business banking
agency and they are

263
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,949
fighting the computer and they sending
back documents containing the nose

264
00:15:43,949 --> 00:15:48,329
the and yes wanna hang well how these
subsidies

265
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:54,300
so you send it back I'm the documents
they sending mine was the same as

266
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,940

at the city's but he is getting where
Israel

268
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,350
was saying we don't these assets the
best guess and it is just waiting there

269
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,290

277
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,750
you can have serious scheme I know how
heated debate where is the final

278
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,839
yield s killed on my can just as long as
I have no problem I don't have to pack

279
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:39,959
and

280
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:45,060
you can have over their Spanish many
wondering what company exchanges you

281
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,410
know employees exchange data using my
what he says is

282
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,519
they just not into the rating getting
access to these files

283
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,899
and upgrading you know saying something
with his

284
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:58,940
features online are less than a minute
on the weather

285
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,600
and is that the that let's say that
something he always has and if I was he

286
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,699
said this is all down with a lot of
millions let's fix it

287
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:11,209
and that's not generating random doing
tomorrow what happens to me as well as

288
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:13,780
it out there that have a already dont

289
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:18,610
to sequentially these they always have
going on today it was mostly set design

290
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:19,620
on those

291
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:24,750
and you know that I am for the fight
what he says is ideally

292
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:28,600
millions of miles and you don't pay
their ass of your customers

293
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,590
or keep them in just the second and i
cant get my money the second one

294
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,070
but that is what companies will do so

295
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,660
is me towards the end and I say

296
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,220
by what he says is I really genuinely
useful and you must use it

297
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,960
choose one that generates his thought is
that appear on the new

298
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,190
so outlook will be done with my last
paycheck that dole's

299
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,429
any idea if they appear on that its
cleanup and

300
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:59,070
always always possible existing data you
already sending an email to your friends

301
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,190
from Dayton Daily

302
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:04,230
you know you're in my life you got my
