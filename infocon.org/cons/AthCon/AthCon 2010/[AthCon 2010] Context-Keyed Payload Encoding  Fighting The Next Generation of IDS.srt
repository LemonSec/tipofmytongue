%uh it was a very modern and a

32
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:10,020
if you have a hey this is this your
infrastructure

33
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,300

your says

36
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,150
for this last there's no lo not exploit
closely with this place just like that

37
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,420
but there is an explosive or I had no
service

38

00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:42,780
Georgia lewis structures

41
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,800
the pale as we say in this part of the
meal

42
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,800
when you come in every way russia over
200

43
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,819
the II places say it is only 10 oz is

44
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:55,920
I think like a man: worry whether it
will be Sunday

45
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,940
process when he hit the program

46
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,569
should be there for you sold what he
needs to do

47
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:05,860
he's tools everything you do lolol

48
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,780
especially program so that I S I

49
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,200
exiting his own stocks in the day
because something we don't know exactly

50
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,370
where this is a is this yeah

51
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,970
this exploding with that gave me man
wearing of the

52
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,879
but other locations we use it what is a
political statement said just

53
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,519
John construction sold we a point there
is an obvious

54
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:35,530
to any away with a lot of snow sled and
this was going to be sure to let me make

55
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:40,129
souls it's a big school today

56
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:43,780
exploits on the wire they are these

57
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,290
the first one is class this is what most
yeah

58
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,330
I yes hey what's up with you

59
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,599
they are actually leaving it for us
office a little soul

60
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,599
be settled like this they will be
looking for the knockout stages for the

61
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,230
partial

62
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,480
they don't ended for the internet access
and they have a large database of known

63
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,330
senior officials know mahler

64
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,959
and it will not stop on the wire call
okay so

65
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,290
this or the like business is slow this
also this research paper

66
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,549
call today mother this is the Wednesday

67
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:20,350

candidates really got the stuff that
doesn't have its election day it is

70
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,720
so the second school his allegation

71
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,840

96
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,919
because the police gold you think you'll
be okay with me

97

problem is is this

110
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,300
if you got to see the Calder for your
cell

111
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,759
all over your ass it works lol the
political soul

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,669
with the mass by a sequential basis idea
so let me in please

113
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:15,430
he's a man with a heart attack the
colder for your

114
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,750
forward-looking ksl and got away with it
I guess

115
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:24,220
pictures for signage letters as well as
the basic called it does a little less

116
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,270
now quotation michael okwu

117
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,349
for destruction but still have seen
their statistical properties

118
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:36,509
with the conical try that means that
including such a way to your cell

119
00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:40,669
that actually does like properties to
the top this minute payday

120
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:45,569
this calls plz it follows like
englishtext

121
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:49,530
souls and that's how they get away with
it trumpeting

122
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,750
they have a day I leave next sheets this
the %ah

123
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,470
too little to allay cabling for example

124
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:59,560
know all the most up-to-date analysis

125
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,860
this think sears is stopping yesterday

126
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,889
mystery here souls that analysis fails
to do anything but

127
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:10,639
days job Orleans Hornets lol sentencing
preview

128
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,300
the actual are totally selfless say it's
a

129
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,410
this cell it's going to be a bit so that
it doesn't look like there

130
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,860
but I i misses this is the relation

131
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,879
can actually find the in the memory all
be

132
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,470
secrets lol because Google actually
drugs lol

133
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,450
excited about this the action

134
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,979
so close with the lazy

135
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:40,800
okay he's got a very good sold

136
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,950
hey isn't coming to the support a lazy
finances

137
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:49,000
coming from the people who live there
the latest decision coming so they say a

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,800
fire

139
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,420
that this that's just the way it goes
boxes the actual a lot of what we sell

140
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,830
is going to be executed

141
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,959
now I'll I this minimally environment is
a problem

142
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,320
because the if this is a leotard oh yeah

143
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,660
the best all in some markets although
the bottle service

144
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,700
it's going to be to see the seller's
both did

145
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,570
this a little with the right role early
all the money must see

146
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,230
but what if there are probably the
environment

147
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,240
of the idea is so let the bass

148
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,910
connection now this is the one on this
team bailey's

149
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,120
this is yeah selling days the

150
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,810
Royals from this principle legacy

151
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:41,209
the main hey we're not going saying I
for example

152
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:45,140
I think so easy time dedication to your
cell it from the environment

153
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,430
a little holes that the basic a

154
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:53,450
now I'll one way of doing this

155
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:56,830
he said it was a memory-based she has to
say

156
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,980
his bias that colleague a specific

157
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,570
member litigation all the mothers roses
and you

158
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:08,140
as your early Christianity jazzy maybe
this will exploit

159
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,430
a forgettable yes ma'am %uh yeah they
say

160
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,120
process if I am selling a 16gb looks on
the stock

161
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,209
parliamentary that you may study as well
execution of the program

162
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:23,380
did you see those boxes as the crazy

163
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:27,029
see that has really something similar
for close

164
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:30,170
sold if we use this time probes

165
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,320
for our cold team we actually yes

166
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,700
a the bias that the other crosses
without

167
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,060
I specifically remember any and on the
money closed

168
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:45,820
well he didn't do this pulled over a lot
of Florida by any pockets

169
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:50,740
persons a is buying boxes because it's
it's like that uses

170
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,899
position to execute those stuff there's
a beautiful are they're all set

171
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,459
in the same and memories to YouTube or
less from their

172
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:02,220
love they're going to be I did not
settle for less

173
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,610
you know from the biodistribution
looking to buy you have you got to look

174
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,170
at the facts without

175
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,420
and was a show you how to change
actually

176
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,829
see for yourself to a but I have those
bites

177
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:18,399
a and the in you know that's the beauty

178
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,850
but this isn't used by my space layout
randomization

179
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:27,209
go to any issue this proceeded is the
base

180
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:32,320
official the CPU this is say sexy stars
cold sea buen

181
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,500
with you can use did information about
the aggressor

182
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,120
so little easier time to sell gold
desire

183
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,690
must-see end of the day and not allowed
to sell it to run

184
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,880
on another must-see production of it
also investigate

185
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,910
are ongoing it happened even the writing
portion okay

186
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:56,050
to UAB others including Christianity in
the papers

187
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:00,589
ensures I would be extended to include
it is believed

188
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:04,399
explosive election with users a a lot
richer

189
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,540
she uses you say a delay this is a
little

190
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,570
let everybody weeks of this information
and we use a

191
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:15,170
busy so that means you see this file
using the UAE

192
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,769
redesign a little holes well

193
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:23,810
if you have a million systems that
something is that doesn't mean the real

194
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,029
CPU

195
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:28,220
over a messy it uses the

196
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,610
so lead all anything this city is policy
visualization software

197
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,490
I was in line also there's ser lo those

198
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,730
can withstand the CPU solely to come in
the release of the new features

199
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:45,459
lol basically you need it was not
looking good missing you having

200
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:51,010
on the other said solo the other opposes
it generally icky

201
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,550
where Glee yeah this is a poster

202
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,829
actually I what they would be his

203
00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:01,110
listen i haven't. duffy's

204
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,139
there the process memory for some time

205
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:07,820
but to do it i mean the this is like it
at all

206
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,769
itself for political science sold

207
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:15,769
yeah I'm just so that it is this a prose

208
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:18,959
what does he say that it is the a

209
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,430
time this is the whole NASA you always
say

210
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,690
I third base yeah

211
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,760
and this doesn't feel shitty in only
this one will be using the sixty

212
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,680
LLC diabetes what you say are silly at
times final

213
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,579
for 18 hours you told after those 18
hours it's a little here little

214
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:41,899
creating one another seeing over whether

215
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:45,630
kidding I said yes the Bible all-time
leading wholesaler

216
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,690
or something but the most cases J

217
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:52,440
is so difficult for the day this is the
foliated

218
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,269
of course not the day it is caller ID s
into

219
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:02,930
collects easily I it's no problem for
ever since he is because

220
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,149
actually is forcing or figuring out what
to say

221
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:09,360
by those bees is another old

222
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,440
now this a are you oppose days to visit
today

223
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,180
we're using a data chrome and not from
the

224
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,690
filesystem a the secrecy

225
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,850
why because normally any ideas as they
are

226
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,970
assist on the play medieval times actual
classes

227
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,240
to the files servers the other day

228
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,639
so we can make on this key from
filesystem me that they not

229
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:38,540
like for example throwing a Hindu by you
of these that simple

230
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,880
the companies are the size of the file
and the last modification

231
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,920
classifications file

232
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,930
the size of the file because ps4
executions that is buying a market is

233
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,560
you know what vichy CEO I services not

234
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,970
then you know what the actual a pocket
what exercises file

235
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,120
is going to be also love you 55

236
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,690
forgive me systems in the lab the kids
and I am

237
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,980
okay with ladybug it maintains you have
the

238
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,740
as well as a weekday shortlist and
making texting

239
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,420
what happens if we start the fire that
we link that legally name

240
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,810
already well the same effect

241
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,889
as the previous example if the Denver
lazy yeah

242
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:24,130
where during school will not only be
able to exit is

243
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:27,600
it in time with the actual file is there
to you

244
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,899
also how to hold yeah I

245
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:35,889
okay this if you think so incriminating
is

246
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:39,579
I know this okay the sinuses

247
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:42,839
let me CK be CK be available to anyone

248
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,160
testers so who exactly will help us to
spread world

249
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,990
and it was a this it was a mistake that
doesn't have anything to do with us

250
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,540
so we need to receive email said you
would call it was kinda put together and

251
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,070
I know it

252
00:15:56,070 --> 00:16:00,360
extra cookies are generated by
acidification

253
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,820
with you its affiliates be a can you do
today

254
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,310
the actual used to be like hewlett are
sold a

255
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,769
hailing louise is this a guy with the
winky

256
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:15,380
and the exhibition it was a big issue
that said with another complex is on the

257
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,410
front gate

258
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,800
getting anymore but the this is Paul
example

259
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,230
will call you a lil rod it is it was
really

260
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,760
sorry

261
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,890
but she's so what happens now is it a
skimpy little

262
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,020
it was equally noxious you

263
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,180
64-bit using that they didn't he has
said

264
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,160
%uh you didn't call this didn't stop
this stuff is going to be used

265
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,620
runtime: immediately called your appeal
you include your appeal

266
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,820
using the key then just got from the

267
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:54,150
I tell me you didn't get to see you will
do these together

268
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:59,170
above the usual and that's the cell the
user doesn't get you some other process

269
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:03,360
to is the most startling although we do
see some the wheel doesn't involve many

270
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:03,960
disorders

271
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,839
is that we must be getting old so you
see a system for this is

272
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,339
it seems to be going by the misleading
voters unless we're starting to play it

273
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:15,600
so little this is the

274
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,360
a today the stuff for the CPU the hey

275
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,510
a holder I this is

276
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:27,550
hey let me just say that I would just
say that this just 50 is trusted allies

277
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:32,310
always be yourself old and I'll uses the
same he'll do it but you see you in the

278
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:32,970
beaches

279
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,580
and cleaning services as well this is
the

280
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,590
they sorters a face a today the total

281
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:45,160
this is the start of a skittle I'll

282
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:52,160
and I'm listening station day

283
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:57,159
I slowly I think it will be

284
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,440
for you I whether this is not to say
that a key

285
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,000
hey this is politics a both the City by
the Bay

286
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,590
sold for you I

287
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:14,340
extremists the also it's the elf warlock
was executed a lot

288
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,400
and he said because about this a or

289
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,990
yeah it seems like that's what the is so
loaded with an IDS

290
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,179
soul if I E

291
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:28,440
for example disease the only loses the

292
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,260
yeah Metasploit Haley 46a

293
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:40,260
with his itself with this issue so if I
got this too smart

294
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:56,730
take some time

295
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,750
closing but you can see here is the see
me on this one

296
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:08,390
the ski actually saw something
suspicious so if I it's a I

297
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,650
snorters this is actually found it a
little holes

298
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:17,020
take a a they say what we expect since
this is another

299
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,550
goals 50 for the day but a

300
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:24,100
sold a

301
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,920
missing all this with the got a 98
holiday and business policy

302
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,390
the leading the meeting got to see what
sort of I ask you

303
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:37,360
now this is

304
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,400
the same ASL old but hey it happens

305
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:47,400
slots

306
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:56,460
if you see here it says as you know
there's a there's like a

307
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,120
got a soul

308
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,620
coming we find this put a lot of which i
think is a 90 s

309
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,840
that is a violation I
