I'm time that some people

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,269
like they don't use them one of them

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,750

3 I something to some gas

13
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,430
things a before and there was a in well

14
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,820
shootings you might say that everyone
knows what a person is

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,980
I'm something a bunch of times his on
Sunday at 10 so that maybe this is world

16
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,770
class

17
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,829
mainstream so as we thought so we're

18
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:04,019
I'm going to basically I'm other videos

19
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,290
possible from the very very very
beginning to

20
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,860
to know basically for only the that time

21
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,780
same is the around 22 years old so I
asking too much

22
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,740
well has been it's been a little while
and during

23
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,150
da whole roses the whole time

24
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:26,820
this this what are the changes without
girls

25
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,880
bosnian I want the dollar rose

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,880
has become a bit more sophisticated and
time

27
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,690
I'm good this position gold

28
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,040
the fireplace I'm by the

29
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,740
over in this position and

30
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,870
closer to you the whole fucking

31
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:52,440
I'm to need from very very hard leather
and

32
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,020
trying to see how old and varies in
different states

33
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,370
and two periods %uh from the very early
days to

34
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,670
yes its I think this whether until

35
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,149
now and then you can to figure out what
sound

36
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:13,450
whether I'm how old the saying

37
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,870
industrial tightening was is going to go

38
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,360
so I'm going to talk a little bit first

39
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,430
above the very caring about the possible
I also

40
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,690
said Services Limited this is the first

41
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:34,100
Veterans Day seeing to something that
somehow the symbols

42
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,220
well solar surrounds order to

43
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,340
said what happens don't let me know in
the nineteen

44
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,490
83 nosing around Apple going to be when
they were

45
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,570
the spokesman McIntosh and

46
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:53,000
really cool story ASP I basically these
guys were very

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,410
I demo so there they do it

48
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,920
I mcintosh running

49
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,180
ultimately its initial actions by so
basically the voters

50
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,920
this program a we're going to see

51
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,310
defense into that system

52
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,560
so basically it's easy to use a phrase
says

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,090
menu or does the basically for

54
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,300
presentation focuses but then those guys

55
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,170
up with has been suspended $128k

56
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,750
members so many was really knowing that
this thing

57
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,900
was kinda important and

58
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,890
this is a little actually heard use this
very same thing

59
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,650
for 14 kinda I stress

60
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:45,060
and somewhere so basically what we're
going to do is he that

61
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,630
is not so the mini vans see how the
hissing reacts

62
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:51,950
so the only thing called him he was a
little later

63
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,020
basically a monkeying around only
impressing

64
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,550
I'm is proceeding on clinton home places

65
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:02,140
so so the this was the

66
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,860
first brothers prices for the same no
explicit

67
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:11,340
betty was a little first definitely the
justification for stressing that

68
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,530
first markings on it applications

69
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,299
and at the front put a buzzkill

70
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:22,390
this from the a someone that money
clearly only

71
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,990
Queens or 800 chose a the window so they
treated us like

72
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,599
into the special called my kidneys to
spur

73
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:35,050
cool override is able to stay here then
exit function

74
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,340
its I think so basically this is the
very early days

75
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,080
iPhones well another example

76
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,130
is the over

77
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,479
1988 and this is the first time

78
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,150
with turn passing was used it was just
by

79
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,320
but neither she was around possible so

80
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,860
you not only Wisconsin and was a

81
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,520
see by accessing the site means to

82
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,630
to students or course

83
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,919
and as early as you can see it all

84
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,510
on this later basically this is this is
a pretty

85
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,039
this proposal proposed to the students

86
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,390
basically says well the should be a tool
to

87
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:25,010
randomly generate some people's I

88
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:29,080
into an honorable universities its

89
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,410
is the first and the 10 photos

90
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,720
piercing 700 basically so basically

91
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,820
single its first generates and
afterwards

92
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,880
after asking hearing I'll quiet

93
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,099
the the world close 10 anything goes

94
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:50,950
this is really findings from the
visiting Russia

95
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,800
professor in the fall

96
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,879
28 she was but it was a motor to

97
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:59,899
the university's home hines apparently
was very

98
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:02,949
and stormy day because

99
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:07,209
rained in the world knows thing that I'm
Sony

100
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:10,869
County kind of on time really really
fast

101
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:13,990
hoping that they landed in the whole so
much noise

102
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:18,179
that basically the whole or in school
with is wrong this is a discussion

103
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:19,580
traditional and

104
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,990
he was released president actually that
vision failed

105
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,899
there's been some don't know if that's
how the whole thing study

106
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:31,790
so well

107
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,139
basically to sum up %uh went to eighty
Days

108
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:38,430
second the princes pros

109
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,520
as you can see this well this

110
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,860
like following many dollars's

111
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,910
basically what does the game alright

112
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,590
when I just don't think so I'm solar
service was

113
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,970
taking notes security-related was more
about

114
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:00,039
stability of the solar the stuff untill

115
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:05,350
facility with Wells I'm I up product
rule

116
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,410
this is probably busy I I'm

117
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,440
tells approach for sources

118
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,440
assessment and and also the reason was

119
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,700
was not security force to it was because
source

120
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,250
no such notice all that senator but
doesn't that is

121
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,880
believe it is he didn't know who it was

122
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,430
he says world and going to one of the
most

123
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:35,600
showing a Council

124
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,110
its forces so this belongs to a little

125
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:44,620
so to the bus to the president's so

126
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,770
very interesting info a 60-year-old

127
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:52,140
I quality

128
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:55,400
plant was the commercials

129
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,650
period and the holes

130
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:00,850
in it

131
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,360
1999 one totals

132
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,180
his a as the numbers

133
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,800
this everyone and tests

134
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,870
a says whereby fetuses applications

135
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,240
%uh without kinda trusted a didn't think
they were very

136
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,950
for alternatives for those time little
tough to know what it is

137
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,520
so basically what I think both of us in
the corporate world

138
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,570
has been about ten years this is not
already

139
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,229
runs I think one of the reasons why this
is so

140
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:38,650
over at the moment is because this

141
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,910
several grueling excellence

142
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:46,130
great too to nestle the resulting in
death

143
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,630
to basically was a very small amount

144
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,480
get answers souls was really more the
morphol

145
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,440
the souls home and yeltsin

146
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,990
this there is no going mean went
mainstream

147
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,160
we all love the overturn

148
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,000
you lots of people have developed advice

149
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,700
and us the businessperson president you
know

150
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:18,350
busing says most I'm amazing things
going on sector is

151
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,959
so it's simple approach

152
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,519
and this to code symbolizes

153
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:29,339
very versatile so the answer is

154
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:32,519
the Masters this some adjustments in the
Sony

155
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:36,059
president worsens what is certain is
becoming

156
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:39,999
is and home servicing the

157
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:43,040
government this clear dear a

158
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,600
trend

159
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,089
to was there celestial a mess and

160
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:55,569
well as the many things like Microsoft
Cisco love you

161
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:59,220
little around about the team's a

162
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,239
quite what happened and

163
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:05,319
it was interesting because he has been
I'm

164
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:08,540
just for many

165
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,170
technologies so not only with Rose it's
all about today's

166
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,119
holding the every single thing the says
data entry

167
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:21,480
and was being bussed some point history
and

168
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,699
if nobody have been very very soon goals

169
00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:30,980
well very very kind in the world then it
does become a bit more to do

170
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,139
physically the define same as

171
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:38,889
and providing I'll see you around the
world

172
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,949
unexpected and to system

173
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:45,089
and eventually be sable

174
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:48,299
protocol or file

175
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:52,569
or anything around called yeah I will

176
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,970
any late entries didn't change and

177
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:59,319
clean up first person to one of them is
Saints

178
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:03,009
as I think data I tumbling

179
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:06,350
slight intended and see what happens
clovis

180
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,439
its another roses generated know that
today

181
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:14,669
nato second was case going to be

182
00:11:14,669 --> 00:11:19,579
chosen well this and the trent

183
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:23,239
was a calls it was very fast and

184
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:27,360
an interesting basically this the

185
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,689
to meet stuffed into its basically if i
dont

186
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:33,709
about the mainland but also do

187
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:36,809
using up what's called exploratory
variances

188
00:11:36,809 --> 00:11:39,889
just identifying different fields with
friends

189
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:43,850
it's just like this and today but then
it believes that

190
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,129
chase the reaction from the tactics

191
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:50,579
program and indians

192
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:55,449
a according to you you know what this
cause a basically the whole state

193
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:59,429
mother them the way pass

194
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:03,949
min very very simple as you can imagine

195
00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:07,119
we're talking about solar and two
different approaches

196
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:10,579
goals want to vote levels its

197
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:14,029
sorry but you don't know how that goes
with wild

198
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:17,730
go this analysis on this disadvantages
of both

199
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,199
on basically sometimes we only have
black box approach

200
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:25,259
cuz dunno spose

201
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:29,169
this little do that so many times with
just one vote

202
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:33,079
considerable him and see how to

203
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:37,169
you some some examples I'm

204
00:12:37,169 --> 00:12:40,679
below the Mendoza

205
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:43,230
both over it

206
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:48,060
sometimes Houston because one think he's
going to increase

207
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:52,210
present something called as it is known
to the

208
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,360
to people for many many reasons may be
because

209
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,990
to relinquish his parental may be there
his

210
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,720
something that that Israel be programmed

211
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,230
like balls with white bow sandal you
have

212
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,360
for understanding poland

213
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,180
my bit surreal well rainbows lots of
people

214
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,660
talk about it cities if you think about
it doesn't really

215
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,020
annexes anything bowls college rainbows
is

216
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,080
blackballed to you is about

217
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,090
the best generating knowing about always
the morning the

218
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,300
for us supposes

219
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,829
but just below

220
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:40,839
from the slices and it

221
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:44,549
just from them from the fights and me
this is

222
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:47,979
I this walls and so

223
00:13:47,979 --> 00:13:51,919
four-run really they know whether I'm

225
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:59,289
heavily focused person 2002

226
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:02,430
spike possibly Davidson

227
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:05,500
community %uh very very well with a

228
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,990
chilean all this time still

230
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:17,900
487 panels and

231
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,380
it's just a matter of what's going on in
this house missing

232
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,510
it's very little

233
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,640
contains physically and his progresses

234
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,160
and these so it is

235
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,770
but i'm saying is framework that
addresses really this guy's

236
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:40,450
its I'll this yeah

237
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,820
well tile also how long they are and

238
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,310
his things then davis's mention this
because I

239
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:53,120
poet so I'm so yeah

240
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,290
so

241
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:00,310
and also this too but you know it
doesn't show

242
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:03,360
services really really

243
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,660
I to leave the

244
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,440
your whole and to see really intend

245
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,340
basically notes adjusters got it

246
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,240
basically I'll sauce close

247
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,030
and the way I loved over a little there
so

248
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:25,380
a great was the

249
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,180
papers and and so you can see with three
months

250
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,539
everything has been

251
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:34,800
justin is plus the

252
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,680
everything and kennel and trade

256
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,640
to don't time to I was thinking

257
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:58,930
poet show to someone is not something
that is present on the show as

258
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:03,740
sufficient represented Island demo

259
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,140
facility to somehow yeah a was his eyes
are you

260
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,890

sizes and daily

261
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,930
different approaches president it would
be met with us the second one is

262
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:19,000
wasteful person thought it was funny
because

263
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,240
whether over

264
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,230
to the winds I basically associates

265
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,420
yes sailors community he said

266
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:36,240
it when I using so for for exploiting

267
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,670
I'm saying that one so busy his show you

268
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,579
mean running

269
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:44,480
is we have a server running same

270
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,929
this is a test in B&H did visa

271
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:50,720
only

272
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,560
what we're going to do is run

273
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:01,060
this

274
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,790
friend so to if you don't know it is
sound

275
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,299
it were possible

276
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:13,329
think anything about it when I go to is
that this is surely this is huge for

277
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:14,309
this move this

278
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:17,900
pasa other didn't get the best results
but

279
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,929
definitely is place you with you get
your results

280
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:25,079
okay so it is and and mostly kind of

281
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:30,330
pasa saying cuz indian desi you try to
call you can see it was mysteriously me

282
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:34,429
18 any the many

283
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,590
PNC chai

284
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:43,090
any database with you doing this is
because it isn't the way to do it

285
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,809
man in the middle and is that's all
following the

286
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:50,619
trying to get my hands on the set so
busy

287
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:54,539
don't wait until fine you there

288
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:59,320
people tree the constructed this is my
number is this a little

289
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,529
doing some other religiously for example
even got

290
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:06,039
a I just do this because I thought it
was so

291
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:09,419
maybe clear so and

292
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:12,849
so we have an STD the 790

293
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:17,229
this box so what I'm going to do isn't
going to set up

294
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:21,990
thing they do it missing samples and 21

295
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,630
forward to it. to host 21

296
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:32,630
okay was a simple as that

297
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,809
tonight and we didn't go to 2121 so they
will be releasing

298
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:43,049
casa and only five minutes

299
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:47,660
this is going to be really really really
fast

300
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:52,530
right so so basically we do prison
because he retired as we are

301
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:56,370
and presently doing all the the money
into minnesota

302
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,830
weekend access their to be okay so

303
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:05,190
just to show you creating so this is
what its a

304
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,299
whether physically I senses many people
but we can see the

305
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:12,890
this is a pass and then holding owns
that we're

306
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,980
then you can go to a friend's stuff

307
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,610
same as you think that there's something
interesting on this request says it's

308
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:20,299
important

309
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:24,010
USA between okay and then

310
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,049
think I'm going first is also so you got
it

311
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:30,090
girls total cleaning

312
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:34,309

314
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,690

315
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:49,690

316
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:59,210
into its quality but is it possible to
them

317
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,059
you go

318
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:12,390
so

319
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,710
so there you go

320
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:21,710
is right now is that a person

321
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,610
there you go and as you can see there
was an exception

322
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:31,299
I the certainly parents responses

323
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:34,559
I visited the this is the that was also
follows

324
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,640
if you will what is really going to
later I'm going to travel very very very

325
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,240
fast because I think

326
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,400
we don't have much time so basically as
you can see it here

327
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,380
tile present so let's just say which is
where we want to cause we've been

328
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,190
buzzing

329
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:55,970
this okay services

330
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:59,620
its owner debugger is okay

331
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,690
very very very very old I'm

332
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,400
and done well this is whites boss a
testing

333
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,890
and using I agree with possible by his
house was here

334
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:14,220
polled by the Forsa this is a real
example you can see it

335
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,299
is doing today the source code as we can
see

336
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:21,159
this is this is see program parents

337
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:24,179
interesting but is there and busy is

338
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:27,820
we have I'm Siro Siro on our

339
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,780
when visiting with me for for a bias we
know it was his alone the first

340
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,650
parameter

341
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:36,510
goes to this function we have 0

342
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:39,890
10 its eyes and nobody will the second
bites

343
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:44,250
it goes dysfunction 02 2012 is facing

344
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,549
0:30 goes this function does the
television grizzel

345
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:52,330
this is wrong with only in only process

346
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:56,429
it we send whole lot is to 20

347
00:21:56,429 --> 00:22:00,169
10 2013 it was a musician

348
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:03,570
for a generation nasa Mb impossible

349
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:07,169
what are the chances old discovering
that I would say

350
00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:10,950
minimal going to show you how we're
going to do that

351
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:15,190
there's remind for my whites boss
perspective

352
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:18,409
so very very quickly

353
00:22:18,409 --> 00:22:25,409
fun and you see that

354
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,380
you go so so we have basically this

355
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:37,850
a the this people say it is the one we
doin

356
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,170
we will you investor

357
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:44,590
without showing not I'm basically what
we do is we use

358
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,060
gold buyer it by the faster but what it
does is

359
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:52,280
Cincinnati GCC is a simple question but
is no

360
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,340
settling a long-running it also who's on
single decision

361
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,120
whose and not just some looting into the
early okay

362
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:07,120
so basically what we will do is I'm so
we use and

363
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:11,580
funny just seen

364
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,260
okay to combine the source code okays

365
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,590
it and mold okay

366
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:23,780
to know we have our a bold

367
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,820
I want fire I know what we do is

368
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:33,540
we have feel

369
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:37,940
so so this is the same day those I

370
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,460
time sorry for it including information
that so

371
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,570
as you can see in this only I

372
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:49,030
days there's nothing else think so
officers will

373
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:52,280
take that includes I'm going to do that
and see

374
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:59,280
how it goes missing so it seemed

375
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:12,379
so

376
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:23,389
okay so no we are going to thats I am to
enable it

377
00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:27,239
although the last poll to the right one
and then using the fire

378
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:30,940
I'm basically what this program is going
to do is particularly program

379
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,999
and then created a boosting it says it
will buy it

380
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:40,239
so it will basically identifiable the
branches and it will identify him

381
00:24:40,239 --> 00:24:47,239
below

382
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,350
will identify it is a little difference
is that I showed you before

383
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:58,670
okay and we'll go through it

384
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:02,090
Monday should

385
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:09,090
with Israel find

386
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:15,080
us

387
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:20,120
to answer it

388
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,390
so it goes you already sold it to a
couple who

389
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:29,380
to come out and with them and then

390
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,470
this is the results all the person

391
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,720
so you basically detected all the
different branches

392
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,650
detected all the different conditions
and it has created

393
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:43,670
aspire to actually creates a
segmentation fault

394
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:48,460
the on the program I don't know about
you guys but I think this is really

395
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,320
amazing

396
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,690
this is amazing console or sure is

397
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:58,490
technique do you have time for the last

398
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:03,059
demo place

399
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:04,370
someone

400
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:08,100
but until they kick my ass a little the
reverend

401
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,159
let me show you last

402
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:16,080
Evelyn very very quickly and basically
we have

403
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,260
this to Israel we have this

404
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:25,200
days so we have I just with this

405
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,679
ASCII art and this this really cool

406
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,919
and for us it was basically what it does
is just

407
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:36,919
who's living with multiple fractures and
it just randomly changes then

408
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:40,200
so instead of is that ok cats

409
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,620
STR what we do is we thank you that

410
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:50,620
the fire store

411
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:56,180
and as you can see it is if you do the
same thing but ended this is really

412
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:56,800
really

413
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,470
cool foreign for final find a person

414
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:04,070
%uh for is going on with this in office
a

415
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:08,890
media business interests is right and
those to miss some so we can see this

416
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:14,140
with it was a number of barnes et so
what do we do

417
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,430
this will assist you

418
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:21,990
this phone lines 100 times with 10 with
100 dependencies

419
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:26,200
when is it different confirm this and
you can use the form this for

420
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,690
for saying the yeah iPhone basically so

421
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:34,020
this is a three-and-a-half-year mp3 file
and what we can do is we can

422
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:38,500
trying this program with I'm to may need
something to break

423
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:43,690
and and

424
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:48,930
this

425
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:53,330
so basically what I have here it is bus
this assignment for the memory

426
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:57,600
this is a so they're X's time three
seconds

427
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,690
we r doing want 10000

428
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:04,720
tries against some sandwiches and you
never hear the news about five to 10

429
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,650
what it does is it changes changes
because it was all the time

430
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,790
basically and as you can see it

431
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:16,750
well as you can see here this whole
release there were some problems

432
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:21,140
so-and-so the fine is a different one as
you can see it in details: always change

433
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,720
businessmen to date only thing that mp3
files so basically

434
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,450
every single day this is Justin however
it is

435
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:32,000
tools and actually sitting at a
different name is required

436
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,570
so basically you can do is running
Ubuntu 9.10

437
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:39,570
for grant there's that kind of stuff

438
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:43,240
Island Exeter I will show you

439
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,440
but I don't company to Rudy

440
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,230
responsible for this is the only way to
describe it is

441
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:54,940
the offers found and this is something
that is really believe in the same then

442
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,340
israel says hello there facile 10 days

443
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:03,220
maybe free whether same said

444
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,540
whether basically think

445
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:10,770
the the

446
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:14,130
if you need a bit more to explore using
a little

447
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,330
its handling biz has been really really
quick talk

448
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:20,400
doesn't driving thinking about is

449
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,040
sold so I'm

450
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,410
said this is the today was an important
and

451
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:32,260
although trolls and Russia old okay so

452
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,510
let me know about the future really to

453
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:38,880
10 trillion much it is basically what is

454
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,620
bond it is going to the same the
facilities

455
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,630
it is is becoming really strong in this
one

456
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:51,440
development life cycle a becoming as
much as much as a

457
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,320
going it out better the

458
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,510
I can see what's causing as be able to

459
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:04,140
number so the whole way but in little
solar and

460
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,770
companies on just not so

461
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:11,870
pieces but my personal at the moment
doing

462
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:17,190
wonderful person I do know this is
totally the

463
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,920
foreseen into the

464
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,410
a citizen conditions this is what it
said

465
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:27,540
susan is in loans on the move go

466
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,700
longer a I can see that going

467
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,700
the corporate world goldman's offering
posse

468
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,410
services I'm really mind

469
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:41,770
don't so I'm this just about to break it
will pass

470
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:48,770
questions

471
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:50,820
thank you its
