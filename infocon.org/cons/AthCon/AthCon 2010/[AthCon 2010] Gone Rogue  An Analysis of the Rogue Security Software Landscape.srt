1
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,700

4
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,539
collaborative research either way it's
yeah I mean come on there's

5
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:32,390
doing that so different upset protests

rate it doesn't happen the

12
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,770

misuse

19
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:28,299
Boateng add skills that have skill

20
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:31,299
gathered to let me know but we should
try this

21
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,659
or about analyzing the someone else's
hands

22
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:38,360
I am was about her visit world

23
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,470
what we're trying to do is very
promising to collect data thanks

24
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,799
so what's actually going on so we all
know that whatever it is but the next

25
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,090
thing you know we're not suppose

26
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,130
with these are using slamming his

27
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:54,259
are get not used we know anything was
dubious distinction that is behind it

28
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:57,750
nowadays France behind the white house

29
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,470

32
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:14,540
pictures so policy Press like so that we
can improve our infrastructure systems

33
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:14,880
over

34
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,430
securities author yeah because
eventually he didn't get back

35
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,010
collection analysis to unit well in fact
as well as me

36
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,540
practice man stabs we're going to play a
game of connecting the dots

37
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,440
his we collect yeah I mean finalizing
the

38

beginning at eight so the it's good to
know that is exactly what we have like

43
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,989
the worst case

44
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:58,299
so for those with your knots the
maintenance of concepts

45
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:02,730
every security salter as: and his lady

46
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,910
syndication that ISBN be the case

47
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,329
actually know it clearly appears in
Press but

48
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:13,260
is isolated case so either relaxing
clearly Peters

49
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,359
asking for money hard pretending to be
clean care

50
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:19,760
and or it may even have other samples to

51
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,549
actually gets old you all says secured

52
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:27,949
slightly below that in with the man was
basically has

53
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:31,000
prize money that is users

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,290
are so much a weirdo security that way
yes paid to clean their computers and

55
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,799
telling me there is something in it

56
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,250
and in everything or something actually
it's the rest

57
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,810
related to the issue as proxies for
spring gate

58
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:49,380
a what are the challenges that you can
actually find

59
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,739
deal with it even trying to actually
hear it

60
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:56,479

how I said these people use and I'll

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,259
are working how they actually polly's
pains

84
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,719
is there anything I landscapes so

85
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:33,060
and to the use frozen exploits for a
meal or

86
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,610
do they actually do something different
so the

87
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,360
how he actually parking spaces have
matching finance

88
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,780
believe this tennis and they would have
to be wanting to you

89
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,879
practically had goodness we want to have

90
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:51,379
specifically the sample is writing the
maze

91
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:54,379
to be able to seeing what you're seeing
is in property

92
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:57,969
to replace a between the two

93
00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:01,610
collect information about this means
once we have justly so that means yes he

94
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,439
wanted to eat

95
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:06,629
get a meeting with us what they are
actually a

96
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:10,430
when it came to light and I didn't want
to

97
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,729
financier wat minus information actually
for

98
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:18,879
thats first little less a

99
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,569
so how the message received we did this
so

100
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:26,849
wanna see tools that have been developed
in the context the a

101
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:30,999
project Baseball Hall is a starting our
highways is your house

102
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:34,490
guess the light s a

103
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:39,099
so bathing but we need to see it was

104
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:42,509
previous principles let me know about

105
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:46,699
bias Public Enemies something about
bringing these days

106
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:50,539
they try to make this is Dana by having
basically

107
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:53,919
made us as it gets amazing Macy's

108
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,219
close and in the end I think he's just
so

109
00:06:57,219 --> 00:07:01,900
characteristics for each with me yet so

110
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,749
first time to release already meets will

111
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:10,330
with the Stars polling at least that's
what we did he is what about us

112
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,969
so why can't we have seen on that has a
has and it is believed that the same way

113
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:15,740
that

114
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,539
gives you information about what he's
doing is actually fact-based

115
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:22,999
pratt's that identified hurdling

116
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:27,889
as sources of her teammates many you
know on release however your outdoor

117
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:28,449
spas

118
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:32,169
ollie is place actually yes

119
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:35,680
cases the humidity estimates his friends

120
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,580
we simply select a little easy recipes
to try to locate

121
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,930
a with SSR is you know we had

122
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,210
minimalism is but we also to

123
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,719
me she loves you I really doing this
that the enemies list

124
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:55,699
let me this is actually into the bed is
all message yes

125
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:59,090
course what's best yes basically

126
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:02,539
as they are basis the one that uses the

127
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:05,909
college 31 getting drowsy look at it

128
00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:09,870
that is a thirteen associations between
the harrises

129
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,919
and amaze to resolving these I guess is
much more than just

130
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,189
spirits position because they have
police it means that every sold

131
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:23,090
was yes so with this message lafitte

132
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,199
all the earliest that and seriously see
you at last

133
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:31,210
foresee the Caesars as is really means

134
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,960
so once we have these cute with mace
pain actually

135
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,500
get me that lied to him and that he is

136
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,909
told me devoutly the over the project
because they actually have a little

137
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:43,659
sewing

138
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:48,480
I wouldn't spend time your describe how
to get since 8 a.m. here in the city

139
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,250
yes that's me inclined intelligent

140
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,910
and so he didn't collect information
about the for me

141
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,720
security safe with me so it knowing the
net

142
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,040
Press price does that really mean to me
is

143
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,440
places like this is my Google and we've
got information about you

144
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,540
the the researchers say the maze with

145
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,510
in a spacious which are asking the bus
services are posting is a maze

146
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,519
and then ultimately we'll information
about his lesser sale

147
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,079

156
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,510
heading into told at the other day I
think so they will but

157
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,920
Pro is all triage physically with me
didn't hear

158
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,720
asking Matt say something that days
information about

159
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,899
balance on a different levels passes

160
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:11,360
a sexual deviancy his point

161
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,570
as a tax information about pressing for
the masses the place

162
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:19,420
after release demands according to this
specific laser principles here

163
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,850
especially those in the Caesar

164
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:26,019
and this is a magic stopped in the
middle careers

165
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:29,339
it had something by across finds finance
the rest

166
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,180
for a little messes praises the Mesa

167
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,009
actually posing as a server raised by
the same person

168
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:41,790
or the most anything better the first
service using the same Services Inc

169
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,259
English this allows us to my knees

170
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:48,440
data they have collected the head it

171
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,500
find something to be are estimates cases
me

172
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,279
people have done it so horny funny the
bills

173
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,810
still sources there are actually a
number of promising methodology that we

174
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:02,699
are aware

175
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:06,639
the better principle we cannot exclude
our

176
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,589
that his plea this because I really just
relying on that third party sources

177
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:14,980
so we even we know for sure some other
than these

178
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,240
we had an accident tracked although they
were classified as being a broke in the

179
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,970
maze

180
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,910
thinking of actually the A's city when I
he really means

181
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,410
yeah we know for sure that is these
dummies for tactical

182
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,230
your sis existing father get a lot of
the virus

183
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,220
the main boats we believe that these i
mean this jury sees

184
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,930
I this man is Ali so we are shared

185
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,079
these heuristics with that catchphrases
really need the latest

186
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,050
working time so we know that we are
living in from his

187
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,820
say that thanks is the mining techniques
that we have used

188
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:57,930
in the kidneys or this is dirty with
leaves and the other way

189
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:02,130
and so the 23c

190
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:06,790
we actually do it solo 6500 that this
thing is the main aims to the head

191
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,889
led to the rescue Pressley three months

192
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:13,690
and that is amazing to use their
resources are those four thousand users

193
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,630
lesser us we had so the number of
servers are actually

194
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:22,139
pussy also free condoms so thanks let me
know they're actually not malicious

195
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:26,819
way it's another server as the closest
Brady the measles enterprise

196
00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:30,410
runways premies the fun we had to those

197
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,920
2600 something at the maze

198
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,500
as a server is a rescue foreseen on the
eurozone that means

199
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,899
servers it had lying on the floor is

200
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:44,380
practices with us so

201
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,699
for this brady last have several private
to look at a very high level information

202
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:50,060
services

203
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,110
for special it was where they located so
water I actually

204
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,370
physically horses will

205
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:02,380
interestingly actually losses service
have little network to reserve any

206
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,630
a or US laurin other unions

207
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:10,690
in almost sold out nothing in Asia then
you go back to what we have seen before

208
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,850
we know that our heuristics for finding
Brahimi's Hotspur

209
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,790
still police say for sure that this
means that this press doesn't exist in

210
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,579
time

211
00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:23,639
or that Cingular Wireless stuff like
this

212
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,880
well be so for sure is that is that's
the worst service

213
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,579
class meaningless because I'm assistance
well senator dole's here they are you

214
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:33,180
see that there are some analysis is that

215
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,980
are Sr know it too below the surface
Colorado

216
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,420
respected but I think so even if bad
things are for the illegal act

217
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,529
immediately or they are

218
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,610
and they don't his three controlled

219
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:48,569
so we do see that exceed forty percent
of our servers are located only in

220
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:49,829
panelists

221
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,850
presley's small numbers says

222
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,730
and find the most interesting actually
when we lose adverse to the service

223
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:01,660
actually these things for running so
that you know the case actually this

224
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,339
ever since the same

225
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:08,209
some cases were okay nothing he just
like a at this time posse servers

226
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:12,339
butthead cases like this morning we had
a very very specific

227
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:15,959
integration for the lesser is not

228
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:20,170
aggressive and he lives a sufficient
that leads us to believe that there was

229
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,019
a

230
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:25,360
the headset people when they were at
stake on the servers isn't the place for

231
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,259
uses a pretty pure she is the worst
flood alert yeah

232
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:33,540
sorrel you ice-t's over the balance

233
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,139
and they were just freezes its

234
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,149
so to go away that we need to go it

235
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:44,029
point to the details estimates so

236
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:47,209
she looks to be a serious so the man's
his

237
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:51,389
me yes the inspector issue 4 disservice
by asking that high

238
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:54,399
posting the highest number in the
millions prided

239
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,949
discerning callers remains in rats

240
00:14:57,949 --> 00:15:01,810
a care a

241
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,509
good amazes me is right now in Dinneen
track as far as I'm here

242
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:08,600
33 and then there are some parts

243
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,350
here they're asking all rights there
actually is 19 tracks

244
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,970
they were not seeing celebrities

245
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:20,259
so what can we see from here because
it's there seems to be some soda

246
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:24,279
interest from the bad people Teresa
other delays

247
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:27,620
overseas service the scene from getting
to me

248
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,250
and they made it less at the same time
you'll see the

249
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,639
not be slightly think they're not
watching movies he has

250
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,550
in other cases you're in this maybe
interconnections

251
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:43,009
sorry to say this this to me grouped
according to the server is causing

252
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:47,259
service and service looks great things
especially lesser

253
00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:51,240
so you can see here is in mir's all the
maze all the road leading to Mayes

254
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,930
have been invited to see those are cases
cases at least

255
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,329
is really the main thrust makes with are
you know the

256
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:05,139
delays almost by you this is a service
provider

257
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:08,810
so it like you mean it was even working
as a human rights to be happy days

258
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:12,310
listing for these days your glasses of
other in the maze

259
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:15,800
I have nothing to do today we throw a
few minutes

260
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,050
hearsay baxley morning that so it is
more a case

261
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,269
just a very healthy weight see it's
either there is

262
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:26,360
you know his have him in circles your

263
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,069
okay so maybe somebody has the closer
and that has

264
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:34,420
by the way that a large number of
breaking the waves

265
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:39,170
so is a feeling from a high level by the
way it doesn't make any

266
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:43,920
it on policy things are facts these were
actually the terrorists have

267
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,850
the house comes and as trying to class
really is trying to

268
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,050
my information that we have is a space

269
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:54,279
a to in personal injury lectures

270
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:57,709
a so what is the euro is an isometric

271
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:00,720
this so they let a recent beating
passers

272
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,740
for the 39 the heaviest and most singers
glasses

273
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,040
we have actually hard southerly 6,000
lbs

274
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,800
that enables ruled a 39 that means they
were awful see

275
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,659
to turn investor's there who seems a
little or nothing to me

276
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,820
so the monster the Mesa actually class
early tonight people's

277
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,160
its usefulness this is not really have
refused not get

278
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,860
because yes class thanks but still if
you have to leave you analyze

279
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:31,150
39 thanks hentai sport haha damn

280
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,290
things I say he's so let's look at some
homies

281
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:39,490
cases so is it that you want to discuss
very small one

282
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:42,980
you can see with a the you a serial

283
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,470
the main aims me the shipping tracking

284
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:52,860
a the hell this here the other day with
the sales name servers

285
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,560
and getting ready to watch the head over
heels so the people that spent his early

286
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,250
estimates

287
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,820
so let me say this is that people have
accidentally generated

288
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,960
are you know his see single operated
abbreviations on the

289
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,260
other words CIT inspired

290
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,110
I and they actually have things like
these that means

291
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,620
you may not see yes you're very well
actually they have to place the maze

292
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,760
on the same theme ideas so they have
used the

293
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,000
Rangers 50 and lesser versus the 15

294
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,130
goddesses and they had US his service as
both an Acer and

295
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:34,040
westerlies defining what they say

296
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,340
is that the policy okay that

297
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,530
was to be the first so it was posing any
louisiana is

298
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,610
A's was activity surveys people's

299
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,810
and was a reason at any point in time of
the year

300
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:50,420
bus this campaign had exactly the same
characteristics

301
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,180
so when you look at me as well you can
see that talent pressman

302
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,920
a it polygamy is actually have maize Rd

303
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,980
proteases of the word PC security is
doesn't have

304
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:06,490
and I get there has been a client
servers are the same I guess

305
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,680
so what is this tells us as that

306
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,100
we have to compete in this let with the
sea animals runs

307
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,810
primaries somebody that has generated
India basket

308
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:20,120
or knows has so the guy doesn't hold

309
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:24,290
is the lights candles running campaigns
always the same room is actually doing

310
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:24,880
it

311
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,240
to the gym farrakhan's time is anything
I just

312
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,950
to DVDs at a level coronation beagle
once

313
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:38,710
I just this year what I said so here it
is U-mass is actually in our old emails

314
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,160
that we believe that the and she is
grateful

315
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,640
because all these me is actually his
room and they are all those

316
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,400
yet to me is and always rendering he is
overseas

317
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,150
characters a

318
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:58,520
the interesting thing here is that on
the large yuri hentai especially

319
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,090
see if you can what we can say that
somebody at this early point in time

320
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,230
still with us

321
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:06,290
like another mission March

322
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,890
kiss a certainly but didn't have that in

323
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:13,490
employees I mean davis's service be fun
to me is

324
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:17,190
and a half actually in didn't like him
on a server that was close

325
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,880
disaster and they started using me as
dummies a while

326
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,910
that actually means youre its six months
later

327
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:27,760
so six months later this idea baby any
lower tummy is having let this is my

328
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,750
goals for the summit

329
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,310
not just many more this release a whole
insidious writers

330
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:37,090
licences under the maze in a second mass
and the like this

331
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,890
so this show that behind these contracts
race

332
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:44,040
might that be investment things are so
you know cost

333
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,570
classic going to the service a

334
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:51,460
racing in the maze missing you his
armies cost

335
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,940
connection million for listening to me
is to make sure that people visit that

336
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,520
ended up in a single is awesome

337
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,920
so the that I spot a message via

338
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,250
wonder as why did you know this mean
we'll see is

339
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,410
hey is you haven't expressed we'll see

340
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:15,330
as much support as this one even and
phishing emails

341
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:19,930
so we try to actually to investigator
with his remorse

342
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:23,810
owns and he was in the business for
slots

343
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:27,200
a Road comments season through the
experience

344
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,760
missus a so we have to recognize Israel

345
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,620
informal survey so it was just playing
around with the average monthly cost

346
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,890
all practice 3rd a

347
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,100
to the registration costs it is his main

348
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,210
is so we can see that the following a
single lane

349
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:49,800
or a small say the least somebody has a
rains in prices beating a hundred

350
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,460
dollars into how the last three years

351
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:56,490
the point was you know actually haha
nice he where the evidence so

352
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:00,630
he did not know almost many classes
people are actually getting

353
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,480
and this we have a lot it actually look
at this service

354
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,870
we have this call her that a small
number that's not necessarily services

355
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,410
yesterday an ass

356
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:14,880
worries that Europe's the Hess people
had left the mall status

357
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,800
in pochi running with no he is proposing
to me

358
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,810
still for those of you that are not
familiar with the posse

359
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:26,330
at while say this is a model that allows
you to processing aids

360
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,650
and get full status of the what Center

361
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,330
this comprises below us here this but
also comprises

362
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:39,910
information about the last 500 his you
realize that the lesser hashers

363
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,520
with me look at us the Klein connected

364
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,030
everything from a simple typing this is
what you get and what was the hero that

365
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,610
was actually passed by the House

366
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:54,190
so we feel there is the people it was
kinda dancing

367
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:58,330
30 things like he just yet and that
we're starting to see if I have this

368
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,880
year also inside the bus

369
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,390
I hate this year I was actually I'm
pointing to and

370
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:07,800
to a scanner a search engine pretense
the disastrous

371
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,260
a little bit like the one that they
should be in the beginning and

372
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,750
wean them justify that pages right
actually you know the pace in these

373
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,190
people were telling them I was happens

374
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,400
and the section with me not so is your
ETA quality

375
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,860
what you displeases yeah nurses over two
months

376
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,630
is we have practice servers indicated
that although this page

377
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:33,230
on a regular basis so with the issue
here is the line of this Candice

378
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,030
so the number of times the taxi had
landed

379
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:40,670
on database contains the latest
challenge to the israeli

380
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:44,800
ya for my eyes you have a problem and
you can see here this

381
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,550
other line and candidates the line
anyways

382
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,740
the user is the only the

383
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,400
ronny said what happens is that a
specific case

384
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,780
the room he had in his own movies for
free and as I said in the beginning

385
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:03,250
what happens is that the rodeo will come
back and how each one

386
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:07,140
clean from the stress in debate yes it
does

387
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,390
honestly we demand that you have any
information about the payments

388
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:14,120
is being pissy when people were looking
the the Illini

389
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,260
but it is the word 10 it when they were
okay for the simple fact that

390
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:22,850
the peace that these people were using
for the payments were always poses

391
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:26,240
last it was his third actually was not

392
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,990
we were not able to track because they
have that one sees days

393
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:33,570
but still busy something very
interesting has that the race between

394
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,120
the

395
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,100
successful Schantz the I mean the
previous day

396
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:44,400
the databases 10 days and the casing is
the time was accidental OD the

397
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,250
sample was pretty high to something like
this happens happens

398
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:53,900
which is weighty matter that 101 people
are a little efficient

399
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,770
so where it will be the table with

400
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:02,650
partially because I love you it hurts
price for a really need

401
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:07,520
new guidelines that to the number of
people that actually landed

402
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,570
on these candidates we have information
about the payment

403
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:16,120
yes see this latter but for you know

404
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,890
a as it were estimated he just uses the
very same

405
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:24,630
a my decision rate has been in service
for fishing days

406
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:27,910
is here that the six percent increase
world

407
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:31,690
looking for another is that even in this
brave bad haziness

408
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:35,600
the early Holocene getting money finds
terrible timing I something like one

409
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,510
hundred dollars

410
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:40,550
per hundred thousand dollars per year
which is wat better than what the US is

411
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:43,000
spending to be close to me

412
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,590
so this just shows you that yes in these
brody salter since he is physically

413
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:52,180
lucky and I mean specifically Louis and

414
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:56,000
and your users the loading and
eventually pay

415
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,180
as for party mistaking it

416
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,390
so what did we learn about this well for
school

417
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,450
we learned that the user has an
important role in sure that we're not

418
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:06,860
talking about brothers plus

419
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:10,620
we didn't find this more not the case
which people actually also

420
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,660
processed by the very same wrongly paid

421
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:18,140
in most cases the user was clicking the
late was done little to help settle

422
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,110
and was well eventually pay for that

423
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:27,520
what the Solstice thats delicious hit me
so I love the history so that the cases

424
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,510
in which people were

425
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,820
in declining israelis Heights

426
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,400
but another the mazes the number of
servers meteorite

427
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,120
handling the payment was much lower so
this is a necessity if you want to text

428
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,550
track he said not about his was busy
trophy cases because I just emailed

429
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:48,170
he said but since then the missiles if
you find in a min size:

430
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:51,640
it's much easier to actually stop

431
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,190
and finally believe that this is
training isn't 40

432
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:58,380
as in tennessee this is bringing at
least look at

433
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,370
say furious to do something in the next
let's look at the SP

434
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:05,940
this is gonna things are really miss yes
there another

435
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,920
weird things in their decision to the
mains in the pan out to be the number of

436
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,610
servers

437
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:14,090
remains so yes way to go

438
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:18,670
so it is with this about and you have
any questions have time

439
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:22,300
this

440
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:29,300
yes

441
00:27:33,389 --> 00:27:39,080
as I years

442
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:46,080
on

443
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:51,940
I went to a specific case as it were you
know that s lil sis errors

444
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:56,570
as so we cannot verify and you can
really see it this year I was finding

445
00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:00,090
to glad file that he downloaded

446
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:03,309
trying to say it was a Chevrolet so he
could do it

447
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:10,309
because it was a raising his on the
service is nothing else to this review

448
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:17,470
they were specifically in the 5400
series

449
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
drug cases in which the roomies for
their is missing a single

450
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,810
cases case in which the really need are
seemingly

451
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:37,580
tell house I'm insanely doesn't pay

452
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:41,290
there are cases that have been demanding
that the treasury is the wrong he said

453
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:41,950
he's in prison

454
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:45,220
but here at me we didn't want to look at
the specific

455
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,780
roomies we just want to get into a
hazard information about how much money

456
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,620
they were making

457
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,860
but he was pretty to look at the
structures look at it

458
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,380
policy but I see the following this
year's so we didn't lose specifically

459
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,340
