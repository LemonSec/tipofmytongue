near here and okay so I'm today I'm
going to talk about

3
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:15,759
to only demand for only need to
incorporate mentor

4
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,350
holding the the insert by taking over at
a buddies

5
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,970
terror and economists are not only did
single server

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,080
not only Windows can be anyone

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,130
%uh I am

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,600
process haha for SolidWorks Panther for
all colors

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,719
with the Securities you have a zit the
information security company

10
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:41,649
and by the way we are also hiring if you
are interested just

11
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:45,379
aspin's meant I am an open source and is
just

12
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:48,989
I have been developing fuel him

13
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,120
tools they are whole released under GPL
license

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,649
yeah and today and another straight

15
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:01,430
singing of new features and for this
team selection

16
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,699
the management system as I say they are
power

17
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:07,990
locations a new dared

18
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,000
most important to us historians
interrupt

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,619
with does stories proper way and
interrupted

20
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:18,270
efficiently but these the

21
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,270
oldham molar and other bases actually
support integration with filesystem

22
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,689
and if they don't support integration or

23
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:29,860
a.m. I with the president more delivery
system

24
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,479
you can't force them to do you can't
read them to you can abuse other

25
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:34,590
functional this

26
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,040
too many do what you want so

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,520
baby you're not for them you can exploit
them so

28
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,740
sharyl say they are from the businesses
don't

29
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,119
so it's a double bass are either way you
are connected to a database

30
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,860
meet a connection because your VM

31
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,640
provided with icons so we'll like
braided a

32
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,700
both esteem more about brute force
incomes

33
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,840
or you are connected through the vase

34
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,629
by ask one's actions 0 is on the loose
ball in the second session

35
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,810
any well locations than the ones I and
education

36
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,989
any application that uses a the blaze
began the

37
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:20,230
store and her out with dust so let's do

38
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:24,310
not your hand and a great day okay
alright that's fine but

39
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:29,690
you want more you want us to those one
only to touch the service if you are

40
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,730
and other you on Etsy a improving sign
that

41
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,170
this single nerdy in their second
session tomorrow

42
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,450
we passports or by overflowing with
another bizarre very so

43
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,610
can I love you too long the entire there
are numerous is done

44
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:50,280
for even other service within the
network so

45
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,340
what is still far so far last year he
was Essendon's you then it's

46
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,180
many others have been presented as well
and the bus about sequestering borough

47
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,340
there is not a new

48
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,769
a many people have done the research is
in the years

49
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:08,090
about the command execution and
religious affiliation

50
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,159
I'll by abuses it was her and Oracle

51
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,290
on these are just a few 10 examples

52
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:21,360
wedding don last year this to my phone
is mostly on sick list on my list

53
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,250
home on my scene was sorry and posters
is arduous soars above is

54
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,909
softwares I actually it was indeed to
adjust

55
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:34,280
well let's see if I can reproduce what
is his initial or any other third person

56
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,659
you're

57
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:37,680
or plz functions in our lab due

58
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,080
so how the way that secures columns well

59
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,299
actually anxiety user-defined function
well as a user-defined function

60
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:50,010
is just your whole you're single the 20
mile is a shared library

61
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,290
by using the management system

62
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:58,340
development glamorous you my love said
shirt object your loaded

63
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,720
and then you create your old passions
elevated

64
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,909
I could a couple finds that we also

65
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:10,159
does in a bit posters on the wall this
supports all persons or entities so we

66
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,049
have an accepted

67
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:14,110
paralyzing tcl/tk cold

68
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,660
on the whole a there anything wrong with
amazing stunts

69
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,070
but the as far as I know all the

70
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,060
previews and I'm those on the list and
all holes were visible

71
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,550
for witness vehicles another operating
system don't

72
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,449
a enable this press the language is
banned also they are

73
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:37,259
useless in an environment that uses for
use by others

74
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:40,500
so I created a set of you

75
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,790
I user-defined functions I am

76
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,160
and actually lost for my seat when was
this is

77
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,660
one very simple one system this korean
model actually when you call this

78
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,880
function your colleagues in the SELECT
statements or select season disco diva

79
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,210
and as argument you mustn't call on
common will be honest

80
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,660
executed on the underlying grievances
nothing there

81
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,000
fancy does reproduction and 14 also

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,500
behind XP 70s show single server singer

83
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:16,500
other DBMS settlers so long as I said
own interests are

84
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,259
is not only lawrence's time common
security some

85
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:23,699
you can establish how about an action
which doesn't use

86
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,850
the same a time now to being friends
they have

87
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,630
to who takeover the other boss is on the
mend

88
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,199
I'll article it was traded for example
his own Julius

89
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:40,610
a which performs a school the last time
I love you

90
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,449
over do the or you can use as big as a
stream

91
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:47,650
I have over this this is the last state
election you can I

92
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,090
for example any spoiled I'm tales

93
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:55,229
matter Shelby NC executed on both
software

94
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,750
any other danger from the weather com
weather

95
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,910
so let's make it more still there

96
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,419
because in a real environment about his
main things

97
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:08,440
now where they are now he's into you

98
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,419
it's not is it truck time and forensic
investigation

99
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:16,319
so what what what can you do you can
forge a show called

100
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,740
with hamas says a lot about nicole is
with sadness I think a little bit about

101
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,569
a few

102
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:25,300
or its Sarah on the virus productive and
will be in colour

103
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,509
to use that you use them as a clearly

104
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:31,569
local resources the Metasploit online
interface

105
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:34,660
I the city on a predefined is it
important

106
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,100
or performing an action to the database
the venues but the show

107
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:44,520
isn't buying connection or a vast
collection so is the database lol

108
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,460
I was going on action tool arthritis be
more serious R&R

109
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,900
collection if indeed did it does some
more

110
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,069
the time of users by the fire will so
some more but

111
00:06:56,069 --> 00:06:59,590
from your for spam Arnall shooter are
close

112
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,990
you're going to have his these
misconfiguration of the fire until the

113
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:03,620
end

114
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,360
your show on that specific I don't know
a lot of children

115
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,910
for that on the database server you
create your DS

116
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,539
the next to the payload in memory so you
know anymore

117
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:18,490
season this for real because I actually
just underscore the ball

118
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,229
all only execute one single home you
simply

119
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:25,410
12 is anyone to sq

120
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,740
are we trying both holes encoded

121
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,370
in my mind because you are calling me
from a SELECT statement

122
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,039
either from a single injection what to
do or for from entire

123
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:40,560
action database so this is a 94 as a
good thing because

124
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,900
it's hard to try and francine
investigation

125
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,960
%uh because actually

126
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,520
the pay the cell is most poor on the

127
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,580
system it doesn't touch the surface of
the whole system

128
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,569
is directly executed in memory with
previous

129
00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:00,720
of the user running these classes below
the base or

130
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,410
the database software

131
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:08,889
so I create a new user the time and I
both incidents underscoring the law it's

132
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,639
quite solid explainable

133
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,629
I was going to quite a lot of these s
how is yours

134
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:18,889
and 100 protection my name's it bypasses

135
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:22,060
actually is it can hold very well

136
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,370
game wheels system that dissection
probation

137
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,539
and its bid enable in their software
that or are not because

138
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:35,200
sees I and II meinhold's cold

139
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,589
I create and I and II located here well
I love

140
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:41,620
windows or and my home we on UNIX

141
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,830
I know him in real already that memory
page where you live with

142
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,910
at to do this hotel is on the mend
first-place showdown executed

143
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,360
I okay it does excusable already so

144
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,730
there is nothing but that embodies can
cause the developers have already

145
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:02,080
will go I we'll ask you %uh and
everything so

146
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,230
we will execute in his childhood up

147
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:09,610
on a memory page that is marked is
creating is allocated

148
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,300
excusable so

149
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,920
actresses penalizes support offering to
pay those

150
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,870
only while because among the problem

151
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,649
when do you want your wall are
exploiting and I'm

152
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:28,600
anywhere in the form of the the memory
corruption vulnerability is

153
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,209
is dead you troupe and the getting this
Court PC

154
00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:37,000
financial hole to your show to be able
to his house in my mind

155
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,860
but you can call it is and I was an
all-american code is

156
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,490
this bias are not I love my bizarre

157
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,940
a binary data so do I and I'm sure

158
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,250
about in the database through as he
cleans up some

159
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,260
is parting tool to and admirable

160
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,360
for me to get firms are more are you
going to put in some instances

161
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,170
or even involved in some instances it
might not support a binary

162
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:06,019
binary encoded binary streams

163
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:09,950
so how I solve this problem ms I think
all the schooling of two

164
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,649
support a.m. on the mental tumbled

165
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:17,190
from well about to register and soul

166
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,190
basically when you can call your show
you buy

167
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,839
your Amazon available to them something
bold and collated

168
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,060
with the also as an American border

169
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,410
you also specify it that you want your

170
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,000
poem on water flow to be resurrected

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,050
at the time the hell is called to

172
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,110
the memory address up in store

173
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,450
in the into the HX register

174
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,750
so disease great

175
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,690
but how and what is your old pale

176
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,180
on the memory address referenced by he
is

177
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:59,480
well ya actually control here singled
didn't let you know that you have

178
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,399
created on the database server

179
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:04,920
it's great that means you're also if you
up into your

180
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,089
I'm to the function that withholding
tables

181
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:12,440
this meet this need the something called
actually

182
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,200
you what does here actually it specifies
that they did

183
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,279
must be moles the email address

184
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,360
and have a little with her as

185
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,990
mold to the memory address to liaise
dresser

186
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,310
and they will call with colorectal visit
our shop directly into that

187
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,630
a and memory area so is a key executed

188
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,920
so far we've got with so little problems
we don't need

189
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,130
mine relate I'm to indict any
improvement over currency was our

190
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:46,339
further second you lighthouse memory RAM

191
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,500
for class just let me stock market and

192
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,610
yearnings incomes or and it's been his
Arthur

193
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,690
the site during the these from

194
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:02,500
I deserve it I'm trash copes with if I
does

195
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,579
any avoid the MBMS crushes a production
environment if you miss exploit database

196
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:09,510
server do those wanting to cross

197
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:14,180
otherwise it will be banned for you with
a client to to explain why president so

198
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,660
what they do is ice home the overall so

199
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,680
injecting the deal and executed

200
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,420
now excusable memorization in class
right

201
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,779
and distress itself is cold weekend

202
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:32,160
its structure exception handler as
teenage

203
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,970
friend with us right this with trying
a.m.

204
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:40,690
cold so even though even in the
worst-case scenario is

205
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,779
the payload process it we'll

206
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:48,510
am believe that Israel then rise

207
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,500
and as yet expression which will be
handled by the

208
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,980
structural exception handler Poulter

209
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,600
in Windows and it will kill it right

210
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,970
so the worst cases but your show will

211
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,200
another standoff the not close

212
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,250
and probably in a proper way of turning
execution

213
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,260
so it is the horses are

214
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,959
so is closely both of the user defined
function

215
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:20,130
presidencies is perfectly juicy cold

216
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,470
%uh and will be some I am references

217
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,870
to my seat little glabrous and most
visible

218
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:30,360
fibrous I have created by a combined is

219
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,050
open source is part of a single mom
supply of I was made for you

220
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:37,100
all the process of anxiety and
insecurity

221
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,560
I enormous either %uh on wheels

222
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,839
or buenos I'm a decrease in the war also
with the

223
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:48,290
is commodities Antonio 2008

224
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:52,269
warehouse and you cannot be marriage in
the same boat about your opponent

225
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:57,680
celebrating 50 and yours on both 32 and
64-bit architecture

226
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,810
and is that and members thing

227
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,300
so

228
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:09,060
let's see ensemble I mean let's let's
see tomorrow

229
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,420
class and I'm an example to make things
more clear

230
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,560
so and i really am a freelance well said

231
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,790
your call either XP 70s show sees the
mall

232
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,750
horses underscoring ewbal like any other

233
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:27,970
celebration any other query is executed
with the

234
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,700
operating system user previous the

235
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,250
of the user which ill which is running
the database

236
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,700
software youth pastor the base price so

237
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,080
on you my physical servers

238
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,230
thousand usually was running and system
that wrong signals are

239
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,550
2005 by the phone during the
installation and

240
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,820
select which is the the operating system
user

241
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:56,690
to tool you're going to be used to
execute this

242
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,290
the basis for us but by default it goes
into medical services or

243
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,380
local service so laundry list

244
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,640
use a and nearly all user all this time
I see clothing

245
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,920
they both run at varying on previous

246
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,209
user on any yunis and environment

247
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:18,580
I interestingly my ceiling windows

248
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,589
romances always whereas father is also
on Windows ron is a

249
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,890
non-religious post this user the name is
Paul

250
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:29,220
respectful well regardless of the

251
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,620
OS operating system user running the

252
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,430
this process yet Iran escalate religious

253
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,770
how well there are many ways

254
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,890
excluding religious now we are known for
his position

255
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,500
sharaa of we've got us into the

256
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,810
base either minus single injection or
better mashine

257
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:53,250
I we haven't columns as I did just

258
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:57,630
said by a fire different things
regardless of the

259
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:02,080
basins were exploiting to go home in the
mall of now yeah

260
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,330
you want to escalate privileges so
what's your system what's your room

261
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,279
what's your tour

262
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,760
on on the bus well the service

263
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,630
and the amount of things that you can do
and theoretically

264
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:19,020
compromise is much wider so the point is

265
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,150
be creative there are many things

266
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:26,290
out there Osama bin widely documented

267
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,630
and reason this is a couple of months
%uh

268
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,910
the misplaced guys didn't you were in
particular

269
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:37,280
as implemented a very I'm powerful
on-demand the panther

270
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,390
which is guess is done these abuses when
he believes the business

271
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,650
prices for different techniques to I

272
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:48,250
system privileges these include as well
controls

273
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:54,120
which is an article on bus for about
seven years since Windows and in 3.5

274
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,020
often when the Sun reaches risk
impressed by my personal favorite is

275
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,630
here

276
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,900
you're going to lose weight provision of
my services

277
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,990
5 I was a design like

278
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,079
going to los dias others you're going to
do this

279
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,410
at this point member of boxing
third-party libraries

280
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:15,709
a.m. in third party software and
embraces Islam

281
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:19,550
I'm all software because I'm using all
the users are about

282
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:23,110
53 which is a trait that you write file
and then

283
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:29,020
a startup folder for all users and do it
the way they're not only los am

284
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:33,240
and is straight with me excuses you're
gonna make it in the

285
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,610
create a user like and I mean for the
global user

286
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,720
than you do in with 20 is required time

287
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,220
because you have to wait and the Israel
let me know really

288
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,290
so at this point whether the well

289
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:50,810
quite I as a friend does you where you
are on the bus

290
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:54,140
so let's see if we can make its world so

291
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,620
I think that a whole

292
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:04,620
make it are yeah opposing of Spurs fan
but you also want to say where the

293
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,300
where think the selection is in this
case is an hour I

294
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,928
environment this is the number one za
Windows three sides by

295
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:17,470
to I'm running and it's a single server
with a full-time religious

296
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,600
for service user around spots

297
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,050
bolsters was phone number processes by
the time

298
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:28,770
we're on has progress promiscuous and so
I have

299
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:33,570
whatsoever yes with a friend ESPN aspx
pages here

300
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,840
%uh they are horrible student section
but this is not the

301
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,650
but all in all this whole I

302
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,240
I was just fine on the street mimes
ventures news agency will not be

303
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:45,820
variables

304
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,120
interest things that dreams not

305
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,490
and then it was gone to specify that
they want

306
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,960
only operating system and you know you
was just as a

307
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,830
mere wage 63 it together today's

308
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:03,179
out and then it's just fine but

309
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,130
worms a where split is installed

310
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,470
and then bring us because but fold

311
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,070
it wouldn't want previously West and is

312

affected by what I mean babies
time-based and/or

315
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:29,159
Union where explains action I'm so in

316
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:32,350
identified it is affected by a dude
where's the plans are shot

317
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,230
and what else

318
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,179
did well

319
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,850
it is. is that your new user is to be a

320
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,850
doesn't laws these runs but in this case
it is

321
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:50,020
then you texted the my hiney

322
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,419
to you transactions are created if they
are ready to present

323
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:57,200
and the the way it doesn't regret them
so it's a sign

324
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,570
in this case they are not created so it
will just

325
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,630
a abuse while most shot into

326
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:07,280
remodeling your know that a binary file
because the

327
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,890
the Charter library is combined so is

328
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,330
by republicans is bases before all this
whole

329
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:18,490
totally fine with with their I'm thanks
and bye harry

330
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,900
a but there are slight getting old

331
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,740
as request that means without user says

332
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,429
the low on that score tickets for

333
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:33,130
prosperous using the full function to
create

334
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:37,100
did you know that uploaded and
ex-servicemen

335
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,950
base is important because trains at this
point it will

336
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,909
the created this user I'm sure you learn
from massachusetts

337
00:20:44,909 --> 00:20:48,679
you will this is xx I was all good just
uploaded

338
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:51,990
deal up and then

339
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:56,190
it will last me which way they only want
to use to execute

340
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:01,909
the Metasploit either by oscar has been
evolving Orlando million was paid your

341
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:06,159
so right he's on the fastest times that
being seen as a portable ask the women's

342
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:06,919
hooded

343
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:10,360
of course I want to go with full time in
which is in memory

344
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,100
way an impressive you ask me all of us
to generate them in this ploy is

345
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,650
shadows I will go into the fold what's

346
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:24,810
then shows me which is the conduit calls
has said

347
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:28,429
it goes it does I'm of merry

348
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:31,890
here take some time to come as well

349
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,300
so basement times

350
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,370
the little things mottos should be done
you

351
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:43,440
it's pretty slow and I'm it's wrong said

352
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,880
man display online phrase locate so it
will

353
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,360
based on predefined for visit this
before my

354
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,320
both parker-bowles will be listening on

355
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,540
and this is done by miss clark game

356
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:04,540
and displays prop inducible of but could
be any other tool

357
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,960
okay

358
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,350
so but it did well it was loling

359
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:27,150
and then being on my boss his boss here

360
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:32,000
on this poor Amazon command line
interface and then on the other side

361
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,090
told the other side the bizarre

362
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:38,460

363
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:43,390
the indicted who they are function
buying posse

364
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:47,190
and of my encoded stream

365
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:51,060
in this case it's not all the other
American coated it is also

366
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:55,020
angle it will she is our which are which
is the whole release

367
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,330
overcome a pneumatic for some

368
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,700
function in a manner Lee homered each
Arthur

369
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,720
so with totally ASCII compliant

370

00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:43,580
I'll it shows a got system

380
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,710
if it didn't get system with this
statement it will be used

381
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:52,520
the talking about something anything
going to take me I'll hospital and then

382

I'll

383
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:56,450
here we go we r system

384
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,470
and its common there on works

385
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:04,590

so Walmart

404
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,440
well we go to the one that wins for the
database software

405
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,720
and we are able to communicate with the
tournament or

406

people our profit true the on the
bizarre

409
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:33,090
so I'll what more can be achieved well

410
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:38,090
you can said interior we are all
user-defined function

00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:19,820
on this boss as said it's running

470
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,590
prime as national service

471
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:27,500
not specified is this auspices simplex

472
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,770
and I must be trained in the world over
they're both out cold

473
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:34,010
and then using OS both lot which
exploits

474
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:39,640
as specific single server behold message
organizers are for

475
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,240
to the novel sing along with the first
time only

476
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,390
tool 12 these exploits

477
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:50,220
reliable why it's reliable

478
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,130
on wheels 40 I get it when his father
and three

479
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:58,300
bronwyn that enable and it is a new

480
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:02,030
II overthrow during our visit

481
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:05,380
in a specific store procedure quite hard
to

482
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:10,140
to to exploit actually later on other

483
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,480
open source and commercial frameworks
ever implemented

484
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,910
these exploits as far as in all while
commercial framework

485
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:22,450
as is only displays for visiting our
meeting that bypasses that the other

486
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,080
doesn't

487
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,940
and minutes played as well as recently
implemented the wrong

488
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:31,330
%uh exploit which is

489
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:34,510
well as well

490
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:38,260
so as her

491
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:42,570
connected to the base fingerprints is
for you it does it's going to explode

492
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:46,310
this a memory corruption are busy

493
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:49,590
so a game about you how you want to

494
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:53,360
force the Metasploit show which in this
case will be

495
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,310
%uh injected executed

496
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:01,250
wheeling the failed three years about
her little

497
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:04,550
married that's the way the whole lot of
times it's fine

498
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:07,870
this case they also asked which is the
failing all their to use

499
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:11,540
I will be the one in his letter dated by
and beer

500
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:15,290
cars last it created it was very

501
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:19,710
this time done disease

502
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:23,800
fun is the old

503
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,110
that exploit this buffer overflow first

504
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:30,290
and second as you can see there are no
single or small the

505
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:33,890
also it again to read the bus needed

506
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:37,740
I yes and ings

507
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,030
as you can see it it sounds center stage

508
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:44,760
because my didn't matter some HMO's

509
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,620
stage exploited it was they want to a
very small tables

510
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,250
to feed within the area that they can

511
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:56,940
overflow a game

512
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,630
transit national service this process

513
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:06,320
it abuses people market I warehouses

514
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,399
just going to the Buffalo tonight much
in this case

515
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,600
nucleus said and her such

516
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,710
grimy screens around beer I cannot

517
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,780
bombs sold I've got some

518
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:25,899
ashes so these are the possible possible
worlds

519
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:29,110
I'm at Health and Hospitals you

520
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:32,480
four different already system users

521
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,100
I am also used abuse this

522
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,669
but was to all other russians how policy

523
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:43,780
a right now seconds flat

524
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:47,419
so but

525
00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:50,550
was it's being to do right now

526
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:53,740
summing up conclusions wasn't

527
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:57,520
mean to deal with daytime is not today's

528
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,250
well GoToAssist with his management
system

529
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,520
want to go that high doses be there a
game

530
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,290
by a weather station by it stand-alone
lambskin

531
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:11,500
singers when our bodies company

532
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,770
any any bilateral issues to access a
database

533
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:20,179
to this point about how is Yahoo taxes
swamp the underlying numbers is the man

534
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:20,929
from them

535
00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:24,760
escalated religious power by am using

536
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,470
consoles with information mostly on
manned by its

537
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:31,540
and up services usually there are

538
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:35,399
services week permission and abuse in
their online system so

539
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:39,950
once you are able to mining-related
service though in the service

540
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:43,700
well mexicans your own polls annual on
both

541
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,399
we'll create an option for the poor may
not be used for or even worse an

542
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:51,320
enterprise the nominees for the future

543
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,950
so I'll when he was I previous

544
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,380
OS user-to-user you cannot yes

545
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:02,090
and try for its pride in our own
directly

546
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:06,169
it's possible by design office on the
tropical

547
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:09,750
to use the tell them or NTLM

548
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:13,169
or NTLM version true I'm

549
00:34:13,169 --> 00:34:16,260
hash to connect directly over

550
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,679
NetBIOS and thats or a Amazon

551
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,710
mad a semi for 405 I wrote a tool to the
dust

552
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:28,589
just 10 minutes and you can't really
don't know it so the next that will be

553
00:34:28,589 --> 00:34:30,580
just like little macarthur

554
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:34,060
for both the whole or you was sinking of

555
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,780
right time flag right right fire

556
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,149
yeah fashion ardent of clothes 5 in
their way towards

557
00:34:41,149 --> 00:34:44,620
to buy this for you about you can use by
Julien's

558
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:48,280
to create a portable executable up a bit
so it's one fighter clothing

559
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,490
and then you call this tool by hoskins

560
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:55,149
yellow metal's hushed up just this one

561
00:34:55,149 --> 00:34:58,950
or any other outcome many clear that's
cause for

562
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:02,410
and user content in the hospital MSI MS

563
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:05,410
cash any entitled to an awesome

564
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:09,240
ashes he is problem parsing recognize

565
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,460
you mustn't also this hopefuls at least

566
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,680
the man's and it will trying all yeses

567
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,609
thank you and here to passwords again
all those

568
00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:22,870
ball says that the specified so you know
exactly one shot

569
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,830
how many bosses you can build one can
over SMB

570
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:32,520
four-member such so

571
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:39,120
questions
