1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,040
okay so we have agreat talk until now

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,810
by nick of soul some of those uh... can
cope

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,739
and uh... capital

4
00:00:09,739 --> 00:00:12,349
thanks

5
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:14,019
so long

6
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:17,650
recommend her body to this awesome
called friends and to my talk that is

7
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,400
about as the title states

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,590
uncovering as there are days and advance
housing techniques

9
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,539
uh... you had seen several methods and
this talk about how to get the two

10
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:30,619
routes to successfully unlocked

11
00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:31,689
unix

12
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:33,040
and windows solaris

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,160
and more

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,450
uh... in case you have questions or
comments please ask a comment right

15
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:45,450
after the presentation

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,690
because of the presentation is displayed
on the council i'd on the screen

17
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,940
uh... we will start with the short
introduction about who i am

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,140
then i will introduce you to the topic
of the car and

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,580
presentation off the what's we are going
to discuss the main topic which i

20
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,840
entitled

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,270
ortiz and the rush for public with her
abilities

22
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,670
must advance causing techniques

23
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,350
the reason why i put

24
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,010
rush for a public banner abilities until
the title is that

25
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,860
as some of you might know

26
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,390
i did put much work into exploring
whether abilities

27
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,280
that had been already publicly announced

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,700
yeah as a side note

29
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,530
the discussion of the speech can be
applied to any operating system

30
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,060
including the window series of operating
systems

31
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:37,200
most off the detail yet directly apply
to unix systems like lineups

32
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,890
b_s_t_ or solaris

33
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,890
the upcoming slide contains information
about myself

34
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,880
so who am i

35
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,700
realize actually come on in both windows
and linux it's and will display the

36
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,740
county logged in user

37
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,759
just mention that

38
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,539
uh... mine a mystical also bylaws added
some of you well no

39
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:09,199
the nickname ideas through all of my
time of the hacker this thing called

40
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,199
i let them grow up to germany

41
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,669
and uh... billet shibuya frank vogel

42
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:20,150
all my family is greek so off both of
our parents

43
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,399
as some of you

44
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:25,340
might have noticed by reading my public
runner ability advisories

45
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,569
i feel connected to mike recruits

46
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:32,550
i have a strong personal i'd like a king
self-rule

47
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,160
rediscovering wilder abilities writing
exploits upright all to finding out how

48
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,279
the self brown facing us running

49
00:02:40,279 --> 00:02:45,540
i started being active with packing
before the date displayed on the screen

50
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,209
i can do you remember bill

51
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:52,179
better brought my plus reworking exploit
back in two thousand three

52
00:02:52,179 --> 00:02:55,659
and the past life been working as a
penetration tester richard

53
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:58,909
with the company base in germany nearby
mileage

54
00:02:58,909 --> 00:02:59,700
yen

55
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,349
cowardly i do want their ability
research

56
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:11,349
so i would just proceed with
introduction of the public today

57
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:20,770
from weekend defined brodeur abilities
since ever colossus

58
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,810
that have been developed over the course
of time

59
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:29,569
every colossal blunder abilities has its
advantages and disadvantages

60
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:30,950
remote exploits

61
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,750
can be tried as exploits that when run
by the attacker

62
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:40,589
gain access to the system silently and
without user intervention

63
00:03:40,589 --> 00:03:43,739
scanf s can be additionally programmed
to support

64
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,779
a remote exploits it means of
discovering vulnerable so gross

65
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:53,529
sometimes remote exploits do not used to
the desired privileges on the remote

66
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:54,819
system

67
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:57,090
so the class of local road exploits

68
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,319
can be used to gain elevated privileges

69
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,639
will corrode exploits can be used
uniquely to at the scene a real revered

70
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,799
sect are already has access to the
system

71
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,309
aroudn the informal when their abilities

72
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:15,980
out the client side with her abilities
that when

73
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,630
exploitative attack

74
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,129
entities and organizations companies
individual users

75
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:27,119
the clients at the texts nominee require
user intervention of the victim

76
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:29,030
and this particular talk

77
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,949
i would especially illustrate

78
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:32,909
how remote softer false

79
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:39,050
remotely their abilities i discovered an
exploitive

80
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,719
most parts of his discussion can be
applied to local and client

81
00:04:43,719 --> 00:04:49,740
when their abilities

82
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,209
that's for sure discovering doing our
abilities since kisi

83
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:58,619
uh... program program as around the
world constantly do mistakes

84
00:04:58,619 --> 00:05:00,039
and introduce

85
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:01,430
flawless especially

86
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,020
when you reach us all persons are
implemented

87
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,380
an interested the tech up there for can
be like in discovering grow their

88
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,240
abilities but looking into

89
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,790
about c_b_s_ bills

90
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:18,279
well for example reversing updates

91
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:22,169
every new technology brings new
possibilities for the attack not

92
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:23,330
the reason for this

93
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,880
is that new technologies

94
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,880
are in nature and only get secure after
several use of patching in crafting

95
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,099
discovering flaws can be fun when you
have to be appropriate to set up

96
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:39,969
like you would see in the upcoming slide
about the environment that needs to be

97
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:42,330
set out to be successful

98
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:47,539
there is no secret everyone cooks with
water just needs passion time experience

99
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:54,539
and good music

100
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,630
now to the environment

101
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:03,360
that needs to be build-up before
auditing for werner abilities can begin

102
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,140
good will definitely

103
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,139
needs virtual machines

104
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:08,269
the reason this

105
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:13,499
ritual machines can be easily installed
and use nowadays

106
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:16,169
the amsa perfect or proposals

107
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:19,240
many operating systems let's say targets

108
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,620
can be installed

109
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,220
the running of the ems can be used to

110
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:29,439
for adding offset some values for a
different exploit targets to

111
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,780
i remember the time i was not aware of
virtual machines

112
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,610
i wanted to exploit a window flow and
had bird like

113
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,040
tamil more cds

114
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,930
every cd containing its own windows
version of windows language

115
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,639
so i took the city's one-by-one and
started on real aqua

116
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,110
wada time over half

117
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,130
if you can't have it so simple with
little machines

118
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,869
digest installed software said they'd be
m

119
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:57,949
and if the gossip rating plates you
won't loose dot dot

120
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:02,689
except the roof that's inside the bme
but that's a different story

121
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:06,690
what example setup this as you will also
see in the next slide

122
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,490
their windows seven aust

123
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,819
with several guests installed like

124
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:16,169
window a split up some previous these
embarrass eighty six and so on

125
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,509
as a side note

126
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:19,949
you can easily do cal debugging

127
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:21,110
they're using pipes

128
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,099
without using the real seria live on the
real hard work

129
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:29,759
so this is an ob it wanted shoe as
neutral machines

130
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,310
there is a lot of stuff that you can use
to do it for this propose

131
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,879
the embargo workstation oracle
virtualbox julia malone

132
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:38,199
and so on

133
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:45,199
diablo sleepy noviembre book station
over the years

134
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,900
that's the screened on behalf of the two
machine

135
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:55,180
running for freebsd inside avital seven
host insulation

136
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,260
it illustrates

137
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:01,189
illustrates quite pretty why g_m_'s have
many advantages

138
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,089
at the left name

139
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:08,339
you can see the operating systems but
never installed and already bill away

140
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:10,949
lable for booting

141
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:11,999
by the way

142
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:14,080
previously previous iran's

143
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,110
very stable unsaid bbm and installation
is quick another upset is that the hot

144
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,110
the stuff that the m gross according to
the use it should

145
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,930
so you don't need like twenty ppm

146
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,419
first place

147
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:27,430
the next slide

148
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,230
will be about important to us that a
person he prefer i'd recommend when

149
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:36,220
doing out its

150
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,450
the tools

151
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:45,100
a bigot launchers is the ability to
program right coat

152
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,760
so a bit too i included is the kind of
programming language the one you like

153
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,900
most

154
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,569
interpreted languages like peril

155
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,770
or pipes on

156
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,390
can be used to easily for pos software

157
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:59,220
developed

158
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,520
and bright exploit itself

159
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,130
and other proposals the high-level
programming language s

160
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,220
have this writing all tools

161
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,540
take the example you want to observe
processes how they're on the set raw

162
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,610
some positives require native codes and

163
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,630
language like c

164
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,260
especially local exploits tend to be
written in c

165
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,430
another example our pc exploits

166
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,139
and of course it looks

167
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:30,970
much more lead to code in c

168
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:37,970
especially when you when they had a
common so a lot of them back to exploit

169
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,519
the startling unix tools are present

170
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,460
most of you will have grew up with them

are important investigate box

172
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,450

especially traces like esterase pull it

00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,320

will come out to discover whether
abilities ferreting source code

236
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:27,100
and by doing binary roasting

237
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,779
to audit by looking at cells called

238
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,739
of course that this required but the
reason we don't know what's the

239
00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:38,790
programming language quite well

240
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:43,080
i personally prefer reading signal
because most of the unix rose buildup on

241
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,240
c

242
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,540
some box can be discovered

243
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:52,210
unexploited without reading one line of
code

244
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:56,090
one good example for this is the apache
range spice

245
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,630
denial of service that

246
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,970
if you heard about it will make a remote
apache installation non-responsive what

247
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,800
effect of the so-called apache killa

248
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,940
the apache killer was discovered by the
causing only mils soul scott was through

249
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,900
a study by beth use just plain causing

250
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,200
this topic will be covered in the next
lives

251
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,250
in contrast to the apache bach

252
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,920
most of the time forced me to be
research

253
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,550
everyting soft coral

254
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,140
to understand the weaknesses spent to
build a stable exploit but taking it

255
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,880
want to show those

256
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,580
one example is a prolific acadia remote
exploits

257
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,870
i have been looking on in the past

258
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:42,250
and is heavily relied on understanding
the sales growth

259
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,680
at the bottom off the slides

260
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,790
trying to determine the situation

261
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,850
one of the critical code lines that made
this publicly announced vulnerability

262
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,700
possible

263
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,290
and the top while the buffer length this
verified

264
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,180
wild offline

265
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,349
to be now this can result in a sec days
copper we're on

266
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:06,109
but the baf land changes to the negative
value

267
00:15:06,109 --> 00:15:09,410
and that is indeed possible

268
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,560
sometimes the sales quotas not available
proud that technology sabha find other

269
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,590
ways to understand the software

270
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:21,810
one way to understand binary code has to
do

271
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,850
binary reversing

272
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,840
binary reversing requires quick
knowledge i'll pass on block

273
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,910
but it's a very good

274
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,640
to understand eighty successively

275
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,880
because this is the most deployed to
process are

276
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,749
at least

277
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:39,630
and the desktop and server wrote

278
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:43,119

280
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:51,520
running some lower risk can be done to
understand disassembled all quote

281
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,620
the interactive disassemble

282
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,410
there's a good tool probe in every

top rosalie

284
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:02,450
tend to look at suspicious car passed

286
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:10,690
weeding cells called or binary roseanne
is very effective

287
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,340
when doing parallel testing in recent
now rials

288
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,320
and other factors that binary rules they
can be used to develop they exploit

289
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,880
itself

290
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,260
for example the priority p_d_ exploit
heavily relied on disassembly codes

291
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:31,010
defied all seth a specific awsome
instructions

292
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:33,800
the screen dump at the bottom shows

293
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,960
an example of a disassembly

294
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,399
it is the right b_r_t_ entry points

295
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,900
they exploit relied on

296
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:45,730
in order to be able to leak process
memories for further processing

297
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:51,350
s describe before borrowed testing means
testing output to coco pops andrea test

298
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,970
cases

299
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,029
this includes housing around

300
00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:56,790
the critical cole pulse

301
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:59,430
to on come up with her abilities

302
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:06,430
and that takes us for the next topic i
want to present today

303
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:13,790
cmi ultimata causing with propriety

304
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,780
but i polis xenia automatic causing

305
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,330
because nothing is done probably by the
programming language like world

306
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:22,589
and more important

307
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:25,850
done by the knowledge of the program a

308
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,030
this housing technique can be especially
effective

309
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:33,080
propane tanks protocols because human
being simply on the stamp latex

310
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,950
particles c_v_r_

311
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:39,650
and therefore penthouse more confortable

312
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,840
role by the republican party

313
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,360
can be done this way

314
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,250
smitha dumps retrieved prompt for
example the white sharks in the fall

315
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,630
are required

316
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,240
one downside is that

317
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,789
usually only in the initial packets of
the binary protocol can be covered

318
00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:01,200
the reason for business that battery
protocols tend to be more complex

319
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,480
and a lot of packets i exchanged

320
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,990
but they are only visible in binary form
for the program a

321
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,060
thousands

322
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:15,340
i want to mention that library somewhat
yourself the programming language can be

323
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,500
bows

00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,650
high-level

325
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:22,450
that want it's just that neelima if not
all of the binary protocol discovered

326
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,260
during the housing session

327
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,270
since

328
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,500
the library of module as the cold
already in place and we have the ability

329
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:36,270
to speak to the seller side in the
convenient manner

330
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,070
to make you understand why

331
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:42,160
the knowledge of the program a about the
protocol is so important

332
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,679
i would continue with the causing
templates

333
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:51,679
are you still up in the past amber
destructive the several parts of it

334
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,420
this very basic template you see on the
screen

335
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,630
written employer this very effective
when used properly

336
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,780
the script when ron

337
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,610
corrupt connects to the remote service

338
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:11,040
and this case fees of our steam comport
eighty-eight she deeply

339
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,810
as you see in the comments

340
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,789
says the payload and greets

341
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:16,830
the response

342
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,200
the crucial potter's railroad

343
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,520
looked causing ideas here

344
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,910
so the program a

345
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:27,160
texas knowledge about the protocol to
attack

346
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:32,390
and coast possible packets that might
make the service failed

347
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,210
the packets can include overly large
swings

348
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,059
pemain string specify as

349
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:42,340
apec it's adjusted his to test the
specific too suspicious code profit

350
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:48,840
reviewed by using binary roasting or
called auditing

351
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,860
this template can be extended sc

352
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:55,580
to sent several pecos by repeating it

353
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,429
it can be extended in the way

354
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,840
the packets are rep after the response

355
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:06,390
and hurling packets are sent and so on

356
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,710
bd

357
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,980
the template and the previous life tend
to use a binary protocols by just

358
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,510
replacing the payload

359
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,549
with binary dot south

360
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,809
each modification of the packet

361
00:20:19,809 --> 00:20:22,029
to send us run as a test case

362
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:24,030
against the syllabus

363
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,220
each test case

364
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,100
might have resulted in the fall

365
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,580
so that were requested such self on the
remote site using pesos like the one

366
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,299
described in the previous lights

367
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,060
astray straws

368
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,640
another tool to mention stopped

369
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,660
which can be used to inspect memory ncp
you use a check

370
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,850
for example

371
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:47,160
a spike in memory hughes which out the
request the sent

372
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,650
can indicate the memory consumption

373
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,020
or denial silva sole

374
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,870
this during the talking session

375
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,730
we successfully fought a box

376
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,559
and it sure about that

377
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,760
the motor abilities research and explode
written

378
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,610
extending the basic template

379
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,610
the following example shows how the
basic template

380
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,840
was extended to real exploit

381
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,150
after barry fighting a border ability
will sit on

382
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,379
in this case

383
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:16,140
we will rediscover

384
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:23,140
the apache remote denial of service and
write parts of the apache killa

385
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:29,440
the slide show us the very basic

386
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,790
housing template at the top

387
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,660
islt you can see that everybody

388
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,500
during two thousand session i decided to
plaza specific h_t_t_p_ head out that is

389
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:47,240
supported by default by the apache web
so well its name is strange buys

390
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,070
we enter the race parades bites that
uh... been assembled warm into the

391
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,170
template

392
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:56,330
and looked at we can break at that she
will do it

393
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,639
the rains set up in a simple form

394
00:21:58,639 --> 00:22:00,580
does not make the rep so will prevail

395
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:04,410
so we had a overly long had out with
overlapping ranges

396
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,390
to the cost them blade ansi

397
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:13,390
but their pets you behaves unexpected

398
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,800
anne beat

399
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,639
but talk to our shows a spike in memory
users

400
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:21,470
so we assume

401
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:27,210
this might be a flawed to handling of
the range by setup

402
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:31,870
the memory leak israel we have our fifty
requests are related to the apache web

403
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,679
server using the perma dual

404
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,909
parallels ball manager

405
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:38,100
the result is

406
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,710
that they'd see h_t_t_p_ did become some
responses

407
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,090
and because of running auto subspace

408
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:47,230
many processes that killed and the
operating system

409
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:50,320
the system hangs

410
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,390
a different way of causing software that
especially invoice engulfs

411
00:22:54,390 --> 00:23:01,390
battery protocols will be discussed now

412
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,659
nowadays

413
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:08,419
many are critical open-source programs
in the unix wrote

414
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:11,270
i've written in c and c plus plus

415
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,049
shelled from experience

416
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:18,390
housing by modifying c sauce on the
flight can be very effective

417
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:22,880
housing housing by using c sauce gamba
confortable and easy to do

418
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,560
even with complex protocols

419
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,410
how can you tell us using this technique

420
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,620
so simple

421
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,559
the targets of those shows are

422
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,230
and compiled

423
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:36,109
let's take the example of some bob

424
00:23:36,109 --> 00:23:37,210
only nuts

425
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:42,220
bsn bt services compiled and executed
and said the testing and why rent

426
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,210
so it can be audited though

427
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,620
now the plants also is like for example
s and b clients

428
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:56,590
are compiled an off of the compilation
of both parts the audit can begin

429
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:01,770
the clients losses a modified during the
pausing session step-by-step

430
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:04,820
and after each modification east
testcase

431
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:11,820
eskom pirate and run against the soviets

432
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:17,919
using this technique we can discover not
only buffalo barons and the like

433
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,190
that also logic box

434
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:24,400
if you want to discover logic box we
need a strong understanding of the

435
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,830
cultural and the product software b
apparently auditing

436
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,150
the suspiciously

437
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,930
client code clients

438
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:37,539
i've changed in a way to parole logic
box upon this oversight

439
00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:40,440
by being the commonly known brunner
ability is like

440
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,739
buff overruns

441
00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:43,340
memory corruptions

442
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,370
tomas ring box and so on

443
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:48,460
denby were don rather blindly

444
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,570
to accomplish those who do the following

445
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,450
we look for the critical code and see
sauce

446
00:24:54,450 --> 00:25:00,289
like electrical airport come on time the
court all parcels

447
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:04,659
and as a side note which we can all get
results when doing housing tests

448
00:25:04,659 --> 00:25:06,919
easier pots of the sauce

449
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:09,770
it is important to dig deeper into the
coach

450
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:13,789
went to the more complex leah sofa
software as these mails

451
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:16,990
tend to be more were durable

452
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:22,020
now which means the buffer called and
said let's one-by-one

453
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,950
each modification of baffles

454
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:25,280
than the client code

455
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,840
is comprised untested against the
service

456
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,510
the next live contains a spring dob
illustrating coaching deals and the s_

457
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:39,510
and the client to potentially provoke a
buffer overrun

458
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,350
there's a lot of places we can modify
coatings ambala

459
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,509
the screen dump shows a very simple
location of the client

460
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:55,690
but it's a very shortly office of the
client

461
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,010
the cmd log-on function

462
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:01,980
the dust parts of the s of these
sessions setup

463
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,250
changed and the man out but the partial
birth center long passport p_b_s_ and be

464
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:08,070
service

465
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,159
i put about but with the size

466
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,870
eight thousand ninety-six filled with a
sense of the source code

467
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:18,140
that i've typically typically session
sent out the mods

468
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,740
i've come on comments about the copies

469
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,130
when they could use which

470
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,470
and the other copy unchanged alliance
where the bop bop

471
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:29,539
and stopped the length is written

472
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:31,440
now the court can be compiled

473
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,260
along crosswalk will be sent to this and
be service

474
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:42,570
i have to know that sometimes deal but
he long buffer lengths out truncate his

475
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,200
and set the client itself

476
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,000
because they are all so long

477
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,419
so sometimes these size checks and set
the client sauce

478
00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:53,820
me to be changed to insert the packet
was sent with the correct overly long

479
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,980
about the size

480
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,250
sometimes we need to adjust several
buffer sizes

481
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,510
because the babble sword

482
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,780
the dot doc

483
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,990
that got overflow

484
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,910
and the client envy

485
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:09,920
might get sick mentation by eleven
violations in the clients have prior to

486
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,590
sending out the packet

487
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,149
another notice that popo grounds

488
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:19,010
sometimes need to be and the specific
range

489
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:22,560
it's not enough to make the bottles as
large as possible

490
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,080
sometimes small about the size of

491
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:31,110
richard m_ overrun duress lovable for
says this will mob

492
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,090
then we have successfully discovered the
runner ability

493
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:38,890
we're going to exploiters and the
several stages to do this i described in

494
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:45,890
the next section

495
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:48,510
logic box i'm nice to have

496
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:55,230
sensex plus the logic docs can be more
stable effect if any easier to develop

497
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,000
buffalo overruns and memory corruptions

498
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,010
can be a stable and effective as logic
box

499
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:05,940
exploiting them as children might
president experience more time kam

500
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,149
consuming

501
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:10,870
the goal is to retrieve a remote shot

502
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:15,090
accommoda line so the attack at getting
children to the system and late into the

503
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,600
network

504
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,429
a straightforward way to do this is

505
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:24,010
in the case of pop over on some memory
corruption instill

506
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:26,880
that's memory to hit the good place to

507
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,100
controlled the instruction pointer

508
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,920
it's eighty six it is caught the eye p

509
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,580
after watts

510
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,290
bypass protections like bsl r

511
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:42,080
bedrest space layout random ization and
that makes

512
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,730
the nam execute a little bit bit on mon
executed bill mappings

513
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,080
what a m d sixty four

514
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:53,800
thereafter all paid off can be executed
to successfully execute the shell

515
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,399
i personally prefer retrievers shouts
and likes bright codes

516
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:03,920
because this makes a profit possible to
leave eight iowa protections

517
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,440
most of the work of both

518
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,350
to start using it debug elect jim

519
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,660
at the time

520
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,580
graphics pipelining

521
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:16,730
quite stable burst through this time to
at targets

522
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:22,220
the next stage is to say and it just
exploit in the white in real world

523
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:26,440
a crucial station exploit writing
nowadays esta bypassed protections like

524
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,800
a s_ o_ r_

525
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,190
so we will have a look at that

526
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:37,190
and how it's done lit up some x_-eighty
six bed from a bit closer

527
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:44,909
required for bypassing address space
layout randomization arlette ups

528
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:48,890
december control or what the instruction
pointer

529
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,110
for example

530
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:52,140
tape respecto heaps smashing

531
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:56,190
overwriting a bunch of point up

532
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:59,920
so as soon as we have to control over
the instruction pointer

533
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,000
the address basis randomized so will be
jump to

534
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,549
seca dresses addresses of libraries

535
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:09,700
heats up libraries already the mice

536
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,400
the image referred to as the tech
segment

537
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,850
consider them for the code segments

538
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:18,970
is not randomized

539
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:23,720
that's a lobbyist lobbyist of our
implementation of limits

540
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,669
as high-powered us that good a colleague
of say yes so there are

541
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:28,879
implementation

542
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:30,630
this week by design

543
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:35,220
they are all the methods which a more
complete to protect systems like packs

544
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,570
execute headsets

545
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:43,770
position independent execute the bones

546
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:48,230
since they don't see this is week ansel
our implementation betty ford i refer to

547
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,930
it to you

548
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:54,890
what we do is to be jump back into the
text segment because it's at the space

549
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:59,480
has a six address and as predictable

550
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,810
at the time of the sliding up those new
verified that the straw was not matched

551
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,909
but he's not in the recent goal

552
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:07,630
from two thousand twelve

553
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:14,630
has the following it image illustrates

554
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:23,720
the example shows the memory of apple
priority p_d_ running on the notes

555
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:26,779
the bill registro stop a rating system
version

556
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:28,409
and tell bill date

557
00:31:28,409 --> 00:31:31,340
letters from january of this year

558
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,559
yellow regine

559
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,960
shows the virtual memory space that is
not randomized

560
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,440
and the rep regine shows the ritual
mammy space

561
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,820
that is randomized

562
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:46,409
you can obviously see but look at the
very top left author yela regine

563
00:31:46,409 --> 00:31:49,710
that the base address up the process
tech segment

564
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,980
stayed the same

565
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:57,220
after proactive p_d_ has been was
startled

566
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:02,019
as to the tech segment was always mock
tests being readable and execute a bull

567
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:08,420
we can't jump to it an execute code and
set the segment

568
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,920
the previously described law is very
important for bypassing i_s_l_ are on

569
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,820
the notes

570
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:18,600
bypassing i a sellout bill involves much
more than the fact that the address

571
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:25,600
basis only partly randomized

572
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:32,870
the broadest it began to execute code to
get the shot running

573
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,440
might be true

574
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,620
the steps involved traditional album
balding we look out beyond that point

575
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:42,490
and that the sixty-four beauty entry
using i dot

576
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:47,230
this depends on what and that was
available in the process called cold

577
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,270
that at all

578
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:53,430
from the p_n_c_ entry weekend indirectly
jump to the randomized elaborate

579
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,660
function

580
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:00,580
we look up the mam copy purity entry
using i dot

581
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,370
as the next step

582
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,850
who use

583
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:09,210
i'm up to met with spree memory ration
with required an execute permission seen

584
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:16,210
a build so we can copy code into this
memory regine

585
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:20,580
next to use them copied to copy bites
from the text segments

586
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,770
to the newly-created memory agin

587
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:25,330
the proposal despised being copied

588
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,080
is a copy of the shall quote

589
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:32,060
who worked with the new memory regine

590
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:36,409
we jump to the copy were team that will
copy the shuttle

591
00:33:36,409 --> 00:33:40,390
yeah and the payload that working soon
we will show this executed

592
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:43,809
texas to actually called the m_f_n_ them
copied functions

593
00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:47,950
we need to use returned oriented
programming

594
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:51,870
i'm going to show you know much about
area salah bypass technique

595
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:58,870
and will explain it using the
illustration art

596
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,610
the image of the first

597
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,370
consulates complex

598
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:07,950
so i will explain how to successfully
run the show cold

599
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,320
at the left side

600
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,750
we have the attack on

601
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:15,389
at the right wing of the proactive p_t_
process memory space

602
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:18,030
the great prod off the memory space

603
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,859
is there not randomized memory

604
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:23,239
and the rat pappas the randomized memory

605
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,899
we can only execute

606
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:27,769
code inside the great part

607
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:34,519
executing code and the rep pappas horny
possible indirectly as we will see

608
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:37,149
so their tech at number one

609
00:34:37,149 --> 00:34:41,389
connects to the remote f_t_ piece of art
no login credentials on you to execute

610
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:43,499
gold

611
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:45,079
we expect that uses frog

612
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:48,499
the baby a should feel returned oriented
programming

613
00:34:48,499 --> 00:34:49,550
to execute it

614
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:54,189
several functions inset next segment one
by one

615
00:34:54,189 --> 00:34:55,490
the first one chin

616
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,289
we jump to his cm at

617
00:34:57,289 --> 00:34:58,689
g_o_t_ entry

618
00:34:58,689 --> 00:35:02,649
peyote entries allow us to jump to the
randomized memory blocked

619
00:35:02,649 --> 00:35:08,509
now finally execute the lab rian system
called

620
00:35:08,509 --> 00:35:09,799
at number two

621
00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:13,739
am at escort to create the required an
execute a board member mapping at a

622
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:15,329
fixed address

623
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:17,839
the newly-created memory mapping is
shown

624
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:22,619
and this image of the bottom as doc
yellow

625
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:27,389
we need to have this memory because we
need to fix i'm randomized plays we can

626
00:35:27,389 --> 00:35:28,789
write the shout go to

627
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:31,480
and we needed a place that is executed
rule

628
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:36,739
to execute the shuttle

629
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:41,319
wants we have created mapping we use rop
again at number three

630
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:46,879
to be exicted to be able to execute a
new function

631
00:35:46,879 --> 00:35:48,709
this much of this man copy

632
00:35:48,709 --> 00:35:51,429
but not before

633
00:35:51,429 --> 00:35:55,899
make use of the beauty entry to rescind
randomized library function and the rat

634
00:35:55,899 --> 00:35:58,699
regine

635
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:01,440
for the man copied to permit is a need
it

636
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,649
while the cement copy itself

637
00:36:03,649 --> 00:36:06,979
and dot the one suburb edible mnemonic
ps

638
00:36:06,979 --> 00:36:09,229
like assembly instructions

639
00:36:09,229 --> 00:36:12,379
inside the tech segment we copy

640
00:36:12,379 --> 00:36:15,989
now use imap copy and rocked special
bites one-by-one

641
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:19,489
from the text segment to the
newly-created memory mapping

642
00:36:19,489 --> 00:36:22,789
at the bottom

643
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:28,549
these special diets isobel as fractions
which once collected ir you straight up

644
00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:29,539
or

645
00:36:29,539 --> 00:36:33,239
copying the shackleton executing it

646
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:37,729
once we have forty copy of the buys from
texas ecm into the new mapping we'd me

647
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:41,919
just jump to the bites at number five

648
00:36:41,919 --> 00:36:44,479
which i thought copier gets executed

649
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:47,719
ebu copied the shout quote from the
start

650
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:48,869
feathered dawn

651
00:36:48,869 --> 00:36:53,059
of the required to execute mapping

652
00:36:53,059 --> 00:36:59,639
timely we jump to the shuttle find out
itself that number six

653
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:03,429
finally we jump two percent board itself
that number six old the shuttle to get

654
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,279
executed

655
00:37:05,279 --> 00:37:08,579
adsense pectoris fished out to be taken

656
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:12,269
at seven

657
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:16,430
this plight that uses exactly this
technique to bypass a hassle hours

658
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:19,529
publicly available under the name pro
active duty

659
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:21,589
i agree more toward exploit

660
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:25,719
this exploit uses stack baseball forum
to execute code

661
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:29,029
and the rotor ability for it was
publicly announced ban anonymous

662
00:37:29,029 --> 00:37:31,329
individual and uh... advisory

663
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:32,949
working with is that the i

664
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:35,639
busy work day initiative

665
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:38,279
because logic box can be fun too

666
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:43,019
and i'm going to be effective we will
discuss them now

667
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:49,679
though

668
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:53,829
sensex plotting logic most strongly
depends on the nature of the back

669
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:58,640
and can be called complex i give the
previous t if t p t remote exploit

670
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:03,039
which once was a no day as an example

671
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:04,459
the scenarios

672
00:38:04,459 --> 00:38:08,189
there's not really was that weekend
though it's an opportunity nomic county

673
00:38:08,189 --> 00:38:12,999
linked library into the process of fifty
p selva

674
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:16,589
we can't do that because the locked in
to use those inside the c_h_ word

675
00:38:16,589 --> 00:38:17,749
environment

676
00:38:17,749 --> 00:38:24,619
and weakened by five so that this using
death to be protocol

677
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:26,579
how do we exploit the flow

678
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:30,309
we need a way to break the c_h_ short an
execute code

679
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:34,439
the easiest way in my opinion this tour

680
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:36,869
program economical i've read that

681
00:38:36,869 --> 00:38:38,470
breaks the c_h_ route

682
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,650
but using the picture a system called

683
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,550
betrays is a system called

684
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:46,779
but allow us to debug processes

685
00:38:46,779 --> 00:38:51,759
so we attach to an ic system picked
existing freebsd process but once this

686
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:52,699
route

687
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:54,729
using p trace

688
00:38:54,729 --> 00:39:00,719
then we copy the shout quote into the
ruled on process again by using p trace

689
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:03,949
the lost that person that the process
continue

690
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:10,179
at the shuttle position so the shuttle
gets executed

691
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:13,230
the an expert on n_b_c_'s sixty four ten

692
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:14,920
and this particular case

693
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:20,700
bypassed easily because on freebsd bessa
replied execute memory mac mapping

694
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,579
india sticky process

695
00:39:22,579 --> 00:39:24,849
i guess guests that this is

696
00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:27,589
the case and all the previous e
processes

697
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:30,839
so rewrite the check wrote into this
region

698
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:33,039
now that pete rose from the court and
said

699
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:40,039
the mapping

700
00:39:40,499 --> 00:39:47,499
i will show you the procedure depiction
of

701
00:39:48,269 --> 00:39:51,249
and this picture a

702
00:39:51,249 --> 00:39:55,430
uh... press the attack at the left and
the seller running this fifty p service

703
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:59,189
at the right

704
00:39:59,189 --> 00:40:02,640
detector connects to the f_ t_ pizza but
i'm not saying using

705
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,629
the credentials

706
00:40:05,629 --> 00:40:09,379
the s_d_p_ service once inside a c_h_
food environment

707
00:40:09,379 --> 00:40:13,369
soviet tech outlets economic library
onto the prior system

708
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,039
and the library breaks out

709
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:21,529
of the seat ruled attaching to the root
on pro says using p trays

710
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:23,599
the process and priscilla stopped

711
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:24,719
state now

712
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:28,410
process katee dates to attach to either
dean krohn

713
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:30,050
so sloppy sendmail

714
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:31,739
or any other known

715
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:32,680
that name

716
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,899
road don't process

717
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:38,319
the shock vote is injected into the
running process

718
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:41,090
we got the process continue at the
shuttle position

719
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:43,069
and as shown in the six sample

720
00:40:43,069 --> 00:40:44,089
utica gets

721
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:47,799
mecca reverse roe chelle

722
00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:50,339
we have our desired which are

723
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:54,489
banal need to make the exploit a stable
of pulp fullest possible

724
00:40:54,489 --> 00:41:01,489
i would describe ideas about how to make
this in the next section

725
00:41:03,209 --> 00:41:05,609
her way to make the exploit more
powerful

726
00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:07,609
his batting targets through it

727
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:08,979
the reason is simple

728
00:41:08,979 --> 00:41:13,329
we want to support as many as possible
warner role installations

729
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:16,159
that are out there in the internet

730
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:18,799
targets can be divided two pilots

731
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:21,369
who supported operating system

732
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:25,199
the support of software version on the
operating system

733
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,539
we create the environment by selling as
many possible virtual machines

734
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:35,670
with the literal below operating systems
and self diversions

735
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:42,670
we need to get the offsets and possibly
other bloodiest need to be examined

736
00:41:52,769 --> 00:41:53,959
as the first step

737
00:41:53,959 --> 00:41:56,869
we had hoped would exploit

738
00:41:56,869 --> 00:42:00,429
uh... before the start of integration
part of selection

739
00:42:00,429 --> 00:42:02,879
bordering three examples

740
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,730
of three different exploits

741
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:05,540
we show

742
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:10,689
what has to be added to the exploit to
support role where since

743
00:42:10,689 --> 00:42:14,960
the priority p_d_ exploit was designed
to make it easy to at targets

744
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,140
the fairly well yes i need it

745
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:21,479
the write-offs that can be followed
using i dot

746
00:42:21,479 --> 00:42:26,170
ladder patting values ophthalmology
using a postscript that was written for

747
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,160
this proposed

748
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:32,629
by observing the behavior of the pros to
be peace of this

749
00:42:32,629 --> 00:42:34,210
paul the second exploit

750
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:36,890
that that they can extremist gifted
beauty

751
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:40,339
already the did nomic libraries the to
become part of each operating system

752
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:42,579
version

753
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:45,690
kartik sample arnaud crude exploits
previously

754
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:48,900
but has been adjusted for running a bill
from x eighty six

755
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,989
an m_d_ sixty-four architectures

756
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:57,329
to shout outs i had it to the exploit
and publicize adjusted for each track

757
00:42:57,329 --> 00:43:01,209
architecture appropriately

758
00:43:01,209 --> 00:43:04,160
now that we have your the end of my
presentation

759
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,370
we show you

760
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:11,969
the last apt with can be made to make
this but even more effective

761
00:43:11,969 --> 00:43:17,519
we are testing shaping it just looks
like in the wise

762
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:21,109
exploits can run perfect in the testing
environment now

763
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:24,989
material without they might not succeeds
in getting a shot

764
00:43:24,989 --> 00:43:27,579
that personal experience shows

765
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:32,339
that's not always the case sometimes
exploits can sexy

766
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:36,640
uh... even own when only tested in a
testing environment

767
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,619
so based what needs to be made stable
but testing it and real networks

768
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:47,219
actually i don't recall my we recommend
that slides very much because

769
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:49,499
you have to break at the systems too

770
00:43:49,499 --> 00:43:50,789
past this

771
00:43:50,789 --> 00:43:52,639
exploit and the wife

772
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:54,659
arts accomplish that like

773
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:58,509
sacha agents getting nicer to finding
running sellers and the wide to test

774
00:43:58,509 --> 00:44:00,479
exploited against

775
00:44:00,479 --> 00:44:02,619
scandals can be developed

776
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:07,459
to sequence irreparably durable sobils

777
00:44:07,459 --> 00:44:09,849
once we have also i was discovered

778
00:44:09,849 --> 00:44:13,829
majestic splat against them

779
00:44:13,829 --> 00:44:16,519
if they exploit dates

780
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:18,950
look what's possible uh... uh... today

781
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:19,839
real collars

782
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,690
all it is possible to get the
information

783
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:26,099
from the world are open so i'll go to me
make it

784
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:31,049
uh... instead of intended it to machine

785
00:44:31,049 --> 00:44:33,239
they exploit their

786
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:36,799
what we do it the neck at the last
episode just exploit by addressing the

787
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:40,479
status in the extra code

788
00:44:40,479 --> 00:44:42,849
and i want to thank everybody

789
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:44,999
who supported me overtimes

790
00:44:44,999 --> 00:44:50,819
you know who you off

791
00:44:50,819 --> 00:44:55,909
now hope you like me like uh... i hope
you like the uh... the talk even the

792
00:44:55,909 --> 00:44:56,679
vote

793
00:44:56,679 --> 00:44:57,619
but ripping

794
00:44:57,619 --> 00:44:59,599
and from the

795
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,599
from the pay periods so if you'll

796
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:07,159
have any questions comments or
suggestions please ask you know

797
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:14,019
anyone yeah mckenna

798
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:15,589
layout peach vases then

799
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:18,019
teach causa is quite buys if you do

800
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:19,229
uh...

801
00:45:19,229 --> 00:45:22,019
if you do binary fucking because you can

802
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:25,549
use the framework you don't have to
write everything by yourself

803
00:45:25,549 --> 00:45:27,619
that what i think is that

804
00:45:27,619 --> 00:45:32,139
customized systems spent two billion
more

805
00:45:32,139 --> 00:45:35,809
more restrictive because you can't do
what do you really want me to know what

806
00:45:35,809 --> 00:45:38,749
you have in mind at this in my opinion

807
00:45:38,749 --> 00:45:43,969
back constraints in the third some three
trials are

808
00:45:43,969 --> 00:45:50,969
another question

809
00:45:54,279 --> 00:45:57,429
tillotson magic are not

810
00:45:57,429 --> 00:45:59,849
uh... and i think that follow dramatic
uh...

811
00:45:59,849 --> 00:46:02,669
housing all discovering rotor bidders

812
00:46:02,669 --> 00:46:06,509
is made possible but not really humbled
on the renew kore

813
00:46:06,509 --> 00:46:09,269
uh... software because saw

814
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:16,269
you need to put some some brain
situational

815
00:46:18,759 --> 00:46:25,759
any question yeah

816
00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:33,869
can you speed the plow type of you know

817
00:46:50,289 --> 00:46:51,799
now basically does is that

818
00:46:51,799 --> 00:46:53,549
start using rob

819
00:46:53,549 --> 00:46:57,799
uh... if you go she looked at uh...
spend return oriented programming or

820
00:46:57,799 --> 00:47:02,699
like the only to return to live c_e_o_
extrication

821
00:47:02,699 --> 00:47:04,539
you jump to a function

822
00:47:04,539 --> 00:47:08,489
jump back to a function where you can

823
00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:09,969
jump to the memory

824
00:47:09,969 --> 00:47:14,680
so you know if you can't do everything
ok in the pro active duty extra case

825
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,809
yet to request one their reading of the
memory

826
00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:22,899
that's what's so that was values
buchanan to use uh... dot with a riot

827
00:47:22,899 --> 00:47:27,469
it's at the s_d_p_ process memory

828
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,239
is that you don't need the bright

829
00:47:29,239 --> 00:47:34,729
you can't do everything we watch out

830
00:47:34,729 --> 00:47:39,519
anyone else

831
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:46,519
to a balanced

832
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,640
politically still have pastor

you could work for moving the world
united parkinson

834
00:47:53,609 --> 00:47:57,529
yeah how i do that so basically that
does not recommended to do that because

835
00:47:57,529 --> 00:47:58,789
that's candy

836
00:47:58,789 --> 00:48:00,869
uh... dangerous

837
00:48:00,869 --> 00:48:01,710
you can

838
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:06,709
suggest a key exploit hines canvas of us
uh... and later on

839
00:48:06,709 --> 00:48:09,460
you find wardrobe lots of us

840
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:14,089
and then you just look what services are
running what is still not what's exploit

841
00:48:14,089 --> 00:48:16,910
fading with

842
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:19,130
and if you find out what right-handed

843
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:21,989
oil even if you doesn't find white
failed

844
00:48:21,989 --> 00:48:27,819
just installed the low the operating
system which runs remotely

845
00:48:27,819 --> 00:48:31,809
on the internet you mean the cats
individual machine

846
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:32,999
and then

847
00:48:32,999 --> 00:48:36,159
you look okay what good to have failed

848
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:38,119
nobody you find uh... uh...

849
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:39,949
the thing that they are

850
00:48:39,949 --> 00:48:42,889
and then you can fix that that uh...
just sit down

851
00:48:42,889 --> 00:48:49,889
yeah relics but more properly

852
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:53,759
