1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,939
dream

2
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:11,809
hello everyone

3
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:14,769
so i've expected stating that way

4
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:18,260
populist local client platforms

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,400
soprano

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,610
uh... my name is affects and i want to
talk to you about another climbed by

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,109
firms and their respective clad context

8
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,079
we're gonna look and had to come

9
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,000
to fairly different approaches and
inclined platforms

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,370
in detail one being the apple itouch

11
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,410
uh... in the first generation and the
second being a group of crumbled

12
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,570
when

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,770
uh... both of those devices or

14
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:44,920
uh... pretty much clout dependent so
we're going to look at their respective

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,270
cloud implementations and how did

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,950
essentially different and i want to
close with him

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:56,800
thermo body by security comparison uh...
over to fort bridger platforms

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,540
uh... what

19
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,550
the if you take away one thing from this
talk is three companies do not make

20
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,430
security because they want to

21
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,160
but because they want to protect our
business model

22
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,250
so far apple or uh... most of you
probably here dot apple sold more

23
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,729
pipettes and last year dan h_p_'s hold

24
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:15,270
pc platforms

25
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,690
of any kind of form

26
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:21,650
so um... every idiot in the world price
pipettes

27
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:28,130
i'd like to make some money in from the
hardware sales primarily

28
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:32,500
uh... in two thousand ten voluntary made

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,610
thirty two billion become

30
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,040
units sold spend twenty billion

31
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,740
uh... in u_s_ dollars

32
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,500
did take thirty percent of all dumb
money that uh... people making the ap

33
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,280
story

34
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,180
uh... which is another six billion

35
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,480
pin-ups more money

36
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,050
and then they take thirty percent off
everything are the mobile provider

37
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,890
charges you phone calls uh... as a mess

38
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,409
but that's another too dot eight billion

39
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,010
tell u_s_ dollars

40
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,109
and um... this goes to

41
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:03,590
bom apple they health

42
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,180
thirty and sort of thirty thousand
shareholders but they're not

43
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,219
uh... paying dividends so tall stays in
the company

44
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:13,989
and this is what they've built their
security model

45
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:18,499
so what apple once it is uh... besides
the consistently and uh... simple user

46
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:22,399
interface that award loves what they
want is a integrity protection of their

47
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:23,660
operating system

48
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,430
and one anyone else on their operating
system uh... date

49
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,359
restrict third-party software

50
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:32,680
bum from the source you can only get it
from the ups store

51
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,679
uh... from the capabilities slate if
you're building some software dept

52
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:40,369
well let's say it makes a less sucking
ymail point it will never make it into

53
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:44,189
the ap story because apple housing in a
client

54
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:47,849
gay restricted content and they restrict
the payment models

55
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:51,879
protecting the uses data is not part of
two security design because it's not

56
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,449
part of the stuff that they make money
with

57
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:57,609
um...

58
00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:01,489
accordingly the apple apts story is
really restrictive thanks uh...

59
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:06,239
if you ever try to sign up with them as
apple apts to rent on publisher

60
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,609
comes you will receive a piece of
conflict that makes every lawyer tried

61
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:14,369
when there is lots of interesting
regulations india

62
00:03:14,369 --> 00:03:18,659
well you can get rejected for a pretty
much any reason number not even given

63
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,509
your resume

64
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:21,859
and

65
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:24,559
is essentially all rights go to apple

66
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:29,129
but every possible damage blatantly
phoned damages you can get sued for are

67
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:31,809
limited on applet cite two fifty dollars

68
00:03:31,809 --> 00:03:35,559
but you already paid ninety nine dollars
to get signed up to the ap story

69
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:38,509
so essentially itself out of jail free
card for apple

70
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:41,939
and although the thumb all tourists goes
to you

71
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:43,819
also they have a very opaque

72
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:45,060
review process

73
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,439
so you're submitting a binary tree ap
store

74
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,519
magic happens fall we know it they could
have a bunch of monkeys stepping around

75
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,799
tonight pabst

76
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,709
and of the monkey uh...

77
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:57,579
parts and and you're a cop is accepted

78
00:03:57,579 --> 00:03:59,729
uh... we really don't know

79
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:04,779
uh... however we do know that they have
the content is armed not to do it liking

80
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:09,309
but let's say it's pornographic or
political warrior apple bashing

81
00:04:09,309 --> 00:04:13,899
uh... warrior good security software
because apple has no security issues

82
00:04:13,899 --> 00:04:16,729
uh... then it will be rejected

83
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:18,239
thumb

84
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,470
interact store guides their social work
themselves that in their arab store

85
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,420
gusty explicitly say

86
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,270
if you want to present russia's it never
helps

87
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,449
so if they don't even fear publicity
anymore

88
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:35,080
now on the other hand why does google
make the chrome book

89
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,769
onto gold for google is data collection

90
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:42,489
budget generating ninety six percent off
all their income come from selling user

91
00:04:42,489 --> 00:04:43,599
profiles

92
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:45,279
uh...

93
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,689
you're not just a little

94
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:53,160
thirty billion plus dollars formats per
year

95
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,690
you get situation is also very different
because some sixty seven percent off to

96
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,599
stalk

97
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:02,239
uh... class b_ stock so if the decision
making and money-making stock is in the

98
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:03,849
hands of three people

99
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:05,360
so the three people

100
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,639
uh... make all the money and everyone
else in the company can claim that

101
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,599
they're working for a technical company

102
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:15,959
uh... for doubt business model to work
google most dot t_ ensured at the use of

103
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:20,039
field safe to enter his data into the
chrome books so it can go into to google

104
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:20,949
clout

105
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:22,509
and can be used

106
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:26,430
uh... in publishing products so they
have a completely different business

107
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,270
reasons

108
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:32,380
to build the security model

109
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,150
axia umd you already see in the design
so what they want is they want a device

110
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:42,229
that excuses reruns one single program
which is the browser not surprisingly

111
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:43,969
dot as google chrome

112
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,019
but they won

113
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:48,250
to prevent third-party software when the
device of theirs

114
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,610
absolutely no legal way to put

115
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,239
binary code on the device that is not
coming from google

116
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:56,930
patriarch you want to protect the user
data

117
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,370
because of the devices stolen they want
to use it to get a new device which is

118
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,069
back to you pretty cheap

119
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:04,580
uh... sign up with his google i_d_ and
everything

120
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,569
in is nice again

121
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:07,480
they also want

122
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,340
to have a fast that uptime

123
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,969
and what is really important google
realized very very soon

124
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:17,009
but they have to win over the hearts of
the merits first because that merits are

125
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,310
the ones that multiplied our technology
around but the

126
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,349
other it gets on the planet

127
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:27,129
uh... so for example when when google
started to breed how have their own

128
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:28,909
public d_n_ a service

129
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:32,460
and even at the privacy lobbying german
hackers

130
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,259
but would not say wait a minute now if i
use the group will be announced in

131
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:41,139
google knows every single thing i look
appendix and profile even better

132
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:45,259
what they said with look at decide p
address at state dot a dot k dot k how

133
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:47,499
cool is that

134
00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:50,000
so they are nice that this pretty soon

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,069
some

136
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:52,680
and uh... you can

137
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,860
this goes on with their own webstore

138
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,339
servlets webstore

139
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:00,919
but you can uh... you can put extensions
uh... to to google chrome and air

140
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:03,089
to sign a pro cesses troop leal

141
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,630
cost you five box

142
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,830
very little contractual hassle

143
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:11,219
directly submission of two contenders in
the review process whatsoever

144
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:15,110
everything as html and javascript anyway

145
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,469
and yup

146
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,469
there's there's not much to it

147
00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:22,429
so let's go into the details

148
00:07:22,429 --> 00:07:26,289
uh... the ipod security architecture so
sensual what we're looking at is a

149
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:31,490
stomach the standard xa newtown pa cosby
is the operating system architecture

150
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,589
done everything runs either ask allah
root word a single user called mobarak

151
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:40,330
uh... they have a few krunal additions
um

152
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,899
one is called seatbelts

153
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:43,729
uh... that limits

154
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:46,479
somethings like p trace debug
capabilities

155
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,849
but they have binary code signatures
sold at binary code of silence

156
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:52,869
somewhat we're getting to that

157
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:53,550
them

158
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,539
there's a system-wide storage of
credentialed so detective has a really

159
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:00,259
easy time a state to steal your teaching

160
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:03,400
uh... but there's no on disk encryption
for example

161
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,379
like your datasets on this

162
00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:06,520
as it has

163
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,639
and a half days of our deep even

164
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,499
tellme all the modern ship

165
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:16,329
they have a integrity protection
mechanism desist prominent condos climb

166
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,369
platforms this is also coming from all
the funds that the other integrity

167
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:21,289
protection

168
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:23,319
uh... meaning that on power on

169
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:27,689
there is some initial trust anchor and
from this initial trial sankar

170
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:31,600
but the next stage is validated and then
the next stage of start up and then

171
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,870
the next stage validates the third stage
and so on and so on

172
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,520
they're doing this as well they have in
rome come

173
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,410
some apple our state keys

174
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:45,030
uh... and they are used for the
verification of the next step in the

175
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,020
next step

176
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,530
uh... loading

177
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:52,680
fell melody loading i mood of course it
had an eye on it

178
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:59,680
i brewed loading colonel karnal uh...
checking water for their signatures

179
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,630
rome this is integrity protection is
nice if you could write

180
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,850
some of this being applet they didn't

181
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,590
so essentially uh...

182
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,890
the device can also brute

183
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:15,530
uh... into something that a steep but
the issue most though device hockey no

184
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,240
amanda

185
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,240
lead firmware upload won't write it

186
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,590
and uh... yet saying it's unfortunate if
you have a buffer overflow in that which

187
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,610
date yet

188
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:32,170
uh... because it involved so to update
uh... to buffer overflow to fix buffer

189
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,470
overflow you throw away the device

190
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:35,750
some so

191
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,970
yeah but this is this is how we actually
get into any i passed

192
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,640
uh... first-generation

193
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,490
them and this is how all the table
export

194
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,870
and then we looked at this dispute
loader and and how does it in detail and

195
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,160
found out that they are using x five a
nine certificates and and the

196
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,480
certificate chain

197
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,970
uh... from a accurate c_a_a_ over some
problem immediate c_h_a_ and entities

198
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,770
uh... and we looked at to coach

199
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,480
and found out there

200
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,200
it doesn't verify basic constraints

201
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,670
now i a short elder border basically
strengths some

202
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,220
become use case of the next five a nine
certificated

203
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,810
uh... is to build a trusting obviously

204
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:21,450
uh... but obviously the c_d_a_ ed one
point once to give you a certificate for

205
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,080
which you have a private key

206
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,710
but that doesn't make you see a right

207
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,550
so essentially to see a asserts that a
little bit that says uh... this

208
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,210
certificate on signing

209
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,530
is for c_ a_ words not

210
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,420
now if it's really bad if you're not
taking this little bit

211
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,169
some

212
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:41,670
because that means that we have a valid
and if you certificate

213
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,079
we can essentially sign ships uh...
which um...

214
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:51,840
eventually is obscene and signed by
apple

215
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,380
we talked to matt interestingly enough
there actually shipping um a private key

216
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,820
and the public she ended signed
certificate on every single device which

217
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,760
is used for their push services

218
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,700
however we found out that the bootloader
restricts this is the whole process two

219
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,989
three steps

220
00:11:07,989 --> 00:11:11,180
and since they have to some intermediate
sia is already

221
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,110
uh... we couldn't use that one of the to
boot loader

222
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,580
however if we looked around and use a
lens and found out that they did the

223
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,770
same thing there

224
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:22,870
because essentially what they did was
invaded downloaded a open-source library

225
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,130
call time correct

226
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:28,150
and use that for all their crypto
without understanding the library

227
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,230
so we take this pursuit of the kid

228
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,769
uh... push notification certificate and
we signed shift

229
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:34,990
for example

230
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:37,620
h_t_t_p_ s certificates four star

231
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,540
like the entire internet

232
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,240
wherefore anything that you do

233
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,840
itasca i'm at has scored pop three has
slowed bpm connections or what not

234
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,200
and this then cause they've very hurried
updates

235
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,040
by apple

236
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,430
uh... interestingly here

237
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:01,160
is so they opted at i_r_s_ afford

238
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:07,600
and that means uh... they updated iphone
four and i've thrown in at three g s

239
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,270
nobody else so if you have a nice phone
before three g asbestos alll is broken

240
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,050
and apple doesn't care

241
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,330
uh... which i find interesting because

242
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:20,220
compare that to microsoft who still
shipping security updates for it they

243
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,189
dumm operating system which is ten years
old interfilm actually out of service

244
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:27,510
called exp

245
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:31,590
which actually doubts as as are correct

246
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:35,940
so if you have an older device who want
to go to that website and if you find a

247
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,300
nice little oc though on top of that
then you're screwed

248
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:45,450
benja short throw away your iphone and
buy something decent

249
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,629
then coming back to apple and crypto

250
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:51,360
that they need to uh... signature
mechanisms to check the refineries

251
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,050
radars that they didn't help slide
wineries

252
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:59,080
so the karma verifies the integrity of
applications at libraries

253
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,760
but if you do a signature mechanism
don't do it like al pulled us because

254
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,650
what they do that was the they
essentially only sign specific sections

255
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,920
in the file they say well what's
important to code section

256
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,930
to read only data section

257
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,960
and doesn't that done

258
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:19,920
andheri essentially of the balloon uh...
made-up toda and and i don't think so

259
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,120
though what happens is there is
obviously they ship load

260
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,200
ways to get around this

261
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,060
for example they don't signed header of
the file

262
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,850
while the head are off the filed
contained study information brady entry

263
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,600
point is so all you need to do this you
take a signed binary

264
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,780
can slap some unsigned binary code at
the end

265
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,830
uh... you changed the entry point to the
end to binary is loaded film everything

266
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,850
is happy

267
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,800
and um...

268
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,600
get out the execute code

269
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,930
uh... part of three hundred regmi j
breaks that you find for you i thought

270
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:58,340
uh... the system updates for forty i pet
are essentially um...

271
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:03,540
scoop them covered by the integrity
protection and ites youths

272
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,100
so yeah did you get application updates
in the ap store

273
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,210
however

274
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:09,160
uh...

275
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:14,460
application updates are also covered by
the by the monthly review process

276
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,070
so if the map developer finds that they
have a critic of on the bill to you in

277
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,020
their coats and a shipping opted in the
next hour it can still take up to two

278
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,960
weeks

279
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,770
uh... morgan randomly be rejected

280
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,989
uh... by alcohol so uh...

281
00:14:27,989 --> 00:14:31,690
there is no shortcut for security
updates

282
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,580
also one thing that well in some people
wanna play with potentially is uh...

283
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,420
carey updates of the mobile phone
carrier

284
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,560
firm kenwood some magic

285
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,330
uh... updates of little things in your
iphone or ipod for example the proxy

286
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,810
server you're using

287
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:51,420
uh... which is then an interesting thing
if the proxy server

288
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:56,630
live is not located at the carrier for
example

289
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,000
so um... the apple apts toward

290
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,859
uh...

291
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:05,149
essentially the apple out the story etc
appliances into itunes into our clients

292
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:05,829
are

293
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:08,060
wrecked yet

294
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,260
it's a web browser

295
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:14,400
than it has a if everything javascript
referendum object to see a p_r_i_

296
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,520
uh... containing baram july kit classes

297
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,160
it is white listed to certain list of
the main so you can draw these state my

298
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,990
ap story now is ed google dot com

299
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,940
threatened to white list this pretty
permissive and at how some signed p list

300
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,380
xom l

301
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,040
bullshit

302
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,240
the problem with that whole thing is if
you're building a web browser

303
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,940
uh... usual dot you build a web browser
so in order and four do u security has

304
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,370
some chins of web browsers to work

305
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,610
for example the use a house to see

306
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,200
but the address bar

307
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,880
now the ups store coined doesn't have an
address bar because it always talks to

308
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,930
apple right

309
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,060
but that means the user has no way to
see you

310
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,080
you know it

311
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,130
took a left turn and now rand on google

312
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,230
uh...

313
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:08,070
you have no indicator of whether you're
using h_t_t_p_ ass or h_t_t_p_

314
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,360
and uh... jeff

315
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,430
so the standard web security things
simply don't cut it anymore because the

316
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:19,300
user company could you could decisions

317
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,660
that for example means that

318
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,030
seaview

319
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:28,480
injects some javascript skin random
apple websites

320
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,000
let's say an open waistline like here

321
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,640
uh... but you cannot cheap call some of
those javascripts uh... thinks

322
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,650
bills javascript functions contain

323
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:41,830
interesting functions like itunes dot
billy at chin

324
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:46,070
as you will to see them talk just your
credit card and by suit in the upstart

325
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,140
uh...

326
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:52,120
they have csr after bill clinton some
dead barton are meant to prevent such

327
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,320
attacks that are c_s_i_s_ paste

328
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,020
however

329
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:00,610
persons the libraries are elected
libraries they would happily fill in the

330
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:03,980
tokens for you so the attacker doesn't
have to care about them

331
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,340
uh... n this all is pretty hard to fix
so

332
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,589
but i'll give you an example

333
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:13,970
here is they dumped your during the ap
store as you see

334
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,170
to get a pop up that asks you for your
apple id to you

335
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:21,339
uh... which is somewhat expected some
because you know

336
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:22,850
during the ap store right

337
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:26,040
uh... however just pop up was actually
cost

338
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,089
though by a little

339
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:31,570
piece of javascript it you inject in pa
bitterly websites tandon

340
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,530
you know club

341
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,760
if you can guess what a password goes to

342
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,640
uh... like once you enter data

343
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,450
certainly not to apple

344
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,200
uh...

345
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,210
even the vanilla web security things
um... part not right away or it is that

346
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:51,340
the disease after prince arthur not very
good so from even if you're going to be

347
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,540
injecting

348
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,530
the uh... you get like one out of
hundred shots

349
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,420
uh... were totally works from

350
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,750
the thing is

351
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:05,450
dwight list also means the domain
whitelist also means that if we have a

352
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,660
cross-eyed scripting somewhere

353
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,790
on a domain that is in the white list

354
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:14,360
we can essentially be do you have to
score for your device

355
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,090
so all we need it

356
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,150
employers

357
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:22,170
across at scripting somewhere on and
apple dot com website because the white

358
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,600
listed entire epa dot com

359
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,549
and to let and we found it on the front
page in the search field

360
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:34,200
didn't have to look forward to tweak

361
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,380
because at scripting in research field
what psa uh... essentially

362
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,340
there is uh... the what kid has an ex is
as alberto rates access as kansai

363
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,340
prevention pool

364
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,400
dumb

365
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,330
and that's all there to prevent us from
hacking around however since this is not

366
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:50,800
a real browser

367
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,100
uh... it will support the data you al

368
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,910
or data you are scheme

369
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,230
film as a source of content

370
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,990
which were pissing browse it would never
do

371
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,770
thumb so there is split javascript code
that we execute in the context of the

372
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,130
data origin bone which

373
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,310
you know it's considered harmless right
by the browser

374
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,750
and so

375
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,520
we kept his we can inject javascript

376
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,990
that essentially

377
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,400
dry folly

378
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:22,590
marches download instill run
applications on here at the devices

379
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,490
uh... this is how you do it

380
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:29,530
so essentially it comes to talk to her
is your concert scripting

381
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,090
uh... thingy and you put them

382
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,940
they tell you uh... allendale would pay
sixty four in code above the bindle

383
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,660
tend to be low essentially

384
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:42,690
why is it a stupid piece of shit from
the upstart

385
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:45,350
the interesting thing here is

386
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,600
that were not sure whether we can
disclose how to do that because that's a

387
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,299
good to certain known certainly have the
fraud injection

388
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:53,510
uh... issue

389
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:58,570
uh... and stand so we talked to alcohol
they fix it then

390
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:02,740
they fix it by fixing the cross
expecting in research field

391
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:09,720
so if you find another car side
scripting feel free to have fun

392
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,220
now so how does your data end up in
apple to climate

393
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:18,710
uh... obviously early you will have to
switch on and use the italics which

394
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,630
uh... very expensive t_v_ advertisements
will

395
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,760
continuously tell you to do

396
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:29,850
and also if you're updated over high
flow over g_i_ june's uh... interphase

397
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,809
injured in an operating system update
you will find to be our child has

398
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:34,710
suddenly turned on

399
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,930
lately

400
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,289
so what it does is it takes

401
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:42,780
any documents though that has a certain
datatype an issue at all

402
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,100
uh... iniki well you file

403
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,059
were any

404
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:50,530
document that in unit out subdirectory
named documents

405
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,790
were library private documents

406
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:56,320
anything and air automatically goes into
the clout

407
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,809
the only thing you can prevent that is
as the at authority

408
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:01,820
toucan flack documents as

409
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,090
not to be exported into the ipod

410
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:08,230
which means you as a user help
absolutely zero control over it

411
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:12,370
um... it looks like the whole
transmission poses is h_t_t_p_ s some

412
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:17,350
new we talked about a couple just talent
for cryptographic solutions

413
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:23,600
but let's just assume that element over
your po he wrote that as uh... secure

414
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,070
obviously at the storage is pretty much
guaranteed to be on a trip to it

415
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:31,840
because otherwise apple wouldn't be able
to access your documents and

416
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,890
now moving to a different if i a sort of
a to law enforcement or have to sell it

417
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,419
to someone else

418
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:41,240
uh... which uh... if you if you read to
use that to terms accused

419
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:48,240
they're totally free to do

420
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,770
very good

421
00:21:54,770 --> 00:22:00,190
to coach define essays here's the answer
i don't care what the question was

422
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:04,660
chroma security architecture so
essentially

423
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,309
at the the chrome wants to crumble is
for people them off my extraordinaire

424
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:11,280
that grew up quickly

425
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,990
beating other people for touching their
screen

426
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:20,250
we prefer to actually have to vices
would keyboards

427
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,180
but

428
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,600
this device is different uh... too so it
has a keyboard with it

429
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,980
and uh... it requires a google account
work as the council

430
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:32,680
tumne peers individuals separation
between two users so multiple users can

431
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,420
use the same device which is by design
because google envisions that at some

432
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,289
point universities will have so crumbles

433
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:44,730
and uh... the student just grabs a
chrome book and uses it with his google

434
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,840
account and everything goes to grow and

435
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,510
cannot keep that in mind

436
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:53,510
it's a standard lennox operating system
they have a few announcements

437
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:57,350
they also help warned sing-along routier
zaidi did a run

438
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,450
everything under

439
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:03,419
they have a very strong focus on
preventing native code execution

440
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:06,900
there is no fight a bull flies system
that has mounted execute a bull

441
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,210
so they essentially

442
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:13,010
essentially have to decode and twelfth
dvp

443
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,799
on the file system implemented

444
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:18,620
uh... they have a personal firewall
uh...

445
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,809
which i've had dozens

446
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:25,520
after we told them that i_t_t_ six is
also a protocol that we use nowadays

447
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,220
gumtree

448
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,260
take out a type b_ visits to the
personal firewall

449
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,720
and uh... what is very interesting they
have automatics highland updates

450
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,430
without using intervention

451
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:40,950
so you contact you stop the device from
updating itself

452
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:45,010
the only thing though that you can
access as a user is the chrome browser

453
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,810
nikon comes which although lady

454
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:51,090
famous features security features of the
chrome browser

455
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,799
as your ideas and boxing um...

456
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:58,740
disabled and j_p_ i so your conduct you
have primary uh... poppins

457
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,980
with heights the full file system so if
you save file save

458
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,809
during lease your home directory

459
00:24:04,809 --> 00:24:06,970
interestingly enough uh...

460
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:11,410
also the chrome browser ships with uh...
goldstone compiled version of adobe

461
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,520
flash

462
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,410
they apparently forgot to tell that
there will be about to file system

463
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,210
hiding

464
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:20,000
so if you have a fire safety dialogue in
a flash application you see the entire

465
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,130
filesystem

466
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,820
what was funny it is

467
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:29,720
the who remembers in two thousand a damn
alexander sought to ralph and and of

468
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,429
policy creating

469
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:38,110
mt five um... collision certificates for
as a cell

470
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:41,800
most plaza vendors fix that by taking
the certificates

471
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,190
down putting it into the browser and
flagging it as evil so it would never

472
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,039
ever be accepted

473
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:52,460
google at the same thing but forgot the
flagging

474
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,169
if you were alex hardy raw footage that
you can control

475
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:56,830
the clock overwhelm broke

476
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:00,170
but if you have this is all men in the
middle for everything

477
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:05,750
uh... however do you need to keep it
only sakharov apparently hats

478
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,190
them to be biased

479
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:10,390
also has a development notes so um...

480
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,299
this is the peeling tutored name

481
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:13,250
num

482
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:17,400
to keep so it was about to say to the
greeks

483
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,250
did as a small switch on the back of the
device when you don't need to devise a

484
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:26,220
chose his gary big-screen roger and
develop a remote scare for blah blah

485
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,690
uh...

486
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:28,610
soap

487
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,990
but they also have an integrity
protection chain it is a lot more solid

488
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,210
then uh... the one that bone

489
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:36,490
that apple develops

490
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:39,720
uh... this year's oxy from the
documentation

491
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,110
uh... what do you see here

492
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:46,880
firmwares and come out so the way they
built this system is

493
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,899
uh... action ought to stick but they
have

494
00:25:49,899 --> 00:25:52,400
iran's sections and they have the
firmware

495
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,290
the napa carmel and then they have the
fire system

496
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:58,200
and of all of them they have to

497
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,070
so if they are updating one side and if
i could optic instilled switch over to

498
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,130
the other one

499
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,480
so everything's redundant

500
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,610
from

501
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,840
came into real stuff from

502
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,850
this fall works essentially

503
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:14,019
noticeboard as funny as they are to use
the tpm

504
00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:15,570
some on the platforms

505
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:21,000
uh... two-track uh... that you don't use
an old accused so you can't do rollback

506
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,550
but i can't give you did manage to crack
and older appa told a group team

507
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:31,150
so you can't really use that because
they'd have seen any repeat

508
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,169
what it also factors in

509
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:36,100
is the kind of worsens

510
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,430
if anyone here can convince leanest for
whites to adopt a versioning strategy or

511
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:45,080
firefox so um... every two weeks will
get a new major worsen of two minutes

512
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,650
condo

513
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:52,240
because if the end and this is a sixteen
bit field so if we manage to get to the

514
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,940
knox condom major worsened to sixty five
five thirty five

515
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,830
all crumbled stopped working for effort

516
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:03,950
so if you know let me know what you know
stalwarts film that might be worth to

517
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,840
give them a drink or two

518
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,890
and convince them to do that

519
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:13,410
uh... they built the extremely smart and
fast of filesystem integrity spell

520
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,900
checking

521
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,539
because

522
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:19,480
what they do like if you build embedded
systems this is how you do it

523
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:23,720
but they don't integrity check the file
system data integrity checking some

524
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,650
detox or come

525
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:28,610
the actual hardware layer quickly

526
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,750
dacha hard right

527
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,070
the whole partition this poem

528
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:37,490
checked every single block white house
and endurance is super house on top of

529
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,360
that

530
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,030
so essentially every time you read

531
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,980
uh... the block from the partition

532
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,980
it will help has verified list of hashes

533
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,460
you know what check to house office
block and if it matches fine if not

534
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,630
uh... but you get a little sign that
says please connect me to the internet

535
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,710
in you know

536
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:59,440
i want to reinstall myself

537
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,610
and this is actually extremely smart

538
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:06,010
because cashing cakes in when the layer
above that's so you're not verifying a

539
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,280
block twice in most cases

540
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,180
firm and displaying to put up time for
example down to from less than ten

541
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,440
seconds

542
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,039
and uh... makes it really really
portable

543
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:23,000
uh... however even that integrity
protection some has imperfections

544
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:23,740
the

545
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,730
for example partitioned tables not
integrity protected so if you can make a

546
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,680
film do the caramel

547
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,200
will work on the driver's side into the
partition table helms did will fucked up

548
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,009
uh... parts of the device

549
00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:40,010
is also partitions for or we have in
south florida unifying

550
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,760
poem modules that are not integrity
protected so

551
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,590
president de assumption is would later
promotes that if you can drive in to

552
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,150
dignify section

553
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:52,429
uh... you can load here for a more drugs
before he even did announce couldn't

554
00:28:52,429 --> 00:28:53,510
start spin

555
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,630
nobec toward tabloid

556
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:59,150
enters a theoretical breach of integrity
here

557
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:02,190
because at the point where there is
starting to colonel

558
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,570
uh...

559
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:07,560
this is what they have shows the uh...
as the integrity put their has to start

560
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,400
parameters for the connell

561
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,860
then what you see here

562
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,809
in reg is three percent u

563
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:13,920
plus one

564
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,240
but this is what it later fill-in

565
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,419
uh... did u i_d_'s of two discs that
they're actually one boot

566
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:23,059
but the thing of course it is

567
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:25,269
diablo warned is what they signs

568
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:27,680
into lower one it's what they execute

569
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,070
so um...

570
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,669
this is club gives me a theoretical
breached

571
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:36,749
i've seen a talk submission to a
conference in asia where some academics

572
00:29:36,749 --> 00:29:37,679
claim

573
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,570
but that it could actually turned us
into an actual attack

574
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:48,389
i would love to see that some i was
simply too dumb to do that

575
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:50,440
when you keep in mind that

576
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,519
what do you think that the books are at
mend to be shared slick and universities

577
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:57,620
it is also worth noticing that

578
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:01,789
his veto only section in the beginning
with a health care routine

579
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:04,519
uh... which then loads the firmware

580
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:06,809
is obviously somewhere on a trip

581
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:09,039
and one of my colleagues of mine

582
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,490
find out that

583
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:15,500
that you essentially connected to the
pins when the device and that makes

584
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,020
you retire on the let's read only

585
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,669
uh... essentially you can run software
and say please become read right

586
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:23,130
and i will say yes

587
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:27,929
and then you update deferral ordered and
those so we do have a chrome book now

588
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:32,100
homes that says richard relapse though
when you put it

589
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,550
which obviously means that you can then
essentially do whatever you want to pick

590
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,060
brought to come up

591
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:40,080
whatever

592
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,280
do you call must use a data encryption
to home directory encryption is a pretty

593
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,880
well designed cripple system from my
point of view

594
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,510
uh... everything but a trip to expert

595
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:54,930
when it's what is interesting here for
you to know what is

596
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:58,390
that uh... it essentially depends on you
use a password

597
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:02,380
so this is fairly decent data separation

598
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:05,519
because when user cannot access the home
directory of the other use of the

599
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,059
tuesday

600
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:08,820
essentially had she doesn't have to keep

601
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,890
the key is generated based on your user
password that you entered

602
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:13,910
soem

603
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,759
but this is important outcome

604
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:18,650
to keep in mind

605
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:23,120
to update story with the chrome books is
a bit strange some as a set date

606
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,139
does not allow user intervention

607
00:31:25,139 --> 00:31:27,309
some every forty five minutes

608
00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:29,790
it talks to google him using google ts

609
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:33,110
well maja protocol

610
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:36,870
and then it starts taking the active
system partition

611
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:41,090
ended runs the updates pondy inactive
system partitions

612
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:44,710
but the updates are incremental
modifications

613
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:49,590
of two from where andrew partition so
centrally go house-to-house eight

614
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,180
consecutive

615
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:51,859
uh...

616
00:31:51,859 --> 00:31:56,649
history off every single image d_f_a_
shipped if they ever lose one doctor

617
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:57,980
does not work

618
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:02,090
uh... because they are also updating the
house just above four and forty eight

619
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:05,059
for the prop tables

620
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:07,920
gap take us transported over as a cell

621
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,720
and is by itself integrity protected

622
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,159
what is again interesting hearing is
eight thirty

623
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,440
approach

624
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,880
parity integrity protectionist checks

625
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,830
after the update is applied

626
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,380
so they're not downloading the whole
update checked integrity and then apply

627
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,630
the update

628
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:30,490
nordic download to update step by step
in applying it to did mixed into the

629
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,110
other partition and at the end

630
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,559
they do the house and go like quips

631
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:39,039
something was wrong cory yes that was
built

632
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,440
do everything they did a signaling
something was wrong or govt

633
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,880
is whether dissected bootable fleck
forty other petition back were not

634
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,490
if you know keep in mind

635
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:51,780
that the partition table is not
integrity protected

636
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,159
here is the again a theoretical wade

637
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,740
to get in there

638
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,690
but we couldn't make a practical tasha
called some lost guys

639
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:03,190
uh... they've made a theoretical
practical

640
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:08,160
nineteen eighty seven or something right

641
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,980
to google web store in as a said is
there a good portion of the arab store

642
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:14,759
uh... distributes browser extensions

643
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:15,920
um...

644
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,830
it's all javascript stuff from

645
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,700
did the user

646
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,340
krenz permissions on installation and we
all know that

647
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,780
hidden what is interesting here

648
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,820
um...

649
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,870
do you do a p_r_ itself might work
politically

650
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,780
chrome extension can do

651
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:35,650
is essentially it looks like it was
built for russian banking trojans

652
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:40,440
uh... because one way and one thing you
can do is a so-called content script

653
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,160
uh... where you say for the following
domains

654
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:46,230
i would like to get control after your
energy entire dom

655
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:49,169
and i would like to change some things
in the dog

656
00:33:49,169 --> 00:33:53,929
uh... which is exactly what very um...
expensively made thinking trojans and

657
00:33:53,929 --> 00:33:55,530
windows usually do

658
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:59,260
uh... so that they can get your payment
your talents and happened what not and

659
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,660
send it to you

660
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,310
servers uh... outside shipping sterling

661
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,250
so it's really really powerful dumb

662
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,869
we already see submissions for black in
vegas that

663
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:14,169
nick an entire talk about it

664
00:34:14,169 --> 00:34:18,819
they also have um... paid extensions so
that people can make money off their

665
00:34:18,819 --> 00:34:22,399
browser extensions

666
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,309
but they're not really well protected so
if you have the extension hygiene which

667
00:34:26,309 --> 00:34:28,359
you see when you browse the catalogue

668
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:30,429
you can essentially creates

669
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:32,199
certain request here

670
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:35,339
uh... and endure download the extension
for free

671
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:40,029
uh... you can also use uh... degree
wilson configuration for your browser

672
00:34:40,029 --> 00:34:43,419
and than just alkali due to the
configuration in next time you send your

673
00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:47,119
browser it will download d extension for
you

674
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,039
without you paying obviously

675
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:52,819
what we found interesting and what comes
back to my initial points keep in mind

676
00:34:52,819 --> 00:34:54,799
what they make the money was

677
00:34:54,799 --> 00:34:55,379
uh...

678
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:59,100
when we reported this to google in in an
actual onsite meeting

679
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,269
basic

680
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:03,899
steps that we should update the
documentation

681
00:35:03,899 --> 00:35:06,849
so they have no no interest in
protecting

682
00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:11,400
support people that make money off a few
extension that they sell on under google

683
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,389
checkout

684
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:16,609
uh... because that's not what they make
money with from dayton driver documented

685
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:20,669
fact that this protection simply doesn't
work

686
00:35:20,669 --> 00:35:23,959
certainly cheaper

687
00:35:23,959 --> 00:35:27,289
how can you install malicious extensions
and browsers as well

688
00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:28,019
uh...

689
00:35:28,019 --> 00:35:31,609
if you get obviously if you get control
over to google account you can use

690
00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:32,779
google adsense

691
00:35:32,779 --> 00:35:35,279
and just how diminishes extension to it

692
00:35:35,279 --> 00:35:37,039
uh... will also

693
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:40,849
some exposes in chrome special i p i
still webstore

694
00:35:40,849 --> 00:35:41,769
uh...

695
00:35:41,769 --> 00:35:43,279
day held earlier this year

696
00:35:43,279 --> 00:35:45,339
what we found dead uh...

697
00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:46,619
gatehouse

698
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:52,140
h_t_t_p_ domains with him to write list
so you could inject uh... h_t_t_p_

699
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,179
done very similar to apple

700
00:35:54,179 --> 00:35:56,809
and help them download and install
extensions

701
00:35:56,809 --> 00:35:57,660
uh...

702
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:03,080
d configuration d confirmation dialog
that says yes taiwan install that um...

703
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:08,210
was implemented by a javascript so d
extension cord click itself

704
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:10,789
on the dialogues and suggestions for me

705
00:36:10,789 --> 00:36:11,989
uh...

706
00:36:11,989 --> 00:36:15,670
there and as i mentioned to um... do you
have to militias extensions are fairly

707
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:19,299
powerful you essentially controlled the
browser in an extended to cannot imagine

708
00:36:19,299 --> 00:36:24,459
in firefox work

709
00:36:24,459 --> 00:36:26,380
lets move into the group of clouds

710
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,349
poem

711
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:30,749
so an example here being total collapse

712
00:36:30,749 --> 00:36:34,349
so for the google helps game you have to
realize that if your account has

713
00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:37,059
compromised everything was lost

714
00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:41,499
uh... review session cookie is
compromised your account is compromised

715
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:42,819
so

716
00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:46,079
that a password or to factor
authentication doesn't help you that

717
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,859
much because he half to lose this
fucking cookie wants

718
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:51,299
and that's it

719
00:36:51,299 --> 00:36:52,529
uh...

720
00:36:52,529 --> 00:36:54,369
it's gold it doesn't love you anymore

721
00:36:54,369 --> 00:36:59,769
uh... needed let's say because your name
doesn't sound correct on google plus

722
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:01,499
but you're fucked

723
00:37:01,499 --> 00:37:05,180
we were if someone else can make a
little not loving you anymore

724
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,039
law enforcement government so long

725
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:10,319
you're fucked

726
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:13,589
if you keep that in mind fine you can
use collapsed

727
00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:16,709
uh... so essentially your protection
must cover the authentication

728
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:20,419
authorization lofty user in third-party
applications

729
00:37:20,419 --> 00:37:24,849
uh... there many google helps so that
you some third-party coach

730
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:29,819
uh... and synthesis in octial nightmare
because cougar keeps buying companies

731
00:37:29,819 --> 00:37:32,169
pregnant

732
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:33,680
i think this is

733
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,459
and uh... integrate their products in
hindered offerings

734
00:37:38,459 --> 00:37:42,169
and often this code is really not
compatible with the way google dust off

735
00:37:42,169 --> 00:37:46,470
so that handover cookies second fourth
at some point you can see people

736
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:50,479
burns the alps attending like thirty
copies from one side to the other

737
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:52,079
because the gluten couldn't

738
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,319
makeup which group used important one
uh...

739
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:57,880
param soldiers you certainly have volume

740
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:03,169
bentsen's nowadays they're paying uh...
lots of money if you find critical box

741
00:38:03,169 --> 00:38:06,199
legislation a block

742
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:09,599
uh... an example of interesting things
in the clouds

743
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,309
google docs allows to write naturals

744
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:16,160
uh... for at their spreadsheet
applications those macros are actually

745
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,899
executed on google servers

746
00:38:18,899 --> 00:38:24,330
firms you can import macros from other
people which uh... you know by ones

747
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:28,919
you look at the coat and then you say
this macro school and you save okay

748
00:38:28,919 --> 00:38:33,129
if the other guy updates the macro later

749
00:38:33,129 --> 00:38:36,179
uh... it uh... it might change behavior

750
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:41,569
them what we found will be interesting
owned one of two leading macros homes

751
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:46,249
used by the most people on on google
docs is a credit card number validation

752
00:38:46,249 --> 00:38:47,279
checker

753
00:38:47,279 --> 00:38:49,079
by russian

754
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,879
and it's action that you couldn't do it

755
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:55,229
let's actually not stealing stuff

756
00:38:55,229 --> 00:38:58,839
so it's the one russian but that's a
shitload of credit card numbers and not

757
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:01,200
miss uses them

758
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,499
produce good

759
00:39:03,499 --> 00:39:07,109
but as i said lake uh... if you have
heard turned sites then everyone is

760
00:39:07,109 --> 00:39:08,929
fucked

761
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:12,899
what is also interesting is the macros
can do it needs to be requests

762
00:39:12,899 --> 00:39:17,359
now keep in mind does h_t_t_p_ requests
come from within google

763
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,409
uh...

764
00:39:18,409 --> 00:39:20,999
as you can get up to plate

765
00:39:20,999 --> 00:39:24,429
end fifty geeks per second data
transmission with into google data

766
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:26,759
center

767
00:39:26,759 --> 00:39:29,879
socal only good connected law school
group

768
00:39:29,879 --> 00:39:35,339
uh... and that's that's a pretty decent
way to do it

769
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,430
we found one way and of where p

770
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,770
deduction account switching uh...

771
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:44,789
functionality on the google main site
buchwald actually allow you to steal

772
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:46,429
someone else's accounts

773
00:39:46,429 --> 00:39:49,149
come i'm not walking you through the
entire

774
00:39:49,149 --> 00:39:52,519
uh... cosas players and julia um

775
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:53,769
intercept

776
00:39:53,769 --> 00:39:57,949
uh... a lock in requested you presented
accounts which request where you are

777
00:39:57,949 --> 00:39:59,669
already locked in

778
00:39:59,669 --> 00:40:00,910
and then uh...

779
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:04,009
theater laughin becomes accounts which
is for it

780
00:40:04,009 --> 00:40:09,779
uh... forty user in it looks similar if
not hundred-percent equal to regalado

781
00:40:09,779 --> 00:40:11,840
will walk in but very similar

782
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,929
and you end up having to cocaine

783
00:40:13,929 --> 00:40:16,759
uh... which dennis obviously came over

784
00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:21,469
financial black should be fixed by now

785
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:24,829
well even google belongs to the
companies that still think that all of

786
00:40:24,829 --> 00:40:27,439
us top ten has something to achieve

787
00:40:27,439 --> 00:40:31,549
from i think some some managers
obviously haven't doing poem

788
00:40:31,549 --> 00:40:34,819
yearly review bulb to open spokesmen

789
00:40:34,819 --> 00:40:36,849
processed a contract my

790
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:40,179
so also google site to help us that
scripting

791
00:40:40,179 --> 00:40:40,870
uh...

792
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:44,199
to google sites apartment is actually

793
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:48,089
uh... and very interesting playground if
you want to get paid by google for one

794
00:40:48,089 --> 00:40:50,530
abilities cool websites is a good
starting point

795
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:53,170
because you're living off the google dot
com domain

796
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:54,299
which uh...

797
00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:56,679
breaks a margin pretty nicely

798
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:58,540
and you have a lot of power

799
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,689
over what you can do

800
00:41:00,689 --> 00:41:01,890
other services

801
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:04,019
uh... of lots of

802
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:07,200
nineties style cross at scripting issues
so

803
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,880
for example the administrator paramore

804
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,350
the and post he needed to secure it and
it drifted schoolgirl email service that

805
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:17,759
is also used but many government
agencies in the states

806
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:18,889
uh...

807
00:41:18,889 --> 00:41:21,429
but you have a concert scripting rodent

808
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:26,739
bucket didn't move when viewing messages
from users so if you have across that

809
00:41:26,739 --> 00:41:29,699
scripting in the subject of an email the
user

810
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:34,109
to call the apple and say look and
baptist account please and pop happened

811
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:37,959
at storms

812
00:41:37,959 --> 00:41:43,199
and this this well authorization and
exchange of data things um...

813
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:46,319
really doesn't work too well even when
googled slide

814
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,499
uh... an example being

815
00:41:48,499 --> 00:41:52,339
give one side wednesday access your data
in google alps

816
00:41:52,339 --> 00:41:55,930
uh... you get a little website from
google that says

817
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:59,320
well do you wanna allowed each dot com
to go

818
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:03,159
financial you know if studio daytime

819
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:08,109
would you can obviously do as you use a
who wasn't the right thing to redirect

820
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,190
films where you

821
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:13,549
automatically essentially click on the
though i feel lucky button

822
00:42:13,549 --> 00:42:15,029
which then cause us

823
00:42:15,029 --> 00:42:17,409
who go to ask you something like this

824
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,689
who wants to access your google account

825
00:42:19,689 --> 00:42:21,440
do you wanna allowed us

826
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,880
but the obvious answer is while you
already talking on my day now so go

827
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,910
ahead

828
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,279
uh... which then

829
00:42:27,279 --> 00:42:31,369
redirects through do search engine and i
feel lucky

830
00:42:31,369 --> 00:42:33,539
uh... onto our web server

831
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:38,229
uh... cairns happy new leaks your
article authorization token

832
00:42:38,229 --> 00:42:43,499
uh... into your web blocks

833
00:42:43,499 --> 00:42:48,209
so at what you see here isn't it the
google summary is essentially

834
00:42:48,209 --> 00:42:51,289
who goes succeeded in hardening the
client platform

835
00:42:51,289 --> 00:42:54,689
inorder come to make the use of field

836
00:42:54,689 --> 00:42:55,779
from

837
00:42:55,779 --> 00:43:00,529
this is really safe and i can enter my
day take care

838
00:43:00,529 --> 00:43:04,069
what in fact happens is removing the
risk into the clouds

839
00:43:04,069 --> 00:43:04,670
bum

840
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:05,709
where

841
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:08,239
to security challenges scholar

842
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:12,259
still a lot harder and even almighty
google uh...

843
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:16,950
makes mistakes aaron into foreign dead
like we've learned how to do should

844
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:17,630
write

845
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:22,379
many years ago but in cloud computing we
throw away this knowledge

846
00:43:22,379 --> 00:43:23,539
again and you

847
00:43:23,539 --> 00:43:24,549
as they have

848
00:43:24,549 --> 00:43:26,199
nothing happens

849
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:31,709
uh... also culture pretty opaque so them
they collected like like he's the

850
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:34,279
following together services room or is

851
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:38,089
uh... but i talked a couple of people in
the payment to me and found out

852
00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:40,279
the following interesting thing

853
00:43:40,279 --> 00:43:41,599
uh... apple

854
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:46,929
runs the i quote not themselves but they
run it on google and microsoft

855
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:51,839
now google achchi runs his clout now in
ibm data centers

856
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:55,369
uh... largely for the non-essential
services

857
00:43:55,369 --> 00:43:56,899
ibm

858
00:43:56,899 --> 00:44:01,439
that i know for a fact and she wants to
data centers not themselves anymore and

859
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:08,439
but outsource them to third parties tend
to have them operated by people in china

860
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:21,589
suppose that its rewards

861
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:24,019
decor of the problem being

862
00:44:24,019 --> 00:44:28,209
you'd never know where your data and sop
at and whose action responsible so if

863
00:44:28,209 --> 00:44:30,979
you have a data breach in this scenario

864
00:44:30,979 --> 00:44:36,339
was that like reduces

865
00:44:36,339 --> 00:44:41,259
i wanna close with that what i find an
amusing film matrix

866
00:44:41,259 --> 00:44:45,759
the off to four major nobody platforms
nowadays

867
00:44:45,759 --> 00:44:48,539
if the four major platforms uh...

868
00:44:48,539 --> 00:44:49,979
you will see that

869
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:51,569
thirteenth of june

870
00:44:51,569 --> 00:44:54,930
widely used platforms dot t_ ron mate of
codes

871
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:56,319
while home

872
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,519
the blackberry and secluded

873
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:03,249
who almost not jus windows fill in
action only allowed managed coached

874
00:45:03,249 --> 00:45:08,629
the permission model forty ops is pretty
much the same when all of them so

875
00:45:08,629 --> 00:45:12,519
when you install inhabited gives you a
menu of stuff it wants to do which it

876
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:13,299
data

877
00:45:13,299 --> 00:45:16,399
and either your fine with that or you
don't get ya

878
00:45:16,399 --> 00:45:18,749
that's the same for everyone

879
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:19,899
thumb

880
00:45:19,899 --> 00:45:22,799
device management of his

881
00:45:22,799 --> 00:45:25,189
very um...

882
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:30,329
uh... yeah different across the board so
the apple bios how some device

883
00:45:30,329 --> 00:45:31,999
management which put

884
00:45:31,999 --> 00:45:34,349
is unfortunately undefinable

885
00:45:34,349 --> 00:45:37,159
well on android you have nothing that
comes

886
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:38,889
from from itself

887
00:45:38,889 --> 00:45:43,570
uh... there's a lot of third-party
products but knobs by him

888
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:44,969
by itself

889
00:45:44,969 --> 00:45:48,609
a blackberry and windows fun actually
house device management

890
00:45:48,609 --> 00:45:52,179
they all have somewhat of a clout
ukelele considered a blackberry

891
00:45:52,179 --> 00:45:55,749
enterprise service as a private college

892
00:45:55,749 --> 00:45:56,879
but now

893
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,509
the interesting hardest

894
00:45:58,509 --> 00:46:02,789
uh... divine abilities on autos an
android we have plenty thought like

895
00:46:02,789 --> 00:46:04,790
barry introduced webkit

896
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:08,499
so uh... it made a tactical from
remarkable

897
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:11,499
on windows phone seven so far d only
thing that broken

898
00:46:11,499 --> 00:46:13,769
uh... where william extensions

899
00:46:13,769 --> 00:46:16,249
into most amusing

900
00:46:16,249 --> 00:46:17,890
remember in the nineties

901
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:21,970
uh... we'll inox users were making fun
of the windows users for having all the

902
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:23,649
malware

903
00:46:23,649 --> 00:46:27,559
on a mobile phones now the windows phone
users make fun of the limits android

904
00:46:27,559 --> 00:46:29,739
users for having all the beltway

905
00:46:29,739 --> 00:46:31,829
uh... and without

906
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:33,039
i think i want to close

907
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:40,039
and thank you for your extension

908
00:46:41,139 --> 00:46:41,939
and of course

909
00:46:41,939 --> 00:46:48,939
questions

910
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:17,229
make homicides

911
00:47:17,229 --> 00:47:20,249
well i was

912
00:47:20,249 --> 00:47:21,040
i was just

913
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,900
pointing out possibilities but also
um...

914
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:29,759
the media is not a very good measure for
doubts uh...

915
00:47:29,759 --> 00:47:32,479
before dads are you don't have to take
my word

916
00:47:32,479 --> 00:47:33,589
uh...

917
00:47:33,589 --> 00:47:39,619
to go and look at upto deep the story is
also a reporters that critical e covered

918
00:47:39,619 --> 00:47:40,479
apple

919
00:47:40,479 --> 00:47:41,929
bumping the medium

920
00:47:41,929 --> 00:47:44,859
and what happens to their careers

921
00:47:44,859 --> 00:47:46,389
uh...

922
00:47:46,389 --> 00:47:53,389
and so far at the media is not a very
good measure on what actually happens

923
00:48:02,689 --> 00:48:09,689
you think that uh... uh... will the ipod
idea ever bc maybe implementation

924
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:18,329
i think the so far does not business
incentives and doing it correctly that

925
00:48:18,329 --> 00:48:23,419
the whole point of running a cloud is to
have access to use a state of

926
00:48:23,419 --> 00:48:25,079
uh...

927
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:32,079
pretty sure that

928
00:48:34,429 --> 00:48:37,969
uh... you called archie may he could but
how for a decent

929
00:48:37,969 --> 00:48:39,289
crowd that

930
00:48:39,289 --> 00:48:44,159
house opaque storage were even even
calculation there's some advance

931
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:45,849
cryptographic concepts that i'm

932
00:48:45,849 --> 00:48:51,169
not really understanding but apparently
it is possible to used to actually

933
00:48:51,169 --> 00:48:57,539
uh... run calculations in operations on
encrypt the data without having to keep

934
00:48:57,539 --> 00:49:04,539
the problem is there's no business
incentive for us to insult

935
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:11,149
when you mention on the

936
00:49:11,149 --> 00:49:15,009
by guest taking about the i'd are equal
right but realist

937
00:49:15,009 --> 00:49:19,059
was mentioning that basically the same
which imposes no perspective

938
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:23,450
but they using webkit but it will drive
missiles they should be expected night

939
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:26,769
alone didn't you elaborate on that

940
00:49:26,769 --> 00:49:29,299
do you never third term

941
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:34,069
the question and it was in the context
of the arts the ap store application and

942
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:38,879
directions application papa but even if
you reviews webkit that's one thing

943
00:49:38,879 --> 00:49:42,599
uh... that you actually have to
implemented books that made this is a

944
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:43,789
margin

945
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:45,289
uh... policy

946
00:49:45,289 --> 00:49:46,160
checks

947
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,689
and you have to act you turn them on

948
00:49:48,689 --> 00:49:51,099
and in indian

949
00:49:51,099 --> 00:49:52,469
in the arab store alp

950
00:49:52,469 --> 00:49:55,690
for example did simply turned off
because they assume

951
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:56,460
de eat

952
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,569
what whoever they talk to is always
