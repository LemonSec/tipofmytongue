1
00:00:00,849 --> 00:00:04,390
yeah I know it's a hell of a name but
will come to that later on

2
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,600
so welcome to ought to

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,969
of the two at school how has to convince
so far few guys

4
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:16,960
very good like that I only few when the

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,250
last night so I missile talks yesterday
whatever they were really nice

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,380
that's perfect so first thing for you

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,060
sorry so many mister

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:33,680
Peter honey coated some people might
know me by my nickname calling code

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,050
I'm the founder Ralph column the

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,430
you can follow me on twitter but rather

11
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,899
I'll I don't hold any certifications

12
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:51,180
so unlock one of these well I'll try to
keep you folks away anyhow

13
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,010
I know where the first talk after lunch
is usually a bit difficult

14
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,530
guys that the fall asleep solo tu some
exercises

15
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,910
to keep the blood flow running I am
because the stock will be slightly

16
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,990
technical I I find you guys to

17
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,180
raise your hands and ask questions to
stop me

18
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,600
as I go on to actually try it out

19
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,180
I suggest that you all ratio have right
now

20
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,990
all of you yet maybe all along let the
slow

21
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,020
good for the book flow so we all wake up
again

22
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,580
for growth alright so don't hesitate to

23
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:31,329
stop me I am

24
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:35,030
had an interesting talk this morning
with that and the guys are

25
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,079
right on the front row had an
interesting talk

26
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,350
and they asked me okay Peter where

27
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:45,149
you find all the time to to do this
think I'm

28
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,500
is an issue for all of us so

29
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,850
I will start the stock with time and if
you to work time

30
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,960
what is the first thing that pops into
your mind and I'll

31
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,299
let you guys just she also works at the
idea is to make it a bit instructive to

32
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:02,969
wake you

33
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,210
guys up or to keep you awake like SLE

34
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,319
yes s

35
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,020
anyone else yes alright

36
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,220
I wrote a couple of

37
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:22,000
he works down I think we all agree we
don't have enough time

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,340
flies by finest universal time is money

39
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,260
hey we got money stress it's hard to
manage that lines

40
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,569
so there's a lot of things that we can

41
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:37,300
associate with time I am and 30 FPS

42
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,629
unless you are very fortunate

43
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:46,629
unless you have like your dream job what
we usually do with our time

44
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:50,440
is not what we want to do we all have to
make a living

45
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,160
you have to earn some money but so

46
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,209
we have to spend most of our time going
to work and then the fun begins in the

47
00:02:59,209 --> 00:02:59,709
evening

48
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:03,150
up we also need some time to sleep so

49
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,230
that's a little now we only have 24
hours at:

50
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,709
so up there's like a secret our

51
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:15,129
but you'll fight you'll find out when
you have a kid that you have to try to

52
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:15,640
squeeze

53
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,640
24 hours in a day so that is the reality

54
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,640
finding a balance it's painful

55
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,480
maybe a few words about Bay

56
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,319
we all know what pain sounds like anyone

57
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:37,330
yes and they have three

58
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,640
treat a number of times in our life will
end up with more P

59
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,230
more pain means mores

60
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,400
mores leads to a buffer overflow

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,580
and if that happens in your life this is
what happens

62
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,840
yeah

63
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,830
now I don't know if any if any of you

64
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,910
this is a bit familiar with them would
exploit development

65
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:09,530
what kind of overflow is this it's an
exception handler also

66
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,330
that says so what do we do

67
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,109
to try to squeeze in more time we try to
multitask

68
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:20,650
I have a background in the suspect
ministrations

69
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,010
system engineering I one of the things
that I always done

70
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,210
slight script certain tasks up we try to
automate sir

71
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,910
thanks so what we do in the morning
before we go to work or to school

72
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,790
we we start our cross or plus they were

73
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,270
at Amazon or at home and

74
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,320
me levitra we've built some scripts

75
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,950
to let it follows and to make sure that
things get locked properly

76
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,210
that's what we did and ensuring that the
during the day

77
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,200
when the first find something you get
like a a nice message so

78
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,920
via Twitter or you get an email so you
know that

79
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,880
something is waiting for you evening
bottom line

80
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,960
you also fight all the way to and then
by the time you get home

81
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,390
you are presented with an ice cream full
of

82
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:14,880
calculators so you have like your magic
script that too and all the crashes

83
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,470
into exploits right right yep

84
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,500
okay all the title says lights come see
me after the doc

85
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,200
I want to have your script because this
is

86
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,340
of course not through I wish

87
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,840
usually when you write that exploits

88
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:39,340
it requires minimal talk I'm annual

89
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,800
exploit development it takes time but
wait a minute

90
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,460
you're ready set that we don't have
enough time and we have to earn a living

91
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,040
we have to go to work during the day be
only have a few hours at night

92
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,300
and now we have to we have to write
exploits and its final task

93
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:01,150
if you have the luxury to be able to
write exploits during a bet that for a

94
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,490
professional assignments

95
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:07,330
you're still faced with that line so
even if you have the luxury to do it

96
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:12,020
your still run out of sight on top of
that

97
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:18,160
when you build exploits you're trying to
make it fast and reliable

98
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,270
and efficient so

99
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:25,690
it works if you are doing a pen test and
you have to

100
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,740
make the target machine crashed two
hundred times before it actually works

101
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:34,950
that is also prop so if we can build it
fast and reliable and efficient

102
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:39,880
be also create more time for the heart
exports so it's a win-win situation

103
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,780
frustration as normal

104
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,539
so how do you approach that's what is
the solution

105
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:55,390
and the solution is again automation we
try to use plugins

106
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:00,880
you gotta plugins that will make the
Export Development

107
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,340
easier and there's plenty of plugins

108
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,530
weekend spend the night diet they

109
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,270
figuring out which looking to use force
exploit

110
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,419
and find out why certain plugin doesn't
work

111
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:19,039
doesn't work the way you wanted to do so
I had the same problem

112
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,479
and even with all these plugins out
there

113
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:28,169
I still was frustrated a I still wanted
something that was a little bit more

114
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:29,620
intelligent too little

115
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,800
foster ideally one single plugin

116
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,160
have to be a plugin for immunity because
that just happens to be

117
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,970
the debugger of my choice have to be
reliable

118
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,080
because I don't have the time to figure
out why

119
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,400
a certain point it doesn't work so I
wrote something myself

120
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,500
well quick ball who

121
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,720
in the room raise your hand is actually
using that bucket

122
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,700
personal I'll see like three hands

123
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,090
don't want fell asleep again only three
people

124
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,750
it's not that statistics or so important

125
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,210
in fact if you look back to the states

126
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,640
statistics in general we see doubt about
eighty percent is based on fiction

127
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,260
anyway

128
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,599
including this one and pie charts

129
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,339
I mean the biggest part

130
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:32,050
of pie charts look like an ass anyway

131
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,620
sophisticates on up that port

132
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,940
so beve find addr

133
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:45,339
what any the first version was released
September 2009

134
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:48,620
so about year and a half ago

135
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,880
it's like a month so it's written in
Python nicely

136
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,589
a pluck pluck them nicely into immunity
to viral

137
00:08:55,589 --> 00:08:58,940
as a little bit over the five thousand
lines of codes

138
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,180
and it was initially written to find
Atmos

139
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,589
hence the name beefy are my initials

140
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:08,870
find addr yeah I could have made it
longer

141
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,220
by name in be fine addresses

142
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,400
we don't have enough time to do that

143
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,490
and the ideas to run the the plugin

144
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,680
when debugger is attached application
ideally a crashed I'm

145
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,339
so you get the code context and

146
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:30,250
for the the three people that actually
you state you know that

147
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,710
due to the way unity works on the I am
lip

148
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,980
works when you kick it off justly to

149
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,730
you just need to have it let's run
because otherwise it will just crash

150
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,820
immunity debugger

151
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,029
basic usage you just call

152
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:51,430
the name of the plugin soaked buying if
he finds added

153
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:55,450
addr the commands and the parameters a
confines

154
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,980
more information about the fuckin on our
project

155
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,899
website

156
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:07,300
it has a lot of comments again I said I
just wanted single plugin

157
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,430
doesn't mean that I just want the single
month it of course it needs to be able

158
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,420
to do a lot of

159
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,700
a lot of things a.m. I will go through
some of these

160
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,190
comment in a bit so

161
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,240
enough chit chat seeing is believing

162
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,480
we'll have a look at a basic example

163
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,040
its safe 1.2 overwrites so that's

164
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,480
like the mother of all exploits

165
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,520
wat u feed a no plea long-promised

166
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,330
to a function rights on the stock it
overwrites

167
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:44,240
the safety pointer and when the function
returns

168
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,870
you own E that's that's the basic idea

169
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,540
and in general when that happens

170
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,550
ESP which is a sec order it points

171
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:58,270
at part of your failed of control state

172
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:02,990
so the goal is to both a pointer to jump
ESP

173
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,510
in yeah I P so it would jump to ESP

174
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:10,730
or two got bailed that is the general

175
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:17,029
so before that was PV fight addr we had
a couple of weeks

176
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:20,330
do that because E we could use the

177
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,440
but they're both in search control f

178
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,880
search for jump ESP you find one pointer

179
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,160
if you want another one you just
continue the search that is away and in

180
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,510
if you look at all of lot of information
on the Internet tutorials and books

181
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:41,270
this is actually a way that this at ties
to a a Faisal

182
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,320
you can also use a comment line to a
find jobs

183
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,290
assess the scan number of tools
available

184
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,209
that will actually also allow you to to
look for points

185
00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:56,320
but you have to tell it what model to
query you have to say

186
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,050
rum the excusable against yellow

187
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:03,830
look for that information and it returns
a list points

188
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,899
and if it's supports Rex it might
actually provide some

189
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:11,500
results so that's an option

190
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,520
third option is to use a plugin that
will query one molecule

191
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,910
or all models say dot

192
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,339
and then you get a lot of results you
don't know which one to pick

193
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:25,910
course you can try you can pick up
pointer

194
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,380
and then you end up frustrated because
appointed work

195
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:35,610
have to try another phone is a problem

196
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,500
so we have officials

197
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,320
first the fall we either have to select
the modules we want to query

198
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,430
or we simply select them at all

199
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,510
if you use a command line tool we have
to say search this DLL

200
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:54,290
or if it's a plugin just where is all
the mod so

201
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,540
Yes No there's not a lot of fun too
you're just and up

202
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,780
with the big list pointers a half filled
with them

203
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,210
manually

204
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:08,180
why should we need the ability to select
models well

205
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:12,040
first the fall there's is a lock sense

206
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,510
Windows Vista also window so if

207
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,690
2008 2007 yes is a law

208
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:22,170
it's a I system that rebased thats

209
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,580
changes the base at his of modules it
basically randomize it

210
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:30,000
bit but the key is that

211
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,520
it makes your pointers be like so you
don't want to use pointers from those

212
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,080
models

213
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,360
you need to have an ability to exclude
them from your search

214
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,440
a second reason is rebates and that is
often overlooked

215
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,900
at hazel or again it only works on Vista
and up

216
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,090
be base has been there for ages

217
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:56,780
and what it does it also changes the
base address of the models

218
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:00,150
so in essence its has the same problem
as is are

219
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:03,930
it makes your point to some reliable so
you want to exclude those markets as

220
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,850
well

221
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,120
and we also know that if you want to
build a reliable exploits

222
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,630
we don't want to use pointers from an
operating system model

223
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:16,690
because that would limit the exploit
just that operating system

224
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,510
or even that patch version of store
service pack first

225
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:24,520
so we ideally we would like to exclude
this as well

226
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,880
so there are plenty of reasons why we
should have the ability

227
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,160
to exclude certain or two select so

228
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,020
molecules to query

229
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:40,340
on top of that we also need to look at
the point properties

230
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,770
if you are dealing with it string bass
overflow

231
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,560
you don't want to use pointed that has
an old bike because it's going to

232
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,820
stop the overflowing most likey

233
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,400
break inside exploits what if your

234
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,580
exploit inputs is on for tips or

235
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,620
arstan only ASCII actor sorrel out

236
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,720
I mean there's no way if use a command
line tool

237
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,670
and it's going to spit out five thousand
pointers that your

238
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,260
you know they're going to be successful
at going through that this

239
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,390
and find the point is that consist of
ski principle by Sony

240
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:21,750
it's a it's a lot of work

241
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:26,050
also important what it is a molecule is
packed

242
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,800
model that the crips or TN Colts itself

243
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,690
when it gets slow its if you query that
model but a comment line two

244
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,160
it's not going to produce anything
useful because is going to change in

245
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,920
time

246
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,280
assume that the model gets load and that
basically that alone

247
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,640
already rules out all of the command
line tools

248
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,900
unless you are in danger

249
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,810
and you really know what you doing but
if not you are just pushing your luck in

250
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:58,340
your quest

251
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,610
so if you summarize all of that think we
can

252
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,750
yep and of course all the plugins of
outdated

253
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,920
as soon as is a lyrical cock introduced

254
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,550
a lot of the all the plugins simpy were
not able to deal with that so

255
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,740
so if you put everything together
context

256
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,370
it's very important if you run your
scripts

257
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:25,550
each run within the correct context
needs to half

258
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,620
the correct date and the correct
pointers at runtime

259
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,460
ideally crashed I'm so you know which
models are loaded

260
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,430
which aren't that is important

261
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,760
and that is one of the reasons that I
wrote

262
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,310
the V E find attr so

263
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,810
it will automatically filled about all
the bat models

264
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:51,270
we don't care about is a lower we don't
care about the base

265
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:55,370
of course optional if you still want to
query a solar modules

266
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,580
UK well

267
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,110
it would also indicate if certain point
source

268
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,600
contain no lights and you can even him
out say I don't

269
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,289
and working with the string exploit
don't give me the point have no

270
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:15,750
it also shows with a point to consist of
asking boats

271
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,539
it's also interesting and it will also
ignore

272
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,890
operating system os if you tell it

273
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:26,850
every Kamal every time the plugin
searches for information

274
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:30,130
memory it fights the output to the lock
window

275
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:34,100
and to a text file so you can save it
for later or you can

276
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,559
just use crack there's a a link to

277
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,779
UNIX you feel for Windows so you can
easily

278
00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:44,159
with a little script together and search
for the pointers

279
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:47,860
affects

280
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,650
he fights addr also look for parts
doesn't look for instructions

281
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,179
so that means that if the parts

282
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:59,059
that reference instruction

283
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:02,330
if those fights are part of a bigger
called or

284
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,659
big construction it will actually find
it's not

285
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:09,159
looking at just instructions so it
should use

286
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:13,090
a lot of results and in this example

287
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:18,390
issue looking for appointed to jump to a
register

288
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:22,380
its obviously going to look for the the
obvious once

289
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,350
jump to the register a call or register
push the register to the stock and

290
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,240
return to it

291
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,279
but it's also searching for or
combinations

292
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:39,279
so it should issue a lot of results and
all of that

293
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:44,240
just happens with won't come out so

294
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,909
yes let's put into practice

295
00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:53,400
I don't know if anyone is familiar with
the tutorial some court and I'll be

296
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,630
the first tutorial it yeah describes an
exploit in the

297
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,049
easy RM to mp3 converter to you probably

298
00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:04,549
everybody nose and uses on a daily basis

299
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:09,080
anyway I am the key in that exploit is
to find the jump

300
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,659
ESP and let's have a quick look

301
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:15,880
at the results if you just use a

302
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,250
comment line script free carry all the
molecules

303
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,549
we end up with two other than 35 points

304
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:26,549
Sri limit the search to the application
modules we end up with

305
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:30,140
94 pointers if we excludes

306
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,529
the ones that are going to be based we
have five

307
00:19:33,529 --> 00:19:37,470
pointers BV find attr will just fine one
pointer

308
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:41,490
and it's the only one that works so

309
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:45,029
clear time time ditch you're ready 1

310
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:49,809
a lot of time

311
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:53,919
so when you have a good pointer

312
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,390
have to put it somewhere in your pilots
that's that to

313
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:01,049
and the most common technique is to use
a cycle batter

314
00:20:01,049 --> 00:20:04,330
so what you do instead of

315
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,390
using a lot of aids in your payloads

316
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:11,360
and crash the application with A's we
use a long stream

317
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,890
with the cyclic pattern that cyclic
pattern is deals

318
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,159
to make sure that F 34 bytes in the
pattern

319
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,220
or unique so that means that crashed I'm

320
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,679
you can actually find the offset in that
long string

321
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,130
and know the exact four bytes where you
need to point

322
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:33,150
need to put your point to for example
jump ESP

323
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,210
these are just to tools that are part of
the Metasploit

324
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:40,039
framework so you can create a pattern
this case

325
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:43,220
a ten thousand bites I turn right fall

326
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,390
you copy the contents put it in your
exploits you crash

327
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:50,230
application and then when you look at E

328
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,750
yeah I P you see that it contains the FB

329
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,659
you look at the offset and you know that
yeah I you will be overwritten

330
00:20:57,659 --> 00:21:00,960
after that offset

331
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,409
so that's the traditional way

332
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:08,100
but we can do better well

333
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,669
stock with we can do the same we can
also create

334
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:14,669
exact same pattern from within the
plugin

335
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:17,749
we can also get the offset from within
the plugin

336
00:21:17,749 --> 00:21:21,190
so if you don't have a medal sport
coffee available at that time

337
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,460
you can still do exactly the same

338
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,549
once you have crash that district by
cyclic pattern

339
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:33,980
there's a lot more that we can do
weekend use it for more purposes that

340
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,240
just finding an offset

341
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,970
to ER AP

342
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,080
and I think it's really important to
mention

343
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,340
that before jumping into action

344
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:50,009
building the exploits it's important to
enumerate all your primitives

345
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:53,869
all your options not only look at the
offset

346
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:58,529
but where where is the payload stored in
memory

347
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:03,190
is just bought one time on stack can be
fine multiple copies may be difficult

348
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,549
he and especially if you look at
exploits that are for example based on

349
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:09,139
Muni code

350
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:12,460
building unical payload is a bit more
complex

351
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:17,659
but if first look at where our failed
and replaced maybe there is an ASCII

352
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:18,389
version

353
00:22:18,389 --> 00:22:21,740
happy waiting for you to be used so

354
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,950
enumerating all your options is really
important before building

355
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,869
the exploits so

356
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:33,999
when you make when you trick at the
crash using a cyclic pattern

357
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:38,210
you can simply use the find MSP come out

358
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:41,970
and it will not only if you the offset
automatically

359
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:46,210
to the IP but it will actually search
for all the site

360
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,259
cyclic patterns and memory it will look
at all the registers

361
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:53,619
it look at the exception and watching it
will look at stack

362
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:57,860
see if points to your pattern so it will
too

363
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,789
it will do a lot of lot of things and
free tip of the day

364
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:06,929
and most buzzer state use he's to
trigger a buffer overflow

365
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:11,169
if you build your own first-ever police
make sure that its greats

366
00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:14,519
cyclic batter it's going to save you a
lot of time

367
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:18,940
when you have crash you can run fine MSP
you have all your premise

368
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,950
right away so you don't have to make it
crash

369
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:25,190
a second part so

370
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:28,450
I already said fight MSP

371
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,600
it was fine all the copies it will check
if registered as

372
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,690
written it will also check is a
registered

373
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:38,549
points into a cyclic pattern exception
handler records

374
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:42,330
it will look on the stack and have also
indicated if the pattern

375
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,460
is a normal or unico the expo fortune

376
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:49,549
of off the bat

377
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:53,940
any questions so far no

378
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,619
right seconds very common

379
00:23:57,619 --> 00:24:03,019
type of stack-based overflows is in
exception handler overrides

380
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:06,360
so if you offer ends up overwriting

381
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,610
an exception handler on the stack and
you find a way

382
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:12,879
trigger an access violation more than
that the virus

383
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:16,179
access violation where

384
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:20,860
the excitation stryker it will actually
told the exception handler

385
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,970
to handle the exception

386
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,320
pretty office now when the handler kicks
in

387
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,419
a pointer to the next hand structure

388
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:34,830
is ESP plus so a common exploit
technique

389
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:38,749
you just overwrite the exception handler
with the point is to

390
00:24:38,749 --> 00:24:42,330
a pop pop rap com- pop-up rat
combination

391
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:45,739
which will bring you back to

392
00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:49,179
the next structured exception handler

393
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:52,669
and execute so that will bring you back
to your

394
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:55,860
Williams

395
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,669
but we all know in the meantime that we
can't use any pointers from argues about

396
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:02,080
protect against this

397
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:07,029
Mikes of at the nice technique that
prevents you from using

398
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:11,379
all kinds of operate combinations

399
00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:14,499
so we you're seeing similar issues

400
00:25:14,499 --> 00:25:19,139
well and looking at building an exploit
for exception handle rights

401
00:25:19,139 --> 00:25:23,730
ass with the once that you saw when we
needed to jump to register

402
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,889
like in South the same problem

403
00:25:26,889 --> 00:25:29,889
they either won't be able to indicate
that

404
00:25:29,889 --> 00:25:34,409
model is protected protections were at
it

405
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:37,619
but the plugins were not up update its

406
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:41,179
course they don't like games that will
actually indicate which model is

407
00:25:41,179 --> 00:25:45,090
protected which one not on

408
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,730
you can already hear that there is some
money will work involved

409
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,730
you have to look for the models that are
not protected have to query them

410
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:56,350
individually we still have the hazel or
and the rebase

411
00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:01,299
issue so those are models that we want
that we don't want to use

412
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:04,350
pointer criteria what if don't use no

413
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:08,549
ASCII unico so long most plugins

414
00:26:08,549 --> 00:26:12,009
only look for pop opera but there are a
lot of

415
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:15,009
alternative routines you can use

416
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:18,239
look for at yes peepers a threat

417
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:21,580
you could also look for at yes people's
for

418
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,860
pop rats called the work look outside

419
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,769
of so molecules and that's exactly what

420
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:33,429
if he finds it York us has a a couple of

421
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:38,700
Kamal's that relates with exception and
that overwrites

422
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,720
that basically allow you to specify what
more does she want to query

423
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,450
and it'll just happens without a list
point to stop or

424
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:51,149
usable or we

425
00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:54,649
and a cop other options if you want to
tweak the search so if you want to

426
00:26:54,649 --> 00:26:55,110
exclude

427
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:59,190
no point to see if you don't want search
for a if you don't want to search

428
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,360
in OS models actually the minus so

429
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,580
this making sense anymore because even
on XP

430
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:11,059
all the US model source sese protect
that these days

431
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:14,509
and if you want to limits the search to
just one model

432
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:21,210
you can space fight so lots of options

433
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:24,269
but maybe we can make it the better

434
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:28,679
we have a a lot of techniques to search
for pointers

435
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:32,419
there's a lot of stuff that we can do
when looking for cyclic patterns

436
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:37,200
so maybe we can you throw all these
things together

437
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,980
I just three steps to victory

438
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:46,779
trigger crash for the cyclic pattern

439
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:50,889
we tell the plug and to suggest
something

440
00:27:50,889 --> 00:27:57,549
and we so yes

441
00:27:57,549 --> 00:28:00,999
let's look at the quick them

442
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:06,279
it's a recently discovered a.m.
fallibility endoscopic Asian

443
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:09,690
I think it's a bites 'em

444
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,070
so we'll have a quick look how to
suggest feature works

445
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:16,399
and how fast we can build an exploits
for

446
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,590
solvability I am

447
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,879
this video that other show is shop in
real time

448
00:28:22,879 --> 00:28:26,629
so I didn't cut out any time frames

449
00:28:26,629 --> 00:28:30,179
a try to guide you through sir just a
couple minutes so let's have a quick

450
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:31,169
look

451
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:34,919
so

452
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:39,549
first we launch I gess which is called
application

453
00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:43,309
it's running shows on number of popups

454
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:47,580
system started and now we attach
immunity debugger

455
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:52,379
to the application

456
00:28:52,379 --> 00:28:55,600
so it's the data server component
licence imports

457
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,450
12 for all while and we just

458
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:03,100
run the application inside

459
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,989
next recreates acyclic

460
00:29:06,989 --> 00:29:11,139
I cheated a little bit I already figured
out that we need 5000 bytes

461
00:29:11,139 --> 00:29:15,580
and i also prepared for that skeletal
that will be used to send

462
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:19,309
those 5,000 bites to

463
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:23,109
to the application so the open the
father contains the pattern

464
00:29:23,109 --> 00:29:26,549
we copy the pattern and

465
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:31,999
we open the proof-of-concept scutum so
it has a little Heather

466
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:35,830
we just based in flash the five thousand
bites

467
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:39,730
within the buffer the buffer will be set
supports 1240

468
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:44,259
one

469
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:48,340
very easy very simple

470
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:55,340
and we run the Python script

471
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:02,580
bull access violation you rock

472
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,970
wrote beyond the end of the structuring
we see

473
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,409
cyclic pattern on the stack so all we
have to do now

474
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:14,080
is stellate to suggest something and if
you look up

475
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,240
what you can see oppose it so

476
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,549
first the fall it just looks for all the
instances

477
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:26,039
of the cyclic at so you can see the
first one

478
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:30,179
is one on the stack the other two are on
the heap might be an option

479
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:33,659
maybe we can just simply to return to
keep

480
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:37,450
why not and also looks at the registers
entities that

481
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:41,029
yes I points into the pattern at
position

482
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:45,049
752 so we already know the offset I we
know that

483
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:49,299
maybe we can do a chump yes I it also
looks

484
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:52,720
at exception and the chain edits shows

485
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,690
that we have overwritten the chain and
its shows that be

486
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,980
over have overwritten the X a

487
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,440
exception handler after 540

488
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,720
bytes and then it has done

489
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,140
a little search on the stack found a
bunch of pointers

490
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,480
it's important just enumerates your
primitives

491
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,240
make sure that you have you options
options you might need to

492
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,120
using that knowledge it's just going to
show that

493
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,590
on the stack exception handler

494
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:33,799
fy14 so using that knowledge

495
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:37,710
it can simply suggest and I'll exploit

496
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:41,320
it can tell you are you need two feet 5
and 10

497
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,510
Jan bites than half the next exception
handler

498
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,890
pointer some not show called that issue

499
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:53,500
field company much easier than this guy

500
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,850
it even shows you the commands to find
pointer to a pop opera

501
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:02,830
so as with let's use that information

502
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:06,830
and built the exploit so

503
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:11,789
remove John we need five other than 10
bytes

504
00:32:11,789 --> 00:32:14,880
for reach the exception handler next

505
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,279
anyone familiar we recognize this

506
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:22,149
this is just a small jump okay

507
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:26,850
we need a pointer so will tell he finds
your

508
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:30,539
to get as a pointer again this is real
time

509
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:35,130
it will take a little while you're going
to exclude

510
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:38,139
no bites Noize molecules know the base

511
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:41,990
so it's just going to search for all the
combinations

512
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:45,529
field them and then at the end

513
00:32:45,529 --> 00:32:51,889
will have a list pointers guys still
okay

514
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:55,100
there with me hands up

515
00:32:55,100 --> 00:33:02,100
the flow yes thurgood almost there

516
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,890
if you do this demo real time and you
accidentally click

517
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:30,050
the fucker hang and echoes of them so

518
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,410
590 nighty pointers

519
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:36,770
that should be enough so let's open the
fall

520
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:40,750
it shows the list below the molecules
with all the properties

521
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:44,200
and we'll just take the first 10 so
because

522
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,340
youth and be pasted into our exploits

523
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:51,660
yeah I know

524
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,750
this is sup optimal way to

525
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,960
present the pointer but it works I was
just lazy

526
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:03,120
okay we also need some Chilcote so let's
create

527
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,360
a few lines show coats would use
Metasploit Sanath

528
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:13,230
F you know to do that everybody familiar
with that snook a month

529
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,340
on earth like two weeks ago it combines

530
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:20,480
the and as a pillow and as F goat to one
single moms

531
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,280
thats school so been a slow

532
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,950
she it'll take a few seconds to
generates psalm

533
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:31,649
calculator show called I'll

534
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:34,760
country liquid gel coat but an excuse
company

535
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:41,409
so because Chilcote and replace it

536
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:45,300
into our exploits okay

537
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,450
now remember this is an exception
handler overrun

538
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:54,340
we need to trigger an access violation
we can do that by

539
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,360
writing the arms the end of the spectrum
so we'll just

540
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,620
at more junk to the nth will build our
buffer

541
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,740
which consists of the Heather some junk
the exception had the records

542
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,850
shell both and the official John

543
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:11,920
so all the components put it in but for
and we'll send it

544
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,750
reports 12 for 10 it's close

545
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:22,750
if the thing yes

546
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:32,069
start I gess again check

547
00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:37,930
throwing yep

548
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,009
started listening and

549
00:35:41,009 --> 00:35:44,999
which simply run exploits book so

550
00:35:44,999 --> 00:35:50,739
if

551
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:57,739
question so far

552
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,729
no I think here

553
00:36:02,729 --> 00:36:07,359
alright let's move all this is basic
function I think this is basically what

554
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:08,529
other plugins

555
00:36:08,529 --> 00:36:11,779
can do as well with some Kathy outs with
some

556
00:36:11,779 --> 00:36:16,569
throwbacks you can do better but
characters

557
00:36:16,569 --> 00:36:20,960
but characters are very important if you
are building

558
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,430
exploit and you want it to be reliable
if it if you for example want

559
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,789
to an end and two with Metasploit module
so you can use

560
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:33,239
all kinds of bailouts you really have to
figure out what the back

561
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:37,339
are and that is a heart process

562
00:36:37,339 --> 00:36:42,279
its as a lot of work and

563
00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:45,609
there are like three ways to approach
you could just

564
00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:48,940
ignore it you could just say well you
know what will try

565
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,559
without figuring out what they are and
if the export works

566
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:56,839
fun its lottery you can also get

567
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:59,839
maybe certain file types

568
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,910
on the country

569
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:06,880
they can be very helpful to the time the
list characters it might make

570
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,410
very much sense if you for example take
I'm

571
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:13,989
your typical playlist file in that file

572
00:37:13,989 --> 00:37:17,499
as a reference to another file so what r

573
00:37:17,499 --> 00:37:20,680
the characters that or far-left or at
Follett

574
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:26,099
in a filing and if you also realize that
every turn

575
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:29,989
witches and bites your ails you got the
it will

576
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:33,329
break that string then you already know
that okay

577
00:37:33,329 --> 00:37:37,079
these are my iPad characters so you can
sometimes you can just guess

578
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:41,190
at Cubs the few really want to make sure
you have to build

579
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:44,499
perfectly accurate list and

580
00:37:44,499 --> 00:37:48,089
can be very time consuming so

581
00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:51,339
what is the idea instead of putting

582
00:37:51,339 --> 00:37:54,609
ace or cyclic pattern in your paleo

583
00:37:54,609 --> 00:37:59,009
we fill it with an array with all the
bites all the fights between zero

584
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:02,680
an as we just throw

585
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,440
the play feel old at the application
hope it still crashes

586
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,630
and then we can actually compare

587
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:13,339
the original untouched array with your a

588
00:38:13,339 --> 00:38:17,289
memory maybe some by so corrupt that
maybe the entire

589
00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:21,349
paid out Scott's after certain by and
then you know that

590
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:24,969
okay that could be that character let's
take it out let's

591
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:28,299
regenerate the array again excluding
that bat

592
00:38:28,299 --> 00:38:32,339
character hey just continue to do that
process

593
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:36,059
until the source array matches

594
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:39,109
the array and memory it still takes a
lot of time

595
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:42,219
up it pays off its

596
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:45,599
will help you to build a reliable
exploit

597
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,579
so BV fight attr has a an option for
that as well

598
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:53,479
you just write your array to a binary
file

599
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:56,789
you also put it in the payload and then
it crashed I'm

600
00:38:56,789 --> 00:39:01,359
you basically say compare you provided
the file name

601
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,729
it will automatically search for all

602
00:39:05,729 --> 00:39:10,749
against show them and it'll compared
with the original ones

603
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:14,690
and it will indicate which fights alter
a top position

604
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:17,910
so it should help you figuring out about
characters

605
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:22,499
unico

606
00:39:22,499 --> 00:39:27,599
for a long time a lot of people thought
that unique ot

607
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,650
was not exploitable and it requires

608
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:36,609
a different approach its sometimes not
easy

609
00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:40,819
to exploit unico so we strive to do our
best

610
00:39:40,819 --> 00:39:44,640
puts out of tools into PV find your

611
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,529
that will help you building unico
exports unical by the way

612
00:39:50,529 --> 00:39:54,609
you see 0.00% 41 0.00% 41 it's not just
about

613
00:39:54,609 --> 00:40:00,890
and sorting nope I between every
character the payload is actually the

614
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:01,420
result

615
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,880
of course it's a function that will take

616
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,180
ASCII convert it into unique old and
most cases

617
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:12,960
its results in the payload that contains

618
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,049
not bites between yup but it's not
entirely true

619
00:40:17,049 --> 00:40:20,829
we also have transforms we also have
certain bites

620
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:24,430
that if they are conflicted unico are
not

621
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:28,329
00 but they have another

622
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:31,599
and that is interesting make because

623
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,210
simply searching for pointers that our
and the Seattle Seattle

624
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:38,589
xx 00 xx former is not enough

625
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:41,940
ideally feel so would like to search for

626
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,819
transforms

627
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:49,259
be honest haven't seen a lot of scripts
that do that of course

628
00:40:49,259 --> 00:40:53,509
other scripts search for the easy ones
other local strip search for

629
00:40:53,509 --> 00:40:56,710
transforms and it does pay off

630
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:59,920
it does pay off let's look at

631
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,109
an example I am sign player

632
00:41:03,109 --> 00:41:06,230
another very popular player all of you

633
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,509
from use it on a daily basis I

634
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:13,249
it'll exploits there was a
proof-of-concept posted on exploit pp

635
00:41:13,249 --> 00:41:16,269
I'm about a year ago show the pier

636
00:41:16,269 --> 00:41:19,640
exception handler overwrites and of two
weeks they were still

637
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,160
exploits wonder why she to a normal
search

638
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,339
it showed 0 unical points that were
simply

639
00:41:27,339 --> 00:41:31,099
nada unical pointer to a operetta

640
00:41:31,099 --> 00:41:34,779
to actually exploits that ability so

641
00:41:34,779 --> 00:41:37,940
Iran a simple easy fight addr guess what

642
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:41,219
it found three transforms so that means
that I

643
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:45,200
three ways to exploit it I posted
exploit the same day

644
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,710
so it pays off

645
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:53,019
second example I am a while back

646
00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:56,369
there was an exploit weekend organized
host

647
00:41:56,369 --> 00:42:00,160
by offensive security where they ask

648
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,999
all the cum old contestants to
exploitable through

649
00:42:03,999 --> 00:42:07,660
flow in Foxit Reader a

650
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,710
one of the guys of Courtland he just
mailed it in a few hours

651
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:17,289
using tools so

652
00:42:17,289 --> 00:42:21,410
and of course it wouldn't be PV
following

653
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:24,440
addr if there was fine function

654
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,640
not that the other functions are not
looking for anything but

655
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,019
there is a fine on sure you can do

656
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:34,410
fine for straying or a binary or
whatever and

657
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:38,390
the fucker your phone touch with the
plugin is that it was

658
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:43,680
it will simply this locations and

659
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,049
it just presents the same information

660
00:42:48,049 --> 00:42:52,579
basically what it does a couple of other
options

661
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:57,160
it can assemble moms it can calculate
offset between

662
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,469
to address is if you for example to know
are

663
00:43:00,469 --> 00:43:06,539
need to jump back 400 bites were on come
back from this register to that address

664
00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:10,410
you can quickly type an offset with the
Atmos register

665
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:14,109
and it will show the distance and it
will show you ok coats to jump to that

666
00:43:14,109 --> 00:43:14,539
this

667
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:18,829
so it seeks infocomm

668
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:21,940
will show you what's more information
about the mattress

669
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:26,440
show you what model it belongs what
instruction is

670
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,469
also show information about the molecule
whether it's

671
00:43:29,469 --> 00:43:33,119
is Laura's a sec sector and so on

672
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,809
you can list them all tools with all the
properties you can show the ones

673
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:40,449
not is are and so on

674
00:43:40,449 --> 00:43:43,529
above a lot of options and features I'll

675
00:43:43,529 --> 00:43:49,069
readily available for you

676
00:43:49,069 --> 00:43:52,739
not impressed well

677
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:56,579
there's also rock I am

678
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:59,699
I published though the rock generator

679
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:03,699
with this just another come out in the
plugin I published it

680
00:44:03,699 --> 00:44:07,449
June 2010 so that's about year ago

681
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:11,150
in conjunction with the toward that I
wrote

682
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:14,190
I am it will cap gadgets

683
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:17,539
it will cap the required information

684
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:20,809
to build the role exploits its low

685
00:44:20,809 --> 00:44:24,619
I can't deny it it's very slow but it's
accurate

686
00:44:24,619 --> 00:44:29,019
and at that point I figured that it
would be better to

687
00:44:29,019 --> 00:44:32,319
use more results that need it stand to
pee

688
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:36,559
produce not enough results so

689
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:41,199
speed is not not rates it will actually
look and memory

690
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:45,369
built gadgets up to 8 instructions by
default

691
00:44:45,369 --> 00:44:49,630
it's a parameter so you can change that
if you don't want your gadgets to and

692
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:50,489
with the rat

693
00:44:50,489 --> 00:44:53,579
you can just specify call yea

694
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:56,630
EA X or call you saw you whatever

695
00:44:56,630 --> 00:45:01,569
ending that you want to use it has all
the features of all the other compounds

696
00:45:01,569 --> 00:45:04,980
so if you want point to sell ASCII
printable

697
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:08,499
have no bites she want felt about is a
law or

698
00:45:08,499 --> 00:45:12,799
you based models that's all available so

699
00:45:12,799 --> 00:45:15,799
the end result is good what you get in
your hands

700
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:18,999
is action useful one of the reasons why

701
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:22,339
slow is that it also of goats but

702
00:45:22,339 --> 00:45:26,759
so just an example the first one as a
jump for the rat

703
00:45:26,759 --> 00:45:30,420
the second on it's just subset of the
construction

704
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:33,429
and it produces seconds catch it

705
00:45:33,429 --> 00:45:36,900
yes question I catch it

706
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,289
is am a series of instructions

707
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:44,660
that in the most common

708
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:49,480
set up and spit Rep so you in Iraq
exploit you chain

709
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,679
gadgets to each other so they will
actually

710
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:56,880
for example to a4 chip affect mark

711
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,319
the memory has executed yeah the key
concept of chocolate that

712
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:04,390
is that your they don't stack is no
longer XQ

713
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:09,730
preventing you to execute shop

714
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:15,239
by the way if you have time check the
time line on exploit you be

715
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:18,440
force the publication of the rock

716
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,440
might see that there's a link between
the two

717
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,429
nice to see that gets adopted

718
00:46:26,429 --> 00:46:29,579
conclusion BV fight a Dr

719
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:34,789
it will buy a sign for sure accurate
information is important

720
00:46:34,789 --> 00:46:38,199
it also automates certain tasks we'll
see

721
00:46:38,199 --> 00:46:42,230
the demo of suggests sir certainly a
nice example

722
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:45,960
automation and November mess I don't
know if anyone knows from

723
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,579
when we're a mess he it didn't talk at
Black Hat

724
00:46:49,579 --> 00:46:54,420
about visualization I I attended a talk

725
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:58,449
be good attention so I'll try to
visualize

726
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:02,769
without the plugin frustration

727
00:47:02,769 --> 00:47:06,569
with the fuckin

728
00:47:06,569 --> 00:47:10,319
fun

729
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:15,259
questions

730
00:47:15,259 --> 00:47:19,360
okay

731
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:23,500
as go too far to walk the talk and
actually this is a scoop

732
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,560
for the nice guys increase in Athens

733
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,700
this is the first time that I'm going to
talk about this

734
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:35,010
and public what s wrong

735
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:39,370
know a couple things wrong BV fight addr

736
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:43,820
it was never designed to do what it does
today I started with a single moms

737
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:47,020
I added the second on at a certain point

738
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:51,710
I realized that thinks to integrate
started writing a lot of math

739
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:54,750
go them copying go to three times

740
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:58,430
ha there was no functional sign

741
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:02,360
and I figured if I was going to add more
features

742
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:06,250
trying to fix certain things with
probably only make it worse

743
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,920
so second everything works

744
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,470
it's reliable it's accurate but its very
slow

745
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:17,270
and I heard a lot of comments it still
fast

746
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:21,120
than doing it manually still faster than
doing it with all the plugins

747
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:25,010
but in the end it still slow and its

748
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:28,540
slow mainly because of the way the
plugin searchers

749
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:31,870
memory it uses the eye and lip search

750
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:35,430
search for example if you

751
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:38,960
should tell it to search jump yes people
enter it look

752
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,950
in time in the range for all the
pointers and it will then feel to them

753
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:47,850
so that's painfully slow it's hooked up
to a suboptimal

754
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:52,580
because after API second of all

755
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:56,330
no sorry 30 issue is that all the output
files

756
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:59,700
are written into the same full so if you
use the same

757
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,880
back for instance to build milt exports
multiple applications

758
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:08,020
you end up overwriting files when you

759
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,840
forgot that this is not a file from this
but from the previous

760
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:17,050
using a point that doesn't work and a
lot of frustrations

761
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:21,340
the last fall is also very important

762
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:24,430
I'm as Hawks 2 excludes so

763
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:27,790
molecules from the search let me give
you an example

764
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:31,410
um we all use of virtual machines

765
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:35,540
to build exploits if you for example use
VirtualBox

766
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,660
you install the cast additions it

767
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:42,710
at Los at the lol your process the same

768
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:46,880
thing elsewhere for example s implying
that when those

769
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,090
shell extensions in general it just
loads

770
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:53,440
official the other else in your
applications you don't want to its

771
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,150
models

772
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:57,750
even if they give you good pointer it's
only going to work on your

773
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:01,500
own system or on a system that has that
additional market slowed

774
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,230
so in PV fight attr

775
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:09,130
there was no way to actually exclude you
really have to manually

776
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:12,500
going to the next fall and exclude does

777
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,720
models crap was helpful feel

778
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:20,510
so boom not good

779
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:24,190
and that's why

780
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:28,870
we kicked off project go back we this
was actually

781
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:33,650
a court nineteen project and this is the
working title

782
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:36,840
for a project that would result full
rewrite

783
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:42,310
we started the design phase and back in
February

784
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:45,340
its

785
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:50,910
development still doing development
still tweaking it a little bit adding

786
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:52,060
more features

787
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:57,660
it will get a new name and

788
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:00,850
unfortunately have to announce that

789
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:03,890
EV fine addr is now fish

790
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:07,450
debt so anything we've seen so far

791
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:11,310
is that and maybe we should all take a
few moments

792
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:18,310
few moments of silence to mourn about
the loss

793
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:25,680
of our nice plugin but of course is good
news

794
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:32,110
doesn't your and that's the name

795
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:35,560
yeah don't ask me where

796
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:40,350
I got the name from maybe some of you
already know the name of my little

797
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:41,060
daughter

798
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:44,840
the the guys in the team they insist
that on using that name

799
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,050
although law I had some issues with it
because

800
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:52,450
he put the exclamation mark in from the
you know how they pronounce that

801
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:57,000
out today pronounced X exclamation mark

802
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,460
buying so gang mona I don't think so

803
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:03,720
I mean as a good that

804
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,910
on the other hand if anyone if any guy

805
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:10,120
ever wants to bang Mona it will be in it
Booker

806
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:13,260
and not and realized over Mike that body
so

807
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:16,820
I'm ok with that there was some
alternatives

808
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:20,220
we also thought about naming it bus or

809
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:24,340
your mother or cock or

810
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:28,690
so a Bangkok it's not

811
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:32,640
right so yet they lost to do with

812
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,940
right this time really think about what
does it need to

813
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:39,300
to make sure that there's a function
design

814
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:45,340
it still uses the same concept so
anything we've seen is not lost

815
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:49,250
up it was professional redesigned from
the ground up

816
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:52,690
again it was a team project nice to see
we'd all

817
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:56,140
really professional job reworked arts

818
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:59,410
didn't waste any time so

819
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:04,200
this was one of two the kickoff meeting
very important

820
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:07,730
these other guys actually participated
im

821
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:10,830
and the project

822
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:14,020
we are still right working on
documentation

823
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:17,930
some other stuff so that's the project

824
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:21,980
so what all the improvements

825
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:27,970
first of all I think it's easier to
pronounce

826
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:31,540
and also safe site because if you're
struggling to pronounce the name

827
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:35,350
Mona just

828
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:39,930
is Kamal no house separate help function
for the guys that have use pde5

829
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:43,380
80-yard in the past you know that if you
want to see help

830
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:47,160
you have to type fight at the ER without
any command

831
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,470
than you get like five ageless with all
amounts help

832
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:54,010
you have to scroll up find moms week
that will text

833
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:58,510
so just figured that every single Kamal
help function

834
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:01,900
we have config file we have some global
options

835
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:05,830
performance there's a pep direction

836
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:09,890
and we now focus all Ruby output

837
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:13,050
re so

838
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:17,560
let's take a look at the functions that
are available right now

839
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:22,070
a monster available right now so

840
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:25,220
you for example see that we've marched
all that be

841
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:28,420
p1 p2 a J say

842
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:32,000
just put it all into one single I'm also
we

843
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,840
basically we thought all of the commands

844
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,040
this is these are the commands a dollar
developed already

845
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:43,690
today there will be some more

846
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:48,510
if he wants to see what your options are
the parameters are for

847
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:54,660
amount just help with comment show you

848
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:58,090
okay kasich fall so we have two issues

849
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:02,030
first the fall there was the issue where
all the help files

850
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:06,090
sport into unity immunity program

851
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:09,840
what you can do now is you can set a
conflict parameter

852
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:13,210
and that its to set the working full to

853
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:16,780
something else can use the percentage p

854
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,990
to indicate the process name so if you
create

855
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:23,800
fault see locks you set the working
forty percent P

856
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,930
it will create subfolder for each
process

857
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:31,200
and it's alright all the output so

858
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,720
output is better ranged by the way you
can also use percentage

859
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:39,010
I and that will include process ID

860
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:42,620
excluding models again

861
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:45,660
we just put them in a conflict fall we
say okay

862
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:49,200
exclude molecules we just this all the
shell extensions

863
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,870
that are installed in our computer and
they will be ignored

864
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:59,220
research so another time saver

865
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:03,780
global options so for backwards
compatibility

866
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:07,030
we still shakers

867
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:10,760
with keep the minus and to filter out no
bites

868
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:15,530
minus 0 felt always models this at work

869
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:19,480
but we figure that we need more panel
out so we added

870
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:23,110
minus cm the M she is four criteria

871
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:27,210
hands for molecules there you can now
really specify

872
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:30,430
what type of criteria you want include
or exclude

873
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:33,480
by setting certain parameter true or
false

874
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:37,740
and most Kamal for example this one

875
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:42,230
most epic amounts already half 3d find

876
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:45,990
or the full set of multiple criteria

877
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:49,220
they will if you for example look for
exceptional Andrew flow

878
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:52,630
it will already set say sector false
isadore

879
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:57,960
to falsely based falls West false so the
points that you get by default

880
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:02,570
are most likely pointer work you want to
tweak behavior

881
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:05,770
you can overrule by setting multiple
criteria

882
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:10,010
so that's just one

883
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:13,760
you can also query a list of course the
query in

884
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:18,230
if you find a Dr you could specify one
volume knob you can just say okay I only

885
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:19,280
want use

886
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,380
or I only want to search that that

887
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:26,610
mall you you can use while course

888
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:30,730
nice

889
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:34,000
become more especially with

890
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,580
patrol point to speak on beta

891
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:41,090
in the past we need that one pointer and
we went

892
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:46,380
minority through the list find the point
that didn't have any at characters

893
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:49,470
patrol a big chunk of bail on

894
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:52,720
points so

895
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,180
we actually need more Krunal at on

896
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:59,220
selecting points as well

897
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:03,410
and this is what we did minus EP

898
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:06,780
criteria pointer and you can now specify

899
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:09,820
one or more of these criteria so if you
want

900
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:13,050
ASCII printable pointers and

901
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:16,210
you just specify mines TP ask print

902
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:19,220
that's what only show you those ask
points

903
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:26,180
so that's good one step in the right
direction

904
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:29,640
we also can this become not only

905
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:33,420
specified behavior on of pointers we can
also

906
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:36,560
feed it at this time at characters if
you already know

907
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,640
that for example 00:18:00 the

908
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:43,960
FF will be pat characters

909
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:47,320
we just specify to the search and it
will exclude pointers

910
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:51,180
at half character so it works just like
an encoder

911
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:54,930
but for points and you can use that

912
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:58,660
in conjunction with mine CP mine cm

913
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,980
you can combine anything in every search
compounds

914
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:08,980
that is so this should be noted thanks
safe

915
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:13,930
yes next improvement

916
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:17,560
performance what that we do with
performance

917
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:22,340
so I think you'll agree he find a Dr was
a time saver

918
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:25,660
but mona is designed to be a lot faster
and

919
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:28,700
I think the toukie is that be

920
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:32,670
stopped using I am live actually spend

921
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:36,060
think spent like 20 hours straight

922
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:39,230
figuring out what would be the best way
to do search

923
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:43,060
and we ended up with about 40 lines of
code

924
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:46,590
that performs a genetic search in memory

925
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:50,910
and it goes place Fox so will chill
we'll look at some demos

926
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:54,070
some statistics

927
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:57,740
a second thing is that they will filter
during the search of the searched so

928
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:00,320
instead of searching the entire memory
space

929
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:04,050
dang feeding that through the filter
it's actually going to show through the

930
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:05,550
search and it smart

931
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:08,920
it knows that if for example if you look
for

932
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:12,610
unical pointers it's not even going to
search molecules

933
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:16,950
that doesn't start for 20 because it
knows that it will never return

934
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:22,040
point so and if you are in a hurry and
if you only need one

935
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:25,900
5 and pointers you can just that it's
okay if me

936
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:31,810
who if I folks question

937
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:35,180
it will to exact it will 3 transforms

938
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:42,180
unico so

939
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:47,350
well the transform only happens at the
end not in the beginning

940
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:50,670
so that's that's the problem if the
module

941
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:54,810
doesn't start for 20 it's not going to
end up with you

942
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:58,090
so it's safe to exclude or to limit
searched smart

943
01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:01,710
it's never going to unless you're
searching back

944
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:06,820
research the way

945
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:09,820
so oh and by the way it search from

946
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:13,310
combinations so if you compare or if you
look at

947
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:16,560
the combination sources for forces the
ones I SOC

948
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:20,740
for NP fight attr it looks for more
combinations

949
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:25,250
short fine so that's when when I get

950
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:29,100
we can also show that the axis left what
if be

951
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:32,170
only one point the staten to be
writeable

952
01:01:32,170 --> 01:01:36,270
for example then you can just specify
minus X

953
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:42,600
W and its will search for Point like

954
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,650
for this dick this time fact fiction

955
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:49,230
I Iran three types of searches

956
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:52,990
against an application I just use the
high GS

957
01:01:52,990 --> 01:01:56,230
they a server the one that we use it was
filled

958
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:59,300
fucker so three title searchers I

959
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:03,060
did a quick search for jump ESP search
for

960
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:06,970
operetta and I get the full though Rob
search

961
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:10,550
so

962
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:13,560
Mona was ten times faster but the jump
sp

963
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:17,000
about seventeen times faster with opera

964
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:22,880
and about ten times faster drop so

965
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:27,440
that's nice

966
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,860
we also improved interaction I

967
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:35,060
again I i wrote he fight attr as I moved
forward as

968
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:38,920
as I was learning stuff but there was no
reader interaction between

969
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:43,890
functions one function you some results
but there was no way I could use those

970
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:44,940
results

971
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:49,730
French so we tidy read redesign that

972
01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:54,370
which leads to fostering better results

973
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:57,650
and since we like Metasploit

974
01:02:57,650 --> 01:03:00,730
there is much more we can do so let's
take a look

975
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:04,520
at the second them I will show you can
you suggest

976
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:08,190
so we will do said basically will do
exactly the same

977
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:11,790
that's what we did earlier we will see
the cyclic pattern

978
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:18,190
we will run suggests so

979
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:21,690
again we start the application

980
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:27,000
real time it's running

981
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,350
so we create pattern first be attached

982
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:34,910
the poker to the application well 401

983
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:39,600
okay run first we create a pattern

984
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:44,030
more now on let's check it's just an
example of the working for the parameter

985
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:45,090
so which

986
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:48,320
it will show that I've put it to see
locks percentage p

987
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:52,160
will be easier to find the results

988
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:56,300
betrayed a pattern but I'm grateful PC
just made an alias

989
01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:00,080
its growth into our folder thats open

990
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:03,370
open file see locks

991
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:07,340
name of the process and

992
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:11,240
copy departed bases again in our
proof-of-concept

993
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:14,900
it's the same file at the junk buffer
will send its

994
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:19,230
to ports 124 want

995
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:22,800
okay safe and run we should get

996
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:28,340
exactly the same X violation exactly

997
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:32,370
a clear the window and we have an
suggest

998
01:04:32,370 --> 01:04:35,770
last night we have a lot of information

999
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:40,330
now the loudest ease people exploits

1000
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:44,960
is six .7 seconds we now have

1001
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,090
something diff so not only

1002
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:51,460
doesn't exactly the same searchers of

1003
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:55,700
it will also show the lengths you've
seen lang so it shows you

1004
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:58,810
how many bites the cyclic pattern are
available

1005
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:04,730
and using that information if provides
you with the Metasploit

1006
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:07,770
skeleton that already includes the opera

1007
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:10,930
pointer it includes the offset it shows
you

1008
01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:14,060
exploits function for Metasploit

1009
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:17,420
and shows you how much bites you have
for your pillow

1010
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:20,960
so I couldn't

1011
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,470
think of a way to make it easier for you
guys this is purity when

1012
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:31,470
and it took what 6.7 seconds so

1013
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:35,840
yeah I didn't create the exploits mean
it would probably take longer to type it

1014
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:40,890
that action generates I I was lazy

1015
01:05:40,890 --> 01:05:45,350
four-inch I briefly went over to find
function

1016
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:51,030
he fight addr because it was not lot to
say about it

1017
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:55,250
we changed the law fine is no really a
powerful tool

1018
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:58,280
and what we did is

1019
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:01,460
first of all you can now specify the
type of

1020
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:05,830
information want to search for do you
want to search for straying

1021
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:09,470
for binary information for instructions

1022
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:13,910
so you can tell it what type to search
for

1023
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:18,460
but it now also has a point if 2.2
search

1024
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:21,840
and that is that it's really really nice
cuts

1025
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:25,580
much havin buffer overflow

1026
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:28,590
where you control location referenced by

1027
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:32,230
dcx and this is the Colts

1028
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:35,910
that fight you with colorful over yeah I
P

1029
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:41,770
so if you look you see Xcode yeah I

1030
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:45,530
missed here so this is the flow in
essence

1031
01:06:45,530 --> 01:06:49,400
in order to turn this to a jump to page:

1032
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:52,940
what we need is a pointer to a pointer
to jump

1033
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:56,560
dcx if you have to look for that
manually

1034
01:06:56,560 --> 01:06:59,890
good luck this is going to take a lot of
time

1035
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:03,280
so

1036
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,720
we can do this now with one simple
instruction I just limited

1037
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:10,190
to one PLL even and all the other elf

1038
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:13,380
takes with on the Italian takes like

1039
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:16,750
three or four seconds if you do a search
in all the

1040
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:19,890
the levels might take a few minutes

1041
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:24,510
it won't take dates so I think that's it
that's it future

1042
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:27,700
future

1043
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:31,150
some other goodies pp

1044
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:34,930
that well that function is going to
allow you to set a breakpoint

1045
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:38,750
on reading or writing and thats

1046
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:42,450
my command if you're working on sprays
to

1047
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:45,700
make sure that the buck stops assume

1048
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:49,430
something rights to 0 Caesar Caesars

1049
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:52,770
see for example you can said breakpoint
rights to that

1050
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:56,120
at this just stop doctor on

1051
01:07:56,120 --> 01:08:00,370
fall compare it's also a new feature

1052
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:04,670
imagine you're working on exploits with
a colleague

1053
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:07,830
he could beat the list pointers his
system

1054
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:10,930
you have a different system know you
want to compare

1055
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:13,970
yes output with your output and find the
matching

1056
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:17,089
pointers and cons use file compare

1057
01:08:17,089 --> 01:08:22,810
and it will just show you all the
matching

1058
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:27,320
finally we also it a

1059
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:30,339
full repeal of the rock pretty rock

1060
01:08:30,339 --> 01:08:33,960
rates low it was actriz really slow

1061
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:37,560
we gave more options so you have more
parameters that can tweak

1062
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,890
you can

1063
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:44,089
limit the distance look at the offset
ran

1064
01:08:44,089 --> 01:08:47,490
bill number of number of options I'd

1065
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:51,280
more options that we had in the previous
version

1066
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:54,650
you can now also to a separate spec

1067
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:58,089
its search with the previous version

1068
01:08:58,089 --> 01:09:02,350
really have to run the entire property
to get on that list

1069
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:05,920
if it's now you can just wrong
perspective search

1070
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:09,780
specified minimum max distance

1071
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:13,830
and thats really helpful because it

1072
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:19,049
speeds up your from as well

1073
01:09:19,049 --> 01:09:23,930
reading from memory the slow so what we
did

1074
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:28,580
you can also reach from farms if you
create a rock fall for

1075
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:32,759
some common the allowed paths: just put
them on your hard drive

1076
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:36,070
you can actually use them out and put to
create a property

1077
01:09:36,070 --> 01:09:40,500
so Coast fast

1078
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:43,640
let's look at the generation process for
ROP

1079
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:49,420
so it is a search in memory or false if
you specified false

1080
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:53,280
it will create gadgets so it will
basically look for all the ending

1081
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:57,640
you specified and then walks back for a
number of instructions and

1082
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:01,640
each series catch writes that into

1083
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:05,220
all txt

1084
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:08,410
strong that information it extracts

1085
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:11,420
three types of its great separate file

1086
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:15,500
back befits it creates a file
suggestions

1087
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,810
will look at it and the rock funk

1088
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:23,150
rock funk is going to look for reliable

1089
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:27,030
pointers to functions that can be helped

1090
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:30,280
at Camp use to bypass that

1091
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:33,330
for example social protect so it's going
to do that such

1092
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:37,420
automatically very sorry

1093
01:10:37,420 --> 01:10:40,890
so that means that if you take
information from suggestions

1094
01:10:40,890 --> 01:10:46,580
and for your exploit is just waiting to
be built

1095
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:50,430
is going to its only is a lot faster

1096
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:54,650
but if just limit your information to

1097
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:58,100
those two blocks it will allow you to
build your

1098
01:10:58,100 --> 01:11:03,700
exploit fast

1099
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:06,960
so that got us thinking

1100
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:11,050
wouldn't it be nice

1101
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:14,080
if there was something like this

1102
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:18,410
I can automatic rock build

1103
01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:22,130
so yes we we made it we build it

1104
01:11:22,130 --> 01:11:26,310
we can now fully automate rock export

1105
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:30,660
so of you we should do it

1106
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:34,670
with the knowledge and experience that
we haven't building rock exports we can

1107
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:39,460
search in memory for specific actions it
will be fast

1108
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:42,700
or we can duty classical property first

1109
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:45,730
build all the files it will be slower

1110
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:49,640
of we prefer quality because

1111
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:53,170
what if you don't find that specific act
you end up

1112
01:11:53,170 --> 01:11:56,270
with a little bit of of information

1113
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:59,820
nothing to work with so we prefer

1114
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:04,340
let's build all the gadgets first with
bill your rock followed your suggestion

1115
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:07,510
file and

1116
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:10,770
everything together and see if we can
ultimi

1117
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:16,320
property so going to do with them all
better Wireshark

1118
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:19,680
was actually in book that was reported a
while back to wash or

1119
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:24,220
it was fixed in version 1.4.5 I'm

1120
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:27,550
if the Dec normal text

1121
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:31,180
phones accident if the attacked packets

1122
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:34,800
you cross-posted on the local network
and

1123
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,020
you could basically taken an oath watch

1124
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:41,850
so if you have a washout listening on
the network

1125
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:48,850
this is what could happen so using this
single come home

1126
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:53,630
this this what we can do missus fist are
fully patched

1127
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:57,590
is Lauren able step enables all the
goodies

1128
01:12:57,590 --> 01:13:01,110
so let's look up I have to be honest

1129
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:04,700
cheated I cuts out

1130
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:08,790
bought of this video because it was
going to last for like

1131
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:12,110
almost five minutes I could out on

1132
01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:16,650
so let Scott Weishaar

1133
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:23,650
with attached Booker to it

1134
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:27,260
actually what I will do I would use

1135
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:30,930
and already existing export Metasploit

1136
01:13:30,930 --> 01:13:34,490
one that I added action exploit that I
wrote

1137
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:37,580
and I'm just going to rip out indirect
peace

1138
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:41,280
and see if we can use the piece that was
produced by

1139
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:44,560
so let's

1140
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:48,720
let's let mona work

1141
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:53,540
so Sony going to create those molecules
looks for all the ending

1142
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:58,710
and I was going to do stations that
takes a while

1143
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:02,690
if this green changes that's why I

1144
01:14:02,690 --> 01:14:08,230
without apart okay

1145
01:14:08,230 --> 01:14:11,640
alright so five minutes and 20 seconds
if you do the same

1146
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:16,100
fight addr it took two hours I think
there is already a

1147
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:19,400
levitoff speed improvement here

1148
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:25,320
let's look at what it use first falls
back but it's

1149
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:30,970
so it will show you all the pits and in
fact

1150
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:34,020
take a look at this one the first

1151
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:38,240
Kamal is just changes the value of ESP

1152
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:42,420
doesn't X or that doesn't do anything
that few pops

1153
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:45,900
so it's not just looking for at ESP

1154
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:49,500
with the rats but it actually looks at
Baker chain

1155
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:52,740
and it combines values instructions

1156
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:56,600
that don't break the if it's but allow
you to

1157
01:14:56,600 --> 01:15:01,320
go to sir like so you end up with more
if it's

1158
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,980
that should work all the time so that's
a that's also a

1159
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:08,410
a little improvement that we've

1160
01:15:08,410 --> 01:15:11,670
whips think I accidentally started the
game

1161
01:15:11,670 --> 01:15:18,670
so will again

1162
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:02,820
finished process

1163
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:08,830
seconds

1164
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:15,830
stay away from it this time

1165
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,460
so with its shows you the decimal
distance that you can jump

1166
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:25,890
you can actually specified minimum and
maximum size

1167
01:16:25,890 --> 01:16:29,290
know exactly how far you want to jump it
will only show you

1168
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:32,420
one step to that haitian suggestions

1169
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:36,590
its categorizes certain gadgets

1170
01:16:36,590 --> 01:16:39,800
and its Asian like readable name so

1171
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:45,050
if you want to move EDI to assert
registry can just search for it guy

1172
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:48,270
arrow ya too much and it will show you
all the catch the computer

1173
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:51,580
and then finally

1174
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:55,040
it will create or attempts to create

1175
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,620
when star in the movie sewer lines it
will fully

1176
01:16:58,620 --> 01:17:02,220
create a role bail

1177
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:08,120
so we'll just copy go to

1178
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:11,800
backtrack box has Metasploit install

1179
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:15,010
and I'll just at the model that was
added

1180
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:19,190
so this is

1181
01:17:19,190 --> 01:17:22,970
the chain that was present

1182
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:26,320
in the molecule go to strip it out based
in

1183
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:30,480
what mona created actually the one that
was in the mobile

1184
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:33,500
I created my newly before I wrote

1185
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:37,860
routine this routine what mona created
is like

1186
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:42,450
7 the works shorter who it's even better
than what I did monthly

1187
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:47,440
so we just close

1188
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:50,760
editor safe to follow the other

1189
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:55,330
and we kick off Metasploit

1190
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:58,670
in the meantime will just close
everything

1191
01:17:58,670 --> 01:18:02,050
and will just

1192
01:18:02,050 --> 01:18:05,420
Wireshark on the network

1193
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:09,040
just effort this yet face

1194
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:13,450
just sits there in the meantime

1195
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:16,700
it 30 that's the white shark exploits I

1196
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:20,880
use the me to preach to figure out so
it's just going to do

1197
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,300
the first be connection 2010 11

1198
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:28,920
is my Linux box exploit

1199
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:32,920
ok so

1200
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:36,180
we

1201
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:39,840
automatically created a full-blown Rob
exploits

1202
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,690
yeah because launch calculator since

1203
01:18:43,690 --> 01:18:47,010
my wife happens like acculturated screen
so

1204
01:18:47,010 --> 01:18:54,010
got conclusions

1205
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:01,060
BV fight a Dr is that long as Mona

1206
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:05,350
still be some work you need to do to
clean up some coats

1207
01:19:05,350 --> 01:19:09,080
some small bugfixes need to build in
update mechanism

1208
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:12,080
finish documentation expected to release

1209
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:16,210
is in two weeks so in about two weeks if
you follow me on twitter

1210
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:19,290
or if you just keep an eye on the corner
and I'll be your website

1211

it will be available for you guys to

1212
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:24,430
