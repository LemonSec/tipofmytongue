1
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:08,629
through hello everyone

2
00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:11,589
and that uh... presentation

3
00:00:11,589 --> 00:00:16,269
referring to see all wearing relatively
new too

4
00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:17,590
quota and kruk

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,349
belonging to be a mock toolset

6
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:23,099
how we can use this to too

7
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:24,270
with the

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,859
foster worked strength of

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,310
burberry systems

10
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,589
and first of all i'm uh...

11
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:33,050
i go by the nickname a finger

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,860
and um... i really miss fiscal
transitions

13
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,830
on the main do you know for the sites of
growth of torque

14
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:44,970
some highlights of my research

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,570
and i'm mainly interested janet network
security

16
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:54,680
uh... some of my past work force are
exploiting curtis the

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,160
protocol

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,310
tearing the work that was published in
the truck uh... sixty six

19
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,600
it was uh... what the tradition of uh...

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,170
and the gulf functionality of focus
should be the pic

21
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,460
precious time there

22
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,330
inert there are two conduct uh...

23
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,750
and our experience in a repair the
amount of service a pack

24
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,940
aunt uh... another work was uh...

25
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:21,009
uh... extradition of uh... nixon p p

26
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:24,080
which is a protocol that uh... you make
of usta

27
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,930
indirectly because it's the bop and for
uh...

28
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:28,999
uh...

29
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:33,409
face book started local talk and it's
also used us and open source from

30
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:34,420
thirtieth

31
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,720
for uh...

32
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,530
msn

33
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,060
and um... this work where i was also
present at uh... last year she ran off

34
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,520
to come

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,980
and of course i'm also hello suburban
myself in whole with uh...

36
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,490
animal development

37
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,700
and and crook

38
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,190
which i wrote both uh... two years ago

39
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,680
and democrat belongs to the unlocked
toolset

40
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,180
and visit with uh...

41
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,710
with which you can uh...

42
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,370
contact me

43
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:10,009
uh... before i go on i would like to ask
you

44
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:14,799
expect to see a lot of hans here because
i know that uh... hero uh... intersted

45
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:15,809
in security

46
00:02:15,809 --> 00:02:20,559
and how many of you have used uh...
landmark

47
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:21,779
kicked in

48
00:02:21,779 --> 00:02:23,619
and uh...

49
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:28,519
how many of you have these used some
other tools of the amato sets like uh...

50
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:30,579
and pink and cut

51
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:32,739
uh... b_m_i_ scripting and c

52
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:35,449
or even some up

53
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:36,090
piercing

54
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,079
cure comes here

55
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,529
that's to be expected

56
00:02:39,529 --> 00:02:43,829
because many people still think that
uh... time up is just uh...

57
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:45,459
the parts coming too

58
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:49,399
well um... like in concert was in the
first version that was spotless bucking

59
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:51,019
that truck fifty-one

60
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:54,229
but uh... that's not the truth anymore

61
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:57,040
because uh...

62
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,919
because it will simply lamotte's uh...
larger project

63
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:01,760
anta

64
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,139
this involves some truck

65
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:05,379
which i'm going to describe uh...

66
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:08,379
now this presentation

67
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:11,209
now how it all started

68
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:15,249
uh... back in november uh... two
thousand and date

69
00:03:15,249 --> 00:03:20,579
i was talking to lots of quote uh...
khaled inspection and turtle doting

70
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:24,989
that book that is considered the bible
for lisa field

71
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:28,519
is uh... the art of so for security
assessment

72
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:33,339
which is uh... has been written by a
security peru's uh... some of the limo

73
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:35,709
to mark told insistence ruth

74
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:39,809
and uh... there was its author of their
that specified

75
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:42,009
and in networking

76
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:46,469
uh... debate lists of basic rules that
the whole uh...

77
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:50,799
low-level networking tools buttresses
pockets from the network

78
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,519
as for the baby

79
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:58,819
this is uh... rules how to do with uh...
mostly with uh... length one dictation

80
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:00,509
so

81
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:01,759
uh...

82
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,390
all tools like for example snort or
uh... and mopped

83
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:10,140
but uh... receive buckets free from
therein network without any karen miller

84
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,529
intervention

85
00:04:11,529 --> 00:04:16,639
f using comps and the pickup and uh...
or using growth circuits

86
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,289
uh... tough to do some basic care
validation in their own because the

87
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:22,960
colonel doesn't do that

88
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,309
and since we're talking about uh...
direct access to the buckets

89
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:32,869
so landlocked sense uh... some pockets
to do its essence common coro is

90
00:04:32,869 --> 00:04:34,069
defection

91
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:37,310
and uh... other functionalities

92
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,830
and uh...

93
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:43,199
there was some uh... politician or
things of that uh...

94
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,449
protect if uh...

95
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:49,919
v_i_p_ does that number was uh... one of
the past for us the length uh...

96
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,289
is concerned

97
00:04:51,289 --> 00:04:55,019
so i went to meet up like those basic
rules

98
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:57,310
inclusive of these markings

99
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,600
and uh... what i saw was but uh...

100
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,479
you can see here

101
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,520
that but uh... dat da da drum length

102
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,499
was uh...

103
00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:11,919
was spoke abt

104
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,599
initially sixty eight p dot o gram
length which is the length of the polo

105
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:16,380
um...

106
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,969
i could bike its meaning

107
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:20,960
the length of the eyepiece heather at
the length of the disc because there and

108
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,110
the length of the

109
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,800
they don't

110
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,259
but uh...

111
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,370
when it got this pocket from uh... you
pick up into the coupled with success

112
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,339
the truth about to be

113
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:35,039
that they're really love value of this
of the data size

114
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,979
uh... delegated the buffer

115
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:43,909
for these for the pockets but then
continued on and uh... did go there

116
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:49,199
the rest of the techs using because the
the field india could shed their maybe

117
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,990
she is there also has a

118
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,129
the field but

119
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:55,729
uh... specifies that i could get brother
from length

120
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:57,099
but of course

121
00:05:57,099 --> 00:05:59,930
nobody tells us that this is a

122
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,550
specific iffy hasn't been an adult

123
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:10,189
uh... which means that these may be
corrupted dora even purposely crafted

124
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:13,969
so what they did was uh... crossed my
own pockets

125
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:15,969
since the

126
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:17,469
uh... this field

127
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:23,509
and uh... material data was were less
incised avant there

128
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:27,789
than the ones that uh... this is uh... i
think that uh... specified

129
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:31,139
so that's called as a result but uh...

130
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:32,790
that there was an

131
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,129
and other bonds memory access and all
that they're sick

132
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,629
uh... consequences which serve that
implies

133
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:42,460
but the funny thing about this was about
uh...

134
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,529
in order to be able to cross the spa kit

135
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:48,419
uh... i i had to do some things and then
the next arnold

136
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:49,709
because

137
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,099
the lecture now

138
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:56,369
when he is ross took its inner tubes
crossed your own pockets easily allows

139
00:06:56,369 --> 00:07:01,929
you to crafts uh... and specified every
field

140
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:03,229
this particular

141
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:07,029
fields and only basis but uh... you can
see

142
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:08,689
investors put uh...

143
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:10,329
in the left

144
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,989
uh... was always uh...

145
00:07:12,989 --> 00:07:15,300
and filled in by the colonel

146
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,529
rooftops to prevent this kind of uh...
views

147
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:23,459
but uh... of course this country stop us
because anything but will have to do is

148
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:25,970
uh... thus comment out the lineup

149
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,250
as you can see there

150
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,309
and uh...

151
00:07:29,309 --> 00:07:32,089
and then the recompile the kernel

152
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:37,240
because it's uh... everything is eh...
don

153
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,689
in the meantime the freebsd care no

154
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:40,889
it does

155
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:46,210
the same thinking another minor it
detects if uh... visit by using the i

156
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,569
think that the other grumblings are
uh...

157
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:50,530
upon it

158
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:54,199
ants the chick often testified that some

159
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,069
that folks are values

160
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:58,569
and uh... if it finds an error

161
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:02,779
it's just uh... returns to uh... anti
never lets the bucket outs to the

162
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:04,309
network

163
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:06,210
uh... of course we come

164
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:10,210
always do the same just uh... comment
out this line stricken by the for this

165

barrel to bug reports

171
00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:28,029
and to bugfix for that it's uh...

172
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:33,860
that particular bach

after while in spring fair two thousand
and i and i applied for a google summer

174
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,339
of code

175
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:43,760
and for all of the those uh... if we
don't know what's what these

the whole project the whole uh... on

188
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,970
program lasts a three to four months

189

bonding period in it which is used on
fri do any harm to coral clothing but

191
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:32,870
you get to upgrade yourself a with the
quote

192
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,210
the community began the project and the
mentors

193
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,790
which guide you through the process

194
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,820
uh... they're up

195
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,170
at one thousand two students every year
about that uh...

196
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,400
uh... number and to the of course you
get paid for lease

197
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,030
now the uh... thus defense of uh...
going up to

198
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,300
fife up thousand dollars

199
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,580
but you get these uh... after he passed
uh... to a different divided nation

200
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,250
uh...

201
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,410
uh... evaluations

202
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,490
at which are done by their mentoring
organization and the mentor

203
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,680
uh... of gross you have to

204
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,309
in order to upset you you've got to make
a

205
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:15,640
echoed the petition form at your studio
forceful always uh... martyrs

206
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,329
and if you have a suitcase of uh...

207
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:23,439
research or aren't either contribution
to to the projects like bark reports

208
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:25,840
bugfixes or even go to writing

209
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,490
uh... these are on positive first
partnership interactive commute

210
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,750
and of course

211
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,570
quiver and

212
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:36,600
uh... decides to participate in expert
left to right a lot of court

213
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,510
uh... for example encrypt is uh... no
where almost uh...

214
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:45,060
twenty six thousand lines gold

215
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,230
and uh...

216
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,410
when they applied for our own

217
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,140
google summer of uh... quote

218
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,380
for the animal project and uh... after
the accepted me

219
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,650
that there was

220
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:58,450
there was nowhere the ideal from croat
usually every

221
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,020
an organization

222
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,319
age is is uh...

223
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:06,610
mister clinton i would date suites uh...
plus a political v eight years of the

224
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:11,880
off the potential book projects for the
upcoming customer of code and said

225
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,839
you've got time there was a lot of
interest for uh...

226
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:18,530
extending and cut and kept is uh...

227
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,610
fit and modernize implementation of met
cups

228
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,450
which is the venerable

229
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,500
uh... to state the swiss army knife

230
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,610
which you must also be used

231
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,400
and uh...

232
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,090
belongs of course to the and not to
insult

233
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:36,750
and said there was also some ideas about
uh... extending ca the support for our

234
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,220
own circuits in i could be six

235
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,770
which is uh... relatively three depart

236
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,520
and uh...

237
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,290
if i might for number correctly there at
the students working on this uh...

238
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,220
protect the summer

239
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,670
so i applied for these uh...

240
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,920
two ideas

241
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,420
but uh... off their y

242
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,690
i got uh... and uh... they mainly from
fielder of course there is no author of

243
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,080
uh... and mup

244
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,360
and uh...

245
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,550
she told me

246
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,550
that um... you know

247
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:09,230
and still make don't uh... uh...

248
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,950
used to think that sister were comment
that we've got some bigger plans

249
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,650
and uh...

250
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,090
she told me that uh... after covering
rate than that and soak which is a

251
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:22,580
library for acid obstruction here that
uh... and abuses

252
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,980
that uh... douglas almost ten years ago

253
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:32,480
she was climbing to right uh... flexible
length uh... bird fossil syndication

254
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,940
cracking too

255
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,790
uh... golden park chug even registered
the domain and crook the door but she

256
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,650
never took the time to do it

257
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,300
so she told me

258
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,450
and what did you do it with them he
started from scratch now

259
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:52,250
and psa of course they agreed without
further ado and uh...

260
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:56,770
was an email but she sent to an mozdev
which is the main uh... mailing jst four

261
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,670
a m of development

262
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,260
seasons

263
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,360
the initial aritzia men croat anderson
creek was born

264
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,570
the artists it was

265
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:11,750
uh... mentioned that's analog guidelines
and specifications on wit's end abruptly

266
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,550
i would be built

267
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,020
and uh... as you can share the means to
me but is that uh...

268
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,850
it of course was to be very fast and
flexible

269
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,570
it'll still support both the basic uh...
network protocols

270
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,440
uh... elected two seats uh... h_t_t_p_
it's at their office

271
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,170
and uh...

272
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:33,460
it must even uh... before served on the
its competitors

273
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:39,600
it said also has to deliver us every
functionality upon our protocol stew

274
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,649
improve its feet for example

275
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:46,399
in h_t_t_p_ took us to use uh... needs
to be one point one actually

276
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,200
because the use of persistent
connections and by planning europe to do

277
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,769
many more uh...

278
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:55,650
authentication attempts for a connection

279
00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:00,970
antha it said would need to be returning
masses bluff blasting this

280
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,080
mixed motive that uh... and mop is also

281
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,029
implemented

282
00:14:05,029 --> 00:14:07,170
it's mainly morrissey

283
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,489
concacaf us it was personal

284
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:12,340
is only used for um... class
organization

285
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,690
and the stumper templates library

286
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,490
which is uh...

287
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:20,570
mainly for us takes like uh... victor
sneezed sent uh...

288
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:24,070
similar stuff

289
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,490
when they wandered

290
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,870
why did we decide to write uh...

291
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:32,250
annual net oracle syndication crichton
to when there are a already others

292
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,720
well one of the basic reasons is that
uh...

293
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,980
nowadays

294
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,520
week sponsors

295
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,700
passwords are more problems on that

296
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,670
exploits

297
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:46,010
people still use very password select
their names from companies that was

298
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,880
uh...

299
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,150
their arm

300
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:53,310
birthdate or there and name of their
spouse or a pet or whatever

301
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,440
and uh...

302
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,380
the other thing is that

303
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,160
brea syndication exploits

304
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,020
for major of services like a party or
open the seats the

305
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,579
are are very rare these days

306
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:06,960
especially in the white hot communities

307
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,290
and this is because

308
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:13,960
in order to full finds it and uh... at
bargain exploited

309
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,509
that there are now this many product if
uh... defensive measures

310
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:22,780
like uh... outerspace layout
randomization privileged information

311
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:27,410
as stock ameriprise which makes uh...
explode writing very hard

312
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,220
and uh... innovation visa and major
servers

313
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,309
alike at all but two states

314
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:36,080
popcorn and reverse inspection

315
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,930
saying their quote through many years
affairs but i've been following but

316
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,000
uh...

317
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,670
and nowadays it's much more difficult

318
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,840
innovation

319
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,470
uh... indiana mob scripting engine which
is uh... framework

320
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,279
and

321
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,260
wits and not be used as in order to

322
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,900
edited to do some network scripting

323
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,170
and for them to our language

324
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,950
and it has been following statistically
about that route for scripps uh... the

325
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,410
most popular

326
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:10,610
and to and other uh... positive
indication was uh...

327
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:15,320
in the site too sick to ease the torque
one of uh... fielders popular sites

328
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,779

popular art

329
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:22,780
security tubes possible to play their
security community of course

330
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,580
they are all lower the top

331
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,390
f_-fifteen security tools

332
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,650
are uh... uh...

333
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,939
have to do with bright pink

334
00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:31,530
either a remote or local

335
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,170
and uh...

336
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,640
now for the competitors

337
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,400
uh... of course

338
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,770
many of the competitors are are not very
actively maintained and to some are way

339
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,900
too old and barking

340
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,489
uh... for example

341
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:50,889
brutus is out of the questions is sway
told his grinder is uh...

342
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:51,660
broken

343
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,880
and many of them have uh... probability
problems

344
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,759
for example

345
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,580
uh... hydro pizza tiger require
assistance win

346
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,020
we're going to santa medusa

347
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,830
that the other famous uh... recruiting
tool

348
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,380
uh... doesn't it

349
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,830
dozens really

350
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,850
uh...

351
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,840
work on uh... when disciple

352
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,160
and uh... there are also other
imitations

353
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,770
like for example

354
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,300
uh... you come to redo enemy
customization

355
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,470
as you come to redo any

356
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,100
at times fine-grained inc

357
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,620
or ah... ah...

358
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,659
uh...

359
00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:29,350
or similar stuff

360
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:34,770
there've there are very primitive
options afar us uh... this is concerned

361
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,760
now allows for the eats i dropped

362
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,509
uh...

363
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:43,530
disguised there might have been um...
saken under or rattled a bit

364
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:47,900
because their member of a tha last year
when they was in ninety two conference

365
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,040
of

366
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,610
pickled beets neutral in germany

367
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:54,880
i'm it's their original store if i'm
hauser of

368
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,910
truck gates hydro

369
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,030
and uh...

370
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,149
she told me

371
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:04,580
and we've got some discussions about
uh... katie by drug to and crap

372
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,910
and i remember about uh... after about
uh... two weeks or so

373
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:13,440
uh... there was a new release of uh...
hydra

374
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,300
that the previous release was uh... a
long time ago

375
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:22,590
i don't know if this is uh...
coincidence remarked about anyway

376
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:29,590
we have to wait for the

377
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:36,900
the next thing feared the completed
discuss about is the to picture of

378
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,740
fabric

379
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,649
uh... and refuses to and what's in our
architecture

380
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:44,810
which means that uh...

381
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:48,039
it's the best way to design such a cool
because

382
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:50,530
the you want the modules to be

383
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:55,330
as independence from the coroner's must
possible in order to be easy to write a

384
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,810
more motions and uh... extent and
parties in the

385
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,400
the countdown

386
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,670
and

387
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:08,370
and it's mosel corresponds to a certain
men that were probable

388
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,030
the

389
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,850
city working

390
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:19,840
the quarantine is responsible for uh...
all of the network related stuff

391
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,190
it uh...

392
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:26,100
it does all this look at alterations
through encik which said

393
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,000
about two weeks

394
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,070
when koko uh... later

395
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:33,080
and uh... into four schools in the
protocol morsels

396
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,680
when it needs to

397
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,760
uh...

398
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,630
and as we said he later it's one of its
a stronger of

399
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,450
features

400
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,960
is that time

401
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,950
is the dynamic of the patient of network
when the shins

402
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,250
uh... which is

403
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,890
makes it said

404
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,289
dynamically adopted

405
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,850
uh... it's timing

406
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,380
we'll see how this works later

407
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,690
no this is an example of call them once
and for

408
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:03,820
and soak which is the main uh... library
for us at the corporations

409
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:07,990
it's also using them on buses they said
that for

410
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:12,239
uh... and sensibly it's in library is
that uh... behind the scene

411
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:16,090
uh... it it uses the selective system
called

412
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,200
select for of does you call

413
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,539
when a little bit about uh... circuits
programming

414
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:24,559
and that works for the programming

415
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,590
a sista function but uh... nukes

416
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,979
overall will be open file descriptors

417
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,990
and uh... waits for defense department

418
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:36,540
so for example if you have received
hurry to request

419
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,389
uh...

420
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:40,679
and expect to receive at the different
the network

421
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,330
uh... then when select says he's got the
colonel

422
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,620
notified its

423
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:49,240
through this is an open fun descriptor
of that that they don't have arrived it

424
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,789
weird in return and uh...

425
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:54,030
uh... tell us that uh...

426
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,070
uh... this happened so we can be

427
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:01,560
ready to move on and uh... process this
uh... this data

428
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,520
so what uh... and park does is uh...
it's mortal

429
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,250
consist of uh...

430
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:12,710
shoot those states must sing it's a very
slow state must seem essentially

431
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,899
so it breaks up with the

432
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:19,100
uh... the connection into several uh...
smaller parts

433
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,260
each of them go response to uh...
primitive uh... circuit the parisian

434
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,020
like uh... every two requests or a right
to request

435
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,940
so

436
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,500
and it's an example let's say that week
of the estate's mortal and uh... who

437
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,000
want to do an authentication up and

438
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,550
the first thing is to listen to repair
request afterward of connected of course

439
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,440
the st server

440
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,000
and uh...

441
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,730
and brought the bond their if there is
one there isn't the only thing now

442
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,669
estates depends on that

443
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:50,010
configuration

444
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:52,050
so when we talk about

445
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:57,580
we expect to week for the mortal pieces
the average request duranso

446
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,970
registers they're called back on their

447
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:03,380
and then a returns control buckland kruk

448
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,810
to the core ensign

449
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:09,460
and uh... ifn the and the quarantine if
i'm kruk

450
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,700
looks troops

451
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,760
that the other events that uh... what
intially other mortals of uh... issued

452
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,190
their request about

453
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,049
and

454
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:20,490
does other maintenance operations

455
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,630
at six is there a new quote connections
to open

456
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:26,320
and uh... when there is uh...

457
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,880
when and soak

458
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,130
and notifies its but there's a new
defense attorneys calls dot camacho and

459
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:36,940
this morton's then contusion nearest to
the next state of course it was safe

460
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,179
before the state so that it knows that

461
00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:44,540
this particular more charming stance was
upstaged zero at first and then goes on

462
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:48,809
state that one and so on and then that
will continue make these hit

463
00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:53,419
then in that state walton between uh...
israel a right to request and in-depth

464
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:58,270
and since the first uh... message
pockets and so on and as we go on m_t_v_

465
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,000
and

466
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,190
and the companies of course

467
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,210
in parallel

468
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:06,409
without meeting pia more than one
process you have one process

469
00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:11,220
and difference over your cold air
parliament station

470
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:16,040
now the problem with uh... and soak not
exactly a problem

471
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:21,340
but uh... it's a think it's a fact that
we confuse uh... ross focus of the sock

472
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,880
role capability

473
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,210
in order to crossed our own pockets

474
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,450
and this means

475
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:29,340
that we've gone three use our own dining
congressmen

476
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,720
but i mean congress claiming

477
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,669
uh... to know when they're

478
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:35,080
dissented

479
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,790
more pockets when to open it more
connections

480
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,340
and and soak

481
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:42,509
uh... it's it's upholstery on poeple
focus should be

482
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:47,270
so the two people so that there to work
of uh... timing

483
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:52,940
pizza different from for example the way
that seem at post com inka

484
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,530
in animal works where it's just

485
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,559
crossed the thing pockets

486
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:59,630
sends among the network and then

487
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,929
they just think it's a long time in
congress

488
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:03,690
dot to resemble the

489
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:06,200
is the traffic congestion avoidance
holograms

490
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,640
butting their uh...

491
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,240
in their own way

492
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,390
and uh...

493
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,389
it does not uh... without uh... any

494
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:17,840
intervention from defeat self

495
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,610
but this is due to the soccer all power

496
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,899
so now that we thought that we are on
top of

497
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:25,150
for this is being

498
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:28,140
week off to a reliability thing but we
can do

499
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,590
is uh... rely on the expiry sets

500
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,520
that connection time outs

501
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,130
and some thinks is uh... some picnics
bit based on uh... statistics as we see

502
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:40,630
you later

503
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,500
well it's an example

504
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,350
uh... suppose

505
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:49,480
we'll plan that up first bankrupt opens
so many barman probes

506
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,690
of course

507
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:53,190
asta usually up to a point

508
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,419
us maintain

509
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:55,740
uh...

510
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,650
connections you pop that

511
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,100
dan

512
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,630
the more connections you cough

513
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:04,030
then bigger they'll syndication ratings

514
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:08,240
because you're all you of course dual
distinction parlam

515
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,399
and uh...

516
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:11,070
cheering this is the picture

517
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,100
the white there the arrow is

518
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,149
there

519
00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:16,860
the more the network traffic is

520
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,039
so initially this coffins

521
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,799
we everything is normal

522
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:25,290
we'll put even more uh... connections
because we want to increase bills and

523
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:29,080
jason rate and of course they target
replies with

524
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,300
and many more uh... replies

525
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,299
bouts afterlife

526
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:35,330
we

527
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,050
might see that ah...

528
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,020
the normally replies

529
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,110
also have uh... on are complemented by a
resets

530
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,250
so something is up straight year

531
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,680
the net that target that was me

532
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,550
come to really

533
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:55,880
amhala so many connections so it starts
responding with her sets

534
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:01,380
then when we whenever proxies dot it
immediately decreases the the monks in

535
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,230
power and connections

536
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,170
you can see it's your

537
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:09,240
in uh... complacent with these which was
the previous life

538
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,500
but uh... ofcourse resets will air keep
increasing at the time

539
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,460
and quickly then bills and keep
decreasing the monks and probes

540
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,010
and uh... snow leader sets will area

541
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,610
it demeans but this hero

542
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,669
and when this keeps happening

543
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:26,759
at some

544
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:30,330
point in time the system will be
balanced once again

545
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,930
and to the everything will go on

546
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,460
uh... are saying to me

547
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,410
but uh...

548
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,570
and of course

549
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:40,130
we don't start increasing the probes
again

550
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,680
and this is more of a trial and error
game

551
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:49,670
we gumtree peace through one man there's
that's when the starts up here and again

552
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:56,670
there will be some kinda fluctuation

553
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,659
cheer you can see a graph of the um...
of the bruce example

554
00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:03,299
i think the

555
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:08,390
as the upper function uh... isn't uh...
burgos and by the way at

556
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,849
that function be obedient apart

557
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:12,890
uh... i would be a recess

558
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,360
well the upper part

559
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,190
which is uh...

560
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,090
a brawl and uh... collar

561
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,660
are the endicott probst which are

562
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,450
uh... many more

563
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,210
dont be our cities

564
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,659
but uh...

565
00:27:25,659 --> 00:27:27,560
you can see the

566
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:32,500
indeed be your part but there is uh...
mister dunne uh... some certain time

567
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,230
windows

568
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,530
where the

569
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,730
the function e zero

570
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:42,020
is that time periods this time intervals
correspond to the

571
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,470
to the time where the system is about a
lens

572
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:48,710
and uh... of course the questioning all
of this is uh...

573
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,549
what did we take that the main via u

574
00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:53,580
for v

575
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,750
of all the samples of the

576
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,009
bungalow connections but with helpful
punt

577
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,330
in order to

578
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,919
to achieve the ideal parliament off of
the open connection

579
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,910
and it wasn't a big way this isn't
houses doesn't this songs

580
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:09,940
of course

581
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,740
with a whole

582
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:15,100
we probably talked about uh... resets
now what about the time all its

583
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:19,310
the time also learn much more difficult
problem and this is for him

584
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,420
many reasons

585
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,799
one of them is that uh... oh

586
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,070
we don't read the story for there is a
network failure

587
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,299
in a intermediary note

588
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:30,859
internet worked off but on that

589
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:32,710
uh... are

590
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,489
our cost and the target and the
comparable to

591
00:28:35,489 --> 00:28:39,379
this might hop and not random intervals
and it's quite ben-ami quicken ever be

592
00:28:39,379 --> 00:28:41,490
through about this

593
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,960
and we can never this who want the

594
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,110
the pockets will start going rerouted
for another bold

595
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:51,730
and source to bring buck the connection

596
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,460
and now they're um... reason might be

597
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,740
but without regarded firewall

598
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,059
and purposes or

599
00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:01,490
also very classic nowadays where
firewalls

600
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:05,570
might impose a certainly meet on the
number of connections but we have uh...

601
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:06,380
and

602
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,850
but a couple points

603
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:10,139
inside the start time at time window

604
00:29:10,139 --> 00:29:13,100
and if we start processing to meet them

605
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,610
the far well we'll just block alright
the address

606
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:20,700
for for defenders or even a forever

607
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,399
until michael integration

608
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:25,140
and uh...

609
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:30,970
of course of the by march month might
also be combined with respect to

610
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,820
makes it even more complex

611
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,810
ants there's a also find the lower
reason but uh... uh... infiltrate

612
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,700
frequent

613
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,320
welcome complex dental equals the denial
of service the park

614
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,950
and to the severance usually when that
we hope and too many connections

615
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,170
and their there are ending up the
resources

616
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,180
on the host

617
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,870
on discount started

618
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,420
though in reality

619
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,059
uh... are metric is not the amount of
uh...

620
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:02,780
they received or by malts but for the of
the peace and rates

621
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,169
this additional rate is an internal
metric

622
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:09,090
but just collins khomeini often
additional bands for a connection

623
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:13,919
for the purple nick super a certain time
period for service

624
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,280
and we have to leave

625
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:21,519
and a higher this is the the fastest the
foster we are

626
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,890
of course it disconnected to leader
resets and be dime onto the we get

627
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:26,440
because

628
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,289
of course if there are timeouts and
three sets

629
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:33,039
main spokesmen connections are closed
and us the authentication marine parade

630
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,220
is uh...

631
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,170
have been met decreased

632
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,330
and uh...

633
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:42,280
one of the three distances to use a
trial and error approach

634
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,419
and tsa

635
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:44,600
will seek hope

636
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,220
we can do that

637
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,900
serpro post i mean congress that sits on
top of the c_p_i_ i said before is the

638
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:51,850
following

639
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,090
there is an experimentation face
initially

640
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,480
in which we do the following things

641
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,230
vs

642
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,649
would keep increasing the parlor probes

643
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:03,289
we said before the reason why we do this
and

644
00:31:03,289 --> 00:31:05,719
it's to increase bills in addition rate
because

645
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:07,070
week of uh...

646
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,669
many got open that connection borrowed

647
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:12,000
and uh... this increases the

648
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,789
the rates

649
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:16,729
and said that we take for the three
falling thinks

650
00:31:16,729 --> 00:31:18,810
if the think this and rate drops

651
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,149
and tsa

652
00:31:20,149 --> 00:31:23,200
this means that something has gone
astray

653
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,659
if there is an error

654
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:29,750
end so we have received and uh... every
set of our air connection timeout

655
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:33,780
and if there is uh... if this indication
a repeat stays the same for a long time

656
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,910
period

657
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,809
uh... if this is this the same been
business dot

658
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:39,400
we're gonna really increases

659
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,340
the um...

660
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,920
increasing the connections anymore we
don't have a direct effect on the

661
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,340
estimation rate

662
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,940
so we don't want to waste any more
bandwidth

663
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,220
who want to save our our resources

664
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:54,530
and if any of these uh... reasons all p

665
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:57,480
if this is a of this case is that happen

666
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,890
then we immediately dropped uh... their
limits

667
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:04,080
of uh... off the parlor probes

668
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,970
and of course

669
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:07,559
we need to do this uh... a lot of times

670
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,649
would go to him but the number one

671
00:32:09,649 --> 00:32:10,570
step one

672
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:14,570
on the look of uh... gather then not do
it quits sa mpl

673
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:19,270
this something that will essentially be
as some bearish consisting of uh...

674
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,220
and an authentication rates

675
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:26,549
a corresponding to a certain a number of
open connections

676
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:31,350
but uh... the question still remains how
do we know but uh... recovery it's still

677
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,380
the ideal party isn't

678
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:37,320
at the on some form of strong today is
that we don't really know with than ever

679
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,510
before

680
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:42,460
and to the this resembles uh...

681
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,340
at that

682
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:47,690
problem in most markets in complex
problems where you don't really know

683
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:51,220
if there is a local marxism or a global
marketing

684
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,000
twenty year it's uh... and mark and you
can really be sort this is the

685
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,119
the biggest one

686
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:57,710
the largest

687
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,790
this is also the case here

688
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:05,220
what we need to do is is just relying on
that other sample so that we

689
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,059
previously described

690
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:08,460
and uh... then

691
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,330
rely on trial and error was

692
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,530
and

693
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:17,090
of course we're always in search of the
golden ratio of the golden ratio

694
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,669
buchanan's hideki receipient uh...

695
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:20,990
bond with saving

696
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:25,550
we want uh... speed for obvious reasons
we want to be a false disposable

697
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,980
and uh... i would put the two rusting

698
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,330
accuracy

699
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:33,700
as far as this is concerned p_c_p_ does
a most of the dirty work

700
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:37,220
we don't uh... user assorted so we've
done to me too

701
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:42,680
that make any error taking gora just
uh... see fit market is lost and re-send

702
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,379
it this does ruled out

703
00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:46,000
but we would like your a c

704
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,270
on tomorrow's the

705
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:52,900
but the authentication attempts are
concerned what that was blaming by this

706
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,710
and end up so when ever u hav

707
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:59,090
you have to test the spare time mac
credentialed bear as username and

708
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,919
password

709
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:02,190
you've got sick

710
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:05,779
you think that suppose the connection
dances make their

711
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:07,789
without talking to actually

712
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:09,310
that them

713
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:12,809
but youhave initiated the u_s_
indication

714
00:34:12,809 --> 00:34:16,540
for example in essence agee costs and
the first uh... pockets

715
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:20,919
we'd say indicates that the system the
nick of received some other pocket from

716
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:25,139
the state of the boston harbor that
really tested stages and then the

717
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:25,980
password

718
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,839
and to the connection for some reason
drops and this is very frequently gum

719
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:34,149
that's not meant that the main many
times in the past

720
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:36,530
and uh... even if they sound simple

721
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:38,249
with tough to of course

722
00:34:38,249 --> 00:34:39,499
uh...

723
00:34:39,499 --> 00:34:42,209
retested the whole thing so

724
00:34:42,209 --> 00:34:45,959
save is their credentials and request
them and then you connection

725
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:51,059
and uh... at even if this is uh... very
simple and uh... sounds quite obvious to

726
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:52,099
do

727
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:55,549
and most of the other competitors at
other uh... network doesn't use

728
00:34:55,549 --> 00:34:56,530
incorrect tools

729
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:01,759
bummbly spot all so if a connection
uh... terminates meet there

730
00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:06,369
without having tested that the this for
time magazine them imposter dot where to

731
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:07,299
be tested

732
00:35:07,299 --> 00:35:13,089
in this connection they've just been or
eat and to use this uh... the sparrow

733
00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:17,220
and never tested never get to tested
which is of course uh...

734
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:20,849
and lost a great loss inoculation

735
00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:22,100
and uh...

736
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,098
of course we don't also

737
00:35:24,099 --> 00:35:29,149
we don't also want to speak to wages
their more bond which is on his psa

738
00:35:29,149 --> 00:35:30,899
needed

739
00:35:30,899 --> 00:35:32,520
the problem is however

740
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,580
votes of the network conditions are
quite dynamic as i said before we can

741
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:40,780
ever previous through about uh... the
fluctuations in men

742
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,049
network

743
00:35:42,049 --> 00:35:44,329
uh... so

744
00:35:44,329 --> 00:35:47,889
what we can uh... really do these uh...

745
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:50,400
just career on the stumbled other and
algorithm

746
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,429
but we previously mentioned

747
00:35:52,429 --> 00:35:54,260
uh... turn around to meet their votes

748
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,249
and said this was to be

749
00:35:56,249 --> 00:35:59,269
uh... done all the time in order to

750
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:02,989
their compensated for that book and so
uh...

751
00:36:02,989 --> 00:36:04,910
and fluctuation in a

752
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:09,429
the ever-changing network conditions

753
00:36:09,429 --> 00:36:10,569
of course

754
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:12,190
as you can also too

755
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,729
some customized uh...

756
00:36:14,729 --> 00:36:16,279
sein fein grinning

757
00:36:16,279 --> 00:36:18,910
for example you might uh...

758
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:24,140
you might not frost of uh... the dynamic
values phone blakey and parkinsn or do

759
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:28,029
you might just want to be more accurate
in your own

760
00:36:28,029 --> 00:36:29,609
dangerous content

761
00:36:29,609 --> 00:36:32,020
so what you can do is uh...

762
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,710
the most logical to me is the dining
template

763
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:37,189
which is the same mas uh... bien mop

764
00:36:37,189 --> 00:36:38,319
uses

765
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:39,190
uh...

766
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,209
anyone who has used them up

767
00:36:41,209 --> 00:36:44,410
already knows that there are fights that
different templates

768
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:49,450
from the extremely slow which is a
parnell it the extremely fast

769
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,029
which is being sustained

770
00:36:51,029 --> 00:36:52,779
but uh...

771
00:36:52,779 --> 00:36:56,890
of course you must know that uh... but
the for last of his aggressive in this

772
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:59,870
e-mail suppose uh... denial of service
about

773
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,419
you to the many

774
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,589
you to the flurry of

775
00:37:02,589 --> 00:37:03,359
fa

776
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:04,900
open connections

777
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,599
but this will ensue

778
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:11,159
some other things that you can do

779
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:13,209
is uh... there

780
00:37:13,209 --> 00:37:15,209
two options to different options

781
00:37:15,209 --> 00:37:16,890
in as far as the

782
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,710
number of open connections

783
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,899
there are concerned

784
00:37:19,899 --> 00:37:23,299
the lower case uh... connection limits
here

785
00:37:23,299 --> 00:37:25,169
uh... it would say uh...

786
00:37:25,169 --> 00:37:27,569
forces and brooke to open optimists

787
00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:31,759
i was uh... many of the connections that
you specifying this timing option

788
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:35,020
and there is they'll pull six of itself
in the upper case uh...

789
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,720
connection

790
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,849
limits which forces and kruk to never
use more lum

791
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:42,139
the connections that you've specified
there

792
00:37:42,139 --> 00:37:44,909
and this is of course very useful when
you want to

793
00:37:44,909 --> 00:37:48,649
that when you are afraid that you might
go said denial of service dot doc

794
00:37:48,649 --> 00:37:52,719
or uh... you just don't want to waste
them and their resources

795
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:55,209
and other hyundai option is the
connection delay

796
00:37:55,209 --> 00:37:57,239
with weeds you cannot just the

797
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:00,119
that time between the its new connection

798
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:03,330
and there's also another uh... very
useful feature

799
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,580
but that we're going to discuss uh...

800
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,369
later

801
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:10,789
which of the authentication pin to
preclude nection this means that uh...

802
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:11,969
so many

803
00:38:11,969 --> 00:38:13,459
uh... credentials

804
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:16,220
jew are able to test and you test

805
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,679
in one connection

806
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:21,940
of course there are any indication says
that by their servers themselves

807
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,920
for example

808
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,799
all the necessary to by default

809
00:38:24,799 --> 00:38:27,119
lets you with this is the

810
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,660
uh... six credentials recollection

811
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:35,070
or um some other uh... if the peace
everest might uh... lets you just three

812
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,959
and something that uh... demons

813
00:38:37,959 --> 00:38:42,729
i remember from my home testing might
even let use us to one out them

814
00:38:42,729 --> 00:38:45,669
sophistication tempera connection

815
00:38:45,669 --> 00:38:49,559
now will see a real lega case uh...
scenario

816
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:53,369
balkan buy pasta firewall using the same
time costumes

817
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:54,729
now a show

818
00:38:54,729 --> 00:38:56,210
there tonight is the falling

819
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:59,550
but we want a crook at least one uh...
estates account

820
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,400
of that post uh...

821
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,269
there dennis

822
00:39:02,269 --> 00:39:06,809
which is uh... asato answering my
university where i studied

823
00:39:06,809 --> 00:39:11,479
and suppose this is uh... syrup doesn't
listen and uh... before the court

824
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:13,010
ridicule but from uh...

825
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:13,869
forty four

826
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:15,959
forty five one nine twenty

827
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:20,419
and we of course don't want to alert or
trigger the farwell

828
00:39:20,419 --> 00:39:25,349
and the fire alarm rules that is the
they wanted to get here

829
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:28,839
but the two blocks the you're right the
if you open

830
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:31,320
more than uh... to connection per minute

831
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,219
is quite district there are certain as
you can see

832
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:35,789
now some may wander

833
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:37,789
how do you know that uh... this is

834
00:39:37,789 --> 00:39:41,849
the fire will rule set if you don't have
uh... oxes to the mustang

835
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:44,259
you come to that buddy

836
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:46,749
previous experimentation suppossed to
you

837
00:39:46,749 --> 00:39:48,910
if did you cut right to open

838
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:52,369
many connections and throughout the u

839
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:56,509
she found out that uh... when he opened
more than that to connections in one

840
00:39:56,509 --> 00:39:56,950
means

841
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,720
but that's part of a book to you

842
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,739
it isn't it

843
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:02,579
soul difficult find

844
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:04,489
now let's see some uh...

845
00:40:04,489 --> 00:40:05,539
uh...

846
00:40:05,539 --> 00:40:11,039
some people configurations united states
because those who are going to test

847
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,389
the marks of some different price which
is

848
00:40:13,389 --> 00:40:14,880
as i said before is

849
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,279
six is uh... the default uh... by you
are the mocks to mark them spur

850
00:40:19,279 --> 00:40:21,029
connection

851
00:40:21,029 --> 00:40:22,599
let you come out

852
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:23,729
that you can do

853
00:40:23,729 --> 00:40:25,970
and uh... the much of my startups

854
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:29,169
are ten this is the these are the
mounting

855
00:40:29,169 --> 00:40:33,229
parlor live connections but you can open
bright pink

856
00:40:33,229 --> 00:40:34,690
and uh...

857
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:39,410
we also assume that we want to the or a
doctor take place only during the nights

858
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:42,429
because we want to be are still
disposable

859
00:40:42,429 --> 00:40:46,659
now as far as the authentication not
themselves concerned

860
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:49,459
and cook those the falling tariq

861
00:40:49,459 --> 00:40:50,489
it uh...

862
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:55,410
strives to learn that the authentication
attempts for a connection but the server

863
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:56,489
lets you do

864
00:40:56,489 --> 00:41:00,740
using derek on assaults rolled this
isn't that any other things

865
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:04,699
i'm not opening to enemies no connection
of the very beginning

866
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:08,359
which is uh... just one connection in
bareilly doesn't open any other

867
00:41:08,359 --> 00:41:11,289
connections and these and this is to
ensure that

868
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:16,130
you call that and almost one hundred
percent sence but uh... nothing goes

869
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:21,759
astray and that uh... your connection is
intended to meet there

870
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:24,130
in this case that you at steve

871
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:25,589
all the

872
00:41:25,589 --> 00:41:26,829
uh... all that

873
00:41:26,829 --> 00:41:32,049
all the marxism wilson's decent rise

874
00:41:32,049 --> 00:41:34,449
what we do in order to

875
00:41:34,449 --> 00:41:35,769
accomplices

876
00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:38,359
initially we use the dymo

877
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:39,599
unix commands

878
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,949
which still studies you home wants the
almost and the running over program

879
00:41:43,949 --> 00:41:44,989
takes

880
00:41:44,989 --> 00:41:46,960
and uh... we specify

881
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,139
but all romo julie is uh... estates

882
00:41:50,139 --> 00:41:51,629
are hostname

883
00:41:51,629 --> 00:41:54,619
and spend our report which isn't the
fold one

884
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:56,819
then we want to impose any limits

885
00:41:56,819 --> 00:41:58,499
uh... in the connections

886
00:41:58,499 --> 00:42:00,809
and a marksman

887
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,460
connections environment

888
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,809
wimbledon we set this limited to one and
want to do this because one qaf

889
00:42:06,809 --> 00:42:07,870
enough time

890
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,370
to press control c

891
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:10,559
in this case is

892
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,549
and uh...

893
00:42:12,549 --> 00:42:15,000
and to college how many seconds

894
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,339
one connection takes

895
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:21,650
and uh... of course we'll specified the
debugging output to be

896
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,029
uh... eleven six

897
00:42:23,029 --> 00:42:26,749
which is just enough to so this is how
quickly do you see here

898
00:42:26,749 --> 00:42:30,750
and you can see jeff dot obv when the a
connection not

899
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:34,420
was uh... been closed which means it
because uh... finished

900
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:37,659
we just that we media depressed control
c

901
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:40,189
and uh... close uh... kruk

902
00:42:40,189 --> 00:42:42,969
we're going also see here about uh...

903
00:42:42,969 --> 00:42:45,099
invest supported uh...

904
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:48,330
uh... in that section where it says
uh... supported

905
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:49,170
we can see

906
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:53,190
that this is actually that the number of
up there a consensus uh...

907
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:55,799
broke last fall into the out

908
00:42:55,799 --> 00:42:59,839
they are the marks a month and or
connection agrees that they're here

909
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,409
and uh...

910
00:43:01,409 --> 00:43:06,360
that time com once just told us about
this connection picks up both uh...

911
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,009
sixteen seconds

912
00:43:08,009 --> 00:43:12,349
so we assume that this is about uh...
demat accounts because

913
00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:15,180
you're must also take account of the
fact that you

914
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,279
gump immediately press control c

915
00:43:17,279 --> 00:43:20,569
and there's a delay of for bob one
second

916
00:43:20,569 --> 00:43:21,440
now

917
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,089
and it's all about the simple arithmetic

918
00:43:24,089 --> 00:43:25,109
afterwards

919
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:28,919
what we do is divided uh... one minutes

920
00:43:28,919 --> 00:43:30,509
rule for parts

921
00:43:30,509 --> 00:43:31,659
anta

922
00:43:31,659 --> 00:43:33,750
are bullies of course two accomplices

923
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:34,490
too

924
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:35,789
that just

925
00:43:35,789 --> 00:43:37,509
less or equal

926
00:43:37,509 --> 00:43:39,959
done that to connections per minute

927
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:43,589
andrea koppel seemed uh... fifty seconds
uh... reconnection

928
00:43:43,589 --> 00:43:44,440
so this

929
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,950
is very easy to count

930
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:48,070
in their initiative from

931
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:50,650
uh... point from time zero to fifteen

932
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:52,389
we open a one connection

933
00:43:52,389 --> 00:43:54,920
then from fifteen to thirty

934
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,710
two thirty

935
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:59,170
there is that that appear at the world
and crook is oppressed

936
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:06,099
and we use that then coaxing connection
delay but the republic's from two before

937
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:07,549
uh... and crook

938
00:44:07,549 --> 00:44:11,030
starts uh... opening can u connection
again

939
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:14,450
antiques finishes up the by a man forty
five

940
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:17,889
and then it's oppressed again for a few
things becomes

941
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:21,290
and by this way we've got would help
bypass the firewall

942
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:25,599
then the common for accomplishing this
is the following

943
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,569
of course we write and park to execute
and kruk

944
00:44:28,569 --> 00:44:32,739
the same thing does before a far as the
host name and days dates modes will end

945
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:34,759
the board is conserved

946
00:44:34,759 --> 00:44:35,990
we specify

947
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:39,239
and what time of uh... one part of a
connection

948
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:40,729
we want

949
00:44:40,729 --> 00:44:42,249
uh... the connection delay

950
00:44:42,249 --> 00:44:43,869
up to the far left

951
00:44:43,869 --> 00:44:46,069
to be fifteen seconds

952
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:48,660
anne's no there's also a red

953
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,689
another nifty trick

954
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:54,520
but uh... will present year which is the
time out

955
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,670
as we said before who want a bill still
feels possible

956
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:59,040
so we specify

957
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,849
but then kruk will be running only four
six hours

958
00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:05,969
unspecified this by

959
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,240
deal option

960
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:10,159
which means that which is short for
timeout

961
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:12,799
and uh... this we make a crook weights

962
00:45:12,799 --> 00:45:15,869
after uh... six hours of bust

963
00:45:15,869 --> 00:45:17,509
now of course

964
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:19,259
they're cracking position

965
00:45:19,259 --> 00:45:20,070
uh...

966
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:24,609
might not have finished after uh... six
hours apostol criticisms are usually

967
00:45:24,609 --> 00:45:26,239
very very long

968
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:28,539
so what we can do

969
00:45:28,539 --> 00:45:33,729
when that we've done that on to specify
a of that minus minus save option

970
00:45:33,729 --> 00:45:37,199
which we make and quick to say the
constitution

971
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:38,210
to this fight

972
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:41,199
colder estate session

973
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:46,449
we're going to use as scheduling care
application like grown and unix

974
00:45:46,449 --> 00:45:47,910
and call and crock

975
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:50,790
with the minus minus resume

976
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:51,569
option

977
00:45:51,569 --> 00:45:55,559
and the flying public of uh... the
device a decision

978
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:57,279
of course we specify a

979
00:45:57,279 --> 00:45:58,759
uh... crowing

980
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:01,520
more scheduled this obligation on your
during the night

981
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,459
but uh... nine p_m_

982
00:46:03,459 --> 00:46:07,899
because understood before we want to do
this only during the night

983
00:46:07,899 --> 00:46:09,950
and uh... this is very useful because

984
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:12,080
eludes us keeps doing this

985
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:17,249
as long as it's uh... six uh... as it
needs to finish the all there

986
00:46:17,249 --> 00:46:19,009
the cracking session

987
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:22,979
and that there's also one other options
here that would have uh... specified at

988
00:46:22,979 --> 00:46:24,180
the minus f

989
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,380
uh... option

990
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,689
which said just means that uh... um...

991
00:46:27,689 --> 00:46:31,129
uh... which cracking after your car
phones one credential

992
00:46:31,129 --> 00:46:34,930
and uh... you don't need to retake the
rest of the uh... you can name men

993
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,680
and passport in your release

994
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,509
and you've got lots of space fire force

995
00:46:39,509 --> 00:46:45,849
your own past forty least red using
their minus p opportunity soon letter

996
00:46:45,849 --> 00:46:51,649
it of course is the same manifolds for
specifying your username at least and so

997
00:46:51,649 --> 00:46:54,859
on

998
00:46:54,859 --> 00:46:56,630
now some thinks about the

999
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:59,169
and purposes library

1000
00:46:59,169 --> 00:47:03,049
uh... the as it's not very wasn't uh...

1001
00:47:03,049 --> 00:47:05,270
we didn't take any regular period

1002
00:47:05,270 --> 00:47:07,099
brother i wrote my own

1003
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:12,109
and they just uh... a deal or it's not
openly state school to do this

1004
00:47:12,109 --> 00:47:15,869
the open the states quote uses for its
own so kits

1005
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:17,529
it also could operations

1006
00:47:17,529 --> 00:47:18,809
and us

1007
00:47:18,809 --> 00:47:20,890
since bankrupt uses uh...

1008
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:24,000
and soak the blow fat separate uh...

1009
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:24,950
uh... or

1010
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:26,959
network operations

1011
00:47:26,959 --> 00:47:28,039
and

1012
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:32,739
i needed to hot peppers the the parts
but uh...

1013
00:47:32,739 --> 00:47:35,609
the hot that circuit court in open the
space

1014
00:47:35,609 --> 00:47:36,830
and substitute them

1015
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:39,289
with uh... an approx gold box

1016
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,969
and this was whether strengths uh...
task but uh...

1017
00:47:42,969 --> 00:47:44,900
it was also quite educational big

1018
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:48,069
goes a so called one of the most popular
ah...

1019
00:47:48,069 --> 00:47:51,299
uh... servers out there is uh...
implemented

1020
00:47:51,299 --> 00:47:52,579
and they also

1021
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:56,109
a lot of things about obviously it's
political works

1022
00:47:56,109 --> 00:47:57,290
and it's uh...

1023
00:47:57,290 --> 00:48:00,359
the bonus think about using pair up in
the states

1024
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:04,199
at the positive things are about uh...

1025
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:08,050
there are many by keys estates divers
out there

1026
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:10,329
these are usually all complain that the
sins

1027
00:48:10,329 --> 00:48:13,990
that uh... might have some uh... certain
peculiarities

1028
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:15,089
for example

1029
00:48:15,089 --> 00:48:17,519
use there are might be

1030
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:21,330
some servers but expect to receive the
anysuch pocket

1031
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:24,939
but has a certain flag uh... activist
rip and beat active

1032
00:48:24,939 --> 00:48:26,299
or whatever

1033
00:48:26,299 --> 00:48:27,669
and uh...

1034
00:48:27,669 --> 00:48:30,719
if they don't receive this pocket then
uh... they might uh... drop the

1035
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:35,319
connection and to open the states
because it's uh... really robust

1036
00:48:35,319 --> 00:48:37,039
uh... because uh...

1037
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,369
they cannot count of all these um... but
you got this

1038
00:48:40,369 --> 00:48:44,619
and house uh... quote that uh... montes
do by possum

1039
00:48:44,619 --> 00:48:47,389
because many workarounds for these

1040
00:48:47,389 --> 00:48:50,609
we never lets this is a functionality of
organization

1041
00:48:50,609 --> 00:48:52,359
and we use it for an kruk

1042
00:48:52,359 --> 00:48:54,210
now this and there are also

1043
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:57,290
many other types of competition which
are more obscure

1044
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:58,349
in the states

1045
00:48:58,349 --> 00:49:02,119
and weak on the floor use the open seats
cold uh...

1046
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:04,760
and for them immediately without coming
to

1047
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,210
reinvent their real

1048
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:12,219
as far as the sampling are concerned

1049
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:14,589
uh... another uh...

1050
00:49:14,589 --> 00:49:16,149
very important think

1051
00:49:16,149 --> 00:49:17,890
it is the order

1052
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:19,359
thoughts to you

1053
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,619
uh... test of the usernames and
passwords

1054
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:27,439
now the usual out or during that most of
the elephant do some cracking tools

1055
00:49:27,439 --> 00:49:29,259
is uh...

1056
00:49:29,259 --> 00:49:33,400
couples youhave the pages enemies that
you see here and the possibility exists

1057
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,139
that you with this uh... passports

1058
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:39,229
and uh... these are nameless is destined
route

1059
00:49:39,229 --> 00:49:41,229
the bus released his uh...

1060
00:49:41,229 --> 00:49:43,910
one two three four five best foreign bar

1061
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:46,249
and uh...

1062
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:48,589
most adorable sedition cracking tools

1063
00:49:48,589 --> 00:49:50,310
uh... do the opposite

1064
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:54,640
of wat tam krabok dust for example vaid
tests

1065
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,339
the

1066
00:49:56,339 --> 00:50:00,069
initially piak direct over that popcorn
the neatest

1067
00:50:00,069 --> 00:50:03,189
and to bend over the years in the
mideast

1068
00:50:03,189 --> 00:50:04,859
so for example the

1069
00:50:04,859 --> 00:50:08,069
hughes they first use

1070
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:09,040
the

1071
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,119
yes

1072
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:12,099
and then they test

1073
00:50:12,099 --> 00:50:13,209
uh...

1074
00:50:13,209 --> 00:50:14,300
all the passports

1075
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:18,849
so i'd guess though one two three four
five guessed that this guests for when

1076
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,989
the guest bach

1077
00:50:19,989 --> 00:50:21,089
but

1078
00:50:21,089 --> 00:50:25,329
this is doesn't really pick up on boats
off of the

1079
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:28,029
of the fucked up the authorities

1080
00:50:28,029 --> 00:50:29,279
popping sort it's

1081
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:31,509
according to frequency rates

1082
00:50:31,509 --> 00:50:34,589
so in the first line in the first uh...
passports

1083
00:50:34,589 --> 00:50:35,899
is the

1084
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:37,910
is the most uh... frequent

1085
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:41,609
for example one two three four five is
one of the most effort and uh...

1086
00:50:41,609 --> 00:50:43,229
passports out there

1087
00:50:43,229 --> 00:50:48,519
so in order to pick up on the dubious
unit to do it in the opposite order so

1088
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:51,109
we hav business and part of the
following

1089
00:50:51,109 --> 00:50:55,139
it to you it tests guest and one two
three four five en route

1090
00:50:55,139 --> 00:50:58,989
which is the second years unnamed and
one three four five and so on

1091
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:03,670
and of course if you want to to do their
opposites you've gone not specified the

1092
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:08,649
the possible its first option nor the
tube returning to reverse order

1093
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,939
now the problem with the states

1094
00:51:10,939 --> 00:51:12,339
is about that

1095
00:51:12,339 --> 00:51:14,660
it doesn't allow it and think that
username

1096
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:19,589
when you're in the same connection so if
you want to do this is uh... if you try

1097
00:51:19,589 --> 00:51:22,939
and do this in the default order

1098
00:51:22,939 --> 00:51:24,169
when hugh

1099
00:51:24,169 --> 00:51:28,289
hospice digest and then no one two three
four five and then sings the username to

1100
00:51:28,289 --> 00:51:29,040
route

1101
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,640
and uh... the possible one two three
four five because you have changed the

1102
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:33,670
username

1103
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,200
essays will tell you

1104
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,649
it will drop the connection and this is
a problem

1105
00:51:37,649 --> 00:51:39,869
so what you have to do

1106
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:40,960
is uh...

1107
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:41,929
initially

1108
00:51:41,929 --> 00:51:44,809
uh... you sent of course the
reconnaissance a program that much

1109
00:51:44,809 --> 00:51:47,259
maternity symptoms slipper connection

1110
00:51:47,259 --> 00:51:51,679
wheaties sublets there are three for
example

1111
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,929
below the knee surgery gone the
configure this to be whatever value if

1112
00:51:54,929 --> 00:51:55,849
you want

1113
00:51:55,849 --> 00:52:00,569
and uh... suppose you have these uh...
using the amused and uh... pa forecast

1114
00:52:00,569 --> 00:52:04,249
and suppose soul supposedly health for
barlow connections

1115
00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:07,640
then what you do is a mixed malt of
uh... uh...

1116
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,679
of order

1117
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:09,830
so you test

1118
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:13,819
the guests and uh... which is the first
username and then

1119
00:52:13,819 --> 00:52:16,879
the first to the passport one two three
four five

1120
00:52:16,879 --> 00:52:21,489
and then you would get the same username
and discuss that the next uh... two

1121
00:52:21,489 --> 00:52:24,099
passport which are best and full

1122
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:27,120
and you do the same thing for the rest
of the connections

1123
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,000
so that

1124
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,989
the essays dozens really uh...

1125
00:52:30,989 --> 00:52:33,739
country to drop the connection between

1126
00:52:33,739 --> 00:52:36,849
and is very important

1127
00:52:36,849 --> 00:52:40,470
some other things to remember and this
is very humbly when you do

1128
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:41,979
winters and they think

1129
00:52:41,979 --> 00:52:44,309
is about the uh... sometimes

1130
00:52:44,309 --> 00:52:46,800
uh... certain services purpose

1131
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,460
purposefully insert that thang delay

1132
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,289
between itself and gives haunt them

1133
00:52:51,289 --> 00:52:53,959
so for example a remember fight isn't up

1134
00:52:53,959 --> 00:52:55,250
whatever our

1135
00:52:55,250 --> 00:53:00,359
you sent that username and password it
waits about uh...

1136
00:53:00,359 --> 00:53:01,160
uh...

1137
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,990
three seconds or maybe more

1138
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:04,660
before do come nam

1139
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:07,389
uganda's the second username and
password

1140
00:53:07,389 --> 00:53:08,849
and in this case

1141
00:53:08,849 --> 00:53:13,720
into maybe into may be better to open a
many connection we seats uh... i think

1142
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:18,480
what you want to do some attempts for a
connection and then immediately close

1143
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,550
in this case

1144
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:24,290
uh... that they should be the three-way
to speak on sake that time that it takes

1145
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:28,849
is less found the time delay but the
services uh... imposes

1146
00:53:28,849 --> 00:53:30,290
and this is a very frequent

1147
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:33,129
so in this case you cannot just uh...

1148
00:53:33,129 --> 00:53:36,150
uh... specified but for the
authentication up empty

1149
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:37,380
the eight p

1150
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,019
uh... bancorp him

1151
00:53:39,019 --> 00:53:42,640
he's one trying this case and park will
just close uh...

1152
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,990
the connection immediately

1153
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:47,239
and it will be much faster

1154
00:53:47,239 --> 00:53:49,099
though some things about the v_

1155
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:51,209
remotes does the protocol

1156
00:53:51,209 --> 00:53:56,059
this was one of the most uh... strenuous
task of last summer it almost took

1157
00:53:56,059 --> 00:53:58,449
there one in the comp month to implement

1158
00:53:58,449 --> 00:54:01,379
but it was uh... were flight

1159
00:54:01,379 --> 00:54:04,220
one of the two reasons it starts no
other two

1160
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:06,729
nowadays gum relieved to have to pick
rocking

1161
00:54:06,729 --> 00:54:07,699
and said

1162
00:54:07,699 --> 00:54:12,119
get this because describe their which
they're only works on windows uh... is

1163
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:18,249
quite broken and body it doesn't even
work uh... if i remember correctly for

1164
00:54:18,249 --> 00:54:21,719
for cracking care when there's a
expendable

1165
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:22,770
and uh...

1166
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:25,520
there were also marked the scope of
boxes

1167
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,440
but that there are but there are remiss
rohan don't uh... really work on uh...

1168
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,669
the spendable

1169
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:33,849
uh...

1170
00:54:33,849 --> 00:54:37,339
implementation of uh... they are the
protocol

1171
00:54:37,339 --> 00:54:39,429
hooked up months because they hope to

1172
00:54:39,429 --> 00:54:43,259
to go through all the documentation of
uh... you have to be protocol leanna

1173
00:54:43,259 --> 00:54:45,899
beneficial um... microsoft uh... website

1174
00:54:45,899 --> 00:54:47,379
see how this work

1175
00:54:47,379 --> 00:54:51,519
and uh... there or were also very
peculiar cases

1176
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:54,729
and one of the most uh...

1177
00:54:54,729 --> 00:54:59,609
of the most of of the strangest uh...
cases were

1178
00:54:59,609 --> 00:55:01,009
the r_d_ pieces ever

1179
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:03,019
just dropped a connection

1180
00:55:03,019 --> 00:55:07,379
whenever there was as certain bits
octave and it's good to have to do with

1181
00:55:07,379 --> 00:55:08,950
a big block compression

1182
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:12,229
which is computer your irrelevant of
course

1183
00:55:12,229 --> 00:55:17,570
in order to find this out i've got to
compare a bit by bit bite bite bite

1184
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:18,879
the

1185
00:55:18,879 --> 00:55:21,859
the output uh... the worst mark output

1186
00:55:21,859 --> 00:55:25,039
off our desktop and compare it with my
own

1187
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:28,839
with an crux and this was uh... quite a
task to do

1188
00:55:28,839 --> 00:55:31,389
i thought that this for a packets that
were

1189
00:55:31,389 --> 00:55:33,689
many many bites uh... long

1190
00:55:33,689 --> 00:55:35,090
and you can see here

1191
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:36,549
the proof

1192
00:55:36,549 --> 00:55:37,630
the arctic bestial

1193
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:41,220
all this pockets are acquired just to do
those sanitation

1194
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,299
all of them

1195
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,029
lengths and other special case

1196
00:55:47,029 --> 00:55:50,829
was thoughtful um... until windowsxp

1197
00:55:50,829 --> 00:55:53,419
everything was normal and by normal

1198
00:55:53,419 --> 00:55:55,349
i mean but uh...

1199
00:55:55,349 --> 00:55:59,169
whenever you sent uh... an
authentication uh...

1200
00:55:59,169 --> 00:56:01,529
and often the case in credential there

1201
00:56:01,529 --> 00:56:05,379
uh... it told you but uh... you ha faqs
investor constraint

1202
00:56:05,379 --> 00:56:07,699
a certain text string

1203
00:56:07,699 --> 00:56:12,349
and visual spiked uh... is it to barcy
is just a hot to fine tune your pocket

1204
00:56:12,349 --> 00:56:15,299
but there was a cell are certain
mastering

1205
00:56:15,299 --> 00:56:19,949
but all of you but uh... you know you
have failed at the username or password

1206
00:56:19,949 --> 00:56:21,739
is incorrect

1207
00:56:21,739 --> 00:56:25,019
but the thing starts in windows vista
and double

1208
00:56:25,019 --> 00:56:27,349
the fact was that uh... um...

1209
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:32,559
if a embedded disinformation intergraph
com parked of p_r_ desktop

1210
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:35,969
i don't know why they did this

1211
00:56:35,969 --> 00:56:39,679
in this case to put themselves search
for those drink

1212
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,259
uh... votes

1213
00:56:41,259 --> 00:56:45,019
the username or password please uh...
falls is incorrect

1214
00:56:45,019 --> 00:56:49,339
so what i saw that there was finds was
trying to search for a month ago bought

1215
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:52,759
their own at bottom of that uh... would
be

1216
00:56:52,759 --> 00:56:56,329
uh... in all hope versions of uh... when
this from based on the boat when this

1217
00:56:56,329 --> 00:57:02,129
uh... seven and uh... two thousand and
uh... it's uh... server and so on

1218
00:57:02,129 --> 00:57:05,809
and uh... i found out after uh... um...

1219
00:57:05,809 --> 00:57:06,819
concerts

1220
00:57:06,819 --> 00:57:10,619
and uh... of course a lot of uh... why
sarika debugging

1221
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:13,180
thought the um...

1222
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,549
the most popular

1223
00:57:14,549 --> 00:57:16,230
where the coordinates

1224
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:22,340
of uh... either of the a_a_r_p_ their
bottom okay or the next uh... bottom i'm

1225
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,569
not by never really found out

1226
00:57:24,569 --> 00:57:25,649
which of them

1227
00:57:25,649 --> 00:57:29,819
butts there were the same always the
coordinates uh... which you can see

1228
00:57:29,819 --> 00:57:30,969
there

1229
00:57:30,969 --> 00:57:33,049
these are the struck twice

1230
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:37,389
were always the same whenever whenever
you hot failed an authentication

1231
00:57:37,389 --> 00:57:40,379
attempts

1232
00:57:40,379 --> 00:57:45,410
of course there's rosen always uh...
place uh... epic barking this

1233
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:47,050
but that would think is that

1234
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:51,549
because that the coordinates maybe
relative to the um...

1235
00:57:51,549 --> 00:57:53,580
tuesday resolution of the rest of the
window

1236
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,410
but the good thing is that uh...

1237
00:57:55,410 --> 00:58:00,279
the client senses the proposed everson
missions so when this country three pw

1238
00:58:00,279 --> 00:58:03,889
and sings the coordinates so this
coordinator for our the certain

1239
00:58:03,889 --> 00:58:08,389
resolution that you sent are always the
same and by this way if you come

1240
00:58:08,389 --> 00:58:12,429
determine the whenever your coffee
domestication not them

1241
00:58:12,429 --> 00:58:14,589
of course for the

1242
00:58:14,589 --> 00:58:18,049
for the case where your ah...

1243
00:58:18,049 --> 00:58:22,029
europe into a successful there's a
default to wait to do the socal

1244
00:58:22,029 --> 00:58:25,269
fortunately that wasn't quite the task

1245
00:58:25,269 --> 00:58:29,810
and find some uh... and crop fixtures
that uh... opened this is a

1246
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:30,750
will adore

1247
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:32,799
or the following

1248
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:36,639
all of you that uh... accuse them up
might not be

1249
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:40,809
that to the different uh... the two
basic uh... outfit for months the one is

1250
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:42,239
the normal output

1251
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:46,759
we'd say system one readable and the
other air things one is the extra mile

1252
00:58:46,759 --> 00:58:51,559
and a crock gone uh... defeat can be
said that these uh... and ma finds

1253
00:58:51,559 --> 00:58:53,699
interview tomorrow that normally

1254
00:58:53,699 --> 00:58:56,019

1256
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:03,500
based on which opened which sportswear
open and which protocol seat of of

1257
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:07,980
course uh... supports because then the
proc gump's crock everything governor

1258
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:11,289
and some political stump even re hobby

1259
00:59:11,289 --> 00:59:14,609
the notion of uh... syndication in them

1260
00:59:14,609 --> 00:59:16,279
and um...

1261
00:59:16,279 --> 00:59:20,949
you can also use uh... at the animal
print at foundation main target this and

00:59:27,509 --> 00:59:33,029
there for example of lifeguards uh...
subnets mosques and so on

1265
00:59:33,029 --> 00:59:37,650
there are also high quality username and
password lips sippin with an kruk so you

1266
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:39,170
don't really needs

default

1269
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,949

1275
00:59:59,769 --> 01:00:04,020
there also some other own botsford piece

and um...

1278
01:00:10,099 --> 01:00:12,130
of course there is so upset with the
