1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,400
okay welcome everybody

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,850
levin my name is Kia risk

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,990
and upright alia reverse engineering

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,120
yes the main goal of my

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,220
presentation is to demonstrate the new
concept

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,330
regarding dealing with 21st techniques

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,529
particularly regarding so protections

8
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:33,830
I love for example it is

9
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,200
a common practice among the virus

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,360
software development companies to use

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,160
Parker's noted not bought an extra layer
of protection

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,260
against anti-piracy now

13
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,550
the most sophisticated by Curtis willa
integrate their cold

14
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,820
I'll virus kinds of underinvestment
greeks

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,970
most of them come other be completely
custom

16
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,769
or use directly some windows

17
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:07,490
API's eyeliner to give you an example

18
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,610
I'll case you

19
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,950
like for example to I numerator

20
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,520
processes in order to detect malicious
processes like a malicious to running

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,479
like a well known to Barca reversing
cool you would use

22
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,320
layer process 32 first persisted next
API's

23
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,280
in order to enumerate the purses sent
the pic the ex

24
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,789
if not to release currently running
along with your process

25
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:36,880
now the good thing is about

26
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,950
I'll one hikers use

27
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,210
this kind of three is that it in

28
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,179
the it really gives you a punk that's
because

29
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:51,310
this cold it's already the memory its
operating systems call

30
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:55,750
so sits this cold is there and what's to
be triggered

31
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,880
at the center point why not use it

32
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,210
for in that's a in our favor

33
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,189
because what really happened she's

34
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:09,440
as the execution of the Parker goes on
and the

35
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,480
porous layers get the crib in memory you
get closer to the original entry point

36
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,770
to the publication

37
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,110
so the figure is not along with his
execution

38
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,870
or so the varsity first picnics are
going to be trigger

39
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:29,290
so what we're going on but said the
point some what their first picture

40
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,150
going to be

41
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,430
more close to the end of execution of
the Parker

42
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,780
so this means that the either with half

43
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,140
I'll their original cost of the program
or if the impact in memory

44
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,230
I in other cases

45
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,730
went to a park itself implements

46
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,920
its own licenses them probably this
layer is the cryptic

47
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,510
I die and is going to be used directly
after

48
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,900
about the use the three getting office
and the rest greeks

49
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,120
so you're to close and Yukon

50
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,130
from from those techniques to a doc

51
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,420
either a pic the park itself its
licenses them

52
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,000
or theoretical I'll

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,850
gold of the program if the protection is
there

54
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:26,040
now this concept has

55
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,880
I as you gonna see has many advantages
well first the form

56
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,620
since most of the Packers shipments also

57
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,950
virus sick some sex now by using

58
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,550
called up it's nothing site the biker
the fuck it doesn't know what you're

59
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:43,060
doing

60
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,790
this is the first lines one of the most
important

61
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:51,540
and the the second the second one is
that

62
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,670
up you come like for example you don't
have to

63
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,040
completely Michael unpack the
application which means that you can

64
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,240
avoid a local folks the world like
reconstructing the

65
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:07,190
it's not important but a stable the
original lawyer fixing called splices

66
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:12,050
and other virus picnic start the pack is
used in order to make the reverse is

67
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:12,690
life

68
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,630
quite more difficult of course

69
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,130
you could use any Windows API used by
the program

70
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,090
if it's of course triggered letting the
correct timing

71
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,199
during the execution but this is another
thing

72
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,220
up today we're going to talk about the
specific

73
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,430
activist recused by your mobile a

74
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,700
which tries to cross lit by Garrett this
is a specific

75
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,360
to reversing 3 its AP packet a specific

76
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,580
University it the want or

77
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,810
fight dialect woke up any effect this is
the first technique was discovered by a

78
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,410
the guys behind on my pillow years ago

79
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,660
and is still used so this technique is
going to be used

80
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,420
I in any case by automobile

81
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,660
I so I use the issue in order to

82
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,100
find let's say emo replace the place
cervical

83
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,639
now the I our case

84
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:19,480
it's also or make what makes our case
more interesting

85
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,810
if that's the whole application has been
let's say you're up there around

86
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,290
with fax-no: Co we're gonna see in a
while

87
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,840
what's all this

88
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,650
so it on my pillow probably many people
ripping no

89
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:39,260
most of the people but deal with
southward

90
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,760
my sense of development its axle
inexcusable

91
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,310
occur it's true that the first very good
protection against

92
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,490
reverse engineering antisocial popular
among commercial

93
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,240
software developers sure some

94
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,020
3x that there might be a lil biker
diplomats

95
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,480
you can either have portable executable
code their elimination

96
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,880
it actually want to eliminate the whole
chapter just small part of it

97
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,950
I quote splicing it's a very interesting
technique it will actually

98
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,389
during the parking I'll the program
which gets executed it gets fucked in

99
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:16,460
memory

100
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,480
it's going to steal some my ass Pacific
Lance of cold

101
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,610
and substitute them with some toms

102
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,590
into high memory locations so if you
dont the process

103
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,050
I some cold is a let's say

104
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:34,480
a substitute it with dance some places

105
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,070
the so you want tough working working in
much

106
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,480
I come either choose to do specific port
redirection

107
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,820
sets two's to redirect specific pointers

108
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:52,210
the inside important but a stable are
either eliminate the whole

109
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:57,590
important stable the but block your it's
a very interesting feature

110
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,760
it was actually applied as compromiser

111
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,530
against about seeing because it's a very
good idea on your up like a

112
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,949
a publication and

113
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:13,949
you you see that you can't bypass some
tricks during their

114
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:16,960
execution the Parker electron and then I
thought

115
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,080
the process notebook local what really
does ease

116
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,720
but it forces the application I

117
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,580
lots a second process and Budget Inn
member who want to running

118
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,790
so burial program is going to run from
the second process

119
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,110
which is a tight process which is while
it's running

120
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,169
its key skit gets it is the up by the
parent process

121
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:43,220
so you can at that's the second process
by a

122
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,060
ordinary means of course is a way to
bypass this to

123
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,169
I'll the copy man it's a very
interesting

124
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:54,210
this it was out with us practically as
an extra feature along with the puck

125
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,139
locker

126
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,520
because the guy sold out was very easy
in the end to

127
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,340
bypassed but but locker so copy member
works

128
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,100
with Bates guards so when executioner
the tide

129
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,260
tries to execute the specific I'll

130
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,990
a specific like stocks on specific which
all others are aids

131
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,710
which has been marked only with for for
exemplary toxicity has

132
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:22,370
doesn't have execute Texas and excision
is going to be raised

133
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,669
with its the Pirates the box it and it's
going to

134
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:30,220
receive this event it's going to see
that help memory access violation

135
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,209
it's going to restore bach and their
Italian permissions

136
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:39,209
endorse the group that Bates I'll cover
some non-whites

137
00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:43,110
along also is the company implemented
doesn't accept feature

138
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,420
along with putlocker on

139
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,670
mites a very interesting at the best
technique its

140
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:54,420
only used by Armadillo I'll armadillo
shell it does is

141
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,129
substitute some conditional toms with in
30 months which are like software

142
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:00,470
interrupts

143
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,769
so what the are in process bucks the
application

144
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:08,889
I knows by in a creek to table

145
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:14,259
what actions fake depending on where the
exception occurred

146
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:17,749
and normal it's going since it will
normally

147
00:09:17,749 --> 00:09:21,759
Tom substitute on condition its amps the
parents house to check

148
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,490
like only that execution flights

149
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:29,720
and redirected the direct the suction
pointed to the time

150
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,480
depending on the fines execution blacks

151
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,829
some mother call +1 and reverse it fixes
just that the bug detection through the

152
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:38,439
column on

153
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:41,639
is the bugger present I

154
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:45,509
gonna have some serious he six-ounce
runtime:

155
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:48,550
and or so of course the

156
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,639
public or talk with the box thing API

157
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:55,740
with things of this form up trying to
cross the bike and as we said

158
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,930
this we only work with only

159
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,529
so what this lets channel cynical

160
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:06,720
is is mostly used for portability

161
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,939
its it will actually bach all cock

162
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:14,800
all the dependencies of predicted
independents together for specific

163
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,059
program

164
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:20,389
so you can avoid some issues like the
early to tell for example

165
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:24,209
when you want to I run your application

166
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:28,779
where the taping machine has a previous
versions

167
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:34,389
some pls so this is mostly used for
portability congress what you see you

168
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:35,509
later Center

169
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,629
sometimes neck at the booklet from work

170
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:43,550
itself up and this is very important
that the brutal as it gets a lot

171
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,959
dependently from the other software and
SaaS the host PC

172
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,480
everything is going to be lots in memory
runtime:

173
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,899
is not going to use the let's say that
the lengths of

174
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,819
the of the printing system to running on
it's going to launch

175
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:02,910
everything it needs a petition the
brittleness YouTube channel that picture

176
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,939
called uses

177
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:09,939
so has a muscular University UN that is
yes

178
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:13,749
if you're eat just interested Michael
impact on my pillow kung fu

179
00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:17,910
online and find many tutorials about

180
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:23,360
but we're not sure for that day up dust
samples provided the antivirus

181
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,740
protection

182
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,550
well your ass is no at least not on
purpose

183
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:34,019
of course tenneco it implements a very
basic

184
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:38,730
the packet detection become if that
doesn't work mentions you

185
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,619
and the of course but the fact that

186
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,879
everything is going to run on conviction
records Britto machine

187
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:49,209
makes the whole process more interesting
because

188
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:54,170
nope not only every module that's going
to be loaded in memory

189
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,499
has every time a different too much
space

190
00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:00,689
it is also the fact that natively
armadillos going to

191
00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:04,160
allocate some extra memory and right
there

192
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,439
effort will be led point they are much
has been a from the previews

193
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:14,290
from the previous page we're going to
see this later on

194
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:18,420
so the hope other this is the first time
the committee look it's

195
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,429
are can't get simple with publication
utilization

196
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:26,259
there's a lot to learn regarding to see
inappropriate self-protection

197
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:31,499
because we will see a case where we're
going to use and reversing technique

198
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:36,879
I'll against the protection itself

199
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,290
so this is a short description of our
case

200
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,619
this is a real commercial software I
it's not

201
00:12:43,619 --> 00:12:46,989
something I I made just to

202
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:51,429
play around it's quite expensive so

203
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:56,470
so fertilizer the fertilizer application
was slow to return for the

204
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:00,189
from work and the

205
00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:03,480
their mobile protection has been applied
gonna fit Steelers

206
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:09,589
libraries before dipped actionable Peter
latest gets applied

207
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:13,300
so when we run the application Excel a
cold as Surratt said

208
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,860
is going to look memo reorganised same
organs it clean

209
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,749
than what they look like they let which
is used for the license management

210
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:24,439
electrons days remaining License
Verification enter

211
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:28,199
of course the tix as I said are going to
be launched by either

212
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:35,199
Britt on BBE lol but we're going to see
this later on

213
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:39,119
now here's some pics information about
the trick

214
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:45,209
are police so organise a modus arose
around that much for it said

215
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:48,389
there's no writing them temporarily like

216
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:51,790
that these help and the harvest

217
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,339
axis on for this think also

218
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:58,920
mister William Rothwell from a babys
company

219
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,639
I used his it's the F hardware firewall

220
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:07,480
when I was on there was talking with him
so because he wanted like a

221
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,249
proof of concept but the reason really

222
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:14,980
%uh know why o.o with the heart this
quite acceptable

223
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,709
close the application I was right

224
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:23,739
I soul work with a tent for example to
come from memory in with programmable a

225
00:14:23,739 --> 00:14:24,410
popular

226
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:28,929
but this it's completely using this
every time

227
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:33,139
you're on the guest acceptable it's
going to blow the original in memory

228
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:37,029
as we saw rates have a myspace for more
goods programmable but then it was

229
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:37,759
different

230
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,220
memory every time irani

231
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,779
and as I said before there might be a
look below

232
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:48,980
we'll look at some extra memory runtime:
and right there some extra cold

233
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,559
was the last season's going to that's a

234
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,749
perform with sex and the Sorcerer's Mar
boxes the lead from the previous

235
00:14:56,749 --> 00:14:57,790
versions

236
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,170
or Italy like years ago you could see
Remarks Bilal

237
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,749
probably created I am

238
00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:08,239
into specific for their offer of windows
but

239
00:15:08,239 --> 00:15:11,769
this is not the case anymore

240
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:15,049
so the fact that the payments based
changes every time

241
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:18,980
many stalkers the brutal others that
specific goal regarding

242
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,119
I'll the last six want to that's going
to be different

243
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:26,110
time

244
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,209
soap up well normally cue you could do

245
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:33,040
to thinks you can either call the loader

246
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,709
rollovers Ricky member that specific all
look modified

247
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:41,249
runtime: well normally for applications
will have different types of

248
00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:44,679
a box it's a you would either

249
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:47,720
try to my early completely Michael Young
pocket which is

250
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,949
very funny say cannons owners have with
a

251
00:15:51,949 --> 00:15:55,999
I you can either practical tool older

252
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:59,139
and do all the talking runtime:

253
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:02,709
I alright then you could line

254
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:06,809
the application itself normally lining

255
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:10,369
I am will either reinforce only execute
the ball

256
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,509
or some pillows particular use

257
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:18,449
but that depends on its case for example
from my personal experience

258
00:16:18,449 --> 00:16:23,269
abused I like orifice techniques and

259
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:26,549
it's crazy when you see like with
protectors

260
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:31,790
I really kicking destroyed by program is
that they don't know how to use them

261
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,220
i've seen cases like where they have
used like a

262
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,029
very good bikers like us perfect like
the new versions

263
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:42,439
of prospect and they come

264
00:16:42,439 --> 00:16:46,019
for example bach execute the ball with
us put their

265
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:49,509
and the half-blood like the trial

266
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:53,369
beer a limitation into a non McBeal

267
00:16:53,369 --> 00:16:56,579
so like come on why did you

268
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,679
I did you pay for the biker if you think

269
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:05,150
Euclid meant the the license sick like
inside the popular enough but the letter

270
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,970
and exit from but is that with this girl
is called

271
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:13,640
the application is a recount but the
memories are we going to do that Pfizer

272
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,309
to inflict call you remember me on the
but the petition

273
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:20,539
aqui don't even have to worry about

274
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:27,539
the park itself okay

275
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:34,709
to have trouble here

276
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,260
okay let's go

277
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,350
so this want is

278
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:35,350
said is gonna be like fickle their
thoroughness

279
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:39,060
by trying to write or or online
functions

280
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:43,200
like southwick its the

281
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,360
runtime: which in this case is also

282
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,970
more fun so are we

283
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:57,230
inside the protection the as we said
before the beetle

284
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:01,000
is going to be no somewhere it's not
reloaded

285
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,960
awesome the armadillos

286
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,800
public it's a memory right the cold the
ritual

287
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,320
I'll what's going to use the output
boxing API in order to cross

288
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,490
biker as said this is specific debugger

289
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,710
like so confused spock inside

290
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,610
I like are we site

291
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:31,040
there populous ritual Philip this is a
case

292
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,070
where the output box thing its

293
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:37,310
school trying to Crusoe

294
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:41,060
biker you can see this thing as a
barometer

295
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,100
the school and it just thing

296
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,300
is now you can clearly see

297
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,410
fertile others I'll

298
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:55,010
from where the call has been implemented
and guess

299
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:58,400
and guess what this artist is inside the
ritual

300
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,710
but every time us F

301
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:05,050
of course or there's mortgage going to
be created

302
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,890
runtime: but these is another layer

303
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:13,410
after that because this is going to be
that created by government believes the

304
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:13,900
lol

305
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:20,900
by a look at some extra memory right its
own but until it somewhere

306
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,500
so here we are where bach to the IMAX is
love space

307
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,660
you can see the called up

308
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,770
books above so

309
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,910
know that we're here will just start to

310
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:47,050
work around just see if this anything
interesting

311
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:50,460
you can see from the stick references

312
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,970
some useless things of course there's
nothing to copy and paste here

313
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:58,590
if it led to this is another case it
will not work

314
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,780
so don't write copy and paste anything

315
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:06,910
in other cases you have to dig deeper in
other things so

316
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:10,540
I am by a

317
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,930
trying to find to take the reference to
our

318
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,680
username there you can see that

319
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,020
a certain point we have

320
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:30,020
FIU so from here

321
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,320
okay you this location here

322
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,440
okay sure that the by

323
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,830
is going to be move back want

324
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,830
the fight by to silver it's their

325
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:52,070
from memory location site that the
spatial

326
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,970
ritual the alert from a deal and

327
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:59,130
and despite is going to be safe in to

328
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:02,430
let's say

329
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:06,150
local viable is local

330
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,270
and then move despite

331
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:12,510
ok eTex then take the ex's not

332
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,520
so don't EX issue

333
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,660
so the dumps

334
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:23,120
not going to be executed but we're going
to see some other issues

335
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,000
it's not that easy so there's some
issues

336
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,810
around this month by yes it is always
you

337
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:34,830
by the forty must always be nosey

338
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,610
by C always I mean at the specific

339
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:43,360
time on the execution because the same 6

340
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,380
are going to be perform more than once

341
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,960
so if you're like you can't wait

342
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,840
might fight it going to shoot this
program is going to be reset

343
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,320
buck 20 and there's nothing to do about
then because

344
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,330
this is not going to beat since forever
probably that

345
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:04,920
necrotic can be performed three or four
times in this case

346
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,340
so like if you are too fast and

347
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:13,710
second good now like the next six going
to give you said

348
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:17,470
who said like 20 and as we said

349
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:21,550
of course is the outer space every
turbulence or so the pizza like this

350
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,850
where these bites locate

351
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:27,630
is going to be different every time so
we can know

352
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:31,230
what is the free tool others much bite
every time

353
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,390
the pic is runs in order to be able to
modify

354
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:39,630
and of course modified when it's the
correct timing to do so

355
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:43,130
so by putting

356
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:46,310
putting things together now

357
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:50,310
woke up always know every to like this
got the spatial which hotel

358
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:55,400
stock what they are with the box it go
to school and we also know if it's a lot

359
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:55,880
this

360
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,630
months ago by so here's

361
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:03,330
reflect the brutal the Briton lewis
structures always the same

362
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:06,720
of course so the differences fights
between

363
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,030
extrication is going always be constant

364
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:13,630
it doesn't matter if you come from 100
110 North

365
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,850
200 210 the difference is always 10

366
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:21,400
and this is what we're going to use so
what we just need is thoroughly

367
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,880
analytically to like this of the month
of the month by

368
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,260
to avert a lot this way record book
boxing API has occurred

369
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:34,570
from the brittan pillar here's an
example

370
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,720
Lake much bypass relative it all others

371
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,080
its a must bite brutal address

372
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,380
minus the address where we're going to
come bach

373
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,700
after the quote book box three is
performed

374
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,460
and of course this distance every time
is different

375
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,540
because got with the box thing is going
to be

376
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:58,350
called trying to cross out the biker
from more than on occasions

377
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:02,640
that's why I'm telling you got you have
to know when you're going to use the

378
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,230
picnic

379
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:08,280
you have first of course analyze the
biker see for example on your case

380
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,480
how many times is 66 performed when

381
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,860
when my let's say it's safe

382
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:21,860
it is the body of the month by gun do it
whenever you want so some things to keep

383
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,320
in mind

384
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,140
for the visual art a complete a lot this
I'll

385
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,660
will only cost if you all lucifer

386
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,720
to the Brit Oval Office of the same

387
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,440
core got box thing from the bitter pill
it because

388
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:46,990
set up gonna be more than one course and
of course who else invasion

389
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:53,470
and others had before

390
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:56,980
this some other stick which they raced
the licensed security

391
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,370
may pick more than once so the brutal
killer

392
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,520
which means that miss that much bite me
bit tense but

393
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,090
in tissue Unit No how many times

394
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:10,850
the output the Park City scored and when
it's safe to modify that much

395
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,930
by which means that

396
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:19,250
Sophie this a so action icons you may
need to calculate the relative it a lot

397
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:19,640
this

398
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,390
much bite by county how many times that
put the plastic has been called

399
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:28,270
in picking course duration: the safe
which all others

400
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:33,570
were reported bucks think from the
turbulence me

401
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:38,220
so can go one step further I'll keep
reflecting the fucked up

402
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,530
you cannot write in like function but
gotta clean with fights

403
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:46,620
much by you don't like it was last
season because as we set this going

404
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,010
never too late feel it's going to be
written somewhere in memory later on

405
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:52,210
during the execution

406
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:55,540
and of course we need to prepare the
first link function

407
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,610
that's going to be executed when we
still have control of the execution of

408
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,810
the application

409
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:04,510
because later the channel Alberto
muahzzz going to take control

410
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:11,040
so won't be able to to play as we want
and more

411
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,160
so we're going to do is to

412
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,450
somehow exploit notebooks thing West

413
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:20,780
pic by with the fighting VR school site

414
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:24,810
the current to lurk in the face
depending on Windows version

415
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:28,330
your officials produced like with
Windows seven

416
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:32,680
and some basic functions have been with
their

417
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,380
actually application you will steer you
see like car

418
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,280
let's see in the port at this table

419
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,830
you keep use the issue that there is a
pointer to the conflict between

420
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:46,920
lol we're going to go there would be
directly

421
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,030
redirected cannot base I because the
conditions

422
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:57,100
is really that if you're in 2007

423
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:00,320
and as we said this modification must
look every time a runtime

424
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,690
as said we don't use the cold up

425
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:07,840
of epic wouldn't really want to directly
at back because the fair

426
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,370
of application upset win over Tampa
reversed the pics going to get trickier

427
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:16,910
and the school it's already there
already Nova

428
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:20,420
of his face route our own cold

429
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:24,920
dynamically every time we don't even
care about the

430
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:31,410
a SLR and other stuff going to show you
ho

431
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:35,080
so this is the same lining this is like
I am

432
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,380
which the Singh the first this is the
starting

433
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:43,240
of the first line function about it some
extra strings

434
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,500
said the cold Katy

435
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,640
notice that the music you Nicole for the
system given names

436
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,160
that's because the application is use
the unique ok first floor library

437
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:01,470
so this support Fig I'm more so using or
so busy port addressed the people of the

438
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,790
application itself

439
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:06,970
to know were peace let's say were

440
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:10,490
well as the a to call the local library
for my needs

441
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:14,200
I don't have to no because the
application uses

442
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,720
so I'm going to use the references from
the pointers

443
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,430
set the tone port staple

444
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:25,210
so characteristics of EPA's some
interest to them

445
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,630
and the two pillars

446
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:32,770
so this is the first line function
buttressed the lash of coal

447
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:36,650
I are the structure that they were

448
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:40,800
substituted when I wrote it some
politically directly from the entry

449
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,190
point

450
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:47,100
to the court gave of course you can or
so directly modify

451
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,160
the the entry point said the shitter

452
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,770
but a it's not let you could do this

453
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:57,790
but in some cases work as we're going to
say later

454
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:02,260
a there are some sick some 60 people
were so the shitter don't want this

455
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,350
so intense that information said hither

456
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:09,060
sources ices had the first this the
first three

457
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:13,330
instructions are from the retirement on
the fabrication

458
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,710
then I save you tonight because it's
theirs and the state

459
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:20,120
execution flux and

460
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,890
my feel and function starts getting
executed this is the first line function

461
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:28,660
this is I constantly say

462
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:33,230
in a cold cave site the application
welcome she later

463
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:38,760
how you can upload take some 6 in case
you used this technique

464
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,780
saw what I'm going to do first this I
need to know which

465
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:46,030
very soon I love the guys going to run
the application

466
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:49,260
some thank first to get the car like PLO

467
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:53,520
the killer bass the library if I'm
honest do so it means that someone went

468
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,760
to seven so I don't have to try

469
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:02,760
I for can offer to anymore

470
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,740
then what I'm going to do is to

471
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,860
17 and no now EX this the bay

472
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,860
the address payments based the others

473
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,760
payments based specific module that
though it has been

474
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,750
we could just retrieved so with a point

475
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:32,230
who is I need I need this let's see

476
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:35,540
this hunger so I'm going save this

477
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:40,090
by you I to yet and then I'm gonna post

478
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:44,420
the as a barometer that

479
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:48,050
dealt with the box thing and the file
you

480
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:51,660
us second parameter to get broke to get
personal address

481
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:55,550
and in this way I'm going to retrieve I

482
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:59,040
first before the address where every
time is noted

483
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:03,030
the out ok with the box thing because
you know

484
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:07,680
obvious a large every time no worries
and

485
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,790
want to do this I'm going to save its
fine you

486
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:14,550
to to VAT rates there and then

487
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:18,910
to the same process again for the
picture perfect a

488
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:22,920
we're going to use the same humble as
before that's why we saved by the

489
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,150
Hon'ble Twizy

490
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:28,300
and events if it's others less so now

491
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:32,650
have been eighty it is now pointing to
the

492
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,179
without with the box thing and is it
points to

493
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:42,179
brittle protect now of the parameters
for better protect is actually a pointer

494
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,610
with the war where when the function
returns

495
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,770
it a do like when the folks from

496
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:53,780
a diplomats serve like it's going to
write their the

497
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,380
the old cost under the protection so in
case you want to sainted the game but

498
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,080
later

499
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,380
you know what the cost what these

500
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,710
of course not to do this I have to

501
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:08,810
to post to this to as a barometer
remember location

502
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:12,940
warehouse right axis other whites

503
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:19,260
the call to the pH gonna fail so what
I'm doing here is also using that data

504
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,190
section of the application itself

505
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,980
because it has already right axis so I
don't a

506
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,149
me too let's say

507
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:31,280
to use some any extra cold and use their
like

508
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,419
and try to get there right DOCSIS all
that stuff I can directly use that data

509
00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:35,980
section

510
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,740
that's why I am posting the this artist
something others

511
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:44,560
the data section and then I'm pushing
the rest barometers

512
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,810
like the you want this constant 46

513
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:52,520
which means a a try to execute

514
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:57,180
the size

515
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:02,560
don't take the permission before it
kicks I'm going or so to

516
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,640
to post the address to what box think
it's

517
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,890
in the 1880 have been called the
function

518
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:14,089
get pacific's writes that now

519
00:35:14,089 --> 00:35:17,290
as we said before week no

520
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:20,589
when we're going to modify this much by

521
00:35:20,589 --> 00:35:25,660
so we need somehow I

522
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,890
to know how many times this on the best

523
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:33,070
rick has been triggered you need their
way to know that right

524
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:37,730
so whether going to do is the first
thing I'm doing

525
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:41,780
is to I'll

526
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,510
bust the netted that the entry point
where is it

527
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:49,210
%uh 24 which is the end it's the last

528
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:53,830
ukraine's want to reach the last bite
from when I took the permissions

529
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:57,849
and I'm putting there is hereby with I'm
going to use as a counter

530
00:35:57,849 --> 00:36:03,349
some using I'm using force my own
counter inside the second blank function

531
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:06,900
that's going to be written so want to do
this

532
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,109
I also write memory as you remember
points to

533
00:36:10,109 --> 00:36:13,950
the outbox thing but output by sleep
last night before

534
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,990
because I i did. 24 busy

535
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:21,280
now 80% of course exploding but with the
box thing but since I didn't need any

536
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,099
more of them

537
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:25,440
the outdated interpreter protect

538
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,880
I used the I used as she

539
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,910
to make the first cut Commissioner for
writing my counter

540
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:35,690
so there is typical months is about
writing

541
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:39,359
the second link function but a curious
or on time

542
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:46,180
when execution comes here so

543
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:50,050
this is the second land function this is
what we're going to see now in

544
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:54,880
after the execution the first lung
function this is called the outbox

545
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,000
get the app has been modified okay

546
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,570
on you can see here my counter

547
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:06,700
I every time

548
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,940
this the first pics go to be triggered
it's going to save this tape

549
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,020
the topic was in its simplicity
execution flux

550
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,220
and I need to do this

551
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:19,290
the third time this is the first it gets
triggered

552
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:23,119
my case so the first and get executed

553
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,270
might be one my counter is going to take
the country's

554
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:31,320
his three if it's not it's going to
restore but there it's a sin

555
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:35,260
go but and but this it's three

556
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,900
I'm going to retrieve from my from the
stock

557
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,080
from the other s for the the stack
pointer

558
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,089
points to blast into for kicks were
treated this fight you

559
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:49,530
because at that point there's that
invites there is

560
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:53,869
it distorted by you buck from the output
bucks think they are much as bill

561
00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:54,820
another space

562
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,270
and a point to and I i pick on some

563
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:02,200
but I know that from but with that not
the best after that for time

564
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,210
this is the Pistons of began at

565
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:08,210
between there if they're not the best
but they're much they love the space

566
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:11,830
the month by and vet now a week of

567
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:15,400
I'll the others the bike and put into
this one

568
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,190
we're going to see this led so

569
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:23,330
versus more conclusion I

570
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:26,740
up LACMA social protection

571
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,880
is good right case may not suit your
needs

572
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,830
it's true that course consider so for a
couple

573
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:37,820
a specific requests about about this
thing

574
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:41,830
up like I use the court for the loader

575
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:45,560
was discussing before I

576
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,630
some people really use it

577
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:53,070
but the hook because more fun too so
this technique like

578
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:56,190
if you can really use metal also another
case

579
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:59,420
you have to write the loaders specific
this application

580
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,960
one you can't like use this concept to
different people

581
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,690
defeat the different types bikers

582
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:11,710
and the good things up is not the fuck
it won't even notice the kid

583
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:16,280
so on gotten the text some text

584
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,750
because somebody would say okay the
first line

585
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:22,850
function safeties have to execute the

586
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:27,240
so the fuck your cunt sick what ticks
right

587
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:32,190
yeah okay the public at 600 can take
about six Sams see if I have modified

588
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:35,960
the application before before I taints
the court of

589
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,150
up system API memory

590
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:43,680
okay the first we think he's not a
fuckin will never rely on the tix some

591
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,460
I depending on the cold of some Windows
API

592
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,869
because the school can set up any time
in the future update

593
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:56,470
solar safe give up that marked the best
thing that the packet could do

594
00:39:56,470 --> 00:40:00,130
like after seeing this is let's say okay
now

595
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:04,420
the calm one and two-point for summer
for the city I would know that she's

596
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,010
like

597
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:08,690
up move 8 the AP so

598
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:12,420
what I'm going to do is the ticket
destructions first

599
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:16,190
but of course stupid because our can
always keep this a construction

600
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:23,190
and the it but defiant up to another
occasion

601
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,770
are cutting the Texans because biker

602
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:34,150
okay want to rely on the tech someone
depending on when the ship yet but the

603
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:37,760
economy should rely on the tech some its
own

604
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,440
all the files has protected of course
many bikers implement text some text

605
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,740
including us for a pic a super thick

606
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:49,339
our mobile from this number protection
options

607
00:40:49,339 --> 00:40:52,630
and the ball and many others

608
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:57,980
of course so what you can do is

609
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,640
as you saw I started I am I modified

610
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,220
the API so if you don't get executed

611
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,330
Michael gets executed ago

612
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:11,560
virulent the best pic but

613
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:18,560
what you can do is that

614
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:30,630
K you can see down there after

615
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:35,890
the first Lanfranchi gets executed and
modifies the specific API a quote

616
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:39,930
memory have its own I

617
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:43,450
bach to continue the execution of the
process

618
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:48,359
what they can't do there is with its own
I already know all the other cities

619
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:51,979
so i cant up in this too for example
without

620
00:41:51,979 --> 00:41:56,369
boxing I can't up in any location on
inside

621
00:41:56,369 --> 00:41:59,670
out this space next the others range

622
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:03,499
but specific API so i cant some

623
00:42:03,499 --> 00:42:07,599
their from she ain't directly continued
execution

624
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,829
dump their up this

625
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:15,269
its previous Pacific old is going to
write a few more distractions

626
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:19,799
but going to be separated from my called
that's going to

627
00:42:19,799 --> 00:42:23,739
to got back there the the protection
later

628
00:42:23,739 --> 00:42:27,499
it's going to be where my counter
correct this behind like

629
00:42:27,499 --> 00:42:31,239
below use the rest space and

630
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:34,989
this or civic would think that %uh
QuickBooks thing API

631
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:38,369
it also provide to break with space
where you gun

632
00:42:38,369 --> 00:42:41,680
really write some extra go like folk
problem

633
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,079
so is the something

634
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:49,319
bach stopping like directly to bike

635
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:52,529
the execute there's the publication

636
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:56,859
when the at the first lady fucks hazard
the second in memory

637
00:42:56,859 --> 00:43:01,969
i cant Sam another occasion below and
sat there

638
00:43:01,969 --> 00:43:05,430
he said the cold whereas or Africa's
makes the call

639
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:09,019
and but cool squeaky-clean or these

640
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:13,009
and then dump but

641
00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:17,869
to the entry point so what the fuck is
going to sick

642
00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:21,809
about in memory verifications

643
00:43:21,809 --> 00:43:25,609
he's not going to take it's not going to
find them of course they're gonna people

644
00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:27,460
deficiency guarding the fine

645
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:31,039
I'll but of course covers apart

646
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:37,849
this like you can't wait for you all
usually the Parker

647
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:44,239
is going also sick I as an extra layer
of protection from modifications

648
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:48,920
run thank which of course

649
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,440
it's more like it's more effective

650
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,969
because in this week on a subject of a
break break points his way

651
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:59,109
going to suffer a break point is going
to Arthur

652
00:43:59,109 --> 00:44:02,150
you're called memory you don't to
release you

653
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:07,420
but others the cold memory it's up to us
to buy it with the

654
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:11,130
SEC x-pipe so if and

655
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,219
take some is going to be implemented I

656
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:17,759
is going to get triggered also by using

657
00:44:17,759 --> 00:44:21,900
break points okay

658
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:27,300
I have a

659
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:32,690
but if you do just status or what I
wanted lot

660
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:36,490
is up yeah it's true that the

661
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:40,650
workers like the open is totally rely

662
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:44,400
the the Parkers the commercial bikers
and

663
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,880
this book but because many of them are
very cool but

664
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,570
are I think it's better bought some
extra layer of protection

665
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:56,740
side your code itself but it seems that
nobody

666
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:00,130
by dust so

667
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:05,700
I'll it was this it was the main

668
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:09,560
presentation so now we're going to
missus movie do

669
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:16,560
well

670
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:27,720
okay I I don't senior cortex

671
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:32,359
welcome song the video because a this is
a commercial application

672
00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:36,170
alone anybody to exclusive now because

673
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:39,849
we didn't have the time to fix this so I
want you to respect the fact that

674
00:45:39,849 --> 00:45:43,480
this is a commercial program

675
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:48,380
so this is the original on

676
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:52,630
I you see that

677
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:58,740
it has already expired so let's try to
see what we can do

678
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:02,170
this is the they wanna have implemented

679
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:06,740
okay structure so you can see up there

680
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:13,740
it's the entry point this it's amp down
to my coat K

681
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:29,130
K so this is how the output box three

682
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:36,130
looks like before modifying it

683
00:46:41,869 --> 00:46:46,590
so here's the cold which

684
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:52,240
destructions we tripped out dresses

685
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,890
you can see this will save

686
00:46:56,890 --> 00:47:00,490
the the other support boxing every them
right back to the

687
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:04,410
that with the same

688
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:08,230
retrieve the other super to protect
we're going to see if this

689
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:12,140
is you for later use so

690
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:15,200
have this citrus sleepy eyes

691
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:22,200
want to use so sure

692
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,460
I'm using has a said a pipe inside the
data section

693
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:30,330
which recovery right axis so icon I

694
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:34,830
safely controversial protect to get the
necessary access rights

695
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:38,130
ritual what they are with the box thing

696
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:41,830
API so let's not go there and see scenes
so

697
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:46,080
stole the call looks like of the output
the box thing a pen memory

698
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:49,760
and the parking of course was no way to
know what operated up

699
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,830
the pack is going to try to cross

700
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:56,190
or biker and don't even know what you
did

701
00:47:56,190 --> 00:48:00,550
so up with the

702
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:05,210
her the point execution so

703
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:08,510
that's right now to run we're gonna see
some

704
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:12,109
error messages appearing that's because
as he said

705
00:48:12,109 --> 00:48:15,730
the brittle machine of tenneco

706
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:19,690
a runs low-tech memory sold

707
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:23,990
biker sculptures the fan but Motors has
been loaded

708
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:27,150
but can't find the low the motor nowhere
in this

709
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:31,010
harvest soak up fine analyze it so it
keeps

710
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:34,109
3 getting some okie

711
00:48:34,109 --> 00:48:37,430
this is the first time we venom

712
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:40,680
the brutal out there still is going to
try to cross her biker

713
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,820
you see the first thought this from
where it's cool

714
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:49,130
we're on again

715
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:52,190
you see here

716
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:58,390
its we're going to sick the centrists

717
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:01,940
which is you this is all counter

718
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:05,930
said for now is gonna be

719
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:11,270
became one of course this

720
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:16,540
it's not three so are re-elect factions
not going to be triggered it

721
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:21,440
we don't want this this is the second
time

722
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,619
that would boast nick has been confirmed

723
00:49:24,619 --> 00:49:31,619
which from a different others again okay

724
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:36,960
so

725
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,890
down okay this is the third time

726
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:47,130
would get your now it's

727
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:51,090
the third time so its okay skorik let's
move to TX

728
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:54,140
30 not this look 82 where the stack
pointer

729
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:57,470
a I'm going to show you

730
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:00,670
stung she their stock point their souls

731
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:07,670
this than others 24 down

732
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:18,720
let's its cool this others

733
00:50:22,290 --> 00:50:27,000
we're inside a city Sat there might be
less brutal killer

734
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,130
space you can see against some

735
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:35,380
interesting strings you can see the name
are much is the little

736
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:38,690
okay

737
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:42,760
and two minutes so

738
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,390
I'll now I out the but constant

739
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:53,390
my case was like

740
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:01,150
that cost them their from the third
return address

741
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:04,300
want the after three times the call but
the box

742
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:07,510
has been trigger and now I know

743
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:10,860
where the much by finally dislocate

744
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:15,090
memory applications going to of course
do this automatically every time

745
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:18,600
that's what our our first lunch those
like function does

746
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:22,960
it'll its rights second one the sick one
stays in memory

747
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:28,220
and waits for the first pics to get a
gift but instead of up

748
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:33,630
are are things going pic so gonna see

749
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:36,870
this going to beat Saints 21 and
charities

750
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:40,100
and the list now

751
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:43,210
Walker remove the 100 breakpoint his

752
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:48,510
more and they're out there the rest

753
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:54,280
is we're gonna help again the same thing
about

754
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:59,380
the biker sees the cups as they've been
to floating in with you but can't find

755
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:06,380
them

756
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:14,290
so this is it I if you have any question

757
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:18,310
about regarding this technique or
anything similar

758
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:25,070
another us now or later okay

759
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:28,950
no questions thank you very much enjoy
the rest of the conference
