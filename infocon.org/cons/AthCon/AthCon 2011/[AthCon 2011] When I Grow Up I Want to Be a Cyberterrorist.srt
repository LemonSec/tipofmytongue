34
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,540

you don't understand

41
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:22,360
please feel free to probe probe only
and/or alcohol

42
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,000
I don't make peace like their but
cyberterrorism

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,849
means many things to many people
basically concerns about

44
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:34,819
on computer bomb attack so disruptive
computer attacks stopped in the eighties

45
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:39,489
personally I think matthew broderick's
to blame it's all his fault

46
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:42,860
a concerns grew until 2000

47
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,090
when you know everybody got distracted
by the millennium no complaints gonna

48
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:46,980
fall from the sky

49
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,540
role gonna die a however really when
Manjula

50
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,790
the 9/11 on because you know obviously

51
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,450
Pete comply planes into buildings
obviously locators

52
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,900
a to turn the first was discussed very
late in 2010

53
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,150
in an article from the enough cult
cyberterrorism

54
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,159
fact or fiction as you may be able to
cast

55
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,110
I know which style up according to
Wikipedia

56
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,930
which as you all know is the fund's all
human wisdom in the world

57
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,080
I US company Toltec politics define
cyberterrorism

58
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,220
house the premeditated yousef district
elected

59
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,760
these for their organs computers on all
networks with the intentions

60
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,629
I'll tomahawk social ideological
religious political tool or objectives

61
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:34,860
all to intimidate any person for social

62
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,890
so objectives that's a mouthful

63
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:42,379
on upset there's also a degree in
history between incoming call

64
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:47,200
is the update politics title it it's
basically got nasty habit

65
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,180
making shital which will discuss later
so that may or may not be a top as well

66
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,569
Anna I'm sure you're a familiar with the
wonderful lucky will take clock

67
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:01,060
a which is caught those who don't know

68
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,010
walls the acts anti-terrorism saw about
george bush junior

69
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,269
and also bill clinton he's been
predicting

70
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:12,360
an electronic poll all but that will
destroy the West Amwell

71
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,329
years as we dole's his latest

72
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:20,299
opus Colts libel the next threat to
national security or what to do about

73
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:20,880
that

74
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,290
really on contentious title a a

75
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:28,090
basically he predicts the Chinese
capsules can destroy the entire US

76
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,040
infrastructure

77
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,440
in about 15 minutes planes will stop
flying

78
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,860
a gentle stopped working just refiners
will explode

79
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,900
on the US will go back to the dark ages
also a

80
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,889
search he's also recanted his position

81
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:46,990
on cyber terrorism electric pole
shoppers as a

82
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,250
all know are tied it be but is no I'm

83
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,800
as much to the US as a whole can't even
decide what conventional terrorism

84
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,889
EG people with balls so you've got

85
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:02,690
a different definition from the FBI a
different definition from the Department

86
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:03,190
site

87
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,680
on various definitions from the military

88
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,270
a person like you know are I'm Mike
define terrorism is

89
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,710
I'm impaired stomping around the world
cheap oil but you know

90
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,199
on over the FBI raided so

91
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,860
point as saw some objects if you believe
the hype in its entirely up to you if

92
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,410
you do all

93
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,940
I read about people gonna do very bad
things with computers

94
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,490
understandable fall now I will play

95
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,550
must the claims made about computer
mediated terrorism

96
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,660
are insanely exaggerated and all
bullshit

97
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,740
a the problem is

98
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,889
trumpeters have also encompasses the
word cyber

99
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:47,229
which if you use at and you're not being
ironic

100
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:50,600
make sure sounds like a pitcher to reach
alt

101
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,229
now I personally will define
cyberterrorism house

102
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:57,830
the use of technology assault II actual
a terrorist nature

103
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:03,530
simpler than tackle it its definition
now I know somewhat nebulous

104
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,250
don't think lots and lots of noise about
informational for

105
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,690
I look the Wikipedia article information
well but I like

106
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:14,430
and has botched up it cites the examples
and perspective in this article

107
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:18,660
deal primarily with the United tonight
do not represent a worldwide view

108
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,240
so if special only happens in the US
power

109
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,240
now well over claims that cyber
terrorism is fake sex

110
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,430
Paul something I'm calling the permit
annoyance

111
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,860
now Fox News under allegedly decline
backers

112
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,639
lovely in the bay did looks like a
terrorist

113
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,539
now I'm a blow to this group such
impartial souls

114
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:47,650
anyway my parents to pinpoint stuff but
listen which is basically defacement

115
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,680
go to crime which is taking your credit
card details goes up must be an offer to

116
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,610
taking on state secrets

117
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,139
up to terrorism which is blowing your
shit so to wall which is blowing

118
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:59,349
everything up

119
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:03,289
now actual computer mediated terrorism

120
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,509
according to a conventionally scene is
lost over

121
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:11,860
actions before all-out war war is a
fairly retarded thing today

122
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,120
now I wanted in this talk to trying
something

123
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,630
what risks are actually pose boy you
know the supposed

124
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:24,340
evil soaring terrorists a sign in to
Gmail access them from the UK

125
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,490
being from the UK I'm part of the
country that's the most surveilled

126
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,520
nation on earth a and

127
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,660
the UK has also introduced also for
legislation

128
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,639
aimed at addressing terrorism agents and
about child and generally being dicks

129
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,130
so I wanted to try to examine threats
sup

130
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,440
not tuna

131
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,819
site first time ago just very stripped
down version this talk to an

132
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,199
organization called the eyesight

133
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,509
I was told by a couple people it was a
dangerous tall

134
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:00,780
on it give people also the wrong ideas

135
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,210
built a I would hope that you all
sensible enough another one of two come

136
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,210
to your own conclusions

137
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:12,160
on I was also told that UK mediums calm
down below

138
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,349
about cyber terrorism other data not
talking about us

139
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:19,080
much I I did some analysis

140
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,160
a survey pro the UK government about
$650 million

141
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,180
pounds that was going to be spanked
addressing

142
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:31,349
computable threats and developing
offensive cyber war capabilities

143
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:34,519
there's also articles lights are on in
April

144
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:37,959
or and also eliminate pro patiently yeah

145
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:42,110
my favorite will is the private sector
has been asked to help fight cyber

146
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,050
terrorism

147
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,370
about the state-sponsored attacks by
submitting traffic data

148
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,120
GCHQ I'm not

149
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,990
to fight terrorists GCHQ can now read my
email

150
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,730
the car anyway but you're not
comfortable ship but yeah my thing is

151
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:02,120
looks like the meteor really homes down

152
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,510
now I don't like to the point but the
media does reporter

153
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,070
thats Wally weirdly terrorist terrorists

154
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,709
well I think the church is basically as
Roque PR companies

155
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:18,810
pill companies wanna shape opinion bar
yet have

156
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,500
getting press coverage that's what
terrorists do that's why the coach it's

157
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,820
ok because it makes huge

158
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,459
now I would argue the

159
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:33,300
the Richard clog pipes approached that's
a discussion about left

160
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,810
I doesn't make sense as much the a

161
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,459
if you're talking about planes falling
from the scholarly

162
00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:43,959
a national CNIB destroyed in 15 minutes

163
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:49,200
Dutch really not defining Rex and is a
little bit hyperbolic certain

164
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,760
you know we make home the language down
a bit

165
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,380
I'm also quite who controls the past
controls future

166
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:01,420
controls the present controls the past
very relevant so good about it

167
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:05,470
but talking about perhaps I'm gonna talk
about little bit of history about

168
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,550
shipped from them that not yet so the
first reported active

169
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,930
over Saudi about Sarah a

170
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:17,180
of you see you could argue the inner I
world and the like

171
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,630
on were cyber terrorist I would say
that's bullshit I was

172
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,769
outside the Celtics you needed from the
habit but yep

173
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:28,269
anyway not yet you have an organization
last name in the world a one of them

174
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:31,709
the inch netbook actually such ski

175
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:35,670
also day but basically they were
approachable group

176
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,190
the to in for prints that aims

177
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,880
distributed I the mail today to

178
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,870
a trunk embassies around the world now

179
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,970
that plan was to disrupt communications

180
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,399
now even in ninety-eight when you know
action shaken mail servers didn't work

181
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,370
properly

182
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,649
800 emails would not kill a decent miles
up

183
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:03,230
a.m. females for a fortnight for the
Knoxville

184
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:08,220
decent miles up us that they are
frequently cited as the first saw the

185
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,519
terrorist

186
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,500
the not terrorists have to call some of
that

187
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,670
that's what makes them terrorists now

188
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,390
their actions caused no major outages
and

189
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,079
also a pretty crap also not terrorists

190
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:28,370
so my if you're a current the IPTV tears

191
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,070
spirals a better terrorists

192
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:36,630
Sat and in 99 you have pro-serbian
hackles

193
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,570
the also the night black on purses
tighter

194
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,570
nature servers again watch with an email

195
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,570
and allegedly a there was some data
exfiltration

196
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,070
chrysler's whether or not those
pro-serbian souls

197
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:55,410
knows on up front there are lots of
Parsis

198
00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:00,070
British rap loans a more importantly
Bolens which are a little bit more worry

199
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,850
playground place a not no I

200
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,220
yes I am talking about like I I'll

201
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,279

214
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,230
a interesting 2005

215
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,410
first used the term AP today we love AP
che

216
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,660
it's such a ridiculous phrase it means
no say

217
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,149
but you can sell anything using it
basically in and

218
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:15,700
fun a system track are absolutely
pathetic tripe

219

00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,180
no bullshit a that said

222
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,889
2009 the Chinese were back 2005 wasn't
enough for them

223
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:35,010
the comeback in 2009 operation Aurora

224
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,130
according to McAfee we are as a result
all do

225
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,610
on lets people buy mcafee the world will
aunt

226
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,300
now Colby cynical if you will

227
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,670
after tax and problems all happened

228
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:53,680
roughly around the subsalt I'm are as
our site

229
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,540
sales pitch sales pitch don't know

230
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,269
this one's Gopala 2009 a European

231
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:05,470
of mobile infantry got bored during our
midst of

232
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,709
2009 your song had nothing but you know
the word or 830

233
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:14,220
so they decided to have a look at
Twitter shall we don't like churchill

234
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,579
show we look at switcher now

235
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:21,339
they wanted to see how terrorists groups
all I'll cut you don't like

236
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:25,639
group use the Internet and also use
mobile telephony

237
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:28,820
and cooled use social media

238
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,720
the question findings from the internet
a

239
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,889
a couple places but that's what it's all
fairly speculative

240
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:39,070
reading in the report by the talk about

241
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,339
pro terrorist interfaces for your phone
so

242
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:46,550
wallpaper they also discussed but

243
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:50,449
Baffert's by which mobile phones can be
used let that sucks

244
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:54,399
yes phones have GPS who knew

245
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,730
and they also talk about scary voice
over IP on

246
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,870
voice changes pretty standard stuff

247
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:05,230
they also examine helps but it could be
employed by terrorists

248
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:10,050
I quote this is a direct flight twitter
has become a social activism told

249
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,310
socialist

250
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,910
human rights groups communist budgetary
inch and a kiss

251
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:18,079
religious communities a fierce political
issues yes

252
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,579
activists and others to communicate with
each other and send messages to a

253
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:23,490
broader audience

254
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:27,050
my question is which one ear I have is
nice to see

255
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,930
miserable the but surgeons and people
interested in human rights

256
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,190
ok to the same a in in the same genre

257
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,380
a third Scianna also

258
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,740
I'm bakery on a case today basically
vegetarian

259
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,320
and basically interest in him much thus
I am a terrorist

260
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,160
also now basically

261
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,620
their search at the report is a social
media

262
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:56,560
can be used by terrorists organized it's
not or to conduct research

263
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,350
well yet coat but they could also use
carrier pigeons

264
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,490
Anna twice already have a number of
legal issues

265
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,769
like you know our fates the WikiLeaks
the ball

266
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:09,930
I'll United such made a request wickedly

267
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,269
gave it to the press embarrass the shit
up fat

268
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:17,230
us that have any other requests and
floated room to the right up

269
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:21,339
earn now if you're a terrorist

270
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:25,870
site or otherwise you probably patient
be aware of the risks of using Twitter

271
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,380
which is

272
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,430
Republic for doing anything over them

273
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:34,980
propaganda on it seems highly unlikely
in my head

274
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,110
anybody involved actively involved in
terrorism is gonna use Twitter

275
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,959
as anything although then in a the alt

276
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,040
pay all message you know it when it
comes to organization %uh probably gonna

277
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,899
use closed all rooms are still a

278
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:53,730
upset can switch to be used for open
source intelligence covering

279
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:57,149
yes it can you have to read for a shit
load of bullshit

280
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:02,310
to get to anything useful can it be used
to plan and schedule attack

281
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:07,750
it can but then so compounded messages
on blog page is a tractor

282
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:12,049
coded message on but the book page

283
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:16,140
but is social media threats

284
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:21,990
a yep if you post details the troop
movements or personal identifiable data

285
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,640
if you do that you worry child I like is
not

286
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,890
right if your personal crap Anna

287
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:33,440
is it being used by terrorists or as
anything other than the river rally

288
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,789
old toasted that said

289
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:41,610
US-trained of mobile infantry want
access to Twitter in 2000 I

290

291
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:50,690
ap quick quick look forward to but not
prove it right now is in a terrorist

292
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,919
organization I know decide

bought this tight butts the coming home
in 10 was talking about earlier

294
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,580

476
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:15,590
so will almost certainly be flagged so
beloved being

477
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:18,860
K to be there will be nothing left some

478
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,890
will have been reported so however

479
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:25,010
may work if you've got in of people

480
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:28,390
Nov rituals then I'm this is more

481
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,450
a viable option for example

482
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:34,559
because the self at

483
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,570
don't we all aspire later on this year
but you know the

484
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:41,029
so she can pull off that I've tried and

485
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:44,299
for if you are actually called you keep
things simple you know you find a

486
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:45,870
reliable exploit

487
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:50,039
exploit the Ripper live like sparks
coming for target

488
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:53,520
and if critical teetered doctors held
and petted

489
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,460
you will drop for that now obviously PCI
DSS

490
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,640
from stop up obviously because we all
know

491
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,049
that you're a small merchant or a former
chin really bored

492
00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:07,700
up their stuff now dot

493
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:11,230
moaning so all that way doing in poet as
early as

494
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:15,270
offers life 2007 installed to help

495
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:18,880
it's simple hutu anonymized data used it
in a while

496
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,700
wall I exploited busboy them I V Day

497
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:27,760
this to analyze and for some it's broad
enough X Factor

498
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,320
the third term shouldn't cause financial
chaos the other do it

499
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,559
you find a week merchant are lots of
them the final

500
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:39,279
your bank credit card data are attacks
are either by a physical attack on the

501
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,299
premises

502
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:44,770
or by finding reliable exploit which
deployed elsewhere

503
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:48,470
you then use on the card thanks that
belongs to Norm

504
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:53,159
helpful acquiring banks surgeon at a
time I report for all

505
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:58,120
you don't profit and compile tanks that
you once

506
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,120
flying the friendly skies this model of
the month

507
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,580
the money on a traffic control systems
are a lot of Paul

508
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,000
on traffic controllers launched the busy
moving planes around

509
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,419
that's what they care about that's their
job there

510
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:16,000
had about network security

511
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,590
up because that job he punched in stock
guy called writer Konkel

512
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:24,140
up frightened by like present some
awesome find

513
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,419
on something are your fam trip very
interesting the last

514
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:32,269
when people talk about terrorists making
plans fall from the sky

515
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:35,549
is one of the populace nightmare
scenarios

516
00:31:35,549 --> 00:31:38,669
can only make plans for from the start

517
00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:42,690
now Nikkei you gone out of fashion
organization called not

518
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:47,059
national air traffic control services
about self as a private-public

519
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:48,809
partnership in 2000

520
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:52,850
up as a result some people transport as
we all know private-public partnerships

521
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,460
work all time there's nothing that can
go wrong with them

522
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,669
people are pissed interest in profit
owner

523
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:01,820
and go home and operational centres but
they've also got

524
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,929
separate traffic control 15 UK adults

525
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:09,740
by a company called not Services Limited
outbreaks them

526
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:14,269
the Queen unheard loyal subjects in
government and foreign I'm Sun

527
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:17,460
a be a a own hopson

528
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,909
on the allied group which consists 7 UK
airlines

529
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:24,510
and the residual the lots and lots of
people involved in this

530
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:27,919
all with their own agendas sup

531
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,070
lipton also up by making very simple
query

532
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:35,590
like find out the information security
manager not

533
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:40,399
los voy a finalist not what time
managers infrastructure architect

534
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,200
the head safety security and program
management

535
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,370
security and only said up

536
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:51,480
their own names I'm because the way that
nuts were

537
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,890
in a the very simply email for

538
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:58,850
sonya spearfishing purposes the space

539
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:02,440
so without using multi there are any
social engineering all

540
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,330
what you can't do is built a really
detailed organizational chart

541
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:10,279
for the air traffic control system in
the UK if you were to do it now

542
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:13,500
if you were doing a targeted attack
state on his bill

543
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,260
nora is over Sony got it out make your
day

544
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:21,779
a doctor knots also use work pressure
publishing platform the weather

545
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:24,830
which is actually roller really skill
number please that

546
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:28,200
at all obviously the website will be
connected to anything else

547
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:34,120
obviously sup in adults technology stuff
but like to see huge

548
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,279
well last year details were published
but watch flycatcher

549
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:42,600
Islanders made by frequencerz and then
use a prospect in the plane's roll

550
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,679
elsewhere but currently arguing polished

551
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,990
a electric light air systems a run on
Mike

552
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:52,700
top what's and its use to track fight

553
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,260
now the for quenches system is used

554
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:59,269
Nigeria but obviously in the take-home

555
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:02,840
cope the bus cuz you know we have more
planes Nigeria

556
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:07,760
and %uh skies are busier on not so also
in 2009 sign docs

557
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,240
single European sky initiative his own
technology stack

558
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:16,740
if you have enough time to produce the
data about systems reviews from

559
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,409
technical specs are a

560
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:22,500
outside if church groups mission funding

561
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,810
prospect poll it also focus on talk
about tax

562
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,629
AG the way comes up made in China is all
that shit is made in China

563
00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:33,599
and you know the chinese for are in
charge online there's nothing that

564
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,369
I'm if you want to listen to ICC you can

565
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:41,099
as an offensive to the lawless like a
few in a hey listening to

566
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:44,440
about possibly go you find the
transmission frequencies

567
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:48,599
their a one interesting thing

568
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:52,490
I am in the UK with also a quick system
which is how military aircraft

569
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,179
communique

570
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:57,849
iSuppli a pic is basically random radio
frequency hopping

571
00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:02,359
which it makes a pain in the Ulster
moments are and also I mean for

572
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:06,099
the most you pick upon is American pilot
pitching that the hell

573
00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:09,200
but like lightly sup

574
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,450
she is better than this something I call
upon paradox

575
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:16,670
on earlier this year guy called Ryan G
first

576
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:21,200
about all caps actual cameras Apple
point to the from whites

577
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,630
on you know Booker find your topic on

578
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:29,109
is highly unlikely it will ever be used
by terrorists just her style

579
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:33,839
and to your own place blockbuster at
probably not right idea from a security

580
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:34,700
standpoint

581
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,310
I would have polls una sir

582
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:41,720
wanna criticisms about the stall is the
Turners Falls

583
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,940
also will be turned computers physical
attacks

584
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:49,530
really halt in a blowing chill is
getting increasingly difficult

585
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:53,970
on her fun I can accept up-close look at
Apple's

586
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:57,160
contents winchell sends up on Angeles

587
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:02,839
such document published which documented
at Paul attacks between 2000-2007

588
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:05,910
the following the number of attacks
spots open subculture

589
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:10,200
also plans in the UK and US combined

590
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:14,609
that was 18 a truck so potential attacks
in Pakistan which is

591
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:18,150
a much smaller geographical area UK US

592
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,890
that was fifty all sup

593
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:25,599
attacks really hard for terrorists in
the

594
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,050
Foreign Legion of why

595
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:32,420
well corporations a this increased
security

596
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:36,570
business philosophy of terrorism which
is about gaining local sports

597
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:40,410
you know it's like they are right your
route profession applying pops up in

598
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:41,390
Belfast

599
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,680
the reason why the blue pops up in
belfast was to remind the people I'll

600
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:49,490
aft that they are right probably in a
okay if you with a French

617
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:50,290
the slow to focus on diagram voice
networks etc speaking about

618
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:55,550
freaking out about VoIP no because for
all the stops is checked 25

619
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:58,920
those that you don't know the extent of
stock and international package which

620
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,220
day at work it was the first wall

621
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:05,490
I deployed in the seventies eighties on
it still use now

622
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:10,730
on actually fun at work for an upright
largely by national telco companies and

623
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:14,040
also couple private operators or talk
about later on

624
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,060
Sat your plane X 25 because it is no
longer

625
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,630
1983 it's a pain y'all

626
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:24,680
the next 18 passion in a dollop now a a

627
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:28,339
you also need some way to make the
template to

628
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:32,290
a playhouse no easy why Paul

629
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:35,650
well X 25 nope stock

630
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:40,410
thus it's very difficult to secure
doesn't play nice avoid yes

631
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:44,119
playhouse for only PS and pick up on
idea

632
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:48,000
for by Sprint network position info
numbers of understand the whole night

633
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,780
night night three

634
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:53,750
an nothing that's good if you from wall
tile

635
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,810
K associate expand part number:

636
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:59,810
impact group of the authentication
mechanism all

637
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:04,190
knowledge other be detected to the
complaint hospital idea

638
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:07,820
additionally what's the phone share
rooms on x 25

639
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,849
example Vodafone all-male

640
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:14,869
Osama operates fire 25 can

641
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:18,990
dole's actually area now accordance
conjecture

642
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:23,089
as a member of the carriers such as
orange 3 acceptor up

643
00:39:23,089 --> 00:39:27,650
that deploy X 25 Sparta its partner
network but right

644
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:31,950
now you go offensively a deprecated
stack

645
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:35,190
grozny in environments where it may or
may not be secure

646
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:39,339
also another interesting thing

647
00:39:39,339 --> 00:39:42,369
the Greek National Lottery works over X
25

648
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:46,520
which is interesting say no deprecated
protocol which comes

649
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:50,599
chill is in a controlling lottery

650
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:54,680
a fun she went

651
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,920
Anna yes he is International Telcom
Julian publishes details at that network

652
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,589
ID

653
00:39:59,589 --> 00:40:04,550
notes basically hours 25 workstation in
fact that network ID code

654
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:08,869
on a network user dress which you know
most is 15 digits

655
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:12,700
a X 25 addresses our oversight

656
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:17,280
they have a change the archie you suck
at this is our ship docked at Russia

657
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,010

not not interested now I'm sure however

665
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:48,900
the last one a the shower all 'it's
dangerous

666
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,359
the organization called Rachael time
total rightful

what they did

669
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:02,900
on be a the fairly interesting shit

670
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,940
still assigned sup

671
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,190
at Kohls terrorists will not spend that
time darling

672
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:12,240
room for 625 what would you do something
the

673
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,349
for me to imagine I'm gonna get caught
doing

674
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:18,670
mission also stated I'm not two thousand
olive

675
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:22,170
and closed countries like China and Iran

676
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:26,079
might be interesting insight abusing
that systems to do

677
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,190
worshipful set the smaller fun of it
disruption

678
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:33,920
build a shelf life John if you wanna
take down homes never

679
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,020
build a very big cell phone jammer put
it up on

680
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,349
park in the city centre of 40

681
00:41:40,349 --> 00:41:44,390
cover the archer also sup

682
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:47,790
that also role in regards homes in a

683
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:50,869
on you can use a boy finances

684
00:41:50,869 --> 00:41:55,099
a cell minutes or dial premium rate
numbers and find a

685
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:58,470
not is not be called don't show done a
graph

686
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:04,230
have a dial and there you go you've got
all funding a future happy camping trips

687
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:07,510
some local shit

688
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:11,319
under sign and

689
00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:14,750
the suspect in some customers for much
better weapon

690
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:20,369
village but is incredibly can be
indicative deeper issues

691
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:23,579
if only was a terrorist not watched all

692
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:27,069
Jinnah easy so much

693
00:42:27,069 --> 00:42:31,210
a and China who are believer TV company
up here

694
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:36,180
a personal trip Hellenic defence systems
to make bombs and shit

695
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:40,890
up for such cryptic this happens daily
paper

696
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:45,109
hospital site scripting goodies to make
hamburgers I believe

697
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:49,050
a precise picture the point is finding
that shit

698
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:53,349
not halt but it may be indicative of the
ship is going all

699
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:57,260
instant if you work for an 8-yard those
organizations I didn't tell you because

700
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,660
I don't speak Greek

701
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:02,000
alright I also understand that like

702
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,460
French is here or something anyway
agendas

703
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:09,290
I'll be quick apparently the fresh cycle
or is looming

704
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:12,540
at the UK government is developing cyber
weapons schools

705
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:16,740
you know obviously using Metasploit all
campuses too difficult and he spent 16

706
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,490
$50 million developing their own shit
apparently

707
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:23,440
rogue states and political terrorist
groups are coming to get you some role

708
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,960
going to Doc

709
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,619
why our task institutions and decreased

710
00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:32,710
yes because the small computer which

711
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:36,050
of physical attacks at least in
non-western countries increase in

712
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:40,450
yes because in Western countries halt to
do

713
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:44,720
to attract make heck slim trash all
sales strategies

714
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,770
an app fun the system I yeah

715
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:51,630
on what can you do if Craig terapia

716
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:55,150
around basically some strange accident
defined

717
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:58,250
right well in the UK

718
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:01,720
the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2000 on

719
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:05,720
which makes it legal to detain
terrorists without trial

720
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:10,369
on you've got situation where the UK
such a critical issue control orders

721
00:44:10,369 --> 00:44:14,920
suspects and those controls complacently
allow

722
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,130
I legal representatives to ok out

723
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:21,500
human rights law your cherished human
rights no longer apply for

724
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,550
you a we've got the chairs are not

725
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:28,950
2006 which allows for 14 days detention

726
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:33,060
without charge a legal counsel little
bit worried

727
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:38,710
on got perhaps terrorism bill a 2009
which plans to increase the interment to

728
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:40,390
42 day

729
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:44,060
the 42-day in a jail no access full all

730
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:47,720
now charges ball a very tempted packed

731
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:52,390
before to get we've also got such good
folks at the pollution Justice Act 2006

732
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:53,170
which

733
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:57,790
I quote a person is guilty of an offence
few supplies office to supply

734
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:00,980
any article believing but

735
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:05,530
it is likely to be used to commit also
assist in the commission of an offence

736
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:09,380
basically if you Roy sports and each

737
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,440
used your guilty of an offence

738
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:15,710
duck cue to misuse also

739
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:18,980
that's gonna help research UK's don't
really chinaman

740
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:22,060
now sign

741
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:25,470
we got really increasing surveillance
state UK

742
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:30,780
got a nap increasing array of walls
we've also apparently built terrorists

743
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,520
so also lawlz lots of violence

744
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,730
we still have to earth now

745
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:41,270
interest in russia you can no longer buy
a prepaid sim

746
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:45,760
help because they could be used by
terrorists this being debated in the US

747
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,880
and if that happens in the US it
developed by that Picard said

748
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,520
welcome to the UK and you have probably
two groups

749
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,660
this is this on for using above right

750
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:00,550
2007 fosler a got hoped-for

751
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:03,690
patch from zones propose

752
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:06,790
users wanting to access the internet
globally

753
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:11,780
could be required to use a biometric
scanner before continuing

754
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:14,990
okay you're not insane

755
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:18,640
Anna now these mechanisms

756
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,300
may indicate soul up the threat of
terrorism

757
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:26,030
the obviously thought to hold back
either be useful

758
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:29,800
officially enough you have to buy a much
clearer dance party to step up before

759
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,510
you can use it

760
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:35,099
us not gonna be used for any other
purposes Hollister

761
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:38,420
but personally almost editors

762
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,810
when it comes to light computer-related
attacked

763
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:46,410
on I'm also not avatar those immediate
ripples

764
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:49,670
while I am genuinely terrified of

765
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:52,680
ill-informed knee-jerk reactions to it

766
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:56,990
and my thing is if you actually give a
fuck about secured a

767
00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:00,359
important there's define rips you can
only

768
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:04,109
dude up once you remove the political
and social engineer sociological

769
00:47:04,109 --> 00:47:04,859
engineering

770
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:09,290
and all the agenda the guy with the day
now

771
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:12,650
I've got no problem with people arguing
