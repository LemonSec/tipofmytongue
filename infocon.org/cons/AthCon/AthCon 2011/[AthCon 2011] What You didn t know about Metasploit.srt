1
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,370
good morning everyone

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,190
my name is william marcus and going to
talk about

3
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,100
Metasploit to to love the talk this what
you do you know about Mitt this

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,000
have i think is very funny that the only
word that I understood from the previous

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,859
stockist Metasploit

6
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:28,490
aka the hand Microsoft

7
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:32,599
in that the two works basically for so i
i think it was very fun

8
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:36,530
but let me talk let me tell you why are
I'm talking about this

9
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,530
few months ago over San

10
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,210
developing some some orders for
Metasploit particularly for

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,300
exploiting secure injection
vulnerabilities through Metasploit

12
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,649
and turn and to I started discovering
the framework

13
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:55,070
i think is her quiet undervalued I think
a

14
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,870
people think I'm nervous but it just for
exploiting our remote open everything

15
00:00:58,870 --> 00:00:59,719
going show

16
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:03,809
so hours to learning more and more about
the framework and I didn't

17
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,770
II really really like it I thought it
was awesome and I was talking to my

18
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,390
fellow

19
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:13,159
pen tester colleagues and I was talking
to them saying well

20
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:16,900
do you know that you can do this with
Metasploit and we're saying had no clue

21
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:21,170
and again and again on an iPhone I think
that people only understand like

22
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,009
maybe 10-20 percent of what you can do
with Metasploit I thought and this

23
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,210
can be a fairly good opportunity to
discover a bit more about the framework

24
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,270
on basically I

25
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,290
arm a I i'm approach this Dhaka

26
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,630
in three parts basically I'm going to
talk a little bit about the framework as

27
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:41,140
such

28
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,340
a I some I discovered that her the more
you learn about

29
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,479
hold architecture in the framework is is
developed

30
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:53,920
the the more you can get from its growth
and the the better you understand them

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,540
how it works so we're going to talk a
little bit about that and then

32
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,469
we are going to talk about how to use
Metasploit for exploitation

33
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:06,979
for pasta exploitation and that kind of
stuff and privilege escalation that kind

34
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:07,390
of thing

35
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,599
and then will focus a little bit on

36
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:13,770
the development on ultimate station that
you can

37
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,129
you can do with Metasploit so well let's
crack on with the first part of the talk

38
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:18,610
then

39
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,879
so in well

40
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,340
we're going to to talk a little bit of
for Metasploit history of it and they're

41
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,940
Architektur okay let me actually ask
your question

42
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,019
who is familiar with Metasploit who just
said

43
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:37,330
ok everyday your from went off

44
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,769
it's a very very well known to a most of
the

45
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:44,120
and prestigious it every day but the
thing is that people think that

46
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,250
Metasploit this

47
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,260
this just I am too soon exploits

48
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,500
setting a host setting up a load exploit
and thats a tan

49
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,260
people think that that is like but met
us produce about an actual is not

50
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,750
arm is much more than that I'm

51
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,129
methods produce a framework arm just for

52
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:08,489
developing exploits Justin exploit well

53
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:12,090
obviously execution exploit code is so
focused on

54
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,519
arm and it's interesting professionals
well

55
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,239
and term it can be yours for shellcode
development

56
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,530
center for never to research okay so

57
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,909
thus a lotta arm of things from it I'm

58
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:30,830
it's free it is open source arm

59
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,080
it is the fact so from tablet
exploitation

60
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,319
framework so so basically when someone
wants to split something nowadays

61
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:43,930
Jesus Metasploit is survived fairly
reliable

62
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,480
very well maintained and is a text and

63
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,299
and has lots of vulnerabilities and
payloads

64
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,709
at the time of writing has like seven
hundred and

65
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,840
8 explodes and 248 a lot switches from

66
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,540
well quite a lot this is a little bit
the history of

67
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,000
Metasploit some was developed

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,120
first Russian bites her HD Moore

69
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,980
biking 2003 the

70
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,900
first person in the second person were
written in Perl

71
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,620
and term new new exploits have united
two sons

72
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,310
first mission her quite horrible

73
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:30,820
front-end text bays I only ate explodes
from it

74
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,410
right a but from then on it to and 10

75
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:40,630
invasion 2.7 the world ready three use
interfaces and more than 150 exploits

76
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,240
and tuned version 3 it was her up

77
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,759
well a was retreating completely unit
improving

78
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,370
and they were so fairly and dramatic
change from the framework

79
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,540
okay well just for the record in the
21st of Dover

80
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,759
2009 profit 7 acquire

81
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,860
Metasploit project but I'm they said
that they are going to

82
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,880
tomb it is going to remain free

83
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,150
an open-source just well

84
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,039
I thought it was quite interesting this
is the first the coach the more

85
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:17,419
email that he sent to security list

86
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:20,840
when he released her first version of
Metasploit

87
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,389
as you can see this on the 8 explodes
and to

88
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:27,910
it was version 1.0 I'm in Britain in

89
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:33,500
impel at the time I thought it was
critical

90
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,979
but open to talk a little bit about the
architecture

91
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:40,699
some on as a Service

92
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:45,430
I'm fairmont have differences between
version 3 on the previous questions

93
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,620
I'm going to focus on question 3 which
is there the current one

94
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,100
its arm is written in Group B

95
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,210
um it well sir and

96
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,870
therefore its multiplatform so you can
prevent the spread pretty much in

97
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,770
ever single Architektur from which can
drum

98
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,960
grouping arm

99
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,380
so well obviously all the major a very
consistent son also

100
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,960
mobile devices you can't run that this
pro pretty much in

101
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,120
almost everything is very modular

102
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,419
antis his friendly well implemented

103
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:24,509
says very easy to extended some

104
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:28,669
is very very soon to write a new model
to extend the functionality of the

105
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:29,639
console

106
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,340
or um or anything like that get and turn

107
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,800
has no dependence is so you don't need
any external

108
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,160
library support from Group B everything
is

109
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,759
very much self-contained within their
Metasploit Framework

110
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,949
the disarm a graph of of the architect
Sir

111
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:52,970
so so basically in and

112
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,139
I'll we have for some common libraries

113
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:59,479
from which implement pretty much

114
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:02,880
in all the circuits handling

115
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,280
lot of leverage for exploitation such a
sitter and then we have the models

116
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,979
that I'm access those libraries okay

117
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:17,039
we have interfaces behalf tools
compliance let's focus a little bit

118
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,050
arm on the library's the

119
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:23,860
assessor you really well at the sanct

120
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,300
and they encourage some for yourself
coat so

121
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,190
so you can't use the same coat for many
explosive do that with

122
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:36,550
rubin nixon's from which is a prequel
technology basically

123
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,870
it is modular and to

124
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,770
good thing is that the just normal Ruby
library so if you can if you want to

125
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,139
write an exploit

126
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:49,479
but you don't want to implement a modal

127
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:53,870
in the the matrix pro from work you can
just is the libraries on your

128
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:59,060
on your own ruby script and you can use
all the technology and everything

129
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,560
within the framework but you don't have
to use the framework

130
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,690
just use the library's

131
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,729
arm brief

132
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:13,220
look to in to sum up the libraries that
this is the low west

133
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,520
the level of the library the Rex /url
every

134
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,090
Ruby extension and ivory and basically

135
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,139
it it includes all the soccer subsystem

136
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,520
the all the protocols just to buy this

137
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,830
meant by the framework locking on some
other explanation utility classes

138
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,810
assert researcher and it has no
dependencies

139
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,820
but at now they're in SF core

140
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,500
and that well if you're familiar with
Export Development

141
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,529
but it's one of the levers that usually
include on your exploits

142
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:52,019
an it isa well interacts with the

143
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,029
exploit models sessions and the plugins

144
00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:58,230
okay and within the in

145
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,370
from where labor is the lowest level
okay and

146
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,959
disobeys this a proper over the

147
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,480
MSF core laboring

148
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,630
arm all the interfaces uses and myself

149
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,660
base and and usually when you write an
exploit you

150
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,690
almost all of the or other fractions

151
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,810
are RM and the South Bay slavery

152
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,550
okay now this is

153
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:30,160
all the models own on that this boat so
this is when you use a

154
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,810
the and thus have consul that is what
you see on the payload something

155
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,320
explodes think oh those than ups and
their

156
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,339
ok caesarean mmm models

157
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:48,050
will will survive but to look maybe
afterwards

158
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:52,570
I'm the framework obviously you need to
access somehow

159
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:57,440
and that is that user interfaces the
same number of interfaces

160
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,950
some of them text based on some of them

161
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:05,050
a report based on group-based will have
a look later

162
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:09,170
that this is just from the architecture
interview in

163
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,610
no the framework comes with a number of
tools

164
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,450
for a well obviously on a number of
purposes

165
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,110
for and explode development for

166
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,660
making your life is here for automation
et cetera et cetera

167
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:28,250
and turned those usually talk at the Rec
slavery

168
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,300
and the black n sour than not like

169
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,140
more deals basically it also decided to
extend

170
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:40,810
their functionality of of the in the
South Bay so the consul for example

171
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,990
after now

172
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,760
but some this is compatible with all
that let's talk about

173
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,820
act actual use of Metasploit there

174
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,079
so we will go through the interfaces
exploitation

175
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:58,540
web exploitation going to pasta
exploitation

176
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,310
now from

177
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:06,190
a so we're saying the same number of
ways of accessing that this product

178
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,579
and the body interface a.m. just two

179
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:12,870
be very common in previous versions but
now

180
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:17,130
since version 3.3 that interface has
been removed

181
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,660
and is not longer maintained from

182
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,769
now the from work that now has a

183
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:27,170
well you can understand the web
interface may be a

184
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:30,529
be in like a collaborative were in

185
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:34,079
I'm infrastructure whereby you have your

186
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,720
Metasploit

187
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,670
host and then lots of people accessing
it through the web now

188
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:44,350
and Middlesbrough developed pretty
interesting way of doing that basically

189
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,340
they developed

190
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,370
there what they called MSF RPC the

191
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,090
which is specifically a and RPC the
moment from

192
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:55,960
that you can set on on a host and you
can access to it

193
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,350
remotely basically doing RPC calls

194
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:03,830
okay most of the crew is interfaces used
his demon

195
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:08,010
to access to them the framework but
obviously

196
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,050
to anyone can can you said share

197
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,130
it'd it from allow suffocation as well
so

198
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,550
so you might as well if you have been
testing company you might have

199
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,950
your Metasploit host with

200
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,480
RPC calls and then you can how to make
your processes Patricia to K

201
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,570
and to the same number of interfaces
there

202
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,930
which come with the framework this is
and what they call

203
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:37,820
MSF going arm BetUS

204
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,070
but OK actually have to say known of the
graphical interfaces

205
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:45,360
are perfectly match your arm and

206
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,380
in my opinion the best way of use in
Middlesbrough that

207
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,920
the normal MSF console which is because
we're

208
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,630
must first use but we're going to face a
Sarah Kate this one is fine

209
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:02,430
um you can discount costs and it gives
to the open abilities

210
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,480
the you can choose arm

211
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,910
certain exploit then choose the target

212
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:15,020
the the fields have most of the details
that you've run exploit and

213
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,110
and you get for example russia along
within them

214
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:22,090
going to face I guess a for people with

215
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:26,510
less experience having a queen to face
can be quite interesting

216
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:31,160
and this is probably the best I'm going
to face is called

217
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,740
arm touch and term and

218
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,540
it is quite nice here it implements a
console

219
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,790
at the bottom and a graphical interface
I'm

220
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,410
once you go through with your discovery
process

221
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:49,210
and Alta hosts will be included

222
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,420
in the top I'm right side

223
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,010
I'm when you compromise to host it
appears in Press

224
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,920
seen the movie is and to

225
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,140
I'm from there you can well keep I'm

226
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,760
working your your way to other networks
and stuff so

227
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,870
it kinda makes things is here in that
way

228
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,230
and this is how you act like basically

229
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:18,670
you get I'm I'm to set a target

230
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,650
and an exploit and and you want it in

231
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:29,650
friendly graphical way well I guess you
are all familiar with the

232
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,410
MSF consul this is just term

233
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,980
what I guess most other people deuces

234
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,720
I'm his son normal client

235
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,710
text-based with with a friend a good
interface

236
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:50,760
to know if you're familiar with

237
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,530
in SF client and one their

238
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,680
few people there but this has

239
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,250
a.m. and this is a client

240
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:06,310
that actually uses I'm comin ninth

241
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:10,210
just pacify mister try and to specify

242
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,930
that exploit that you want to to use

243
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,160
to specify all juror arguments

244
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,280
which will be your remote host the

245
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:25,270
80 that you want to use a successor to a
and then use a cute

246
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,890
well that that explode without pay

247
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,270
love basically everything is is dumb in
common 9

248
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,520
so it requires no interaction from the
user

249
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,670
which is really cute if you want to

250
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:42,640
script attacks done it to enter anything

251
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,370
just provide all the parameters in the
common 9 K

252
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,740
so

253
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,610
so we have an example here to know if
you can read it basically

254
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,050
arm with specified

255
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:01,200
there and the surf client the exploit
that we want to run

256
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,630
the remote host we want to attack okay

257
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,710
the payload we want to use and then the
TPS

258
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:12,030
these X execute a.m. the Paleo

259
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,490
so basically what it does did it to
secure its

260
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:21,090
term the console with all the with all
the arguments I would provide it

261
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:26,710
the two starters the handler for them
for the able to execute

262
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:30,690
and to basically to secure its the they
explode

263
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,700
and provides for us the show which is
the payload that we are specified

264
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,780
okay so as you can see there's no
interaction in person

265
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:42,560
just execute that affect now

266
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,350
obviously a big part of

267
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,380
Metasploit is exploitation impost

268
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:54,420
exploitation arm thus

269
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,140
yeah more than 700 experts at the moment
and

270
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,620
though sir written most oven remote
exploits

271
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,240
and some of them local explodes okay a

272
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,600
because all of us are very familiar with
the

273
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,100
promote exploitation okay and but

274
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,100
where we are going to cover cure some
some of the cases and

275
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,820
we're going to talk a little bit as well
above the payload switches

276
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,990
again one of the things that a a chain
make met %uh Sproat

277
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,650
fairly powerful and we're going to talk
a little bit about the client-side

278
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,750
exploitation which is something to
produce not

279
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,870
dot com well not a very mmm

280
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,970
that many people use it K well

281
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,190
remote exploitation is

282
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:47,530
surf well for this simple with
Metasploit is basically

283
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,690
to send exploit that you want to use

284
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,350
to send a target

285
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:58,380
to sing the Paleo the p-values the code
that you want to secure

286
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:03,120
once you gain axis of code execution
angel target

287
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,990
okay and then test this wrote it is a
simple ass

288
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,420
with you you see here in in this and

289
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:15,290
screenshot so basically here which whose

290
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:18,500
which is you're an exploit with the
comment use

291
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,640
okay for the simple and then we set

292
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,910
a number of fireballs basically we set
the remote host that we want to attack

293
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:30,890
okay the page note that we want to use
in this case is

294
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,020
just chill bind it to a port

295
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,210
okay and then we s proteasome basically

296
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:42,360
at the framework well in this case it's
that the comparability

297
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,740
it nu-derm axis is the host on port 135

298
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,910
sense exploit and opens the session

299
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:53,760
can't as a consist from a simple like us

300
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,960
that's what we all familiar with okay

301
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,170
now I'm

302
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,900
some other interesting facts about mitt
this broad is that it allows you as well

303
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,210
local exploitation by local i mean what
you can do is

304
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:13,260
you can from exploit a remote host

305
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,940
and maybe you are not getting enough
privileges

306
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,770
maybe judges in it through sequel
injection

307
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:26,040
her family the permissions of the web
server something that

308
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,160
I'm well Metasploit allows you

309
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,920
to and to privilege escalation

310
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,440
I'm exploitation on the remote host

311
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,570
use in a look i'm for nobility on the
remote host

312
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,910
okay for doing that obviously

313
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,640
first thing you need to do is to gain
some kind of access on the host

314
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,180
and after that what you do is

315
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,960
you sent this local exploit channeling
it through

316
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,670
your from at exploited host

317
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:01,690
okay determine it's a fairly simple
process basically

318
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,650
what you have to do is have to run meant
to protect will

319
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:09,180
speak about that later and and then

320
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,500
this and is basically about Justin 10
the

321
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,660
post prospects professional Windows
escalation vulnerabilities

322
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,720
okay it's a simple as that just exploit

323
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,760
and then just said assertion where

324
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,920
you have your meant to protect

325
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,420
draining okay and and you just exploited
and you can

326
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:36,290
and for the privileges and basically you
you to a privilege escalation

327
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:40,060
okay now this

328
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:43,930
I'm Augusta promote expedition this

329
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:48,270
what we all too but a first few
interesting things

330
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:54,410
and one of them is I'm out upon a time
if you're familiar with this

331
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:59,190
basically im what you can do with this
is Justin script

332
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:03,960
around some of the functionality of
Metasploit

333
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,770
arm this script what it is.

334
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:11,060
you need a some and database support

335
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,210
okay so in and the framework

336
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:17,290
comes with support with to

337
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:21,940
might sickle database some progress
circle that there was an sequel light

338
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,310
okay so so once you set up that

339
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:29,380
have some other functionality okay
within the framework

340
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,840
and you can't and you can for example

341
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,360
scan some hosts and everything will be
recorded and the poor and open port to

342
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,220
such a sitter would be recorded under
the Tories

343
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,090
and then what you can do is you can't
use and

344
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:48,150
DB out upon to try every single that

345
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:52,110
exploit on ever seen well much in

346
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:56,020
South import and then on all the hosts

347
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,280
but you want again

348
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,120
in an automatic way so you don't have to
launch anything and exploded just

349
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,280
do their out upon

350
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,670
script okay so

351
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:15,570
and this is a very quick example so the
first thing you have to do is to

352
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:18,580
you need to import the hosts into

353
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,730
let us pray that a number of ways of
doing that

354
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,960
so so normal in a in a pen test

355
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,790
you boots for you would have to run and
map

356
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:32,050
and clearly you have the results on

357
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:36,310
X have fired you can import that file
you can import

358
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:39,890
from all sort of all the fires like a
map

359
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:43,230
finds you can import Nessus scams

360
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,950
arm you can import even Qualis askance

361
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,790
okay into into into Middlesbrough

362
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:54,380
so in the example and to have here

363
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,190
actually I chose to Brian and map from
within Metasploit

364
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:04,010
is basically is calling your your ex
then a landmark on your system basically

365
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:07,810
okay so you too DB and map

366
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:12,460
and then whatever from arguments you
want to pass

367
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,600
too and miss you can score scan the
whole range or

368
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,060
whatever in this case as in this case
had just a scant one

369
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:23,000
host okay with a number of boats open to
hear

370
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,750
so on the results from here are

371
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:30,510
a.m. a recorder stored within

372
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,740
within from Metasploit okay

373
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,930
and the framework with know that this
one active host

374
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,140
with a number of ports opened okay

375
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,380
and then and what it will do is

376
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,630
it will from against Port

377
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:50,100
eighty every single exploit

378
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,410
whose arm default port SAT

379
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:57,110
it will try and on port 135 139 and 445

380
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:00,470
every single exploit you know with that

381
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:05,440
default port okay basically in this a
specific case

382
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,780
and taking into account that there's

383
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,850
firmament of open ports I'm

384
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,929
Metasploit I'm found one hundred and

385
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:19,570
89 potential explodes obviously

386
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:22,760
um well lot of them wouldn't work

387
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,200
okay because that a specific host
wouldn't be for noble

388
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,070
to to that I'm to that exploits for
example

389
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,870
import eighty it will try lots of
experts for technologies which were not

390
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:38,500
installed on the I'm on the host so

391
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:42,640
the script actually the sand to any
enumeration of the Services or anything

392
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,260
just based on the port

393
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,750
it would launch everything okay but
we're

394
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:52,220
basically just with one comment which is
TV out upon

395
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,640
at the speeches so that it matters by
the port

396
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,720
and us the is exploitation it will
launch automatically one from the San

397
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,730
I'm 89 explodes and well

398
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:08,429
sorry and to pfeiffer them were
successful so we were

399
00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:11,490
we found that we could compromise that
particular

400
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:17,920
host five different ways okay

401
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:21,470
now was a compromise to host

402
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:25,210
I'm you can you can choose what kind of

403
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:29,840
cold you want Middlesbrough to run on it
which is basically the payload

404
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,450
okay from

405
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,670
this well in the framework this 3

406
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:40,200
different different payloads on

407
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,260
this I'm what they called single payload
okay

408
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,280
States payload and the stator basically
a single payload

409
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,510
just just a self-contained piece of code

410
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,970
that handles a communication okay

411
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,980
back to the from to the attacker

412
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:03,450
okay and it handles whatever code you
want to a secure so

413
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:07,570
you don't need to run in the finance
just self-contained

414
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:12,429
single payload okay

415
00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:17,090
now sometimes when exploiting a host

416
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:20,390
we have some size constraints so

417
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,760
single payload depending on the coat
that you went

418
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,640
you want to secure but in general terms
his family beak

419
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,920
and sometimes we can not run a single I
loved

420
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,570
against host okay so to sometimes

421
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:37,720
what we need to do is to to send

422
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,730
what is called a stator which is a tiny

423
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:44,980
one small piece of code for exploiting
that

424
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:49,500
and then that a state to will get back
to us to the attacker and then we will

425
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,380
send

426
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:55,460
another another piece of code okay that
is what this call to stretch payload

427
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,550
okay the state's payload

428
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,560
this commission independent because that
the connection

429
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,090
side of exploitation will be handled by
the stator

430
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:09,510
okay and and basically

431
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:13,790
when we do use States payload we fest
sent the stator

432
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:17,750
and then the stator communiques two
hours would send the other spoke but

433
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,100
everything

434
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:23,210
is handled by the framework okay we
don't have to

435
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,470
to care about that okay

436
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,540
and the stators when the

437
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,770
the piece of coal that a.m. data

438
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:37,000
lose that exploit and the state's
basically us

439
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,669
it does hello how they explode would
communicate

440
00:27:40,669 --> 00:27:44,050
account on

441
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:47,669
disarm at the moment this 248

442
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:52,240
payloads which are a lot from obviously
the paid notice:

443
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,980
surface of cold and is dependent on the
operating system

444
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,429
and architecture and this famine tough

445
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:04,970
and as well the technology at this fair
amount of

446
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,530
of I'm to

447
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:11,980
branch of by lots to choose from I'm it
covers

448
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:15,169
home were most of the

449
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:18,540
operating systems and

450
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,679
it even France on I funds for this this

451
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,300
they notes for getting a shell on an
iPhone but this

452
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,740
obviously for Windows Unix Linux

453
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:33,120
macaws Sutra Sutra and four different
architectures as well

454
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,500
okay so runs from 32 bits and 68

455
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:41,110
answers before arm and architecture is a
treasure trove

456
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:44,310
now this is becoming more common to

457
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:48,090
half payloads grain on on different

458
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,850
and technologists an architect just like
a job and JSP

459
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:55,870
PHP or ESPN and term

460
00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:00,210
I'll the actually the matter predator

461
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:03,580
let us pray has been ported to PHP and
ASP

462
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,790
K and that's another thing in

463
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:11,950
in maybe a cure a couple of years ago

464
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,330
the wearer number of models implemented
on Metasploit

465
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,919
which were exploiting West dreyfus

466
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:23,770
know when you spoke that the expedition
techniques are slightly different

467
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:27,900
because you're tryin on kernel mode
instead of you sir

468
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,760
you sir land okay i'm for doing that

469
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,890
the Metasploit guys developed a proper

470
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:38,070
for can a mod payload

471
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,980
which has interesting interesting
approach because you can ground

472
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,440
on that your cell and announced that a
system with a sprite

473
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,060
on Kernan in Okanagan abilities

474
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:54,250
can I learned from her abilities and

475
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,620
the server well the basic handles I'm

476
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:01,530
that you can set up on on a payload I'm

477
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:04,620
so so when you're spoilt

478
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:08,230
a vulnerability you can choose whether
dupont to

479
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,850
have to access to a paid adult through
the network

480
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:15,750
and different way right so for example
took away so

481
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:19,160
bind your pedal to our to our

482
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:24,470
outlook import on the on the host okay

483
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:28,320
obviously this herself and some
disadvantages

484
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,750
if you're fired if you have a firewall
between you and your

485
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:35,300
target truly that 50 will be filtering

486
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,340
must've the connection so this paleo

487
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,000
would not work usually what you can do
is you can do our very first

488
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,520
a.m. this the payload comment back to
you

489
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,020
okay which in generalists network from
tunis less restrictive

490
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,090
okay and term

491
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:57,070
the sermon some other interesting
payloads that people don't usually do so

492
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,900
for example what they called reverse

493
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:02,720
had to peel passive X

494
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,250
in a very restrictive environment you
might find that this

495
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:11,600
absolutely no way that you can establish
a connection between your compromised

496
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,660
machine

497
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,919
and the host okay in might be because

498
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,950
thus no such access may be that much in
is only

499
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:23,210
may be accessing the Internet through a
proxy or something like that

500
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:27,510
in this case you can just put this call
the specifics

501
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:31,090
payload which is actually an ActiveX
that your sis

502
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:34,320
I'm Internet Explorer settings

503
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,190
to load on activists and two channel

504
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:42,100
and exploit using its be traffic back to
you

505
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,280
Tucson very interesting way a

506
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,300
also and there it's what is called her

507
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,679
Reeve St City all boats which again so

508
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:56,150
very interesting approach I'm when you
compromise to host

509
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:59,350
you might not know what kind of I'm

510
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:03,690
outbound traffic restrictions are so
displayed old

511
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,900
tries every single port back to you

512
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,770
and basically the first part of the
exploitation the stator

513
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:14,410
and receives and number of the port and
then

514
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:18,010
did tries to commit connect back on that
port

515
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:21,770
okay you're a fucking machine will be
listening on

516
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:25,350
each boat and trying to to get the child
back

517
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:28,870
to on well must've

518
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,880
all of this boat although the bailouts
also

519
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,960
from support IP version 6

520
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,900
for for listen and targeting

521
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:44,730
okay now so once you have the exploded
have the handle

522
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:48,210
you just basically what is the type

523
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:52,610
of experts so

524
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:55,650
when did kisses her personal preference

525
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:58,990
right but usually

526
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:02,720
more people tourist get a child on the
books or

527
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,120
depending you can added you sir as well

528
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,330
if those sites restrictions you might
not be able to secure

529
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:13,400
some payloads for example adding
adjusters

530
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,230
time X tiny shellcode so you may need to
choose their

531
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:21,100
but will this other stuff like
downloading a file on this acute in it

532
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:25,190
executing arm a specific comment witches
and operating system

533
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:29,240
okay I'm many of the

534
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,020
people's use technique very well-known

535
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:38,630
and exploit a technique called perfect
no DLL injection so for example

536
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:41,780
VNC injection the matter producers that
okay

537
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:45,030
which means that you can inject an
obituary

538
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:49,020
dealer I'm on the exploited process

539
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:52,050
okay I'm so I'm

540
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:55,900
Middlesbrough comes with a number of
dealers like VNC on interpreter but you

541
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,290
can call your own

542
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:00,300
and you can choose you can set up

543
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:04,830
Metasploit to inject that the lol into
the exploitive process

544
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:08,210
okay a serb a lot like uploading

545
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:14,230
a binary and then executing okay

546
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:19,069
now this also in Metasploit some

547
00:34:19,069 --> 00:34:22,680
trying inside exploitation from

548
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:26,710
just obviously becoming more and more
common ripeness

549
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:30,730
lot of corporations put quite a lot of a
fort into protecting the

550
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:34,290
external interface but sometimes the

551
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:38,230
the forget about the workstations

552
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,390
okay so this a number of exploits for

553
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:44,620
protein office some PDF files

554
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:48,460
and also obviously the web browser okay
from

555
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:52,830
enough and you can execute whatever
payload supported by the Metasploit

556
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:56,750
okay so on

557
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:00,560
I found well intend to spend two
interesting

558
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,609
for approaches to

559
00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:07,780
to file back door in well or or
client-side exploitation

560
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:12,220
from that I found him quite effective
actually

561
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,270
and the first one is the PDF back
Taurean summit this product can

562
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:19,300
in bed any payload

563
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,940
into a PDF file okay depending on the
person you can

564
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:28,050
will it be a secure it automatically we
were born that you sir in late this

565
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:28,780
person

566
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,750
it might the security policy might be
configured not to secure the

567
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,950
let me show you what I'm talking about
basically

568
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:42,950
so let's see

569
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:55,820
so we have been here

570
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,640
so we have fun or mint PDF file in seara
care which is just that you're so kind

571
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,140
so

572
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:03,740
for of Metasploit but I'm sure you all

573
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:07,330
afraid some point and

574
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:10,430
so what we're going to do we are going
to create an

575
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:13,460
a version of this PDF fire

576
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,980
with the pay you know them better on it
right so we have Metasploit

577
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:24,980
the in SF console running here me just
copy and paste this

578
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,070
the research unexploded which is

579
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:36,360
from a dope PDF embedded Excel

580
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:41,290
right you to have fun

581
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:46,920
most map

582
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,300
so we're to them which is some
interpreter

583
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:57,300
and reverse TCP shellcode can

584
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:08,120
someone for some months month would
really

585
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:15,120
be very glad I would invite a beer to
anyone

586
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,410
thank you

587
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:30,779
so what we're doing here is and us

588
00:37:30,779 --> 00:37:35,009
this is her reverse payload it will come
right back to us so we need to set up

589
00:37:35,009 --> 00:37:35,539
their

590
00:37:35,539 --> 00:37:38,640
local host okay and

591
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,349
so this is our IP address where we will
be listening to

592
00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:46,420
to that payload and then we set out
there basically the

593
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:50,719
the fire that we want to to

594
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:54,579
in to inject it then the Paleo to

595
00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:57,719
and then with just exploited

596
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:00,719
okay so so basically

597
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:03,890
it will generate a file called evil book
pdf

598
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:07,269
okay and no what we're going to do well

599
00:38:07,269 --> 00:38:10,809
through social engineering which send
that file

600
00:38:10,809 --> 00:38:14,349
to their to

601
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:17,459
whatever target we won't okay

602
00:38:17,459 --> 00:38:22,200
which could be by email or downloading
from a website or something like that

603
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,959
it and we will be basically in setting
up a handler

604
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:31,029
to listen to that connection right

605
00:38:31,029 --> 00:38:34,440
so now imagine that we are group

606
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,579
on our victim host

607
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:44,579
can't group

608
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:56,000
so we are in our or victim foster care
with sand

609
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:03,000
this

610
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:06,990
by email okay so basically it would open

611
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:13,460
the fire and we would say well this is
something took the five just

612
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:17,410
click open okay and as we can see the
payload is a secure third

613
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,950
I would care a session on the a

614
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:24,060
on the USS also basically in

615
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:28,830
so we get on a typewriter

616
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:32,030
running through the mediafire can

617
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:35,380
now

618
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:40,920
the sand know the person of that attack
basically would be

619
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,260
back door in a fire on an I thought XE
okay

620
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,690
so Metasploit can in bed

621
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:51,970
any and the payload

622
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:55,980
in in a fire and what you do is

623
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,100
you specify arm

624
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,270
the door X if I let you want to back
door

625
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:05,440
so for example in this case is skulk dot
XE

626
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:12,440
okay summit this probe will create

627
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:19,430
Finacle evil calcd exit and then when
it's a cute nerd

628
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:25,340
when executed you will so we set up the
hand again

629
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:30,090
the user we'll

630
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:36,540
again

631
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,590
in a secured in the final a search and
as well the

632
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:42,790
the matter procession back to us okay

633
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:46,820
so this is our way of back Tauren

634
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,170
find some PDF's okay for client
exploitation

635
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:56,140
now this some other stuff that you can
do from the client-side

636
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,460
with Metasploit okay arm some of it is

637
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,820
you soon a exploits and targeting the
web server

638
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:07,570
okay arm the mean

639
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:10,940
let me show you what a I'm talking about
and it's too

640
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:15,090
well babes who wrote a poem would be
there equivalence of

641
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:19,630
their previous how to pong that try all
the vulnerabilities but this one is only

642
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:23,870
Triumph Bonneville it is within the what
brosser environment

643
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:27,200
okay so to

644
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,000
exit this okay

645
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:38,000
so for president wrote a poem what you
do is

646
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,970
so you've set the path where

647
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:51,540
you will be serving I'm

648
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,830
you would be serbian your

649
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:58,910
payloads okay for Aldo what we're I'm
your web browser

650
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:04,590
for nobility is at and

651
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:09,840
spent to take away and so

652
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:14,590
so and then it now the framework what is
going to do is

653
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:20,099
will create it will check all the web
vulnerabilities affecting web browser

654
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:23,290
so that includes Firefox a includes

655
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:27,359
a and chrome includes Internet Explorer
et cetera et cetera

656
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,440
and what it will do is who will set up a
web server

657
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,260
um which all those when abilities

658
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:37,660
aka and when a victim connects to your

659
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:42,170
from attacking web server will deliver
all the payloads

660
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:46,210
okay whatever whatever the server is so
in this case we r

661
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:49,540
and so we are iDEN nazi-like

662
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,599
job I all the vulnerabilities operon

663
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:55,960
arm so on the panel will it is Safari

664
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,780
and included and framework

665
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,820
will be delivered to to that the King
host up

666
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:09,820
to the victims are said okay and even

667
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,619
so in this case 19 exploit models

668
00:43:14,619 --> 00:43:17,700
surfed on our on our host

669
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:22,109
okay if you wanna feel free to connect
to it

670
00:43:22,109 --> 00:43:29,109
be interesting to get a sender

671
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:33,990
so and now what we have to do is if we
send an email or

672
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:37,369
to old we redirect somehow are a victim

673
00:43:37,369 --> 00:43:40,400
to our a malicious web server right

674
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,330
in this case we receive the connection

675
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:49,170
we take that actually this is when able
to recreate ok jet

676
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:52,740
code execution exploit for it's the
amount okay

677
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:57,070
and turn well the brosser crushes

678
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:00,580
butter it actually created a session
session

679
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:06,099
3 so so we can interact with it

680
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:10,089
and as we can see in so we

681
00:44:10,089 --> 00:44:13,390
in we got our a shell again on the books

682
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:17,609
okay just sent this this client side
expert okay

683
00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:24,609
struggling with the presentation its

684
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,620
sir

685
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,530
okay snow

686
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:37,480
West flirtation typically Metasploit has
been on the target in

687
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,550
a infrastructure testing butter I'm

688
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:44,590
lately it is more common to use it in
the weapon Firemint

689
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:47,700
the song few few

690
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,770
concept that I'm going to explain the
first time

691
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:54,120
is that you can get from

692
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,440
meant to protect her okay and with

693
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,440
working with PHP and ASP so when you

694
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,930
discoverable nobility whereby you can
upload arbitrary contentment maybe to

695
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:06,800
your website

696
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,870
usually what we used to do is just have
a normal web shell with

697
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:13,870
certain functionality but now with have
arm

698
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:17,450
working a typewriter which is actually
I'll

699
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:20,780
it doesn't include on the functionality
of than normal and the

700
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,940
the binary but i think thats quite a lot

701
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:28,650
and well this is the way that we can we
created those fines

702
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:32,560
from from the Peyton Metasploit payload

703
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,820
binary would have it's been a typewriter
reverse

704
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:39,680
okay which had the options and we would
just upload that file to appear it's

705
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,070
been

706
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,630
frost and the same happens with ESPN

707
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:46,980
okay we would do that with the miss have
encode

708
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:50,490
can ones we upload that then

709
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:54,520
with wood just with a pro-civil with a
secured the file I would get them a

710
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,960
two-parter back to our

711
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,750
tour Tech in motion: at so

712
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:03,720
this is an example of it okay and so we
create define

713
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:08,290
okay and we uploaded to the server and

714
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:12,550
and then from a web server will come
from a web browser we visited I would

715
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,290
get them at a protest can't

716
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:18,500
this also some from china tea for
exploiting

717
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,590
remote file inclusion okay so when

718
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:25,140
supply ability: whereby we can execute
any

719
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:28,610
arbitrating pollution okay we can

720
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:31,800
we can do is what it's called the PHP
include

721
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,460
okay and again within a specified any
any payload

722
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,840
and he will be delivered through through
through the

723
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:42,580
it's been closed okay at

724
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:47,290
arm this more more models now for
exploiting sequin just some whenever it

725
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:48,580
is from within matter

726
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:52,490
the framework okay and I coded at proper

727
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:56,710
few months ago for exploiting an asshole
900 for

728
00:46:56,710 --> 00:47:00,040
and use in this and this I'm

729
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:05,050
initially heard works

730
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:09,620
from so so imagine with half

731
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,500
to have a web app

732
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:20,500
group

733
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,980
with her for web up on we identified a
sick will serve upon our ability right

734
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:31,430
so for example retype that with well

735
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:35,320
identified at this an issue here okay
and in this case

736
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,640
within two fire that with a semicolon we
could do

737
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,730
any arbitrary sequel code

738
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:44,730
here okay I'm

739
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:49,590
which cannot be very useful maybe hear
from the South African perspective

740
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:53,730
but it could be very interest in April
12 execute to

741
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:57,340
well exploit the I'm and miss

742
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:02,109
own answers here for for whoever is you
who don't know

743
00:48:02,109 --> 00:48:05,890
I'm not familiar with the vulnerability
a on that exploits

744
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:09,280
and sickle suburban ability in

745
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,450
in this in a French in which is called
repairs right to buyer

746
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:15,500
been okay I wrote this proper

747
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:19,800
for use in its with and sequins action
so that you don't need to

748
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,250
in you don't need to half any

749
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:26,810
any authentication it doesn't require an
authentication

750
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:29,900
okay let me show

751
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,849
how it works so basically we're Tuesday
exploit

752
00:48:33,849 --> 00:48:37,780
okay number twos the host

753
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:42,300
which is winnable to the sequel
injection and with a specified

754
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,470
the sequel injection part

755
00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:52,089
on like so okay so

756
00:48:52,089 --> 00:48:55,770
so Metasploit knows that it needs to SRQ

757
00:48:55,770 --> 00:48:58,830
that cold within this brackets

758
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:02,220
okay was set up there

759
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:05,270
again the under and was set up

760
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:11,460
our local host to listen to their than a
typewriter coming

761
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:17,109
and and basically in

762
00:49:17,109 --> 00:49:21,520
for everything goes okay everything will
be done through sequel injections for

763
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,440
this is not

764
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,980
like infrastructure test in a single
injection a cat

765
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:32,980
descend in the payload hopefully

766
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:47,490
this can be in one of those famous to
more effect

767
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:52,760
that everything goes to run terribly
wrong right it's looking like it

768
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,400
actually

769
00:49:53,400 --> 00:50:00,400
should have worked already

770
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:07,510
well I said that I coated the truck but
actually there was a joke haven't

771
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:10,520
preferred well

772
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:14,740
could be well could be anything really

773
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:21,740
I would say this crack on with the
presentation

774
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:37,030
right well assuming that that worked now
this is one of the most interesting

775
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,760
parts of Metasploit

776
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:44,220
okay and um the pasta exploitation it's
extremely powerful you can do lots of

777
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:44,760
stuff

778
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,210
ones you compromise the host okay lots
lots of stuff that makes our life

779
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:55,070
so much to see okay and some about them
we are very very familiar with it but

780
00:50:55,070 --> 00:51:00,030
arm we can arm make our life very very
soon with its ok

781
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:04,460
one of them is the house stamp so we
don't need to upload BW time to the host

782
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:08,140
okay no we can't just affirmative
protector

783
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:11,580
arm has have having all the houses with
them

784
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:16,310
and after was weak and use the houses
with the yes a sec without even crack in

785
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:16,670
them

786
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:21,250
okay I'm but only if you're familiar
with incognito

787
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:24,280
so really cool too for talking
manipulation so

788
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:28,540
would compromise to host in a local
environment we can jump to that domain

789
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:29,849
administration

790
00:51:29,849 --> 00:51:33,820
you know Justin committed so all the
functionality has been built in

791
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:38,000
within Metasploit okay so we can
impersonate

792
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,930
your sister okay we can a sniff traffic

793
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:46,250
so again once with with half matter
meant to protect run and we can

794
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:49,430
earlier we don't have to upload any a
sniffer weakened just

795
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:53,170
arm a sniff the date and we can even set
up

796
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:56,680
filters us we would do in in any in any

797
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:01,000
sniffer okay this is a very interesting
when this much locker

798
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,060
so imagine that you compromise a host
and

799
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:07,200
you really want the password of that you
sir locked on

800
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,730
okay you cannot cricket you cannot you
to anything so what we would do into

801
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:16,619
in that case didn't work Anissa

802
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:21,510
their under again um

803
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:28,510
show you

804
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:45,930
so let's assume we have so we have from
interpreter running

805
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:51,180
here okay and we won't this guy

806
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:54,420
password okay so what we do is

807
00:52:54,420 --> 00:53:01,420
arm

808
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:07,950
so with two apps smart loca and

809
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:11,400
what this process will do it within
might

810
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,400
rate them at a protest to the Windows
Phone System

811
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,330
ok into the loop we look on process and
what he will do is

812
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:24,470
it will look the screen after a number
of seconds that we are specifying this

813
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:28,200
in this case 10 seconds okay so producer

814
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,670
after 10 seconds of in activity will
have

815
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:34,940
arm the the screen locked okay

816
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:38,830
this with a little bit and so

817
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:42,280
when the the the screen is locked

818
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:45,630
it will run a keylogger it will look at
the

819
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:51,260
in the password and they will show it to
us hopefully your

820
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:58,260
this another them all we will get back
to that

821
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:02,340
okay so well this is an example of that
I'll

822
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:06,290
that running okay basically it grounds
the

823
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:09,730
he is and the keystroke a sniffer and

824
00:54:09,730 --> 00:54:13,180
and then when the juicer looks

825
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:16,650
and sets the password it would show the
password to us so it's a very very

826
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:17,660
interesting way

827
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:23,820
of getting the password of the user okay
would do that and privilege escalation

828
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:26,920
very powerful we can get system level

829
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:31,150
just a number of techniques running out
of time I think

830
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:34,290
and a very very interesting thing is the
p14

831
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:37,400
a system that'll ones with half one

832
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,070
host compromise we come very very
selective compromise another host

833
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:45,240
thus a number of ways of doing this ball
forward in the summer interesting one so

834
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,970
if a compromise victim 1

835
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:50,800
in this case and we went to act as a
victim too but we cannot do it because

836
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,190
the

837
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:55,570
51 is filtering that we can do something
like both forward

838
00:54:55,570 --> 00:54:58,850
I had and then our local port on our
mission

839
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:03,890
and then the remote boat which would be
the remote for that we want to access

840
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:04,400
and the

841
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,950
victim to IP address and in that case it
would create a

842
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:12,240
tunnel okay and we would be accessed
able to access the victim to

843
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,050
okay very powerful Butterwick we can do
that on new

844
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:19,070
for one port in this case would we can
do

845
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:22,280
and more interestingly is to add a new
route to our

846
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:25,380
network routing table okay like

847
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:29,000
you can see it here okay we had our
route and then

848
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,890
every explode will be uprooted depending
on the Bruce OK

849
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:36,700
one thing we can do is to route all the
traffic

850
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,910
and to our target network

851
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:43,550
for example on social 10 from a
typewriter ok and that would allow us to

852
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:44,860
keep exploiting things

853
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:48,640
but that would only work within their
Metasploit

854
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,120
framework so not the other

855
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:55,480
and the other traffic it would not be
routed through Metasploit

856
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,310
which could be very interesting and
that's why we could set up what is

857
00:55:59,310 --> 00:56:00,730
called a SOCKS proxy

858
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:05,520
okay so in this case what we can do is
we can't tell

859
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:09,400
all the traffic through a SOCKS proxy on
a matter for to

860
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,520
version and then do some proxy chains to

861
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:16,710
and to brown and Marple whatever we want

862
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:20,430
so this is this would be an explanation
that occur could could run

863
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:24,910
any comment through this channel just in
a SOCKS proxy

864
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:29,290
okay Michael

865
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:32,800
okay so and and last button class

866
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:37,400
part of this the stock is the
development and not my intention to this

867
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:43,310
it's going to be quickly so we cannot to
meet a number of things here

868
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:46,530
no if we secured in SF console with that
that

869
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:50,290
are and then a script name weak and very
silly coda scripts

870
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:53,930
and for probing so in this case half

871
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:58,330
this very simple example that basically
the scripts all the things that we do

872
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:01,960
just enough I'll and then we can even
include some true be called

873
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:06,060
in there okay so this is an example of
that

874
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:09,800
running so we have secured miss have
console and then

875
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,150
the the 0 comments on fire and

876
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:16,570
does all the exploitation and he is
accused the Ruby code which could be

877
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:17,790
very very interesting

878
00:57:17,790 --> 00:57:21,390
for well for testing an ultimate in the
stuff

879
00:57:21,390 --> 00:57:24,680
okay we can create also scripts

880
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:28,930
forum interpreter very very easily so in
this case we can do for example

881
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:32,220
printer status hello world into hello
world

882
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:36,630
Ruby here and then very sorry we can't
just run it from the matter paternity

883
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:37,650
well as a kid on the

884
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:40,950
on the remote host okay those her

885
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:44,730
this number of tools for hope in ask
exploit development

886
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:48,910
in so this is one for getting opcodes

887
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:53,220
from binary files in this case okay

888
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,930
and again some some tools for exploit
development

889
00:57:56,930 --> 00:58:01,600
I'm so were coming to crack on

890
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,960
um yep its shall generation

891
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,120
and then it is very easy and is very
well documented creatine

892
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:13,120
the and scripts you seen use in their
library so

893
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:17,150
of in SF Bay Rays such or such as what I
was talking about you can

894
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:20,620
just use the library's yourself okay

895
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:24,450
now without having to use them at this
broad framework you can't just

896
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:28,960
use the library's okay

897
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,930
this is how arm exploit model

898
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:36,970
looks like is very very easy to do is
everything is Ruby and you can use all

899
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:38,890
the libraries within the

900
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,980
in exploitation primer okay just a few
conclusions

901
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:46,030
a I would say Metasploit we on the UES
like

902
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:49,860
10-20 percent of what men to scrape and
use a is very easy

903
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,920
use it to extent its to learn at

904
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:56,060
very very powerful post exploitation
features

905
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:59,370
okay and well that's ok thank you very
very much

906
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:02,740
to the Afghan troops it's been fantastic
being here again

907
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:08,890
thank you to the audience and I would
welcome a question

908
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:10,170
quickens thank you
