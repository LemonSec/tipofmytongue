1
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:14,389
- Please welcome to the stage

2
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:18,799
Jamie Williams, principal
adversary emulation engineer.

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,800
- Huh?

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,790
I know that guy.

5
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,150
That's awesome.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,150
(clapping)

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,250
Too kind, too kind, welcome.

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,560
And for many of you welcome back.

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,750
Its been a really long
time since we did this and

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,320
power hour was great, but nothing really

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,890
replaces this atmosphere
coming together as a community.

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,780
We've been here for a little over an hour

13
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,050
and it's already amazing
just catching up with folks

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,250
and meeting new people
and really like cherishing

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,070
this ATT&CK community.

16
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,690
So I actually had one job now
and I'm not gonna goof it,

17
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,989
and my one job was to not talk too much.

18
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:53,760
So with that, I'm gonna
introduce our actual masters.

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,070
- For a safer world.

20
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,350
Through our private public
private partnerships

21
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,630
and federally funded research

22
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,420
and development centers work
across government and with

23
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,110
industries to tackle some of
the world's biggest problems.

24
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,610
So we were here two and a half years ago

25
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:17,109
and this was the last slide
of, of ATT&CK Con 2.0.

26
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:20,509
Little did we know.

27
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:23,869
So it's been a long time
since then obviously,

28
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:26,189
trying to keep things together.

29
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,359
As Jamie just mentioned, we
did do a virtual conference

30
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,109
at the end of 2020, ATT&CKcon Power Hour,

31
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:36,649
trying to keep the community,
bring things together.

32
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:40,509
So we've continued to keep
our outreach going through

33
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:42,740
all the different channels
that we've been able to

34
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,689
find whether it's our external Slack

35
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:49,758
that has now over 2,000 people in it.

36
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,670
Getting out to people on Twitter,

37
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:57,889
which we added something
extra over the COVID break.

38
00:01:57,889 --> 00:02:02,779
Getting 10,000 of you in
for ATT&CKcon Power Hour.

39
00:02:02,779 --> 00:02:04,750
So we have more than 5,000 of you

40
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,289
registered virtually today.

41
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:09,280
Obviously there's about
125 of you in the room.

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,030
So thinned out due to COVID
but we're trying to get

43
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,760
information out to as
many of you as possible.

44
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,109
You're also really an international bunch.

45
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,720
So on Friday I was looking at
Attack.MITRE.org website stats

46
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,980
and I discovered that we
had visits in the past month

47
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:34,000
from every continent and every
country that Google tracked,

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,100
except for North Korea, okay, and Iceland.

49
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,870
So we don't know what we did to Iceland

50
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,270
but whatever it was, we're sorry.

51
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,590
So while we've been trying
to keep our communication

52
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,890
paths open, get information
out, we really rely

53
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,869
upon the community for
everything that it is you do.

54
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:03,320
And so the bulk of the
presentations, books, training,

55
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,269
everything else that's
out there around ATT&CK,

56
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,700
is created by you.

57
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,399
And so thank you.

58
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,100
And we're looking to keep that coming.

59
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,680
So little bit of information
on the conference,

60
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,370
and it's gonna be slightly tough

61
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,810
cause the confidence
monitor isn't working.

62
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,820
But so for submissions, we
had our first submission come

63
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,920
in just 18 hours after the CFP opened.

64
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,049
So, one of you was really rearing to go

65
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,210
and a fairly traditional conference stat,

66
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:43,150
our last submission was 69
seconds before the CFP closed.

67
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,860
And the bulk of our submissions,

68
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,319
more than half of them actually,
came in the last two days.

69
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:49,230
So this is also an international group.

70
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,649
It's also a group of procrastinators.

71
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,340
We saw 16 countries
represented in our CFP.

72
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,319
Now this is lower than usual because we're

73
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,630
asking speakers to travel, thank you.

74
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,790
And so it's a smaller number
but it's still a lot of you

75
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,109
coming from a lot of places to potentially

76
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,990
talk about ATT&CK.

77
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:13,370
So our acceptance stats.

78
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,510
So I don't know how many of you know

79
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:16,589
how we actually handle ATT&CKcon,

80
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,068
we run it like a traditional
conference though.

81
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:21,470
We have a six person program
committee who is starting

82
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,819
out by reviewing all of
the submissions blind.

83
00:04:24,819 --> 00:04:27,100
That is, the program committee
doesn't know what company

84
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,650
or what person submitted them.

85
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,878
So the first score that's coming in is

86
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:34,020
just based on the content.

87
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,650
We get together, we unbind the reviews,

88
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,919
and we choose the speakers
that you'll be seeing

89
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,870
over the next two days
as a program committee.

90
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,810
We're also a pretty selective conference.

91
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,740
So this year we had a 24% acceptance rate.

92
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,810
So the talks you're gonna be
seeing over the next two days

93
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,680
are drawn down from that space.

94
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,749
Now you're gonna unfortunately,
or fortunately see a lot

95
00:04:59,749 --> 00:05:03,319
of me the next two
days, but there is a lot

96
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,889
of people standing behind
me on the ATT&CK team.

97
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,569
We have over 40 MITRE staff
members who are supporting

98
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:12,210
ATT&CK in some way, as well as the

99
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,960
growing external community.

100
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,210
I wanted to recognize a few of them,

101
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,870
get them to wave if they're in the room

102
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,830
and talk a little bit about the areas

103
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,688
that we break ATT&CK up into.

104
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:27,560
First off is ATT&CK for Enterprise.

105
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,979
This is the framework that
most of you probably know

106
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:33,370
if you know ATT&CK.

107
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,319
It's Windows, Mac,
Linux, Cloud, et cetera.

108
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:42,630
And that's run by my
Co-MC, Jamie Williams.

109
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,020
(clapping)

110
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,990
So we've broken off a
few spaces within ATT&CK

111
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,729
for Enterprise that we wanna
put particular focus on.

112
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:55,180
We think of some unique aspects to them.

113
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,220
We want to give particular attention.

114
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,620
So first is Mac and Linux.

115
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,520
I think she's out there, no.

116
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:10,839
So Cat Self, who you'll be
seeing in just a little bit.

117
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:14,529
(clapping)

118
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:16,159
Live tweeting from the front row,

119
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:20,969
we have our ATT&CK for
Cloud lead, Justin Roberts.

120
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,039
(clapping)

121
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:27,169
It's got a separate matrix
that we released last year

122
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:29,979
is ATT&CK for Industrial Control Systems.

123
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:30,979
This is its own space.

124
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:33,659
It talks about different types of devices.

125
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,099
And so our ATT&CK for ICS
lead is Otis Alexander.

126
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:40,650
(clapping)

127
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,400
Not here with us today, but
another separate matrix focused

128
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,929
on iOS and Android devices is our

129
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:51,249
ATT&CK for Mobile framework,
and that's led by Jason Ajmo.

130
00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:53,330
(clapping)

131
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:58,800
ATT&CK has always been made
up of describing adversarial

132
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,309
behavior from the point of
view of an adversary combined

133
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:06,789
with a defensive information
on how to work with.

134
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:09,219
And so we recently reorganized
the defensive parts

135
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,319
of ATT&CK that is detections,
mitigations, data sources

136
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:16,770
and C.A.R, cyber analytics repository

137
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,620
into a separate defensive group.

138
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,009
And this is led by Lex Crumpton.

139
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,080
(clapping)

140
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:31,289
ATT&CK has a ton of open source
software that we put out.

141
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:33,349
We have infrastructure that we run,

142
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:35,940
everything from ATT&CK
Navigator to our website,

143
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,379
and that work's all led by Jared Ondricek,

144
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:41,619
who's sitting in the back.

145
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:43,969
(clapping)

146
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:45,599
All that groups and software information

147
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,050
that you see in ATT&CK.

148
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,729
So everything focused on threat reporting

149
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:54,139
on particular actors
is led by Matt Malone.

150
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:55,270
(clapping)

151
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,839
Our threat intelligence lead.

152
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,199
And last but not least the
editor in chief of our blog

153
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:06,830
is Amy Robertson who runs
Outreach along with myself.

154
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,449
(clapping)

155
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:12,999
And that's just nine
of us that are leading

156
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:18,999
the different parts of
this 40 plus person team.

157
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,289
So we couldn't do this event today

158
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:23,860
without our event sponsors.

159
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,039
This cost a decent amount to do,

160
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,619
you guys all want to eat.

161
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:31,150
So we wanted to thank our event sponsors,

162
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,770
who propose our virtual and full event.

163
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,620
Our virtual event sponsors are
Analyst One, Cyborg Security,

164
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,990
Microsoft, and Pentera.

165
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,440
Can we get a round of applause for our

166
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
virtual event sponsors?

167
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,220
(clapping)

168
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,870
And then we have our full event sponsors.

169
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,030
And so these are the
organizations that actually

170
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,020
have tables downstairs.

171
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,800
We absolutely encourage you to visit them,

172
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,079
say hi, thank them.

173
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:07,790
And those are ATT&CK IQ, Cyber Ranges,

174
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:14,829
Kroll, Picus, Trellix, and Trend Micro.

175
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:21,240
Can we get a round applause
for our full event sponsors?

176
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,280
(clapping)

177
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,959
So if you're watching online
and we will be piping it

178
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,990
into the room some over
the course of the day,

179
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,380
we're going to have some
exclusive online content

180
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,939
coming from our ATT&CKcon couch.

181
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,531
So bring up Cat Self.

182
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:40,979
So Cat around the corner are
gonna be interviewing our

183
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,410
speakers after they've given their talk.

184
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:51,800
That's probably enough torturing of Cat.

185
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,199
So if you're in virtually
or if you're in person,

186
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,590
we're gonna be having a lot
of our conversation today

187
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,740
on ATT&CK's Open Slack.

188
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,400
So if you aren't a
member of our Slack yet,

189
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,850
this link on the left will get you into it

190
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,010
or the QR code that's right
above it is the same link,

191
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,450
I promise.

192
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,030
If you're already in our Slack,

193
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,620
this link on the right
will take you straight

194
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,270
into the channel.

195
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:23,850
And again, take a shot of the QR code.

196
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,980
For each of the talks,
especially if you're coming

197
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,140
in for the virtual audience,

198
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,750
our questions and answers
are gonna be coming in

199
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,380
from Slack channels called
ATT&CKcon 3.0 dash Q.A.

200
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,380
dash

201
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,030
the last name of the speakers.

202
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,750
Now we have somebody
who's gonna be in the main

203
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,100
ATT&CKcon Channel.

204
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,810
They'll be letting you
know, sort of when to go

205
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,660
to each channel.

206
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:47,790
And Jamie Williams will be
using questions from the Slack,

207
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:55,319
as well as questions in the
audience when we do Q and A.

208
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,380
Another great way to
engage with us is Twitter.

209
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,439
So we're out there a decent amount.

210
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,690
We tweet, we like memes, and
we'll be potentially reading

211
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,810
some of the best that you guys send out

212
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,510
from online and we'll be live tweeting

213
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,010
for the next couple days, the conference.

214
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:20,060
So we have as our live tweet
team for the next few days,

215
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:25,709
we have Mike Hartley, John
Wonder, and Justin Roberts.

216
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,970
And so, if you want us to
actually be seeing something,

217
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,090
we really do like memes,

218
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,070
get those gifs out there,

219
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,820
and similar to how I pronounce gifs,

220
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,730
I will agree that it is pronounced Mista.
