1
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,349
- [Announcer] Please welcome to the stage,

2
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:15,370
Mr. Adam Pennington.

3
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,649
(audience applauding)

4
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:19,720
- Welcome back.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,570
(audience applauding)

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,210
So now we have a couple
of shorter talks for you,

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,110
you know, to round out our day.

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,939
Our first talk is another ATT&CK update,

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,530
our cyber threat
intelligence lead Matt Malone

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,780
is gonna be talking about campaigns.

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,810
(audience applauding)

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,260
- Thank you, sir.

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,430
And I know that applause
was more for the fact

14
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,700
that it's a short talk compared
to everything else going on,

15
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,789
but I appreciate you taking time

16
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:51,010
outta your day this afternoon.

17
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,480
I just wanna elaborate a little bit more

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,989
on the structure of campaigns

19
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:58,519
as we are attempting
to put it into action.

20
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,250
Not for April, not for
the ATT&CK version 11

21
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,010
coming out next month,

22
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,920
but this is going to be in October focus.

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,090
I am not lazing anyone, there we go.

24
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,530
Several people talked as they
were introducing themselves

25
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,840
talked about being gamers,
I'm a retired gamer.

26
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,850
I was, I didn't get to the punchline yet,

27
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,190
I was retired by my very
malicious teenage sons

28
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,170
who regardless of the game,

29
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,409
no matter what the
platform coming after me

30
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,439
and taking me out first
and then repeatedly

31
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:33,408
it was always more fun
than the game itself.

32
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:37,021
I've been with MITRE for
about a year and a half.

33
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:39,909
I get the privilege of
working with the CTI team

34
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:41,909
four outstanding analysts.

35
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:43,450
They work with your contributions,

36
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,630
they work with open source reporting

37
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,699
to help create new group
and software updates,

38
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,810
create new group and software
entries as well as update,

39
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,810
additional information

40
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,259
that's already within
the ATT&CK framework.

41
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,690
Over the last couple of
releases, eight, nine, and 10,

42
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,670
they've added almost 30 new groups

43
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:06,700
and over 140 new software entries.

44
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,479
They've also done some deeper dives

45
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,890
into some of our APT
actors trying to update,

46
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,540
refine, and in some cases detangle

47
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,480
how ATT&CK had previously identified

48
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,119
Iranian, North Korean and other actors.

49
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,940
And now, because they'd like a challenge,

50
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,280
we're gonna add campaigns
to their list as well.

51
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,450
As Adam mentioned this
morning and as in the roadmap,

52
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,518
we're starting with a
very general definition

53
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:32,120
of what a campaign is.

54
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,830
It's a grouping of intrusion activity

55
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,180
which may or may not be attributed,

56
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,030
it's ideally bound within a timeframe,

57
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,240
but also specifically
going after common targets

58
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
and objectives.

59
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,099
This is very much a work in progress,

60
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,349
that's why I focus on the fact

61
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:49,730
that it's a concept right now.

62
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,700
So everything I tell you
today will be absolutely true

63
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,069
except the parts that are gonna change

64
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:56,060
between now and October,

65
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,150
based on the reality of taking the concept

66
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,520
and applying real world CTI to it,

67
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,569
but also primarily based on your feedback,

68
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:07,369
your recommendations and your guidance.

69
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,909
The idea of having campaigns
in ATT&CK is not a new one,

70
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:12,290
the ATT&CK team has talked
about it for quite some time

71
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,299
and truth be told there are campaigns

72
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,080
and operations already in ATT&CK.

73
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,980
They're kind of squirreled in

74
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,798
with some of our group
updates, our group entries,

75
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:24,220
there's only a few maybe about a dozen,

76
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,359
but really the turning point,

77
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,069
the tipping point for moving
forward with the campaigns

78
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:33,798
was the solar winds intrusion
as Adam mentioned earlier.

79
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:34,880
From an ATT&CK perspective,

80
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,470
we were trying to focus on

81
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,909
as much of the CTI reporting
that was coming out,

82
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:40,810
collecting it, analyzing it,

83
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,769
and then trying to map the
techniques related to it.

84
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:45,989
We created a new group entry

85
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:48,380
because that was our
best avenue at the time.

86
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:53,459
We created UNC2452, and started
mapping ATT&CK techniques.

87
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,010
When we did the out cycle update for this,

88
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,379
we had 50 techniques total,

89
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:59,870
a majority of those were techniques

90
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,150
that were already in ATT&CK,

91
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,250
however, there was some new behavior

92
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,510
that had not been previously
captured in ATT&CK.

93
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,950
So Jamie and other
parts of the ATT&CK team

94
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:10,689
worked with the community
to help identify those,

95
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:15,450
scope them and then we mapped
UNC2452 to that as well.

96
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,019
Typical with a group entry
we had a software section,

97
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,760
combination of tools that
were already in ATT&CK

98
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,530
and some unique malware that
had not been seen before,

99
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,369
including some that had been
custom made for this campaign.

100
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,140
And of course down the bottom
we had all of our references,

101
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,570
our compilation of reporting,

102
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,280
so as researchers wanted to understand

103
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,520
more about a specific technique
or how software fit in,

104
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,229
they could go to that original reporting

105
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:41,360
and go back and get the details.

106
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,190
Last April coming up on a year ago now,

107
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,320
the US and the UK
government issued statements

108
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,839
regarding solar winds.

109
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:51,270
They attributed with high
confidence the campaign

110
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,649
to the Russian Foreign
Intelligence Service the SVR,

111
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:55,649
and in their statement,

112
00:04:55,649 --> 00:05:00,080
they talked about other
groups also known as APT29,

113
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,840
Cozy Bear and The Dukes.

114
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,890
From an ATT&CK perspective,

115
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,900
we already had a group
entry that covered that.

116
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,260
So we ended up taking UNC2452

117
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:14,030
and merging it into our
G0016 or APT29 entry.

118
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,859
All the information carried
over, none of it was lost,

119
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,460
but what we discovered was
the details of solar winds

120
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,589
quickly became lost in
what was one of our largest

121
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:27,850
group entries in ATT&CK.

122
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,610
The 50 techniques were still there,

123
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,890
but now they were part
of a broader category

124
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,760
of list of 70 that go
went back several years,

125
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,890
same with the malware.

126
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,340
Now we had 23 software entries in total,

127
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,270
at the same time additional
reporting was still coming out

128
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,640
about not only solar
winds in and of itself,

129
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,650
but also what the actors
were doing outside

130
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,960
and after solar winds.

131
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,549
And that was all being added
to the G0016, APT29 entry.

132
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,770
From an internal MITRE perspective,

133
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,120
as we doing work on solar winds,

134
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,349
I often found myself going
back to UNC2452 as the baseline

135
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:04,590
and then kind of populating
additional techniques

136
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:10,770
and software as it came out from there.

137
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,459
We're hoping that campaigns
has a widespread benefits

138
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:17,830
beyond high impact, high
visibility campaigns

139
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,700
such as solar winds.

140
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,710
We're hoping that as we
can populate campaigns

141
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,849
out over time, it provides
another perspective,

142
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:25,960
another way of telling the story

143
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,799
of what's going on in cyber field.

144
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,000
We're hoping it can show the evolution

145
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,870
of malicious cyber operations,

146
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,070
particularly as we can tie
them to specific groups.

147
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,570
We can show how groups have
evolved not only over time,

148
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,680
but potentially due to new
technologies coming on board,

149
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,899
identification, new
vulnerabilities, exploits,

150
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:47,580
sometimes shifting
based on their targeting

151
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,080
or what their objectives are,

152
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,940
but probably in many cases to
what you all are doing here

153
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,649
in terms of hardening the networks

154
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:57,870
and making their job harder.

155
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,870
To a certain extent,

156
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,060
I'm curious that as we
can kind of build this out

157
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,640
will there be sections

158
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,090
where we can focus on unchanged behavior?

159
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,090
If we can get a better sense

160
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,690
of what are those key techniques

161
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,770
that are always part of their toolkit,

162
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,150
they'll make minor modifications

163
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,820
to get around detections and alerts,

164
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,770
but it's always something they
go to time and time again,

165
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,120
and maybe that'll help with prioritization

166
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,590
when you're looking at techniques overall.

167
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,659
From an ATT&CK perspective,

168
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:27,849
it gives us a lot more flexibility
than we currently have.

169
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:29,400
As Adam mentioned this morning,

170
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,620
we currently don't create group entries

171
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,640
without a group name.

172
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,719
We also don't take,

173
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:38,120
I mentioned how we would
previously take campaigns

174
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,530
and kind of cram 'em into a group.

175
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,760
We don't do that with unnamed campaigns.

176
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,190
We wanna create a lot of flexibility

177
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,640
with this new structure.

178
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,340
So we can take unnamed actors,

179
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,219
we can take low confidence actors as well,

180
00:07:52,219 --> 00:07:53,690
and unnamed operations

181
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,690
and be able to fit it into this format.

182
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,900
One of the biggest benefits

183
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,359
we hope to get from this
is addressing ransomware.

184
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,469
The last talk was excellent

185
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:05,060
in terms of just framing the
ransomware as a service issue,

186
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,740
from an ATT&CK perspective,

187
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,310
we've had a challenge
of keeping up on that.

188
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,380
Yes, we can create
malware software entries

189
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,789
for the ransomware in and of itself,

190
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:16,650
but at that point it's
already in the network,

191
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,650
it's already deployed,

192
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,209
it's too late for the defender
to actually take action.

193
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:25,750
There's a large body of open
unclassified CTI reporting

194
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,310
about all the activities all the TTPs

195
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,010
leading up to the ransomware infection,

196
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,200
but quite often it was
unidentified actors,

197
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,309
unidentified groups, or based
on ransomware as a service,

198
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,750
you could have multiple
clusters of activity

199
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,250
all working to the same end goal

200
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,399
of deploying the same type of ransomware.

201
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,510
And we just didn't have a good methodology

202
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,760
for capturing that.

203
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,569
From a campaign perspective
we're hoping to shift the focus

204
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,120
away from the actor in and of itself

205
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,970
and make it the target
of the campaign instead,

206
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:56,810
so we could focus on a
(indistinct) ransomware campaign

207
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,359
against the healthcare
sector in this timeframe,

208
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,620
and identify not only named actors

209
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,170
but unidentified and
unknown actors as well.

210
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,020
So in terms of components,

211
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,699
what the actual page will look like

212
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,970
if you're familiar with ATT&CK

213
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,800
and hopefully you are if you're here,

214
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,180
it's gonna look very much
like a group and software page

215
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,670
with some noticeable differences.

216
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,630
Every page will have a campaign ID number,

217
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,580
so Charlie one, two, three, four.

218
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,560
It may or may not have a name.

219
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,060
That'll be, as I said before,

220
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,239
split in practice from
what we've done previously,

221
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,780
if we can link it to a group, we will,

222
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,439
but that's not necessary,
it's not required.

223
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,830
Again, we could have campaigns

224
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:40,160
that just focus on unknown
actors or unidentified actors.

225
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,829
We'll have that description
of what the campaign is about,

226
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,610
the sectors, the targeting,
countries involved.

227
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,400
We try to capture that
in group descriptions

228
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,400
as much as possible.

229
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,260
One of the challenges is with
data aggregation over time,

230
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,800
we we're forced to generalize.

231
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,109
So instead of talking
about specific countries,

232
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,140
we talk about regions,

233
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,939
instead of specific organizations,

234
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,260
we talk about general sectors.

235
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,530
Under campaigns we're hoping to keep

236
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,650
as much detail as we can
and add additional points.

237
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,840
If new techniques were developed
based on this campaign,

238
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,250
if there were new TTPs identified,

239
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,920
maybe it was the first
time a family of malware

240
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,670
or software was identified and used,

241
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,250
we wanna make those notes

242
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,770
as to why this campaign stands out.

243
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,470
The group and software
pages will not change

244
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,890
with the exception

245
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,060
that when we can tie
it back to a campaign,

246
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,819
there'll be a campaign section
with the campaign ID code

247
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,330
so you can click and you can move

248
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,080
hopefully seamlessly
between a campaign page,

249
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,800
any groups in any related software.

250
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,790
So again, October timeframe, not April,

251
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,800
don't go looking forward in version 11.

252
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,880
Right now the team is focused
on taking those campaigns

253
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,010
that are currently in ATT&CK.

254
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,970
They're going back to
the original reporting,

255
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,300
seeing if any new information
has come to light,

256
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,361
help us better understand
not only the campaign

257
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:08,069
but if there's been some
attribution made subsequently,

258
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,710
they're also gonna remap the reports

259
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,180
because ATT&CK has grown

260
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,870
and changed since these first came out.

261
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,420
And then as we've moved forward,

262
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,760
we'll keep creating new campaigns.

263
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,060
As the team has been working for group

264
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,020
and software updates for version 11,

265
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,100
on the side they've been
keeping mappings for campaigns.

266
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,300
We have a template or they've
been using excel words,

267
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,209
so they've been in identifying

268
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:33,100
and potentially nominating
potential campaign entries.

269
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,110
Our goal over time is to narrow the gap

270
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,290
between what we have in groups,

271
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,130
where we can take older campaigns

272
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,760
and map those while still
being forward leaning

273
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,980
and capturing new activity.

274
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,040
And that's where you all come in.

275
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,449
We're really looking forward
to engagement and feedback,

276
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,850
recommendations how to move
forward quickly with this.

277
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,720
I don't have a set number of campaigns

278
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,180
that plan to publish come October,

279
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,010
I'd rather have a strong foundation

280
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,990
and then be able to build out from there.

281
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,400
We owe you a blog post later in the year,

282
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,410
whereas this develops,

283
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,060
we'll provide a little more
guidance and information.

284
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:17,410
And as always, we look
forward to your contributions.

285
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,829
(audience applauding)

286
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,641
- The words escape me on
how excited for this I am.

287
00:12:25,641 --> 00:12:26,819
I wish I could really capture.

288
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,930
- You (indistinct) heart.

289
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:28,930
- Yeah.

290
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,750
- Wow, just there's a
Taylor swift meme there.

291
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,250
I don't wanna monopolize,

292
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,340
'cause I could talk
about this one all day.

293
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,740
I wanted to see if
anyone from the audience

294
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,850
wanted to ask anything from Matt.

295
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,850
Yes.

296
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,360
- So, I saw a lot of these campaigns,

297
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,700
will they have some campaign activities

298
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,630
dedicated to the ICS space?

299
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,840
- Question for the audience
is will the campaigns

300
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,660
extend to across multiple
domains and matrices of ATT&CK?

301
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,370
Particularly not just enterprise, but ICS.

302
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,040
- Ideally, yes.

303
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,270
Ideally we'd like to
eventually get to a point

304
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,790
where we can either different
frameworks together.

305
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,020
So if something starts
from a mobile perspective,

306
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,260
but moves to enterprise,

307
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,200
if it starts with enterprise
but low and behold

308
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,450
that ICS network isn't as air gaped

309
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,040
as the people thought it was

310
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,569
and they have that type of movement,

311
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,899
so yeah, it is a whole
of ATT&CK development.

312
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:23,060
- We put this in slides, we
haven't put it on a t-shirt yet.

313
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,089
Haven't put that on a t-shirt yet,

314
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,600
but we have this internal
saying called One ATT&CK,

315
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,730
and I think it's something
we're really pushing towards,

316
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,110
you know, the equity
and kind of the balance

317
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,710
between the different domains.

318
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,630
I think we have time
for one more question.

319
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:42,430
Oh, in the back.

320
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,489
(indistinct)

321
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:50,950
So the question is how
fast will ATT&CK begin

322
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,980
to, you know, kind of consume all this

323
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,430
and actually integrate it.

324
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:59,370
- Right now, we release
ATT&CK twice a year

325
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,870
and that's going to be the current pace

326
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,400
until Adam tells us differently.

327
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,780
So we'll be, I guess from the
perspective of the CTI team,

328
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,760
we are constantly adding
and updating to ATT&CK,

329
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,010
it's just that the release
comes out every six months.

330
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,520
- I think we have time
for one more question

331
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,240
and I'm gonna be very
selfish to take this,

332
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,350
in the spirit of this is our framework,

333
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,350
this is our community,

334
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,450
you mentioned contributions.

335
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,450
- Yes.

336
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,580
- What can we do for you?

337
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,790
- Well, I think that's where
the conversation has to start.

338
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,709
You know, we started with
a very general definition

339
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,360
of how we're approaching campaigns.

340
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,600
If people have a better way of scoping,

341
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,300
shaping elements that
really should be in there.

342
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,170
If there are gonna be
particular challenges

343
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,439
where there's gonna be a gap in reporting

344
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,060
of one part or another,
how do we address those?

345
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,939
- Lovely, thank you.

346
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,190
(audience applauding)
