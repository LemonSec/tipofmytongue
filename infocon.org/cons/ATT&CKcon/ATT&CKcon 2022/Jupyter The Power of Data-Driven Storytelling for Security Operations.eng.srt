1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,539
- So our next speakers are Jose Barajas

2
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:18,740
and Stephan Chenette from AttackIQ.

3
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,310
Excel spreadsheets have been a common

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,570
and sometimes derisive topic
at ATT&CKcon in the past

5
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,490
but it turns out there actually
are other tools out there

6
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,078
for working with ATT&CK.

7
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:32,649
Jupyter Notebooks can be a
really powerful tool for working

8
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:36,489
with data and we use them
ourselves with ATT&CK.

9
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:37,570
Next talk's gonna share some of the ways

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,110
they've been able to use this tool

11
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,030
to tell different kinds
of stories with data.

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,329
So please welcome to the
stage Jose and Stephan.

13
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,030
- Perfect, (indistinct).

14
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,429
Everybody hear me okay?

15
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:54,780
Perfect.

16
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,289
So I'm Stephan Chenette,
I'm the founder and CTO

17
00:00:57,289 --> 00:00:58,409
of AttackIQ.

18
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:00,929
We have who am I slides

19
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:06,110
but my focus is typically on
setting the technology strategy

20
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,549
and direction for or scenario based

21
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:11,549
ATT&CK Emulation Platform.

22
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,750
The other thing I work on is
working with our data analyst

23
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,430
to take all the data that
our platform is accumulating

24
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,490
and help our customers and our clients

25
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,880
to really visualize it so that
they can tell better stories.

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,490
And in fact, that was part of
the influence for this talk.

27
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,940
- Cool, and then, hi everyone.

28
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,390
My name is Jose Barajas.

29
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,150
I'm a technical director here at AttackIQ.

30
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,140
I lead our sales engineering team.

31
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,210
I also lead the research
on behalf of the company

32
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,460
that we do with minor ingenuity.

33
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,820
So those paper pamphlets
you're seeing around,

34
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,929
we're a large part of that.

35
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,010
And I get the pleasure of leading that

36
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,180
on behalf of the company.

37
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,660
So with that, let's go
ahead and get started

38
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,990
and walk you through how
we help our customers

39
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,580
better communicate with their teams

40
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,899
through Jupyter Notebooks.

41
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,620
And to start, I've seen this theme

42
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,960
starting with Selena as
part of the opening today

43
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,800
is storytelling seems to be a common theme

44
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,480
throughout this today.

45
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,068
And I think that just goes to show

46
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:10,098
how difficult communicating, right?

47
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:12,590
Whether it's with other analysts
that you're working with,

48
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,239
your directors or the
CSO or C-suite level,

49
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,080
or even maybe even in the board.

50
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,800
It's quite difficult so
we've done quite a bit

51
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,240
in that area and wanna share a little bit

52
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,510
of how we've addressed that.

53
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,950
Telling a story is nice,
telling a story is great,

54
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,540
but we're able to back it up

55
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,670
through empirical data evidence.

56
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,309
It just brings it home, right?

57
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,600
So it's nice to hear the nice story

58
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,239
and then we can show the analyst

59
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,260
all the details that actually back it up.

60
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,760
It puts it all together very beautifully.

61
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,060
And what I heard from the
team at MITRE just now

62
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,790
is you guys are using
Jupyter Notebooks today.

63
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,090
A lot of you in this room are probably

64
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:48,370
using Jupyter Notebooks
today and I, myself,

65
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,709
throughout my career have used them.

66
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:52,650
It's an amazing way of just
pulling in different data sets,

67
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,250
doing a quick analysis,
sharing with other folks.

68
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,080
And today we just wanna
show you how we've been able

69
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,540
to take the work that do as analysts

70
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,350
and do a bunch of technical things

71
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,630
but use that same mechanism to actually

72
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,049
express back to our teams
that I mentioned earlier,

73
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,550
the findings and the stories
that we wanna tell them.

74
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,220
Now, before we get into those details,

75
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,880
let's talk a little bit
about Jupyter Notebooks

76
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,359
and what they are.

77
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,650
At the end of the day, for
those of you that may not know,

78
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,540
Jupyter Notebooks is
just an open source tool

79
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,950
that lets you put together code

80
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,489
to put together a bunch of processes.

81
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,480
And for myself, this is how
I pull together data sets

82
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,099
from a bunch of different APIs.

83
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:36,420
Results as an example, minor data,

84
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,589
think of like mapping
(indistinct) as an example.

85
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,390
And at the end, these Jupyter Notebooks

86
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,130
are super valuable because
that's where I do my work

87
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,130
day to day.

88
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,540
And then it's easily nowadays,

89
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,459
can be shared through
either Google Collabs.

90
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:51,370
They have a desktop app.

91
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,209
So it's really very accessible now.

92
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:54,840
And I think that's one of
the most valuable things

93
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,050
that these Jupyter Notebooks
have brought as of late.

94
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,890
And at the end of the day, they're made up

95
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,500
of these three simple components.

96
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,140
First of all, a text block.

97
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,269
Always perfect to set up the stage, right?

98
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,400
You let people know what
we're talking about.

99
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,550
The text block's gonna
allow you to do that.

100
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,010
Simple markdown is really what they are.

101
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,700
From there, we have the code blocks.

102
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,810
That's where we're gonna do all the work,

103
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,080
we're gonna pull in the results.

104
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,850
We're gonna pull in data from
a bunch of different APIs,

105
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,209
do a bunch of calculations
and finally visualize that

106
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,700
and put that together into
something that tells a story.

107
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,580
And these Jupyter
Notebooks, the reason why

108
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,539
they're so valuable is their notebooks.

109
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,810
The core reason why they were
created is for scientists.

110
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,250
As you're doing a bunch of work,

111
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,680
you can now share it with someone else

112
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,570
and they just swap in their data

113
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,909
and they can do the same analysis.

114
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,600
And as you'll see with
the presentation today,

115
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,060
that also means that as you're
doing your day to day work,

116
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,270
the blocking and tackling
that you have to do,

117
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,560
you can take that same data

118
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,530
and just create a quick visualization

119
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,789
to express a thing that you
wanna express to your team.

120
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,090
And we'll start off with one example

121
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,948
which is gonna be focused on
taking the work that we've done

122
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:03,470
and expressing it to the
executive and CSO at that level.

123
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,190
So I'll hand that off to you Stephan.

124
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,780
- Perfect, thanks Jose.

125
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,369
Okay, so for the sake of
a few of these examples,

126
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,389
imagine with me that your
security team has been asked

127
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:16,139
to assess its security controls.

128
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:19,780
Assess them via different,
either threat actors,

129
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,809
or as we heard in the earlier
talk, various campaigns

130
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,900
with unknown named actors.

131
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,799
Now to do that, you're
gonna use some type of tool

132
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,970
or platform to emulate
a lot of that behavior.

133
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,900
We're very big in ATT&CK
Flows, ATT&CK Graphs

134
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,120
not just looking at it
from an atomic perspective

135
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,169
but actually looking at it
as kind of a multi-asset

136
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:46,080
chain of behaviors.

137
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,800
So that behavior happens,
part of assessing the controls

138
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,620
is taking note and putting
all of that information,

139
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,100
some type of repository
database, something accessible,

140
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,650
hopefully via an API.

141
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:05,198
So part of the Jupyter Notebook experience

142
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,930
is that you can access all that data.

143
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,310
So typically after you kind
of run these exercises,

144
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,360
you maybe use a PowerPoint,
dump it all to an Excel sheet,

145
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,960
it'd be fairly static as an experience

146
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,020
when you're presenting it.

147
00:06:19,021 --> 00:06:20,979
Maybe that happens a week
later and you're like,

148
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:22,440
we assessed our controls.

149
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,670
Here's how we're doing.

150
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,600
Our endpoint failed here or
network control failed here.

151
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Here's how we're doing against

152
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,000
FIN6 or this particular
campaign but it's static.

153
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,090
I don't know when that
presentation was given.

154
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:38,198
If I see it a month later,
how old is that data?

155
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,949
Let me offer a different suggestion

156
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:41,389
in terms of how you can present it.

157
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:43,520
Now, Jose said he's used
Jupyter Notebooks forever

158
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,870
as an analyst.

159
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,590
We're sitting on our
computer, pulling in data,

160
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,380
going through it,
interacting in our notebook,

161
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,380
in our workbook.

162
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,072
But what we've seen be very
valuable is actually to use

163
00:06:55,072 --> 00:06:58,130
Jupyter Notebooks as a
presentation mechanism.

164
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:02,770
So amongst your team of
five, 10, 15 analysts,

165
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,889
someone on the security team,
whether it's the CTI team,

166
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:06,889
whether it's the threat (indistinct)

167
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:09,949
and really management team
going through the data

168
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:13,310
and actually pulling it in real time.

169
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,960
And as Jose said, a Jupyter
Notebooks has a text box

170
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
with markdown language.

171
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,888
So you can put a header, explain
it, much like you would to

172
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:24,710
either an executive, someone
on the operations team,

173
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,888
someone on the tactical level.

174
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:29,250
Has some code that you can pull data from,

175
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,500
whether it's the taxi server pulling

176
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,940
(indistinct) information,

177
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,540
whether it's the ATT&CK Emulation Platform

178
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,419
for all the results and then
paint your visualizations.

179
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:40,111
Now, in this example,
this is a Jupyter Notebook

180
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:42,849
that we highly abstracted,
but we've seen used

181
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,979
multiple times where codes written

182
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:48,280
from the visualization perspective,

183
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,880
you can paint in a very high level picture

184
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,420
to say, an executive.

185
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,740
What does that ATT&CK Flow look like?

186
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,130
What were the multiple steps?

187
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,430
Where were our controls
supposed to detect or prevent?

188
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,540
Where did they fail?

189
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,640
That's a story and I'm
talking about at the CIO,

190
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,919
Chief Risk Officer auditor level.

191
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:11,669
No details other than ATT&CK Flow

192
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:14,400
and maybe you're mentioning
what the techniques are

193
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,000
along the way, but
fewer details is better.

194
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,520
Just understanding what exactly happened

195
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,120
and then using some type of data frame

196
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,990
and mapping on Plotly
and looking at a table,

197
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,860
looking at threat actors and dumping it

198
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,009
within the Jupyter Notebook,
as you're telling the story,

199
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:33,049
and you've had a text block to explain

200
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:36,098
what you're about to show to
again, the right audience,

201
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:40,429
which is fewer details, to
show these threat actors

202
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,239
or these particular campaigns.

203
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,550
And we were neither able
to detect or prevent,

204
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,010
showing red or green.

205
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,170
And we've seen multiple
times more and more details

206
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,939
at this level get added and they're like,

207
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,230
"I have a lot of questions."

208
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,330
And at this level, you
wanna paint a picture

209
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,060
and get a certain emotional
response, like any good story.

210
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,060
So red and green, in this typical sense,

211
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,250
for one of our customers just meant

212
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,670
we were neither able to
prevent or detect it.

213
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:06,490
And showing this data
with this Jupyter Notebook

214
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,611
and going along from
the start of showing it

215
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:12,200
at an executive level will
provoke and trigger emotion

216
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,970
that will hopefully go to action.

217
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,260
- Yeah.

218
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,220
And the goal with this
here at the end of the day,

219
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,920
we're talking at the executive level.

220
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,760
I know for all of you in the room,

221
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,660
you see two green blocks in a red block.

222
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,170
And that seems way too simple.

223
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,550
At the end of the day, as analysts,

224
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,469
we just need to showcase
where do we need help?

225
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,570
Where do we need support?

226
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,600
And while we have all
that data to back it up,

227
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,670
that's all that we need to
show at that executive level.

228
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,140
Now, with that said, we have
to address that problem, right?

229
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,819
When we ask for resources,
what are we gonna do with them?

230
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,710
And the great thing about this
is all that context is there.

231
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,390
We're just exposing in different levels

232
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,790
depending on who we're talking to.

233
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,740
So let's take a look at
how we've put together

234
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,320
a different view for the same data set

235
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,160
so that we can support
the detection engineers

236
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,160
at the organization

237
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,380
and so that they can start
affecting things at the org too.

238
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,019
Go ahead, Stephan.

239
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,019
- Sure.

240
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:04,019
So again, kind of drilling down

241
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:07,220
either as part of the
same Jupyter Notebook

242
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,180
or a different one and you
can imagine you have a whole

243
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,750
git repository of all
these Jupyter Notebooks.

244
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,970
When someone comes over and say,

245
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,240
"hi, I have a certain question."

246
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,330
And instead of pulling
out that intel report

247
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,330
or security assessment report
that you wrote a month ago

248
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,520
to try to answer that question,

249
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,860
you say, "oh, let me pull
out a Jupyter Notebook."

250
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,959
And it's meant to answer
a certain set of questions

251
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,500
to a particular set of
audience of a certain type,

252
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,190
whether it's strategic,
operational or tactical

253
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,590
at a certain level.

254
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,320
So in this particular case,

255
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,260
we work with a lot of
detection engineering teams.

256
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,319
And the question that they're asking

257
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,250
isn't just where are our gaps

258
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,480
or control capabilities
failing or succeeding

259
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,560
to prove that but where are
our detection logic failing?

260
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,140
And as you might run a
particular ATT&CK Graph

261
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,410
or ATT&CK Flow, there is more detail

262
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,750
that can be dumped at this level.

263
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,580
And again, within, embedded
inside of a Jupyter Notebook.

264
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,660
So you're looking, presenting
just like I am right now

265
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:07,370
to you, but you've got a
Jupyter Notebook in front of you

266
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,920
and you can be very interactive.

267
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,599
Jupyter Notebooks allow you in real time,

268
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,490
not just to change the
code, but to have various

269
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:18,149
input boxes to allow parameters
and then rerun the code.

270
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:20,670
Rerun just that text block,
not the entire thing.

271
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:25,170
Output a visualization and
see, beginning, middle event,

272
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,519
where in the ATT&CK Flow, where
are detection rules failing?

273
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,200
Where were they succeeding?

274
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,890
Doing that at a very granular
level, knowing timing,

275
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,610
when was it run on what
machine was it run?

276
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,750
What was the sequence
and the timing sequence

277
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,149
between the various atomic techniques

278
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:45,370
that were run within the ATT&CK Flow.

279
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,500
And this can also be
shown at a tactics level

280
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,700
to show weaknesses amongst
kind of the tactics.

281
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,490
Again, it's not always
sequential left to right,

282
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,500
it could be done in parallel.

283
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,470
- And the huge advantage I've seen here,

284
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,990
when I put together PowerPoint slides

285
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,589
then I get asked, "well,
what was the data source?

286
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:03,310
How did you arrive at that conclusion?

287
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,810
What was the logic that led you to say

288
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,839
that we're okay in this area?"

289
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,000
And because that's
exactly where we function,

290
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,540
exactly where we work, all that
information is there, right?

291
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,750
This is where I pulled the data.

292
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,860
This is where I did the mappings.

293
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,550
And this is how I arrived at that result.

294
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,560
So it lets you engage right then and there

295
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,779
with the analysts whenever
you are presenting

296
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:24,020
to those folks.

297
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,740
- So this is our last example.

298
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,490
And again, one of the
points that we want you

299
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,740
to take away from this is
next time you're gonna look at

300
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,550
maybe presenting some of your
data through a PowerPoint,

301
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,140
write it up in a Jupyter Notebook.

302
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,480
This is a historical performance

303
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,310
viewpoint of looking at some of the data.

304
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,500
So obviously, emulations have been run.

305
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,300
You have more knowledge
about the controls,

306
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,670
what failed, you have more knowledge about

307
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:54,130
some of the detection, logic, what worked,

308
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:58,100
what didn't work, where in
the ATT&CK Graph did it work,

309
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,100
did it not work?

310
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,100
Below it over time.

311
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,000
So as Jose said, you might
ask for resources, more time,

312
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,320
more projects, more
technologies, but in January,

313
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,410
where were we failing?

314
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,339
Did we improve in February?

315
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:10,910
Did we improve in March?

316
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,620
Looking at it from both high level,

317
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,820
either campaign or a
threat actor perspective,

318
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,740
or looking at it a much
more granular level

319
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,019
from a detection engineering
perspective of specific rules

320
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:22,190
that were meant to catch atomic techniques

321
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,089
within that entire ATT&CK Flow.

322
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:26,530
And again, it might be
that you can't catch

323
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,670
that atomic technique
on its own but you can

324
00:13:28,671 --> 00:13:31,779
when they're glued together.

325
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:35,720
- Yeah, and I think at the end of the day,

326
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,829
I think the call to action to you is

327
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:39,300
you're already using Jupyter Notebooks

328
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,719
in some shape, way or form.

329
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,630
Some analysts that you follow in ATT&CK

330
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,660
are using them already.

331
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,010
Think about using it as a way to present

332
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,850
'cause you can take what
you're already doing,

333
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,070
manipulate it into what we've shown you

334
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,450
and then when those people are asking

335
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,920
for that very detailed information

336
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,000
of how you arrive at
that, it's right there.

337
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,459
And that's been a very
valuable thing for us.

338
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:02,430
So thank you for your time so far.

339
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,430
- Thanks.

340
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,430
- Thank you.

341
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,709
Thank you, and I think Jupyter Notebooks,

342
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:09,250
but even more broadly, we're
all big fans of automation.

343
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,560
So I don't think we have
time for many questions

344
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,180
but I just wanted to shoot a simple one.

345
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,069
You mentioned, you know,
the power of automation,

346
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,330
kind of walked us through
a story of an example.

347
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,860
In terms of, one of the
first questions we have

348
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,709
in this space, is how do you determine

349
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:24,670
a good candidate for
automation in terms of,

350
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,120
is it a particular analyst problem?

351
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,029
Is it a story I'm trying to tell?

352
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:31,000
How do you really try to
enumerate and really dive into

353
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,680
that type of decision?

354
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,680
- Yeah.

355
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,790
I mean, I think that that comes down to

356
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,110
when we're working with
our customers or clients,

357
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,620
we're asking them what
their priorities are.

358
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,310
And sometimes at a very strategic level,

359
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,939
as we saw in the presentations earlier,

360
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,770
they might be worried about
something in the news.

361
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:51,269
Maybe that's a perceived
threat and it's not real.

362
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:53,279
And then we'll drill down
and we'll kind of talk

363
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,810
both at the strategic,
operational and tactical level,

364
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,250
make sure everyone's aligned.

365
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,200
That kind of sets the
priorities of what gets tested.

366
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,450
What's the focus?

367
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,000
And then what can be
automated to to get tested

368
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,750
so that you can verify
what's working is working.

369
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,079
- Exactly, I mean, there
seems to be a couple themes

370
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,430
of the day but know your audience,

371
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,739
like I said, that's fantastic, thank you.

372
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,740
- Thanks (indistinct).

373
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,740
Thanks everyone.

374
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,700
- [Jose] Thank you very much.
