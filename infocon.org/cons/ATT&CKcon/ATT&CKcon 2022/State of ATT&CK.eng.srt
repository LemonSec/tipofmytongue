1
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,930
- Back in the slack, I was
loving the Twitter, banter,

2
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:15,930
keep it coming.

3
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,900
And with that, my next
job is to introduce again,

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,723
our MC Adam Pennington to
present the State of ATT&CK.

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,177
- Thank you for the sector.

6
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,700
So, I'm now switching
hats, I like this hat,

7
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,913
so not literally,

8
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,640
But to talk a little bit

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,340
about the current state of the ATT&CK.

10
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,390
So this is a talk we've done
for each ATT&CKcon going over,

11
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,170
sort of what's been going
on in the framework,

12
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,610
what's coming, and to try to
give everybody an opportunity

13
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,453
to do Q and A as well.

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,550
So, I've asked all my leads
to do who am my slides.

15
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:02,209
So I figure I have to as well,
my pronouns are he, him, his,

16
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,810
I'm the lead of MITRE ATT&CK,

17
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,720
have been for about two years now,

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,070
since I took over from
its founder, Blake Strom,

19
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,550
I've been in MITRE quite a
long time now, over 13 years,

20
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,943
that seems like a long time.

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,059
My main focuses are on threat intelligence

22
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,200
and deception lately.

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,730
I am a past defender CTI analyst.

24
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:23,770
I've spent time in the trenches

25
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:24,740
and I've been involved with ATT&CK

26
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,610
since it was a spreadsheet
with no ampersand.

27
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:32,210
Was did used to be ATTACK
before it came out.

28
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,789
And if you see underwater photos

29
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:36,440
coming out on ATT&CKs
Twitter, stuff like that,

30
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,063
it's probably from me.

31
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,280
So, I figure with a talk
called the State of the ATT&CK,

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,813
I have to start out with saying
MITRE ATT&CK remains strong.

33
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,733
So my welcome,

34
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:53,780
I talked a little bit about
how it's been 2 1/2 years

35
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,650
since we've been here.

36
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,843
Since the last time Blake
delivered this same talk.

37
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,740
And so, we'd already come
a long way 2 1/2 years ago.

38
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,740
We had come from this, well
sort of ugly Excel Spreadsheet

39
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,329
to a bit less ugly Excel Spreadsheet.

40
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,470
Now, but we had expanded
a lot, we'd added tactics.

41
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,040
We'd gotten up to 266 techniques

42
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,912
at the point in time this was done.

43
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,320
But there's a little
secret about that slide.

44
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,960
This is what it really
looked like 2 1/2 years ago,

45
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,740
before we cropped the
bottom of that image.

46
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,250
In case you missed it,
this big section over here.

47
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:41,600
So, persistence and defensive agent,

48
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,230
especially had gotten kind of
unruly, we couldn't fit it.

49
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,420
A lot of techniques had
gotten sort of uneven.

50
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,010
And so the shape of ATT&CK has
actually changed quite a bit

51
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,459
since the last time we were in this room.

52
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,430
So this is what ATT&CK looks like today.

53
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,870
Yes, really.

54
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,020
I didn't have to crop
or chop off anything.

55
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:04,370
For those of you in the
room who have ATT&CK flags,

56
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,203
you might have noticed

57
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:08,310
it's now shaped a bit more
like a banner than a flag,

58
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,220
but it's gotten wider,
it's gotten shorter.

59
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,750
And so I wanted to talk
about some of what's happened

60
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,583
since the last time we were
in coming from this room.

61
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,899
So I'm gonna get into some of the changes

62
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,783
that have actually happened
over that time period.

63
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,420
Starting with ATT&CK for
Industrial Control Systems.

64
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,099
So we released ATT&CK for
ICS in January of 2020.

65
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:34,269
ATT&CK for ICS covers

66
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,720
behaviors on Industrial Control Systems.

67
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,680
We keep it as a separate
matrix, so it's off to the side.

68
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,300
If you're ever feeling
nostalgia for the MediaWiki,

69
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,800
that ATT&CK used to be,

70
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,610
you can currently go to
the ATT&CK for ICS site.

71
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,230
We keep it separate because
it's a unique space.

72
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,060
We think they're unique adversaries there

73
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,210
that are focused on it.

74
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,100
And it's kept up with parallel
updates in its own site.

75
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,630
And so I have some updates to that

76
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,183
coming in a little bit too.

77
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,003
Some of the big thing,

78
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:08,880
and the reason why that
shape changed so much

79
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,233
is sub-techniques being
added to enterprise.

80
00:04:14,565 --> 00:04:17,350
(audience applauding)

81
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,490
That's encouraging reaction too,

82
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:23,920
but sub-techniques added
a new level to techniques.

83
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,310
So it allowed us to describe

84
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,240
things that are specific to platforms,

85
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,330
to specific operating systems.

86
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,010
It allowed us to even out the
granularity, the techniques,

87
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,303
and it allowed us to fit it
into a PowerPoint slide again.

88
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,010
We've gotten a lot of feedback
in the past two years,

89
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:46,830
actually racks in the room
act is nice to hear too,

90
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,810
that most people have been
happy with the change.

91
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,160
And one way that people
have also said that

92
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,740
is voting with their feet.

93
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,960
So we've seen most people over time

94
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,780
switch to newer versions of ATT&CK

95
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,400
in actual leverage
sub-techniques in their products.

96
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,233
Thank you.

97
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,700
So, because sub-techniques
have worked out pretty well,

98
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,960
something you are gonna see over time,

99
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,010
we have these separate matrices still,

100
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,860
is sub-techniques coming over
time to the rest of ATT&CK.

101
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,970
I'll talk a little bit about mobile

102
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,713
and we'll figure out when
exactly on ICS in the future.

103
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,400
So I know some of you
were fans of Pre-ATT&CK.

104
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,159
And so I'm sorry that it
is no longer here with us

105
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,170
as of October 27th, 2020,

106
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,040
but we did replace Pre-ATT&CK
with two new tactics

107
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,570
to take its place in the framework.

108
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,480
So reconnaissance and
resource development.

109
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,770
So this led us to talk about

110
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,169
in the main enterprise framework,

111
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,710
things that the adversary is doing

112
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,890
to try to get information,
to be able to do a breach

113
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,310
or the steps that they take

114
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,600
in order to actually
build up their activities.

115
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,853
So writing the malware,
setting up websites, et cetera.

116
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,099
And again, this is an area

117
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,320
where we're slowly seeing
more and more people

118
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,580
adopted into their practices

119
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,840
and show up in more and more reporting.

120
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,299
We know this is a tough
space for some people.

121
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,460
This isn't necessarily intelligence
that every defender has,

122
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,560
but we think it can be a useful place

123
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,563
for a lot of people to look at threats.

124
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,000
A platform that I think a lot
of people may not have caught

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,640
being released was our
network devices platform.

126
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,510
So October, 2020,

127
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,210
we released the network devices platform

128
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,900
covering network infrastructure devices.

129
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,479
This is things like routers and switches.

130
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,060
So adversary is actually hacking

131
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,760
into these types of devices,
replacing their firmware,

132
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,332
and this is added into enterprise ATT&CK.

133
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,990
So, I finally decided to
stop abusing Ryan Kovas,

134
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,193
sad cloud graphic,

135
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:03,113
'cause we are very much
in happy cloud mode now.

136
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,870
But so Ryan spoke at the first ATT&CK on,

137
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,360
he talked about our
lack of cloud coverage.

138
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,600
And so over time we've released cloud,

139
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,650
we've covered a number of platforms in it

140
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,479
and we've done work over this time period,

141
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,223
expanding the space that we're in.

142
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,630
So, in the space of platforms,

143
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:29,790
we added Google Workspace
alongside Office 365

144
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,640
and we made a shift to actually get rid

145
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,180
of three platforms as well.

146
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,497
So you may have noticed
that we got rid of AWS,

147
00:07:38,497 --> 00:07:41,440
GCP and Azure as platforms in ATT&CK

148
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,513
and replaced them with
Infrastructures as a Service, IaaS.

149
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,930
The reason we did this
is that we took a look

150
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,000
at what was unique
between those platforms.

151
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,650
And so what were we adding differently

152
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,849
as techniques between them?

153
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,050
And the answer was nothing.

154
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,670
ATT&CK actually was showing

155
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,650
at the level of granularity
that ATT&CK is at.

156
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,837
About the same techniques
in each of the platforms.

157
00:08:04,837 --> 00:08:07,640
The other thing is there are
a lot of other IaaS platforms

158
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,128
out there besides those three.

159
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:14,323
So condensing those let
us describe more space.

160
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,040
We also released ATT&CK for containers.

161
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,720
So, we had a lot of demand
looking at things like Kubernetes

162
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,233
and other container
orchestration platforms.

163
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,530
And so we were finally able to
build up enough intelligence

164
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,559
in the space and what
people were really seeing

165
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,752
from threat actors.

166
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,429
More recently over the past year,

167
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:44,059
we've been making some changes
to enterprise data sources.

168
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:48,869
So, before data sources
and ATT&CK for enterprise

169
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,210
were just a list of text strings.

170
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:56,210
So, these weren't that
consistent, we have to admit it.

171
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,709
So, we would have something
like file monitoring,

172
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:04,010
something you do, process
command line parameters,

173
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,530
something that you're gathering
and Windows Get Registry,

174
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,880
something that you're
gathering information on.

175
00:09:10,996 --> 00:09:12,670
There's also no details beyond the name.

176
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:15,140
So, we were just sort of describing things

177
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,560
that you could gather,

178
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,290
but there's no information on
what we really meant by that.

179
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,390
We sort of hope that you'd
interpret it correctly

180
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:23,992
and no descriptions behind them.

181
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,099
So, we've done two releases
last year to improve this,

182
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,920
our first release in ATT&CK version nine

183
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,719
that came out in April, 2021.

184
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,470
We started adding a
little bit of structure

185
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,260
to our data sources.

186
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,689
And so this idea of data
sources and data components.

187
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,130
Data source being the thing

188
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,610
that you're gathering the information on

189
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,950
and the component being
the specific activity

190
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,950
that you're gathering information about.

191
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:55,250
Now, the originally when we
released this in version nine,

192
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,860
if you clicked on these data sources,

193
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,880
you actually went to a GitHub site,

194
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,823
you're looking at a YAML file.

195
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,360
That's not really ideal,

196
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,800
that's not how we normally
build things in ATT&CK.

197
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,252
We do things in STIX here.

198
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,313
So we fix that in October.

199
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:16,077
On October, 2021, we
released our current version

200
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,070
of enterprise data sources,

201
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,400
where data sources are now an object.

202
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,800
There's data sources tab at
the top of the tech website.

203
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,170
You can go into them,

204
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,579
you can see what techniques

205
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,430
that a particular data
source is relevant to.

206
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,469
And we're seeing a number
of sort of our power users

207
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,880
taking advantage of this and looking at,

208
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,560
what sorts of techniques you can gather

209
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,453
with specific information.

210
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,199
And like I said, since it's us,

211
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,303
it's of course in STIX 2.

212
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,530
Yeah, STIX 2, but it,

213
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,280
yeah, 'cause anything that's
actually on the ATT&CK website,

214
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,380
other than things like documents
and lists of conferences

215
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,770
is generated from our STIX repository.

216
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,270
It's not the other way around.

217
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,150
And so these objects are out there,

218
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,949
you can actually use 'em, do processing,

219
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,023
take a look at what's inside
each of these data sources.

220
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,199
Something that hasn't
changed in the last two years

221
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,893
is ATT&CK's community.

222
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,560
So ATTACK, and again, with an A,

223
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,132
that Blake's original preferred spelling,

224
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,439
was originally built,

225
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,930
primarily using adversary data

226
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,849
that might have gathered
doing deception ops

227
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,323
against APT actors.

228
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,069
And so if you think back to 2013,

229
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,450
there really wasn't
much threat intelligence

230
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,880
reporting available out there.

231
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,620
There wasn't a lot of talk
about adversary behaviors,

232
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,290
you had some people publishing IOCs,

233
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,230
but there wasn't much for us to work from

234
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,683
in terms of reporting, so we
had to use some of our own.

235
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,010
Since then, since the ATT&CK was released

236
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,490
to the public in 2015,

237
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,680
it's the community that's
kept us going ever since.

238
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,439
So it's the contributions
that we have coming in

239
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,970
from well, you, that are
letting us actually understand

240
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,760
what adversaries are doing,

241
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,860
what sorts of groups we
should be focusing in on

242
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,760
and what pieces of software
we should be adding to ATT&CK.

243
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,370
And so this is a slide

244
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:30,263
that has actually been used in
a couple of these talks now.

245
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,903
It's getting a touch unreadable.

246
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,689
So, and here's why,

247
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:43,690
we now have 308
organizations and individuals

248
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,473
who are named contributors to ATT&CK.

249
00:12:47,404 --> 00:12:50,030
That's not everyone, so some people ask us

250
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,209
not to credit their contributions.

251
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,730
They don't wanna put their name out there.

252
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:59,600
They may have rules around what
they can brand as their own,

253
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,963
and it's been growing too.

254
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,780
So in 2019, the last
year we had ATT&CK on,

255
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,510
we had 82 named contributors.

256
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,110
2020, we had 130.

257
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,283
And in 2021, we had 155.

258
00:13:14,121 --> 00:13:16,403
And 155 is a lot of you.

259
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,970
And you think of what we're processing.

260
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,500
We're trying to do a better job

261
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,080
on getting down the amount of time

262
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,410
that it takes to process
contributions, get back to you,

263
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,329
and apologize where it
does take a long time.

264
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,340
But we are getting a
lot of new information

265
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,550
and a lot of new contributors
into the framework.

266
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:39,300
One more stat as we're
continuing to other slide

267
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,380
and add contributors,

268
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,193
we're also down to 4.5 font to
make this work, sorry, Katie.

269
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,883
So that's the past, what about the future?

270
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,900
So first of all, ATT&CK for mobile.

271
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,910
I hinted at this earlier

272
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,800
that we've done stuff for
sub-techniques in enterprise,

273
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,589
people seem to like it,

274
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,530
and we've got some of the same problems,

275
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,766
maybe won't fit on a PowerPoint slide,

276
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:13,670
but the unevenness that's
happening in the parts of ATT&CK

277
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,969
we haven't gone there yet.

278
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,760
So we're about to release
a sub-technique beta

279
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,830
for ATT&CK for mobile.

280
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,993
So as we're coming in ATT&CK
able release version 11.

281
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,020
And so the ATT&CK for mobile team

282
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,540
has actually spent all of this past year

283
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,949
working on this internally.

284
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,610
So implementing sub-techniques,

285
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,910
moving their information over to it.

286
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,170
And we think those of you
that are interested in the iOS

287
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,652
and Android security space
are gonna find this useful.

288
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,380
So final release, similar
to how we did sub-techniques

289
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,150
and ATT&CK for enterprise,

290
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:56,090
we're planning on changing the
beta into the final release

291
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,300
sometime in the summer,

292
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,199
depending on what sorts of feedback we get

293
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,683
and how much we have to
change from the beta.

294
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,770
We're gonna be continuing this trend too

295
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:10,050
of taking features that we
first released in enterprise

296
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,930
and bringing those to
other parts of ATT&CK.

297
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,420
So data sources are coming up

298
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,599
in the same sorts of forms as you find

299
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,423
in ATT&CK for enterprise
and mobile as well.

300
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,970
So I've stolen most of my thunder

301
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,450
on talking about the future

302
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,800
and I'm gonna be having my
leads over the next two days,

303
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,819
give updates on a lot of their areas.

304
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,610
So I'm gonna give a preview,

305
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,220
hopefully get you back to
their individual talks,

306
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,103
but there's much more to
come on each of these areas.

307
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,540
The first is defensive ATT&CK

308
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,199
coming up just at 1:30 today.

309
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,260
Lex Crumpton from on the side,

310
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,939
gonna be talking about some of the work

311
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,410
that we're doing now,

312
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:00,510
moving from data sources
to refactoring detections.

313
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,650
So if you followed the changes we've made

314
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,709
over the past couple years,

315
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,880
there's been this trend
to take blobs of text

316
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,670
and turn them into more structured data.

317
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:14,670
So mitigations, data
sources and now detections.

318
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,319
And we're also gonna be tying those

319
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,180
to individual data sources and components.

320
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,829
So if you have a detection,

321
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:24,040
what is it you need to gather
to do that one detection?

322
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,839
In the past, you've sort of had
to guess what the mapping is

323
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,630
between the blob of detection we write,

324
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,000
the data sources we list,

325
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,400
and we're gonna be making
up some more explicit.

326
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,329
Lex also gonna be talking

327
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,530
about some upcoming changes to car.

328
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,350
So something I know a
lot of you are fan of,

329
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,790
but we do have some plans in store

330
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,593
for car in the future as well.

331
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,140
This afternoon, our threat
intelligence lead, Matt Malone,

332
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,050
is gonna be talking about campaigns.

333
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,449
So as threat intelligence person,

334
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,780
I'm actually really
excited about this update.

335
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,589
We're going to be doing some restructuring

336
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,503
to groups in ATT&CK.

337
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,899
So today when we have a group and ATT&CK,

338
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,640
we have these associated
group descriptions.

339
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,170
We have basically all of the reporting

340
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,740
that people have tied back
to this one group over time

341
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,880
in their reporting.

342
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,990
So like APT29, we've tied together

343
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,990
things like Nobelium, YTTRIUM
the Cozy Bear, the Dukes,

344
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,359
altogether into one piece.

345
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:32,159
Well, we actually did a lot of
work doing separate tracking

346
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,950
for the events around
solar winds last year.

347
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,910
So we had built up this data

348
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,777
and then when U.S government
came out and said,

349
00:17:39,777 --> 00:17:42,940
"It's APT29," we pulled it together,

350
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,860
we sort of lost that distinction.

351
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,699
And so we'd like to get
that distinction back.

352
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,440
We also have a problem in ATT&CK

353
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,440
where we today only will do
reporting unnamed groups.

354
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,530
So somebody's got a great
threat report they've put out,

355
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,960
describes tons of adversary behavior,

356
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,710
gets to the end and they don't name it.

357
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,588
And they don't tie it to any other report.

358
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:10,440
Today we wouldn't add it to ATT&CK.

359
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,440
So we only add groups

360
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,040
that people have actually put a name to,

361
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,253
have called the group into ATT&CK

362
00:18:16,253 --> 00:18:19,790
because we're not the ones
sort of creating the space.

363
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,500
With campaigns we'll be doing things

364
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,340
that just have identifiers

365
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,439
and allow us to add some of these reports.

366
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,050
Trying to not to hit the laser button

367
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,103
while I'm pointing the
pointer at everybody.

368
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,610
Tomorrow morning, Otis Alexander

369
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,889
is gonna be talking about ATT&CK

370
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,170
for Industrial Control Systems.

371
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,670
So something I'm really excited about.

372
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,490
And some of you may be sad

373
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,920
if you really love the MediaWiki,

374
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,750
is that ATT&CK for ICS is
moving into attack.mitre.org.

375
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,680
So it's gonna join the website

376
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,100
along with ATT&CK for enterprise,

377
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,500
along with ATT&CK for mobile

378
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,410
and sort of be full-fledged
member of the team.

379
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,460
So we've already been releasing it in STIX

380
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,410
for a couple of releases now,

381
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,693
but it's all gonna be coming together.

382
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,100
They're also doing work to expand assets

383
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,659
and how they talk about
different types of devices

384
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,100
that are specific to the
industrial control space.

385
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,110
And keeping up with this
theme of mobile and ICS,

386
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,580
moving towards parody with enterprise,

387
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,513
adding detections to ICS.

388
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,770
It's been a space that's
taken a little while,

389
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,860
not necessarily as much gets published

390
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:35,070
on how you defend against
specific actions in the ICS space.

391
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,620
But we think that we now are at a point

392
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,120
where we can actually talk
about it intelligently.

393
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,000
Mac and Linux ATT&CK.

394
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So we released ATT&CK for Mac
and Linux way back in 2017.

395
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,760
And it was the work of
Cody Thomas primarily.

396
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,540
And he did a lot of
good work in the space,

397
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,360
but it really didn't get
a lot of love after that.

398
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,340
So we don't see a ton of
contributions in that space.

399
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,053
And so our eyes tend not to go places.

400
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:12,223
We have some exceptions
tend to go to that space,

401
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,590
unless we're seeing stuff coming in.

402
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,310
So we wanted to go back

403
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:19,480
and actually put some
specific attention into it.

404
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,650
And so Cat Self who's also
gonna be coming to you

405
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,010
from the ATT&CKcon couch

406
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:27,870
is focusing on updating our
Mac and Linux techniques

407
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,149
going through the entire framework.

408
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,750
We've done a lot of work with Mac already,

409
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,160
we're just starting in on Linux

410
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,740
and she'll be talking about more details

411
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,523
for just before lunch talk tomorrow.

412
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,250
Finally, Jared Ondricek,
our development lead,

413
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,200
is gonna be talking tomorrow afternoon.

414
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,939
So a lot of people are familiar with tech,

415
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,650
have seen the stuff we've
put out in terms of our STIX

416
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,360
and our actual website,

417
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,479
but not necessarily all of you've seen

418
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,440
some of the code we've put out.

419
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,410
So for quite a long time now

420
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,330
we've been releasing open source programs,

421
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,310
whether it's our website,
ATT&CK navigator,

422
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:07,929
whether it's for manipulating layer files

423
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,453
in ATT&CK navigator.

424
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,550
We put out there GitHub,

425
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,070
and so Jared's gonna get
into some of those resources

426
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,562
that you can put to use.

427
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,100
But there's one more thing.

428
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,556
So, we haven't yet announced

429
00:21:24,556 --> 00:21:27,620
when the next release of ATT&CK is.

430
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,882
And so we decided to
put it on the best date.

431
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,270
(audience chuckles)

432
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:37,062
So the next ATT&CK release
will be April 25th.

433
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,573
And so, just coming next month.

434
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,980
It's Monday, which is a
little bit unusual for us,

435
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,873
but we will try to make that work.

436
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:53,610
So, we've intentionally
left decent amount of time

437
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:58,203
for questions, 'cause we thought
you might have some for me.

438
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,120
So with that, I'm gonna,

439
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,610
since this is our first talk with Q and A,

440
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,600
Jamie's gonna be leading our Q and A

441
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,310
through the rest of the conference.

442
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,950
So we don't have a audience mic,

443
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:12,970
if somebody is asking questions,

444
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:13,900
he'll be repeating it

445
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,650
to make sure that people
in the audience have.

446
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:18,220
And he is also watching
our slack for any questions

447
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,170
that come in from there.

448
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,003
- First off, thank you.

449
00:22:21,003 --> 00:22:23,520
And while folks, take
your last sip of coffee

450
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,690
and get those questions geared up,

451
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,200
we did have some amazing
comments in slack.

452
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,000
First off, the question
from Barry Anderson,

453
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,433
what do you think about the
prospect of sub contributors?

454
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:34,967
- Sub contributors?

455
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:36,300
- Yeah.

456
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,470
- I feel like we're getting to that point.

457
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:40,410
I think you said 4.5 font,
that's a little hard to track.

458
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,630
- Oh, so to condense it, yeah.

459
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,530
I think we're probably gonna
have to retire that slide

460
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,160
after this or I'm just gonna
show a blurry image with lines

461
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,660
and not even bother to
fill in the real data, but.

462
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,060
- So, like Adam said,

463
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,149
we have about eight minutes
or so before we go to break,

464
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,850
but at this point, we really
do want to hear from you.

465
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:00,899
This is one of those opportunities,

466
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,960
we did an AMA during the pandemic.

467
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,670
It was a great time
for us, we had a blast,

468
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:08,620
any questions from the audience?

469
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:11,652
Don't be shy, feel free, just
throw a hand up or stand up.

470
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,590
Oh, question over here.

471
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,590
(speaker inaudible)

472
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,420
And for our friends on the
live stream, the question was,

473
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,100
is there any plans to go in more depth

474
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,590
regarding data sources and components,

475
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,709
particularly mapping
those to particular logs,

476
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,900
particular events,

477
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,670
especially as we begin
to unpack the nuances

478
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,460
of different types platforms?

479
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,410
Differences between Windows
logging and Mac OS logging.

480
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,500
- Actually, Jamie, I might
kick that one back to you.

481
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,900
- Yep, perfect, yes.

482
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,480
That is something we were
really excited about,

483
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,420
in terms of building out
the data source objects,

484
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,780
is we went with this mentality of,

485
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,997
if you build it, they will come.

486
00:23:55,997 --> 00:23:58,850
And really giving folks a
chance and opportunity in space

487
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,730
to deliver those contributions.

488
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,620
So you might have noticed now,

489
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,629
even with ATT&CK version
10, we have data sources,

490
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,490
we have data components

491
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,490
and then those data component definitions,

492
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,250
we did begin to start list examples

493
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,740
of this is sometimes known
as this amount of event one

494
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,730
or a 4688.

495
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,120
We really do want to hear from you

496
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,100
in terms of how are you folks

497
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,770
actually detecting these
adversary behaviors?

498
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,000
Are there particular logs
or particular prevents

499
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,830
that have really helped you?

500
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,500
'Cause Lex is gonna
present this later today

501
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,900
and Adam kind of teased
it, but for version 11,

502
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,150
we will be merging those detections

503
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,870
and data components together.

504
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,800
So the more rich and nuance

505
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,649
we can really get in
depth there the better,

506
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,420
'cause one of the big things about ATT&CK

507
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,560
is we're not just documenting
the adversary perspective,

508
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,000
we really are trying to connect

509
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,930
that back to defensive countermeasures

510
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,400
and really make it impactful for you.

511
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,671
So, great question, thank you.

512
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:51,421
We're here.

513
00:24:51,421 --> 00:24:54,421
(speaker inaudible)

514
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,379
- So for the question
for the live audience

515
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,490
is what is the status of navigator

516
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:04,310
and what's the future
look like for that tool?

517
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:07,713
- Yeah, so tech navigators
on your active development,

518
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,460
we actually, Jared will
be talking about some work

519
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,760
that's been done on it lately.

520
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,070
There are number of improvements
that we're hoping to see

521
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:20,149
in terms of its ability to
display data, work with it.

522
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:23,450
And so some people are using
it and have been using it

523
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,193
as an alternate way to
view ATT&CK over time.

524
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,470
But there are no plans to really diverge

525
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,310
from where we are now,

526
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,379
where we've got attack.mitre.org,

527
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,710
which has all of the information behind it

528
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:40,203
and ATT&CK navigator, which
is a way to deal with,

529
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,200
focus on sort of picking techniques.

530
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,940
So which techniques are
going for a particular group

531
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,550
or problem or defense

532
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:51,193
without sort of the full data behind them.

533
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,130
- So we had, oh, one sec.

534
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,990
We had a great question from online

535
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,930
or I think she, I think
Tim might be in the room.

536
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,710
So I think it's your birthday as well,

537
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,550
so either happy birthday or happy belated.

538
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:04,620
So a lot of folks, oh, amazing.

539
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,159
A lot of folks might have
actually, as you said,

540
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,520
just noticed the network platform.

541
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,230
How would you describe the scope

542
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,113
of what that platform
is trying to capture?

543
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,090
- I wrote, right now

544
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:20,360
it's pretty specifically
routers and switches.

545
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,320
So we have left it open

546
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,300
as the possibility of getting broader.

547
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,230
So that's not a scoping decision

548
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,730
that we wanted to keep it to that.

549
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:33,710
That's where we had enough
data to talk about it.

550
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,770
And if you look to the contributions,

551
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:40,190
it was heavily from Cisco.

552
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,940
We had a ton of contributions from there,

553
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,010
but as well as a number of other sources.

554
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:49,730
And so, we really appreciated
some of the publishing

555
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,260
that happened around that,

556
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,500
where there is a bit more
information now on threats

557
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,300
that have actually happened in the past,

558
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,930
stuff that we're able
to cite as references.

559
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,890
And so we felt that we'd
reached the threshold

560
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,610
to be able to talk about that space,

561
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,870
but in order to be able
to sort of broaden it,

562
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:09,760
we would need to see more
publication out there.

563
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,670
So the two things that we look for

564
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:14,127
to publish a technique and ATT&CK

565
00:27:14,127 --> 00:27:17,830
are that there is a
publicly citable description

566
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,550
of the technique.

567
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:22,200
So that could be anything from...

568
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,710
Somebody tweeted and said,
"An adversary did this,"

569
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:30,333
or I could do this or a black
hat talk or an ATT&CKcon talk,

570
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:35,920
talking about something that
could be done or has been done.

571
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,100
And then we're looking for
that proof that it's been done

572
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,909
by somebody in the wild,

573
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:43,050
that might be somebody
whispering in her ear,

574
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:46,010
that might be a public
threat intelligence report.

575
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:48,410
And now not necessarily something we cite,

576
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,260
it does need to be of course unclass.

577
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:56,170
But so it's finding that
threshold in different spaces

578
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,800
can sometimes be challenging

579
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,500
and that's definitely been one of them.

580
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,290
- I think we have time for
maybe one or two more questions.

581
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,389
I think there was one.

582
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,682
- [Man] Yeah, so now that we have ability,

583
00:28:08,682 --> 00:28:11,682
(speaker inaudible)

584
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:18,250
In its own way, I'm
wondering in the future,

585
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:22,787
would there be any interest
in possibly creating objects

586
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,100
for investigations that are
like follow up investigations

587
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,139
around the data components?

588
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,760
- So for the audience online,

589
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,690
the question very nuanced and
very awesome question was,

590
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,910
now that we're starting
to kind of really dive

591
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,320
into the detection side of ATT&CK

592
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,760
and we're building out these data sources

593
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,180
and data components,

594
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,720
how far are we interested in going

595
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,690
in terms of investigations
and other categories

596
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,900
beyond just the detection
engineering perspective?

597
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,010
And I can...

598
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,040
- Yeah, so it's an interesting question.

599
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,770
So, I don't think we've thought
too hard down that path.

600
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,350
I mean, we obviously have gone down

601
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:03,719
into some things like specific
implementations of detections

602
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,520
and things like cyber
analytics repository,

603
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,270
but sort of going down that path

604
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,793
of pulling it together
into investigations.

605
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:14,179
I don't know if we'd go there,

606
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:18,380
so there is a line where
we're trying to keep stuff

607
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,850
general enough to be able to work

608
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,592
for basically all defenders,

609
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,500
but it's certainly an interesting puzzle.

610
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,610
Jamie, I didn't know if
you wanted to add to that?

611
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,840
- I think it ties back to the,

612
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,220
if we build it, they will come,

613
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,270
that's something where, like Adam said,

614
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,070
we try to not be prescriptive

615
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,980
and say like, this is the best
way you're gonna do cyber,

616
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,500
this is the best approach for you,

617
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,820
rather than kind of
connect you to those ideas.

618
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,939
So I think it might be something

619
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,550
where maybe we can prototype it,

620
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:45,409
maybe we can collaborate and see like,

621
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,566
start with a Spreadsheet and build it

622
00:29:46,566 --> 00:29:47,410
and see what it looks like,

623
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,400
and then if it makes sense
for a broad community,

624
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,570
definitely something we
maybe interested in pursuing.

625
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:53,403
So I think you said,

626
00:29:53,403 --> 00:29:55,600
I think like exactly to
the heart of your question,

627
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,030
the detection and
defensive side is much more

628
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,780
than just alerts and monitoring.

629
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,244
So really thank you.

630
00:30:02,244 --> 00:30:05,624
I think we have one time
for the final question, yes.

631
00:30:05,624 --> 00:30:08,624
(speaker inaudible)

632
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,270
- Oh, for the live
audience, the question was,

633
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,800
have we thought about
characterizing supply chain

634
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,870
and infections and really
that kind of diving

635
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,389
in a really deep dive into that space?

636
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,300
- So we do have techniques
for each of those

637
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,740
in ATT&CK today.

638
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,070
So we do have a supply chain technique,

639
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:35,743
we do go into each of those areas a bit.

640
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,030
We've gotten the proposal

641
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:41,730
of doing like an entire
supply chain framework

642
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:45,530
to just expanding out that area.

643
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:48,250
Right now inside enterprise ATT&CK,

644
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,330
it is sort of in line

645
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,320
with how we cover the rest of techniques.

646
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,450
So doing a huge bulk up there

647
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,883
would be a little out of place.

648
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:01,370
But there is the possibility
to improve those techniques,

649
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:04,350
expand it in place,
possibly sub-techniques.

650
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,020
And so a lot of that's gonna be driven

651
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,210
by what we see for contributions, so--

652
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,600
- You know the inbox.

653
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,149
- Yeah, if you have suggestions

654
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:14,950
on some specifics to add, so we're...

655
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,580
- With that, I think we came
right in our time for break.

656
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,210
So thank you for indulging us

657
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,360
and for those on the live stream

658
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,899
and those in the room as well,

659
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,750
we will be sending over to
Cat on the ATT&CKcon couch.

660
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:30,260
So, stay tuned and see
you in about 30 minutes.
