1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,440
with the attack on couch and we have

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,920
with us olaf and johnny who just got

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,840
done presenting on

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,279
the insight into data sources um

5
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,359
so thank you guys so much for your talk

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,359
i know how much work it goes into taking

7
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,960
like doing one of these talks

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,199
um i really liked how you guys scoped

9
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,960
everything down there's just those five

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,040
techniques like that was really helpful

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,239
because i think sometimes when you get

12
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,000
into these talks it's like

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,840
well everything's important

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,320
but then nothing's important so you

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,960
can't really get into anything um so i

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,399
really love that just excellent

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,239
excellent talk um

18
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,920
so really quick there is a question in

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,360
slack that i wanted to bring up just to

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,640
start it off

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,600
um

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,520
so thank you guys so much for posting

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,719
your questions and slack we really

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,440
appreciate it the question is um any

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,600
tips for being able to

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,760
reduce the um

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,359
the noise for when you're trying to

28
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,400
access like process access um i believe

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,320
yeah reduction of events for when you're

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,920
trying to access process access yeah

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,080
it's definitely a hard problem to solve

32
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,760
because i think there's definitely a lot

33
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,759
of different avenues you could go

34
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,159
um i've seen within i'll say this the

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,400
majority of organizations when coming to

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,080
those like bitwise operations that i was

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,000
talking about um the majority of

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,280
analytic platforms um can't actually

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,280
perform a type of technology yet so if

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,560
you're utilizing this you can't

41
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,240
necessarily do that so it'd be very

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,400
specific on the access mask

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,759
that you are

44
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,600
looking for inside your data analytic

45
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,600
which is which can be tough and easily

46
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,560
bypassable um i would say for like in a

47
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,680
data collection standpoint um

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,880
there's a couple different ways so you

49
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,920
can either

50
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,159
um look for the commonalities of

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,520
different source processes and the

52
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,119
target images that they're accessing

53
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,360
it's like for example is a highly

54
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,880
accessed process

55
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,159
and like sbc host for example

56
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,439
is um

57
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:02,880
all like typically dropped to handle

58
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,960
that quite often and so i've seen some

59
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,479
environments they'll take that out or

60
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,800
they'll take out instances where the

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,160
access mask

62
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,000
is only like a couple of different

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,520
values and so they're only looking for

64
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,640
those um those are a couple avenues

65
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,400
that some people can take yeah

66
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,200
nice

67
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,080
very cool

68
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,680
i just do you want to call out i really

69
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,800
like how you guys during your

70
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,319
presentation kind of this reverse

71
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,319
approach where you're like okay if i

72
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,920
wanted to do this

73
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,000
then what access would i need and then

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,680
like going and looking at that access

75
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,360
and then asking yourself okay

76
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,640
like what am i really trying to

77
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,480
accomplish if i do like if i need this

78
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,599
access what am i really trying to

79
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,440
accomplish like there was a point in

80
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,400
there when you were talking about like

81
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,239
the logical steps like the human behind

82
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,480
it that i just really appreciated and

83
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,800
then you also mentioned sub data sources

84
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,040
which i love so what do you guys think

85
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,200
of the talk that lex gave about the data

86
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,319
sources and all the future work that

87
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,200
we're going to do on attack

88
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,040
i'm super stoked about it i think um the

89
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,800
the mappings that is going to be inside

90
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,959
of niter is like pretty next level and i

91
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,159
think that's something that everyone

92
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,400
really needs um and then kind of like

93
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,760
what i mentioned to jamie just like

94
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,040
mapping

95
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,680
mapping those to like event ids as well

96
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,440
is going to be a huge benefit for the

97
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,680
community so i'm super stoked about that

98
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,080
yeah so for me i think that is a thing

99
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,080
that has been coming for years or should

100
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,280
have been coming for years and then a

101
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,200
lot of research being done

102
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,360
by a small group in the industry right

103
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,519
there's a bunch of people that know this

104
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,040
by heart

105
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,200
and a lot of people don't so getting

106
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,519
them started by having a certain

107
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,959
direction where they actually can do

108
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,560
something with it will be super

109
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,080
beneficial i think

110
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,840
over time it will probably go even

111
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,239
deeper to most valuable fields within a

112
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,239
data

113
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,080
so what's your favorite data source in

114
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,640
mac os

115
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,080
uh we're gonna have technical

116
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,159
difficulties guys so sorry actually in

117
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,959
the meantime um for those of you that

118
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,200
are doing the attack con memes

119
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,280
like that flag is still up for grabs so

120
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,640
we'll make the decision at the end of

121
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,439
the either today or tomorrow and then

122
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,959
we'll be rewarding that flag so

123
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,560
definitely have good memes like how to

124
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,880
use attack i think one of my favorites

125
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,079
was um

126
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,519
the face that you get when you realize

127
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,040
how many techniques there are on attack

128
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,199
that was awesome so all right but back

129
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,120
to my sneak attack question oh yeah the

130
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,199
mac data sources so that's a difficult

131
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,040
one because getting it from the host

132
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,160
itself

133
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,080
the esf with the endpoint security

134
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,080
framework is so fast

135
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,560
it's almost a fire hose um

136
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,160
but it's for research it's amazing

137
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,759
there's so many good stuff that you

138
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,080
could be able to detect if

139
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,400
there would be a great tool to ingest it

140
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,120
so i'm working a lot with some edr's

141
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,160
um

142
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,400
and they haven't really committed to

143
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,240
going there so usually it's like file

144
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,800
creation network events process creation

145
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,400
process commands

146
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,880
maybe scripts a bit and that then it's

147
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,840
there

148
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,560
and that's sadly the fact that we have

149
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,560
now and we have to deal with but yeah

150
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,080
i'm putting some pressure on some of the

151
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,240
edr vendors that i work with at least to

152
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,320
get more i know that they're working on

153
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,840
it but it's probably

154
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,800
more difficult than i expected to be

155
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,080
esf is great but it's also a little bit

156
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,800
weird sometimes because it's so fire

157
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,360
hosey that it even drops stuff so that

158
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,600
might also be a problem for them i don't

159
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,800
know but

160
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,240
hopefully this year there will be some

161
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,199
great

162
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,560
leaps forward

163
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,400
fingers crossed infant could those are

164
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,720
too big yeah that's a real thing right

165
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,880
because most of the industry i see a

166
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,280
macbook here i have one in my backpack

167
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,440
there's a lot of people that do security

168
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,120
that work on a mac

169
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,600
whereas it's it's a it's an okay

170
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,400
platform but it's not as well known as

171
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,160
windows for instance but we are trying

172
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,039
to

173
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,800
defend with our macbooks which is kind

174
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,400
of weird yeah

175
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,960
so last question um really quick because

176
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,639
we had talked about this some before

177
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,960
hand and for those that are getting into

178
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,639
cyber security me and johnny were

179
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,720
talking earlier and he's got some really

180
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,400
great insight into like the things that

181
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,840
he's had to overcome getting into cyber

182
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,600
security so i wanted to ask you like

183
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,960
what are some obstacles you've kind of

184
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,520
overcome yeah um i would say um i kind

185
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,880
of mentioned this to jamie but don't be

186
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,199
scared right so um for anyone anyone

187
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,479
that doesn't know me i've only actually

188
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,600
been in industry i'm coming up on my

189
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,160
third year and i graduated college in

190
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,880
2019 and graduated high school in 2015.

191
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,039
when i went when i went into college i

192
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,880
knew nothing about computers and so

193
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,880
coming into the space it there's a it

194
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,720
can be very overwhelming and to pick

195
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,680
what you're interested in is hard um but

196
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,360
the biggest advice i can give is stay

197
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,280
motivated and dive head first and find

198
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,520
yourself a good mentor you know like um

199
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,479
actually it's funny because i was

200
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,759
telling all of this earlier he was

201
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,039
actually one of the first people i

202
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,880
followed on twitter and so he was like

203
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,560
one of my like original mentors matt

204
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,319
graber matt han some of my other current

205
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,319
mentors and find those people that you

206
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,800
can continuously ask questions to um to

207
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,720
challenge your assumptions and just keep

208
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,160
diving hard and

209
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,560
you know i think the community um

210
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,800
in general is always excited to learn so

211
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,960
just be excited to learn as well i love

212
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,400

we're super excited for

222
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,479
um

223
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,440
olaf told me a a nickname

224
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,319
i'm not gonna say

225
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,560
so

226
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,720
ah

227
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,800
whenever i get nervous i always like

228
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,879
this is funny i just say the worst like

229
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,960
i i definitely butcher everyone's name

230
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,759
so

231
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,280
how do i properly pronounce your name

232
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,080
well

233
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,960
in in dutch we say

234
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,960
but uh it's probably a bit more

235
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,360
difficult in in in

236
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,599
in english but uh

237
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,319
you can try it

238
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,199
no no no no i want to say something

239
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,000
for you

240
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,680
be on the safe side that's cool that's

241
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,520
cool cause there's like like i know in

242
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,199
dutch specifically there's actually like

243
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,599
parts of like there's sounds it's not in

244
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,919
english at all yeah so it's true yeah an

245
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,840
attempt to be able to do it because it's

246
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,440
i don't even know how to make that sound

247
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,319
yeah

248
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,639
so like i'm learning chinese and there's

249
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,680
certain sounds in chinese that like like

250
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,560
like

251
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,879
there is no english equivalent to this

252
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,799
yeah and in dutch we also have a lot of

253
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,958
words that are let's say

254
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,399
letters that are

255
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,919
for example

256
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,240
we can we can talk a lot a long a long

257
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,679
time about this

258
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,159
all right so i loved your talk on attack

259
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,160
and the evolution that was a really

260
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,760
really like

261
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
i know everyone in the attack team like

262
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,320
we really try to have this attitude of

263
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,360
a authenticity and be like we're here

264
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,519
like service like how can we make this

265
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,120
better for you all right

266
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,920
so

267
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,920
it's it was cool to see like adam up

268
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,120
there and jamie up there because they're

269
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,480
like yeah it's true you know

270
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,480
this is honest like let's be real yeah

271
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,800
um but i also appreciate like your full

272
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,120
scope on like how it's been useful right

273
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,200
like how it's evolved like it's not like

274
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,360
nothing is perfect in this world and

275
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,839
it's constantly evolving right

276
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,600
yeah i agree and i also think that this

277
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,839
is one of the uh the main things why i

278
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,839
thought of this talk was also to address

279
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,600
exactly that you know there's a lot of

280
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,519
people thinking that we everyone is

281
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,560
using it

282
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,040
and we all will think like that but is

283
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,040
that really the case and i tend to find

284
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,959
that not always the case

285
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,440
so i was talking in another interview

286
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,600
way back when um and

287
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,600
they were telling me that

288
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,760
sometimes it's more detrimental to have

289
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,880
someone that thinks they know how to

290
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,160
apply attack

291
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,920
than actually having somebody apply

292
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,680
attack in an organization no and at

293
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,519
first i was like no no that can't be

294
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,600
true but then i like listening to your

295
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,040
talk i was like

296
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,040
that that's like this is a common theme

297
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,720
it's like people that are trying to

298
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,079
apply this but don't necessarily

299
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,640
understand it yeah exactly and and and

300
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,480
have the expertise to follow through

301
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,399
right if you start with that's what i

302
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,079
also said like it's easy to start doing

303
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,000
this because you know everyone is

304
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,920
standardized to it you know chop a tree

305
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,519
in a sec cyber security wood and it

306
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,959
falls on something that is mapped to

307
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,000
attack so so we adoption is easy but

308
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,839
then using it and then having the right

309
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,760
people to actually do that

310
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,240
and that is that is challenging

311
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,160
so how have you like

312
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,000
what are some indicators like between

313
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,760
noise like like oh that's just someone

314
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,600
marketing you know

315
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,800
this is legit like i need to pay

316
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,399
attention

317
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,240
yeah i i um

318
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,000
it's it's very difficult to give a

319
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,720
definitive answer but uh

320
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,399
there's some flags let's put it like

321
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,440
that so

322
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,279
if you if you usually see people you

323
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,839
know don't nuance it correctly then i

324
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,600
think that is sometimes an issue if they

325
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,680
just emphasize the usage of attack and

326
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,959
then i i i tend to see that people

327
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,600
like lacking that type of nuance you

328
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,440
know that's a red flag for me and then i

329
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,040
have to pry deeper and then and then

330
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,800
what you uncover is that people actually

331
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,399
don't use it

332
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,640
as they should or maybe just emphasize

333
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,440
it and and maybe use marketing uh

334
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,519
nonsense for example yeah we have a mark

335
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,279
the the attack stamp but we don't know

336
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,399
how the heck we should use it

337
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,560
so you're like you gave some awesome

338
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,440
solutions for that in your talk um

339
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,680
and then

340
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,959
so i guess you could say like we have

341
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,360
like a good chunk of viewers online um

342
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,120
is there any like key tips you would

343
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,880
take kind of like for like so for you

344
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,480
guys at home getting started with this

345
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,680
are there any tips that you would give

346
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,079
them

347
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,120
yeah

348
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,320
i mean the first thing is is and i think

349
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,000
i'm repeating what probably the previous

350
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,480
speakers have already said so

351
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,480
uh one thing i do see is it's easy to

352
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,120
start using it but just use it as is use

353
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,839
it as as as the templated version as in

354
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,519
the standardization part there's a lot

355
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,320
of issues that are revolving around it

356
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,000
and some of the limitations i addressed

357
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,880
today

358
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,279
so do do consider these as points of

359
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,320
attention for your security program but

360
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,959
using it as is is key and

361
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,880
just start using it but then also you

362
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,959
know second make sure that you

363
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,279
understand the implications of that

364
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,440
and that you when you start using it or

365
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,360
act heavily using it you have to do you

366
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,279
know stuff like feedback you know where

367
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,360
it relates back into your team

368
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,760
and that is uh yeah i i that is also one

369
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,360
of the main things i wanted to address

370
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,600
in my talk is is that i don't think that

371
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,320
is happening often and i and i think

372
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,160
you know the minor team is willing to

373
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,800
learn and uh yeah i think that is uh

374
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,639
that is super awesome and and and to

375
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,519
give an example so the previous uh the

376
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,000
previous dude in here olaf we we

377
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,240
actually had some talks uh uh i think a

378
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,320
couple years back it was we're trying to

379
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,480
hack something you know excel related

380
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
we're trying to hack attack into excel

381
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,360
because

382
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,519
excel right um and then and then you

383
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,360
know we were like hacking at it but we

384
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
were like why isn't this you know why

385
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,120
isn't this feature in there so we're

386
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,720
like

387
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
we're like going into like okay we might

388
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,160
need to have that conversation with the

389
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,920
admirer team we had that conversation

390
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,279
and actually that function got rolled

391
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,920
out pretty quickly so feedback did work

392
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,760
uh it worked really well and actually we

393
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,440
got something we could actually use so

394
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,399
all happy

395
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,680
so are you talking about is that the

396
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,600
tool that like literally translates

397
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
attack into excel the export thingy i

398
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,760
have used that myself when i'm trying to

399
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,680
do metrics and like coverages so that's

400
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,920
exactly so that's where that comes thank

401
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,440
you i i thank you it wasn't me yeah so

402
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,200
i'm just addressing some of the the

403
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,680
points of attention you know because i i

404
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,760
tend to believe that if if if two people

405
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,440
are already wanting it then i think you

406
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,760
know maybe more of them need it as well

407
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,760
and and and it's not about me but it's

408
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,519
about the team that actually built that

409
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,839
and provost that and i think yeah it's a

410
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,519
testament to all the people good people

411
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,440
at the minor team working on that well i

412
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,240
mean i think that says a lot right like

413
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,040
like

414
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,320
you're here at attack on speaking like

415
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,639
you have just you went your presentation

416
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,560
just went over the evolution of us and

417
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,600
you've been

418
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,680
not just a passive watcher but like an

419
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,440
active participant and trying to apply

420
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,519
it like there's a lot of tribal and

421
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,800
internal knowledge that you get just

422
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,199
from being around an industry let alone

423
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,199
embedded in it right so

424
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,279
like i don't want to be too dismissive

425
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,880
of like well we thought this would be it

426
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
was just two of us but like

427
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,959
because the reality is is like you guys

428
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,320
are kind of

429
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,560
the ones that are like lack of a better

430
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,320
term like my army's coming out like

431
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,000
boots on the ground like you're doing it

432
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,760
you know like there's a perspective that

433
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,440
only the practitioners will ever be able

434
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,320
to have

435
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,760
i i think that's really cool that you

436
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,000
touch upon that guy i think that the

437
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,079
practitioners don't don't think about

438
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:44,959
that

439
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,199
and they just think you know

440
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,279
i found this little thing and it doesn't

441
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,600
fit

442
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,320
and i'm like yeah but you can actually

443
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,920
have a conversation about that and

444
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,600
people are willing to do something about

445
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,760
it so so again i also want to take this

446
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,480
opportunity to to encourage everyone to

447
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,040
to to to highlight that to to talk about

448
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,519
that you know you can connect it with uh

449
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,440
slack and i'm not getting paid by my

450
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,680
full disclosure

451
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,839
i i think that that emphasis is not

452
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,920
happening enough and and you know that's

453
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,839
what i at least wants to make

454
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,720
i so appreciate that um checking really

455
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,839
quick for any questions um so i am

456
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,440
definitely checking for questions inside

457
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,360
of slack so if you guys have any please

458
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,759
let me know um

459
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,160
let's see

460
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,079
if you have any tips for completing an

461
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,040
exercise that is a thought exercise

462
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,480
um

463
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,480
like how accurate do you think those

464
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,240
exercises really are

465
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,160
for thought exercise actually yeah

466
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,079
thought exercises

467
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,079
yeah so thought exercises are good

468
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,120
except

469
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,399
i tend to work not in thought exercises

470
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,959
i encourage everyone to adopt a son or

471
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,040
sort of like a scenario based defense

472
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,240
concept

473
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,560
and and that could be you know thinking

474
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,320
of the broader spectrum of what kind of

475
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,639
threats is your team dealing with and

476
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,639
and working that through

477
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,800
what are more of the and this may sound

478
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,199
like intel jargon but i i like to think

479
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,959
you know there's only a couple of things

480
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,560
that actually work in your environment

481
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,800
or maybe could be relevant and you can

482
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
nuance it greatly but still having a

483
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,440
good understanding of that you know and

484
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,720
hypothesize that you know then you can

485
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,880
make a selection maybe we should have a

486
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,839
team focus or hunts on that and maybe we

487
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,759
should have a team maybe the intel team

488
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,360
work a bit through some of these more

489
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,959
abstract things and make it into more

490
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,720
tangible scenarios

491
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,800
and you see that happening more and more

492
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,079
and you see that happening more and more

493
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,800
people detailing the scenario often

494
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,519
and i tend to have a lot of good um

495
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,079
good good responses from my clients that

496
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,240
they see that the scenario model works

497
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,600
because that allows them to actually

498
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,440
have a conversation with risk management

499
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,079
and then say okay so we tested this

500
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,680
what is the outcome is this actually a

501
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,920
risk we need to emphasize on so having

502
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,400
that understanding from a broad spectrum

503
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
i know i know i'm cutting some corners

504
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
here but uh having some having a broad

505
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,919
spectrum and working through tangible

506
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,079
scenarios i think that is key to the

507
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,839
people going from the adoption to the

508
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,880
usage

509
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,280
i think that's really practical advice

510
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,240
then can only be born of wisdom and

511
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,240
painful experience

512
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,480
painful lessons

513
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,000
like hopefully no one else has to go

514
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,079
through those lessons and i'd like to

515
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,760
see more of those lessons so i encourage

516
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,919
everyone to actually share those lessons

517
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:32,799
as well

518
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,640
the painful more painful the better

519
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,160
right yeah because then you're like okay

520
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,200
i'm not alone oh so no thank you so much

521
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,840
for your time presentation time here

522
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,600
really really appreciate your all your

523
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,360
wisdom that you shared thank you so much

524
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,520
guys have a great day you too

525
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,480
all right next we have up

526
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,559
uh lindsay and scott

527
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,640
and i just want to say i love the title

528
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,280
of this talk to the left of the boom

529
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,080
um prioritizing detections with intel i

530
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,000
think that is great thank you guys

531
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,960
you know when i came up with the title

532
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,760
i love it i think it's fantastic so

533
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,919
um so you guys released this open source

534
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,600
tool like i love how you went through

535
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,960
everything um

536
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,559
how like so is there a favorite talk

537
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,760
that you've had of the day like how have

538
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,360
you like how was it being here

539
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,200
i know we didn't get much time to talk

540
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,440
before this so like it's really cool so

541
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,280
i thought selena larson made some really

542
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,720
great points about really knowing your

543
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,080
audience because that's definitely

544
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,160
something that my team sees as relevant

545
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,440
you know all the time so we are an

546
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,440
internal front intelligence team and it

547
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,640
really is such a different experience

548
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,320
writing for you know an executive who's

549
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,240
reading our reports versus you know

550
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,160
other intelligent analysts versus the

551
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,360
people who really do want to see the eye

552
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,799
to screenshot so i want to see your eye

553
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,039
to screenshots maybe not everybody does

554
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,120
but would you like to sure so i was

555
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,039
going to say selena's as well so i'll go

556
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,600
with my fallback um i'll say johnny's in

557
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,760
olaf's talk was pretty amazing quite

558
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,440
honestly getting the chance to see them

559
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,039
speak in person that was the first time

560
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,640
and they both contributed so much to the

561
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,080
community so that was really exciting

562
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,160
for me but the level of technical

563
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,400
expertise that they have i guess it

564
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,120
shows the range of really deep technical

565
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,880
conversations and more higher level ones

566
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,919
here so i was awesome to see yeah i love

567
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,280
it um

568
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,240
so

569
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,080
let me actually go to slack because you

570
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,160
guys had a lot of questions and some

571
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,799
excellent conversation which i loved

572
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,559
and the downside of doing this live is i

573
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,640
haven't had a chance like look at these

574
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,640
episodes i'm hoping you skip the one

575
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,720
that i'm scared to answer so we're doing

576
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,039
some intel collection ourselves ahead of

577
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,039
time i love it there's one about threat

578
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,600
modeling yeah yeah that is the

579
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,320
that's a pretty well upvoted one um but

580
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,240
again like so i think the thing to

581
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,080
remember two of these questions is that

582
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,799
like

583
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,120
we're all human like not everyone can

584
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,799
know everything about everything right

585
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,720
so with the fact that you're here you're

586
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,160
doing a presentation the amount of work

587
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,679
that went into that presentation and

588
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,039
then you're releasing this open source

589
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,840
tool like

590
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,000
the questions are just questions right

591
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,600
sure thing so

592
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,600
um

593
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,360
so i will say like how does how about

594
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,080
this um

595
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,400
have you found any good models for um

596
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,880
that you found to apply to that tool

597
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,360
uh yeah so the the short answer

598
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,200
the question kind of came around like

599
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,080
looking at uh chains of behaviors and

600
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,919
how you would apply threat models to

601
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,679
that and so for that specifically the

602
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,120
short answer is no and that's why i was

603
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,799
scared to answer it it's an amazing

604
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,720
question that has like a ton of angles

605
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,679
to it i think um what i would suggest in

606
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,440
a case like that is mostly we're

607
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,280
recommending performing threat modeling

608
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,760
to surface adversaries specific actor

609
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,679
groups or malware that are kind of most

610
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,360
prominent and targeting certain

611
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,400
industries

612
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,919
when you're getting down to the level of

613
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,440
looking at uh specific attack chains it

614
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,960
almost becomes you need to look at that

615
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,200
specific instance and dig down into how

616
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,360
that adversary is deploying those

617
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,240
specific technique implementations and i

618
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,159
guess if there happens to be maybe some

619
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,320
overlap with some other techniques

620
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,559
within your model i would start focusing

621
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,240
on on those techniques and defending

622
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,720
against those but it's really tricky i'm

623
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,320
excited to see more and more focus

624
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,600
definitely at miter and just in the

625
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,360
industry on like attack chains and

626
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,679
patterns i think it's uh a good

627
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,000
direction that we're heading yeah

628
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,360
and to kind of add to that a little bit

629
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,080
about um what scott said about how

630
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,600
how are threat actors actually using

631
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,360
those techniques so for example lauben's

632
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,720
like i don't know if you've seen some of

633
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,240
the repositories that show all the art

634
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,600
of the possible but really instead of

635
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
kind of focusing on writing detections

636
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,440
for every single law been used in every

637
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,960
single way it's like what is actually

638
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,880
popular you know how are people using it

639
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,080
for the downloads and really kind of

640
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,640
using that um ground truth data to you

641
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,320
know back your detections out of as we

642
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
write them so we're not telling clients

643
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,520
to you know protect against this

644
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,039
theoretical use of the tool it's like no

645
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,039
this is what's actually happening making

646
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,280
sure that things are based on fact

647
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,640
i can see that because like there's only

648
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,039
so many ways to download like

649
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,440
a payload using powershell and there's

650
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,600
like they get reused again and again and

651
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,440
again and it's i could see definitely

652
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,400
focusing on those right so yeah awesome

653
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,840
i think um i think that's actually a

654
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,120
really good example though because

655
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,039
that's kind of my perception as well and

656
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,480
then looking at the tool i remember

657
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,840
seeing powershell come up there were

658
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,480
like around 200 detections for that so

659
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,799
some of that was certain detections

660
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,480
written in certain languages for

661
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,720
specific tools but i think it

662
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,640
demonstrates how many potential

663
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,400
implementations there are for certain

664
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,080
techniques at the same time so i do

665
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,600
think there's an upper limit but in some

666
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,840
cases it's really really high

667
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,919
as well do you think with the amount of

668
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,679
detections that there are that it kind

669
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,679
of creates a little too much noise

670
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,360
though absolutely yeah and i think

671
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,880
that's one of the challenges so i think

672
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,200
it's trying to figure out uh potentially

673
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,039
and you kind of hit a wall here as well

674
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,120
because you know a minor attack even

675
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,720
only goes to a certain level like

676
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,960
there's not identifiers for every single

677
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,120
procedure that exists that's a challenge

678
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,400
that i don't think anyone really has

679
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,000
figured out yet um if you're trying to

680
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,240
put in detections for all the specific

681
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,720
implementations it just becomes a huge

682
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,640
massive task

683
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,440
a little pessimistic yeah it's yeah it's

684
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,200
for sure it's like how to solve world

685
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,000
hunger you know it's like like bird like

686
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,080
where is it

687
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,120
yes for all of them um so

688
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,159
you guys are here um is there any kind

689
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,720
of we're with these amazing online

690
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,919
viewers are there is there anything that

691
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,919
you kind of want to tell them as far as

692
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,679
um

693
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,520
i'll just give you a softball question

694
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,280
um so what are some challenges that

695
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,600
you've had in this field and like and

696
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,039
kind of how have you overcome them

697
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,559
everything from i know we talked about

698
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,919
earlier with celine about imposter

699
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,600
syndrome with others it's been like how

700
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,720
to break in to the cyber security field

701
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,120
and for you all like how have you all

702
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,880
broken into it

703
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,279
um i can start since i have the mic so

704
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,720
those two things were the top ones that

705
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,080
was going to highlight breaking into the

706
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,240
field and imposter syndrome i think for

707
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,320
breaking into the field i think it's

708
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,080
uh and this will relate to imposter

709
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,000
syndrome as well but uh reminding

710
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,679
yourself that um end of the day

711
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,440
especially when you're doing analysis or

712
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,039
intel analysis it's about thought

713
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,840
processes and if you are good at problem

714
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,159
solving in literally any field that kind

715
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,480
of same concept and just the process

716
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,919
that you're using to solve problems can

717
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,480
be applied to cyber as well and you know

718
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,679
sometimes it's going to be tough to

719
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,600
convey on a resume but reminding

720
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,120
yourself that that is real and you have

721
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,720
value to add is is a big thing

722
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,159
sure so i had a slightly more

723
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,919
traditional path in so i got a computer

724
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,200
engineering degree in college and i

725
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,960
actually came to mitre so i was a

726
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,799
software engineer when i started out but

727
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,400
um started doing reverse engineering

728
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
about 2014 and then moved into mao

729
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
analysis around 2016 so i really had

730
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,320
kind of a very safe opportunity and

731
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,760
really project-based opportunities

732
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,120
develop a lot of my cyber security

733
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,200
skills so i don't hold any

734
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,880
certifications or anything but really

735
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,640
getting kind of that hands-on experience

736
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,880
and like learning by doing really got me

737
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,720
into like wow i really love reverse

738
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,159
engineering i really enjoy this i'm

739
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,679
really good at it so now it was

740
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,200
something that i could kind of use that

741
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,559
as a foundation and begin to kind of

742
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,240
grow my other cyber security skills

743
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,919
because you know as you're aware it's

744
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,159
like that's only one aspect of cyber so

745
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,600
now they're moving into more threat

746
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,799
intelligence

747
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,240
specialty it's like okay what are all

748
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,520
the other pieces that i need to

749
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,360
understand so then being able to branch

750
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,279
out and learn those as well

751
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,679
that's those are amazing answers like

752
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,279
thought process

753
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,240
100

754
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,720
like that's

755
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,240
like

756
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,880
where do i start um

757
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
and i like the fact that you're like you

758
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,360
came up from like hey my hat is off to

759
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,799
you because you are e and i hate

760
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,080
assembly because every time i look at

761
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,840
assembly i just my brain hurts and then

762
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,200
i have to like go take a break and walk

763
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,039
away um and then i get nothing done for

764
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,760
the rest of the day so um my hat is off

765
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,960
to you on that

766
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,720
so i love the fact that we all have

767
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,480
different strengths to play

768
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,679
um

769
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,600
but i i agree like the thought process

770
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,880
and focusing on that and then also

771
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,320
getting the hands-on experience are

772
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,640
great ways and like i think i love the

773
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,480
fact that you both even have such

774
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,559
different paths and and like some people

775
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,080
like take certs and that's how they got

776
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,679
the technical understanding and then

777
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,600
other people don't have any starts right

778
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,080
so i really appreciate your diversity in

779
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,400
the background so thanks he is far more

780
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,559
technical than i am but that is one area

781
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,000
where i relate to her i don't have any

782
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,760
certifications as well and not

783
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,039
necessarily that i'm proud of that like

784
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,799
it's not a knock i wish i had had more

785
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,640
formal experience and training in those

786
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,720
regards but if you

787
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,640
are interested in just continuing to ask

788
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,159
questions and dig deeper you you

789
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,679
definitely can go pretty far in the

790
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,840
field for sure so

791
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,279
i love that and the fact that you all

792
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,520
are here today and speaking at attack on

793
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,600
is definitely a testament to that

794
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,279
so thank you i really appreciate it and

795
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,400
thank you for your time and your

796
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,080
presentation and coming out on this

797
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,880
couch with no preparation at all so

798
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,840
definitely be kind and

799
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,679
so uh but yeah thank you again for

800
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,600
everything so thanks for having us yeah

definitely give your best meme for

803
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,039
attack han uh we love having you here um

804
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,679
all of this content is for you guys so

805
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,159
um for the virtual participants so we're

806
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,679
just super grateful that you're watching

807

and we hope you have a wonderful rest of

808
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,520
the break and we're looking forward to

809
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,480
matt malone coming up next
