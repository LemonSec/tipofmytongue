1
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,200
so we've got one more talk standing

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,360
between you and lunch

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,480
so for those of you in the virtual

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,960
audience you've been seeing a lot of her

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,039
the last two days or or hearing her

6
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,640
piped in through the speakers in the

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,640
ceiling but now we're bringing to the

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,119
main stage our attack for mac and linux

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,170
lead cat self

10
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:35,040
[Applause]

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,440
hello my name is kat self i am the mac

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,680
os on linux like i want to say like more

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,040
like initiative

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,160
for the attack enterprise team so a

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,520
little bit about me

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,520
let me get closer to the

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,360
the proper location

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,360
um a little bit about me um i formally

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,199
was an artist so there were some people

20
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,480
that we actually got to interview on the

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,120
attack on couch that previously came

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,199
from an artist's background which i love

23
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,199
um definitely the windy road that led

24
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,520
straight to here right for some of us um

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,360
then i went into military intelligence

26
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,840
served at war a couple years i then got

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,080
a computer science degree target took a

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,799
chance on me and i was able to do

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,320
software development i moved into

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,759
becoming a red teamer and then

31
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,640
eventually a threat hunter um so amazing

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,119
progression there and then mitre stole

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,600
me away with the lore of being able to

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,479
work on mac os and linux and then also

35
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,240
the attack evaluations team so which

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,040
i've loved my time there

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,079
so why this initiative for mac os and

38
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,240
linux right let me set a timer to make

39
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,880
sure i don't go over um

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,280
the reason why is because

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,520
as things evolve naturally like it's

42
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,920
easy like we have over 300 sub

43
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,520
techniques right that's a lot of

44
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,600
techniques to keep track of so as time

45
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,280
evolves like we start to understand

46
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,960
things differently and new releases come

47
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,439
out right well different ways to have

48
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,759
behave oh nice nice little timer there

49
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,600
um

50
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,840
but the reality is things evolve and we

51
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,360
also need those subject matter experts

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,560
to come in and make sure that we're

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,920
still being true

54
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,399
to the behaviors that we have in attack

55
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,840
so and that's kind of the point for the

56
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,000
initiative so miss grant's gave me this

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,480
really super adorable logo um part of

58
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,080
what we've tried to do over this last

59
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,200
year which is one thing that i really

60
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,800
want to cover with you all is like

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,959
they gave me this honor to be able to be

62
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,200
in charge of updating mac os and linux

63
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,280
techniques and what i've tried to do is

64
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,480
actually go directly back to the

65
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,879
community to you all where you all can

66
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,560
kind of and bring you all into it right

67
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,920
because the reality is attack is

68
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,519
community driven

69
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,440
one of those initiatives was we were

70
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,360
able to participate in a blue team

71
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,760
village defcon workshop called the hunt

72
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,440
for red apples

73
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,920
where this is where i met the mr grants

74
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,360
that gave me this logo because they had

75
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,720
this great little logo for that workshop

76
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,160
but it was a really great opportunity

77
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,160
for mitre to be able to be involved with

78
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,360
a defcon workshop um specifically on mac

79
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,800
os right and we were able to work with

80
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,879
like five other key researchers where it

81
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,000
gave us a much better broad

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,519
understanding of like other people in

83
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,599
the community and just that engagement

84
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,080
it was just really beneficial for us

85
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,599
to go through but it also point out some

86
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,400
great

87
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
um identifying facts on what makes mac

88
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,959
os so different like mac os has a lot of

89
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,560
hardware considerations built into it

90
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,400
right one of the nice things about mac

91
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,800
is that when you buy it there's a lot of

92
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,959
built-in hardware security so their

93
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,959
users don't have to worry about things

94
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,280
um notarization is an example of that

95
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,879
for applications when they're building

96
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,120
on macos they have these programs that

97
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,040
they can opt in for specifically

98
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,720
sandboxing right like for a long time

99
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,920
there's a huge amount of

100
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,640
misconfigurations because apps could

101
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,440
either participate in the sandbox or not

102
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,599
um and then what that did was it allowed

103
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,599
a level of security and peace of mind

104
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,760
for a lot of users because even if you

105
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,280
did get access into the application you

106
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,560
were limited from being on the actual

107
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,840
host itself because you were inside of

108
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,319
the sandbox for the application

109
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,680
um same

110
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,280
another big thing i don't know about you

111
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,439
all but i've loved being on mac os for a

112
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,120
long time i also like playing games and

113
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,879
mac os has no problem

114
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,640
dropping hardware changes that are no

115
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,040
longer supported so like back in like i

116
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,120
was in the 90s this was a really common

117
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,239
theme i think they've gotten a little

118
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,200
bit better about warning their

119
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,319
developers now but there was a lot of

120
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,840
games that did not support mac os

121
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,720
because they knew that they were just

122
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,079
going to change the hardware one day and

123
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,079
never tell anybody so

124
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,238
that also happens on this platform and

125
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,800
local admin is really common so windows

126
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,160
does a great job of being able to

127
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,000
segregate those permissions

128
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,080
however on mac os if you think about the

129
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,680
environments that it's in there's a lot

130
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,360
of developers a lot of graphics artists

131
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,320
right like

132
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,160
they tend to have local admin to be able

133
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,520
to get those tools supported to be able

134
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,199
to run tests and like

135
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,840
test um

136
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,600
vocabulary is very hard um instances so

137
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,199
if i need to run a quick web server to

138
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,199
be able to like see as my app connecting

139
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,120
correctly to this database

140
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,840
that requires often a lot of local admin

141
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,639
so

142
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,680
there's those considerations linux

143
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,479
who here knows of an entire fleet

144
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,800
comprised of linux users and points

145
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,560
really

146
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,240
that's impressive

147
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,320
one you know one i'm we're going to talk

148
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,400
after this because that's amazing

149
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,960
um i like i haven't heard until right

150
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,199
now i haven't heard of any um and that's

151
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,479
kind of one of the big differences right

152
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,960
like we talk about linux but reality is

153
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,320
linux is not

154
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,560
very well represented as an endpoint um

155
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,560
which is where a lot of focus is

156
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,320
there's a lot of different distributions

157
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,759
when we're doing it linux techniques

158
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,039
we're kind of like

159
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,720
well what distribution do we discuss

160
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,240
because it's different on every single

161
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,280
flavor right um so how do you represent

162
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,960
that well and be a good steward of the

163
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,160
community without showing too much

164
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,919
favoritism to one or the other um

165
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,120
another one is it's open source

166
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,039
community driven and then also

167
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,960
infrastructure like linux is often

168
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,400
represented in environments for

169
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,479
infrastructure and let's be real even

170
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,240
incident responders have to go through a

171
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,400
lot of permissions to be able to access

172
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,919
those servers to get the logs that they

173
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,240
need so finding open source reporting on

174
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,199
that

175
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,880
which brings us to what do they have in

176
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,880
common right like the reporting on that

177
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,960
right so the nice thing about attack is

178
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,560
it's not if it's not open source it's

179
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,840
not going to be in there right like it

180
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,600
has to be in the wild it's there it's

181
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
been like reported on

182
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,680
um so

183
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,919
if there is no in the wild reporting on

184
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,319
these linux softwares then there's not

185
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,639
going to be an attack um so the

186
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,479
reporting is sparse which is definitely

187
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,440
something that we've kind of come up

188
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,600
against it's like how do we address this

189
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,840
um also the reporting as i mentioned

190
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,919
before is often highly sensitive so how

191
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,280
can you expect these companies to like

192
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,560
hey look at this embarrassing you know

193
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,400
situation that happened um there's also

194
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
a focus on vulnerabilities versus actual

195
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,720
behaviors or hands-on keyboard which is

196
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,000
really tricky when you're trying to like

197
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,360
cover these techniques right so these

198
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,639
are some of the obstacles that we've had

199
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,919
to address

200
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:44,880
um

201
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,039
which brings us to the first release

202
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,639
that i was put on the team it was kind

203
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,160
of like okay

204
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,919
look at all this workout that i did and

205
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,599
then i realized after the release i was

206
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,880
like

207
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,240
like adam asked me i was like okay so

208
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,599
when are you gonna be done and i was

209
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,319
like

210
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,520
oh

211
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,680
what does done even look like like what

212
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,039
does done look like on something that's

213
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,800
constantly evolving

214
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,400
and that's when i kind of came to the

215
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,880
realization that like done is better

216
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,440
than perfect and sometimes i think in

217
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,039
this industry we like to mix those up on

218
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,039
the opposite right it's perfect

219
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,800
um

220
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,880
so

221
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,639
what we decided was our goal was just to

222
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,479
become a go-to resource right we really

223
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,360
wanted to be a platform or not i'm sorry

224
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,520
um a place where if you were learning

225
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,240
about mac os and adversary tradecraft or

226
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,319
you were a defender that you could come

227
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,599
and it was

228
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:34,800
clear enough

229
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,080
understandable enough and also

230
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,319
well-resourced enough that you at least

231
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,319
had a place to start so that's kind of

232
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,120
what we did we went through the

233
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,840
descriptions we added additional context

234
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,000
we went through our detections although

235
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,280
lex is going to go through and make

236
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,280
those all way better and we are

237
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,440
definitely working with her on that um

238
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,120
but we kind of went through those and

239
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,280
addressed a lot of little details

240
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,919
so out of the 385 which we scoped to

241
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,840
because of changes um we viewed about we

242
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,680
fully went through about 232 which is

243
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,960
actually a huge number for those of you

244
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,319
that have had to go through technique by

245
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,879
technique um which we're very proud of

246
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,240
and um and i think we edited about 52 a

247
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,360
little bit over those because we didn't

248
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,800
count one release

249
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,440
and that is a team of me um dylan and

250
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,960
ivy which you'll definitely see like

251
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,879
we'll talk about us later um but it was

252
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,720
three of us and of course also the rest

253
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,039
of the attack team that we kind of hit

254
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,360
that up or were able to accomplish that

255
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,520
um so in the wild kerberos is one of

256
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,960
these this was originally just a windows

257
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,958
platform you can absolutely do this on

258
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,640
linux and mac os

259
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,360
so definitely call out to tim

260
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,120
also a big call out to cody cody was one

261
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,599
of the original attack members that

262
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,320
actually kind of built out the mac os

263
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,720
portion of attack so both of them we

264
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,000
were able to work with the community to

265
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,600
kind of update kerberos and be able to

266
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
add those platforms add context and add

267
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,279
actually specific technical details to

268
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,240
it

269
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,920
another one that i've worked on because

270
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,760
that one was dylan's um

271
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,080
was hidden users we noticed a lot of

272
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,680
times that there was b2 platforms like

273
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,279
windows and mac os because again they're

274
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,560
well represented in enterprise

275
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,640
environments but there was a linux and

276
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,000
then we were like huh we really need to

277
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,320
add these details um and so that's part

278
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,080
of what we did we also in the detection

279
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,000
section we try to give you guys a couple

280
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,560
of technical specific like for mac os

281
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,200
key value pairs for p-list files um but

282
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,720
also like links to the documentation

283
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,160
that allow you to go a little bit deeper

284
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,320
to understand the context of what that

285
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,519
looks like

286
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,640
so those are just kind of some

287
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,240
highlights of what we did

288
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,160
some lessons learned there's this great

289
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
african proverb if i want to go fast

290
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,839
i'll go by myself but if i want to go

291
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:36,640
far

292
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,080
we'll go together

293
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,440
and that's actually exactly what we

294
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,760
focused on so we decided to

295
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,360
while we're doing this initiative we

296
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,600
really wanted to be able to create an

297
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,080
environment in a community

298
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,760
or at least a place right it's nice to

299
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,120
be able to point somewhere and like go

300
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,279
here um instead of like the 17 different

301
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,120
slack rooms plus the twitter accounts

302
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,360
plus the blogs plus the you know tools

303
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,720
um we just wanted one place to go and

304
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,680
like hey if you're talking you want to

305
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,000
talk to attack go here um so our team's

306
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,560
actually committed so dylan ivy and me

307
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,560
uh like for while we finish up this

308
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,399
initiative um we committed to kind of

309
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,560
being on on mondays

310
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,480
at mountain time because that's i'm in

311
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,240
uh denver

312
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,800
and uh we committed to being online so

313
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,640
just be there to ask questions answer

314
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,320
questions um just to engage with the

315
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,200
community if there's something that we

316
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,120
can do better if there's a data source

317
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,800
that you guys suggest or or anything

318
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,920
that we're gonna go over which i'll hit

319
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,920
on our roadmap like that's the place to

320
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,839
do it where you can easily contact us

321
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,279
versus like following all the right

322
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,800
people on twitter

323
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,959
so

324
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,839
so this is our roadmap um essentially is

325
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,839
we started off just talking with

326
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,760
community generating connections really

327
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,360
just trying to bring you guys and and

328
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,640
honestly identifying people that want to

329
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,480
work with us um and then also we've

330
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,160
created the slack channel um we're

331
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,240
starting to be present there um get more

332
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,640
engaged on twitter um this release that

333
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,320
we've already announced april 25th uh

334
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,839
we're hoping to be done with all the big

335
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,160
updates for mac os so you're welcome

336
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,680
those hopefully won't be anything giant

337
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,920
after this um but we've really worked

338
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,959
hard to go through and add context add

339
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,040
platforms where they were relevant

340
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,440
and do our due diligence essentially so

341
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,040
um after that we're actually going to be

342
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,440
pivoting specifically to linux our goals

343
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,120
with linux linux has got a lot of tricky

344
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,959
things about it for example

345
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,399
where is the line between between iot

346
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,040
and linux right like linux endpoints

347
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,920
versus iot or cloud or like there are so

348
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,360
many different considerations um also

349
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,440
the data sources like that lex is going

350
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,200
to go through like how can we better

351
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,720
represent those for defenders because

352
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,040
there's a lot of gaps there that we can

353
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,240
do better

354
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,040
and then also completing

355
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,720
we hope to be fully complete with all

356
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,519
the linux updates by our october release

357
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,040
which is typically october don't hold me

358
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,880
that's whenever that releases you know

359
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,079
so sayeth

360
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,320
um but yeah so that's kind of our goal

361
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,120
here um as always we really are better

362
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,800
together i know i pitch that pretty much

363
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
and every time i talk to you all um over

364
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,839
this last year we've gotten the

365
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,440
opportunity to speak at objective by the

366
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,440
sea we've got another opportunity to do

367
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,839
the defcon workshop um and we've really

368
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,560
just tried to be a part of the community

369
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,839
i want to encourage that because the

370
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,920
reality is you guys have access to all

371
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,399
of that data and

372
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,480
we're here for you so it's more of like

373
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,760
how can we work together to then

374
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,040
represent that

375
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
i know we all hit that super hard but

376
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
i'll just do that again and then after

377
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,560
october we'll probably stop this

378
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,480
initiative and then we'll become one

379
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,600
team again

380
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,279
which we love because that's really what

381
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,720
it's about right that's that's really

382
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,120
our definition of don of successful

383
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,880
and so if you have questions we'll be

384
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,040
there on slack on mondays

385
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,639
always one team and thank you so much

386

389
