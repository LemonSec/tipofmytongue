martinez from trellics

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,119
compelling stories are a good way to

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,039
help everyone get on the same page for

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,279
raising awareness enabling defenders to

8
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,279
act on cyber threats

9
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,640
but it's always essential to tell a

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,840
story that resonates and is

11
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,960
understandable to your audience

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,719
something that's already becoming a

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:34,399
theme this morning

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,760
next talk is going to discuss how

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,000
they've used attack to accomplish this

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,920
and tell some of these stories please

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,310

trying to remember what was the last

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,640
time we were here and it's almost like

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,920

now we're going to talk about this

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,680
storytelling and how that relates to

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,159
what we're discussing here right cti

33
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,400

uh also all the people know me as jose i

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
am from spain and the most important

43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,200
thing that you have to know from me is

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,159
that i am a

45
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,560
so if you don't know what is salmonello

46
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,200
i recommend you to search it into google

47
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,079
and

48
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,000
we can discuss no

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,280
we also have a co-author in this

50
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,640
presentation he couldn't be here

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,119
alejandro from argentina assad master

52
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,240
that's another one you may you may know

53
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,000
a little bit about this one

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,640
so we were discussing about this talk

55
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,799
and how to you know talk about this we

56
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,479
were thinking it would be great if we

57
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,640
had a way in which we could just like

58
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,640
transfer our knowledge right like a tool

59
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,479
where we could say you know what this is

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,160
my experience from the last 20 years

61
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,319
doing cyber defense and just like

62
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,400
transfer it to somebody might be younger

63
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,160
or newer in the in the field and just

64
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,239
like transfer absolutely everything like

65
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,480
in one go right that would be amazing so

66
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,760
i would be like what that would look

67
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,200
like if i had to transfer all my

68
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,280
knowledge to to hosa leo like you know

69
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,120
my early days doing infrastructure and

70
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,000
building

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,800
uh

72
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,400
you know networks and securing those

73
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,200
networks and then teaching classes and

74
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,599
it's not everything about work right so

75
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,599
it's also about like soccer we call it

76
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,959
football because we play with the foot

77
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,360
so winning real madrid big thing for us

78
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,760
right uh sorry jorge is jorge in the

79
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,120
audience no it's a good friend of mine

80
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,360
or hercules right big real madrid fan

81
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,120
but it's all good so joselia what it

82
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,239
would look like for you if you had to

83
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,160
transfer all that knowledge for me at

84
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,879
once if i could transfer information to

85
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,680
you i will transfer and how to analyze

86
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,599
different intrusions using the diamond

87
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,760
model and the kill chain phases

88
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,840
also how to understand the

89
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,239
the terrorist groups are working

90
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,120
right now because i was a student of the

91
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,680
counterterrorism degree and also the

92
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,920
most important thing is when messi take

93
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,840
off the t-shirt in the santiago bernabeu

94
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,680
stadium

95
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,400
after a score a goal

96
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,319
so as you can see we love we love our

97
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,799
soccer but now the key thing is there is

98
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,879
a tool to actually do that and it's the

99
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,799
power of storytelling i don't know if

100
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,200
you're aware of this but there's a um a

101
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,640
very interesting research coming from

102
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,239
princeton university from a few years

103
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,519
ago i think it's 2016 where they took

104
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,879
mris

105
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,560
and they uh gauged the brain activity

106
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,959
in a listener and a speaker a speaker

107
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,080
was sharing a story and it turns out

108
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,319
that when you share a story especially a

109
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,680
real life story to your audience

110
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,080
and people start relating to that the

111
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,120
brain

112
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,840
activity the brain waves start to align

113
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,280
which is amazing

114
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,040
so might be actually happening in this

115
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,720
talk hopefully right where brain waves

116
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,360
are i know it sounds like weird but

117
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,799
it actually happens

118
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:11,599
so

119
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,519
they they did some analysis why is that

120
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,799
this happens

121
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,000
why is that

122
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,839
when somebody tells a story you start to

123
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,358
align with the speaker and that

124
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,040
motivates you changes maybe even your

125
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,440
behaviors your beliefs and it comes to

126
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,199
to these points that we have here full

127
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,280
meaning so you have to have

128
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,440
context it's not just like isolated

129
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,120
words they actually did some tests with

130
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,400
this

131
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,639
that means you have to have context

132
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,720
you have to have expression as well

133
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,320
expressiveness

134
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,000
and you have to have a common ground

135
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,360
that common ground could be language

136
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,639
right we need to be able to speak the

137
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,400
same language like we're speaking here

138
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,840
so we understand each other even though

139
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,520
we have different accents and different

140
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,479
background

141
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,800
but it also could be something like why

142
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,919
does it really matter what you're

143
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,919
telling me right and i think we all here

144
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,759
have the same kind of a common ground

145
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,520
because we all are interested in you

146
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,520
know cti and how to enable more cyber

147
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,840
defenders so when this happens then you

148
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,000
start getting understanding which is the

149
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,680
goal here

150
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,400
taking this to the cyber realm

151
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,320
why is this important we're just talking

152
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,560
about how uh and selena was talking

153
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,320
about this justin

154
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,400
and jason were talking about this as

155
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,800
well the power of

156
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,120
giving context meaning because sometimes

157
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,800
the reports that we have

158
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,639
intelligence reports they may lack that

159
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,199
meaning they might be mostly ioc based

160
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,960
that would be like you know just

161
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,280
throwing random words at somebody but

162
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,960
what's the story right tell me tell me

163
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,160
that story

164
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,639
expressionless we we have a very good uh

165
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,720
presentation from our buddy colleague

166
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,240
carlos diaz that he did recently at the

167
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,440
different summit talking about how tools

168
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,680
can have expression

169
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,440
to convey more understanding or how

170
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,880
sometimes the same information can

171
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,720
convey can be conveyed in a very raw

172
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,360
format and we don't get that

173
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,800
and it's also important to understand

174
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,880
our audiences back to the conversations

175
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,360
we've had before with selena and justin

176
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,360
and jason they were talking about this

177
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,639
if we don't have that we don't have

178
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,280
story what we have is you know a report

179
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,680
that may have limited distribution

180
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,280
partial understanding

181
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,680
and it's not going to enable somebody

182
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,360
right to take action it's not going to

183
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
motivate somebody to know okay this is

184
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,800
what i need to what i need to do

185
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,199
so what we did was uh uh together with

186
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,960
uh some of our colleagues in the 83 team

187
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,560
we started to build this initiative

188
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,000
threat sightings right this is uh how

189
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,240
old is this uh hostilio we published the

190
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,319
threat sightings on september

191
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,400
so about yeah less than a year old right

192
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,840
and we've done a number of presentations

193
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,280
we're not going to go deep into the

194
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,240
schema

195
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,759
of threat sightings we're going to show

196
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,759
you some examples more importantly we're

197
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,880
going to show you

198
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,880
how to use this and it doesn't mean that

199
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,319
you have to use it right we're going to

200
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,639
share the story our story of how we have

201
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,240
used it and how we have been able to

202
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,360
enable

203
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,960
other people that might not be used to

204
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,960
work with cyber threat intelligence

205
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,360
reports and how we're using this to

206
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,280
essentially augment or increase the

207
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,440
understanding

208
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,360
now we talked about words and in this

209
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,720
experiment they did at the princeton

210
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
university uh it was very obvious that

211
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,639
when when when you talk to somebody and

212
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,720
just like give them random words or even

213
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,880
words that make part of a story without

214
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,199
the context that's that's not enough

215
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,120
but our experience what we have seen in

216
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,639
many cases that a lot of people have

217
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,960
like missed instances right but they

218
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,039
don't have enough

219
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,919
context around those uh that means uh

220
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:24,960
instance

221
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,639
and jason and justin again they talked

222
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,880
about this before how important it is to

223
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,199
have not just storage because

224
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,720
data by itself doesn't increase

225
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,880
understanding it's about having the

226
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,120
right labels the right context around it

227
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
the right structure and now you can

228
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,599
start understanding what you have

229
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,440
in many instances what we have seen is

230
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,680
that this mispa databases well it has a

231
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,720
lot of iocs right ips hashes domains

232
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,039
one of the things i always say is that

233
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,879
if you look at your mis database or any

234
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,360
of the thread intelligence collection

235
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,560
and you can that enables you to create

236
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,039
hypothesis and you can go hunting based

237
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,599
on those hypotheses based on that data

238
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,879
then you're probably closer to the top

239
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,800
of the pyramid right so the ttps you

240
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,160
have

241
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,919
you have more expression

242
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,599
but if you look at your mis database and

243
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,879
all you can do is search just based on

244
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,160
nice iocs like ips and queries um

245
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,919
or domains or hashes

246
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,080
then those queries you know they don't

247
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,680
have enough expression

248
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,520
you don't have a full story

249
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,800
so that's what we're trying to do with

250
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,400
this right we're trying to focus on

251
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,879
obviously the ttps but surrounded with

252
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,800
enough context so we can we can work

253
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,759
with that

254
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,519
now let's let's show you an example what

255
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,000
are we seeing here joselia here is just

256
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,240
an example about our schema in the

257
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,559
throat sightings the more deeper you go

258
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,039
from the left to the right the more

259
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,959
understanding you are getting from the

260
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,160
third sighting

261
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,000
the first line of the code is just

262
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,160
an example a description a high level

263
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,399
description about the ttps

264
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,959
we are using the same concept as miter

265
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,560
half already in their website

266
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,240
if we go down

267
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,279
to the behaviors we have also the

268
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,600
small description also is also a high

269
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,720
level description but you know

270
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,120
a little bit more context know about the

271
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,519
specific behavior that is carrying out

272
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,959
but if you go into the right

273
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,760
in this case where we have the fill

274
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,480
called files you know uh where we have

275
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,720
the information like the path the name

276
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,040
the process the sha

277
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,120
that information is the

278
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,200
is the understanding about the campaign

279
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,880
is we are not saying

280
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,120
something someone is

281
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,120
doing a specific technique with a

282
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,320
specific

283
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,200
tool we are saying that is happening and

284
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,120
this is where you

285
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,440
where you go to focus on

286
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,640
so it's

287
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,480
it's a it's a maturity curve right if

288
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,080
you want like you have uh the sightings

289
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,000
with a summary right high level summary

290
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,080
then the behaviors but notice that and i

291
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,040
think it was a question from the

292
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,360
audience right about sequence before

293
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,360
there is a sense of sequence there that

294
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,959
we're going to use to create some

295
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,040
representations later on so it's not the

296
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,399
position of those behaviors is not

297
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,240
random but as you said right the d

298
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,760
and we also made sure that we chose one

299
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,600
example with mishta so we could you know

300
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,680
uh refer to the meme right mr so there

301
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,519
you go uh so now once we have that

302
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,279
that's a yaml file right and there's a

303
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,279
schema again you can you can visit our

304
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,880
site we're going to give you some links

305
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,720
to the to a github so you can look at

306
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,640
the schema that we're using and if you

307
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,920
you know can contribute back to that

308
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,839
give us some suggestions uh please feel

309
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,079
free to do that but now from the yaml we

310
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,000
can use some python scripts that we have

311
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,839
on our github as well that can translate

312
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,600
that into different views so it's

313
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,040
talking about audiences right we have

314
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,480
different audiences that will consume

315
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,320
the data in a different way this is just

316
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,240
like a high level notes so what we have

317
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,240
is somebody taking quick notes of what's

318
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,720
happening we have a structure right

319
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,000
thread actor first dark side a verb used

320
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,800
then the technique and then the tactic

321
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,720
why is this happening well we're using

322
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,800
valid credentials over rdp for initial

323
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,079
access

324
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,839
we use this we have a bunch of software

325
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,000
engineers in our team that you know we

326
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,640
follow the agile method of

327
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,720
you know having the fractal or the who

328
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,160
the what happened and the why it

329
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,320
happened that's going to help us also to

330
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,240
now automate a lot of this and come up

331
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
with some meaningful reports still that

332
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,760
doesn't give us enough context right

333
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,160
it's just like very high high level

334
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,519
let's go into the second level of

335
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,640
abstraction

336
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,560
now we have the tactic the technique and

337
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,680
the procedure

338
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,640
so that's a typical ttp view we also get

339
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,279
now the tactic uh the technique number

340
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,360
the technique id and that can be useful

341
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,760
if we want to do like uh for example

342
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,000
some of uh in our organization part of

343
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,920
our audience is a detection engineer

344
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,519
somebody that needs to write content

345
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,760
right based on this or to check we have

346
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,360
coverage for that content that could be

347
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,720
also in a sock

348
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,639
and we can you know maybe create a heat

349
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,480
map based on that and say how much

350
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,560
coverage do we have for that particular

351
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,320
id right i don't know like coverage is a

352
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,880
very loaded word here in

353
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,320
in this context

354
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,839
and here's a view that it's also very

355
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,839
common right very useful for red and

356
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,720
purple emulation uh teams emulation

357
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
planning uh jorge killers our friend

358
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,399
herger gillis and natalie they also

359
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,560
talked about about this i think

360
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,639
katy nichols has also talked about this

361
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,079
and showed you know some of these views

362
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,320
which i think is really useful

363
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,480
we see the observables but we also have

364
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,880
nodes what do we use those nodes for the

365
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,120
nodes can help us to understand what is

366
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,920
happening or maybe if we don't know what

367
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,399
is uh an ap call

368
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,120
meeting we we can see what

369
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,000
is the purpose of that ap call me

370
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,480
right so we have an api call right we we

371
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,680
can see exactly what it's doing and

372
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,959
we're going to see an example later on

373
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,200
right but um it might be that you don't

374
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
know exactly what that ap api call is

375
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,800
being used for and that node that can

376
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,079
give you context it could be a link

377
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,720
right to some additional reading

378
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,000
now one of the things i like about this

379
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,279
is uh

380
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,440
of this yaml file we create like a

381
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,839
markdown files that we use to also

382
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,000
create a wiki an internal wiki so now we

383
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,440
have the the observables right the

384
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,279
thread signings we just have it in this

385
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,519
form and then automatically we can uh

386
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,399
create a page in wiki where maybe a

387
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,079
detection engineer or could be a sales

388
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,440
engineer or somebody that's doing

389
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,839
customer support can go and reference

390
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,360
this without you know us having to

391
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,600
explain this to everybody so that is

392
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,760
creating some sort of a story right

393
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,680
right there

394
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,440
now as you can guess we like we like

395
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,160
football right we like our soccer and um

396
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,240
so thinking about you know how to

397
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,800
represent the data i was thinking how

398
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,120
important it is to talk about not just

399
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,440
attackers tactics but also defenders

400
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,720
tactics which is probably something we

401
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,399
don't talk that much about

402
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,240
and i was thinking about how does a

403
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,560
football manager do this

404
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,480
and i thought about purple guardiola

405
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,839
right obviously like we're barcelona

406
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,760
fans so we like we like him

407
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,320
and i like this quote because he said

408
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,040
well i sit down i watch videos and that

409
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,440
is when i get my inspiration i know how

410
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,600
to win that's when it becomes meaningful

411
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,079
he's got understanding

412
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,079
now could we just watch videos as well

413
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,600
instead of just like looking at logs

414
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,079
when we look at adversarial attack

415
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,079
so a friend of ours like carlos diaz as

416
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,399
well you know he looked at this gore's

417
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,399
tool and we produced something like this

418
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,480
out of a telemetry that we obtained out

419
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,160
of a ransomware attack a real one that

420
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,839
happened last year

421
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,600
as you can see here this is just

422
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,399
two users interacting with the system

423
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,160
each of these little

424
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,199
uh

425
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,279
nodes in the trees an artifact could be

426
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,760
file system artifacts uh registries

427
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,040
registry keys sockets created for that

428
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,360
jump box uh system

429
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,560
now at some point you're gonna see this

430
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,360
is regular activity

431
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,279
there's gonna be an attacker now that

432
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,199
joins the scene look at that and notice

433
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,800
how the tempo

434
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,000
of that

435
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,920
activity changes

436
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,760
so much faster now the attacker is

437
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,720
running

438
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,399
way faster it's creating a lot of

439
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,320
artifacts touching a lot of things on

440
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,040
the disk creating a lot of registry keys

441
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,320
and you see that

442
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,079
right the socket communications command

443
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,160
and control source port incrementing by

444
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,480
one so very typical from this type of

445
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,920
activity

446
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,360
now that's the same data we could have

447
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,519
seen in a

448
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,360
just a plain text format right in a

449
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,480
report

450
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,320
but i think that watching it in that

451
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,800
particular way just kind of helps right

452
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,920
i'm not saying that we're always going

453
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,560
to gonna do that but there is a time

454
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,399
factor that it's always hard to see this

455
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,240
on a piece of paper right you look at

456
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,480
the logs yeah you could try to infer how

457
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,079
the timestamps are changing but then you

458
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,480
see it in the video it's like oh whoa

459
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,120
that tells your story now we're not

460
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,199
actually generating these

461
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,079
files mp4 files out of the yaml files

462
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,079
yet but we're getting closer to that so

463
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,440
as part of

464
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,199
this project we're producing

465
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,759
automatically with docusirus and mermaid

466
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:48,880
these uh

467
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,120
graphs right that can give you an idea

468
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,279
of sequence can give you an idea of like

469
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,639
what's the flow

470
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,560
and we generate these automatically put

471
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,639
it into our internal wikis so now

472
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,040
anybody looking at these reports you can

473
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,720
see the full story and you can see that

474
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,519
now

475
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,759
that is useful right but we're not

476
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,040
asking anybody to throw everything

477
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,959
they're doing right throw their tools

478
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,519
and then change their language because

479
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,279
we want to follow that we want to find

480
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,279
that common ground so

481
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,120
how does this integrate with other

482
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,519
languages that people can speak in the

483
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,000
uh you know in the thread intel team

484
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,720
like for example multigo or sticks or

485
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,240
open ioc okay we have seen with ismail

486
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,040
how

487
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,600
we are increasing the knowledge and the

488
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,639
understanding about the threats but now

489
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,000
when we were working on our schema we we

490
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,040
made a

491
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,120
we asked to ourselves a really nice

492
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,720
question related to this one and that i

493
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,880
i will show you now

494
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,639
this question is are video games made

495
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,120
for all the audience probably the answer

496
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,240
here is easy because it's not uh there

497
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,320
are written boards that can help us to

498
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,079
understand if the video game was made

499
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,680
for a specific

500
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,280
age and when we were creating our schema

501
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,919
and the information that we we want to

502
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,280
store

503
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,520
we asked to to ourselves

504
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,919
are cyber security reports made for all

505
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,039
the audience this is similar like selena

506
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,400
said before no

507
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,799
um the answers were here

508
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,599
we we we can't have here different

509
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,839
points of view but in my opinion the

510
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,520
answer is no why

511
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,440
because we have different levels of

512
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,600
audience where

513
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,160
they are getting information for example

514
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,000
a reversing engineering

515
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,280
report can be useful for cti analysts

516
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,080
for threat hunters but maybe

517
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,440
a threat landscape report is useful for

518
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,960
any chief of cyber security however

519
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,360
three detection engineers can't

520
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,000
create any detection rule with this this

521
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,240
type of reapers

522
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,039
moving on to the to the next slide

523
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,400
in our thread sightings

524
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,960
what are we trying to show to the

525
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,360
difference audience what we have now in

526
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,039
our schema

527
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,840
the low level we have the tactical level

528
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,760
where we are

529
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,679
we are we have different level of

530
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,760
audience like stock analysts in zero

531
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,919
responders threat hunters and the

532
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,000
information that we have for them

533
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,840
is similar rules we have similar rules

534
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
to create new detection rules in their

535
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,799
environments mapped to each behavior we

536
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,440
have also iocs api addresses domains

537
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,720
file hashes

538
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,520
and also we have behaviors the ttps the

539
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,000
high level the the high level of the of

540
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,880
the behaviors of the introductors

541
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,160
in the operational level we have

542
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,320
information for stock managers cta

543
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,039
analysts pre-detected engineers like

544
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,400
context

545
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,280
i mean

546
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,960
for example

547
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,559
tools used

548
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,520
industries affected countries affected

549
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,840
all the context now about the the the

550
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,280
campaign we have also the behaviors the

551
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,520
here is the low level all the processes

552
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,919
the command lines the fight creates

553
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,039
the registry events and also and the

554
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,240
minor attack we have for each behavior

555
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,840
we have one tactic and one technique

556
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,559
finally the strategical level we have

557
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,960
information for head of cyber security

558
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,880
security strategies

559
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,000
cso

560
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
and the information that we have for for

561
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,520
them is trends like the most loyal

562
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,640
business in the front sightings the most

563
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,200
affected industries in the thresholdings

564
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,679
and we are giving them

565
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,919
information to prioritize the security

566
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,480
efforts and we can see in the following

567
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,280
in the following slides this one

568
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,600
so for this reason there might be

569
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,760
audience and analysts who don't speak

570
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,360
the same language no

571
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,240
and

572
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,360
we have created a tools to convert our

573
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,360
information from the threat sightings to

574
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,280
different languages

575
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,080
let's

576
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,240
start with showing you different

577
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,039
scenarios the first one is a cti team

578
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,679
that only speaks minor

579
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,440
it's normal

580
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,600
what we are doing with that we can

581
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,440
convert our threat sightings to navigate

582
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,400
the layers of mider helping

583
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,039
helping the the operation teams and the

584
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,919
strategic levels to get more information

585
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,480
about the the detroit site to get more

586
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,039
context we have a heat map and also if

587
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,520
you put your mouse over a specific

588
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,520
technique you have all the behaviors

589
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,919
related to that specific technique that

590
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,400
information is it can be useful for the

591
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,159
cti analyst in order to maybe

592
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,240
do some purple teaming or something like

593
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,679
that

594
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,559
another scenario that we have is maybe a

595
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,200
shock that has been working with

596
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,360
sticks over the last four years the

597
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,520
stick is probably one of the most

598
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,000
schemas used in the industry

599
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,159
so we can compare the information of our

600
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,200
thread sightings in json format for

601
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,360
sdx in two different types of

602
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,960
visualization we have the high level

603
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,480
visualization where

604
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,039
the analyst can get the information left

605
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,840
for actor weapons techniques and tactics

606
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,400
used in our threat sightings

607
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,559
and also we have the low level

608
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,480
with information like the actor weapons

609
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,440
and ioses

610
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,480
maltego is another another another tool

611
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,520
that

612
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,480
we we believe that is being used for

613
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,280
different themes and also we we want to

614
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,039
cover the information that we have in

615
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,679
our thread sightings to material so this

616
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,640
is just an example about a conversion of

617
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,559
fresh sighting to maltego that can help

618
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,360
us to understand with different types of

619
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,000
visualization as well what is going on

620
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,720
in the specific society so

621
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,280
we can compare the first items in two

622
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,400
levels high level and low level also to

623
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,080
to help to the cti analysis and the

624
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,240
intelligence teams and the understand

625
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,280
the the campaign

626
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,559
open ioc as well is another

627
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,159
schema used by the industry

628
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,640
our threat sightings can save

629
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,960
iocs but it's not the required file but

630
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,120
we want to to give the opportunity to

631
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,400
check the information about the ioc

632
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,799
for that reason we we can compare our

633
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,960
threat sightings in the

634
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,039
in the open ioc schema to help the

635
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,440
differential channels and

636
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,520
other roles to understand the

637
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,879
information about the iocs

638
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,960
finally here

639
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,400
this is my

640
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,440
my

641
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,400
my

642
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,799
my favorite right because it's not all

643
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,120
about

644
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,760
knowledge about threats it's about

645
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,640
storing also no and this is a typical

646
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,760
scenario that

647
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,520
can can happen when we have a led

648
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,120
uh asking us that he no he need to know

649
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,760
all the threat sighting maybe that

650
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,960
where where opencs manager api calls are

651
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,000
made

652
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,559
opencs manager is used by psx for

653
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,559
remote services connection

654
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,280
and the team says yeah super boss we can

655
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,120
get the information and give you

656
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,200
all the threat sightings or the events

657
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,440
that we have but remember that our

658
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,440
threat sightings at the end are yammer

659
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,400
files so

660
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,159
how can we correlate the information

661
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,480
from our thresh sightings

662
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,960
like the chorus track team we are

663
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,799
saving all the threat sighting we are

664
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,039
converting the thresh sightings to

665
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,159
miss events in order to get correlations

666
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,320
that can help us to understand what is

667
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,039
going on and understand the story get

668
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,279
correlation about different attributes

669
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,360
like api calls maybe ips maybe domains

670
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,960
maybe common lines

671
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,440
so that can help us know to understand

672
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,279
what is happening this is just an

673
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,720
example

674
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,279
where opencs manager was used in three

675
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,159
different events and we are getting the

676
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,840
correlation with this

677
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,360
platform finally the ac3 threat sighting

678
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,880
were made for

679
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,880
help to the cyber security industry to

680
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,760
learn about threats

681
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,919
getting the information in a common

682
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,799
schema and we don't want to replace any

683
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,360
schema that already exists we just want

684
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,760
to adapt to them and help the the

685
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,080
different streams to use our threat

686
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,919
signings in their own language

687
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,000
yes and as we said before at the end of

688
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,159
the day what we want to do with this is

689
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,559
to enable cyber defenders right because

690
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,919
if we just like put a lot of

691
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,520
intelligence out there in a format that

692
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,360
is not understandable that it cannot be

693
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,080
translated to defensive actions then you

694
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,760
know we're not really moving the needle

695
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,679
in the right direction so going back to

696
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,760
the defensive tactics and how we can

697
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,919
translate all of this i'll use this

698
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,039
quote because i think it's very

699
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,039
important right if you have a team

700
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,120
uh trying to you know analyzing the

701
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,600
attacker you want to know what to do but

702
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,000
you also need to know when to do it

703
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,679
because tempo is very important we saw

704
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,520
that in the video as well right

705
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,120
so how does that apply to what we're

706
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,760
saying here well we sat together and we

707
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,520
came up with this idea of like we all

708
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,279
know the uda loop right

709
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,279
observe oriented side act but we

710
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,360
typically refer to this as

711
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,679
what do you do when you are under attack

712
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,000
you observe the attacker right

713
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
the attack activity then you orient it

714
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,240
you investigate you triage you do

715
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,159
instant response you apply your response

716
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,159
playbook then you validate the response

717
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,000
you keep doing that right until you have

718
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,480
an advantage over the adversary

719
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,080
but shouldn't we just talk about what

720
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,640
happens before the attack

721
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,480
and we're going to refer obviously to

722
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,400
minor defend here but i think that we as

723
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,440
a as an industry as here as a uh you

724
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,559
know as a

725
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,880
as a community we we also need to put

726
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,600
more effort into into this so we created

727
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,520
this this model we're just sharing this

728
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,360
as a way of telling a full story like

729
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,200
for example our threat signings is

730
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,880
something that we want to do

731
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,039
and that we actually do as part of our

732
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,720
hunting as part of the telemetry we

733
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,960
gather to observe what's going on out

734
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,640
there to

735
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,720
be more prepared to influence

736
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,120
preparedness to be able to now orient

737
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,880
and decide what are our capabilities

738
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,480
what do we have to defend against this

739
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,159
what are the counter measures that we

740
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,480
can apply i think create what we call we

741
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,320
call internally a defensive playbook

742
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,080
right how do you measure that well the

743
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,600
efficacy is measured through attack

744
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,279
simulations you don't have to wait right

745
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,000
until an attack happens for for you to

746
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,679
measure that so this is like an

747
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,400
end-to-end uh uh you know series of huda

748
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,679
loops before the attack during the

749
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,240
attack and after the attack what happens

750
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,039
and

751
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,760
how it relates to the threat sightings

752
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,520
uh as part of this work we're also

753
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,840
working on and this is something that i

754
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,279
i would like to you know continue

755
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,640
working with the community and with all

756
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,679
of you

757
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,360
on some implementations we call these

758
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,760
defensive playbooks but the idea is to

759
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,240
come up with a set of tactics right with

760
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,799
a common schema that we can also follow

761
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,240
and we can have

762
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,679
humans consuming but also machines

763
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,880
consuming that can be translated to

764
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,279
defensible countermeasures right active

765
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,880
and passive countermeasures we can use

766
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,200
to identify and reduce exposure of the

767
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,120
attacks but also being able to detect

768
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,200
investigate and respond faster there are

769
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,039
some projects like mito defense oasis

770
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,279
cacao as well that have some interesting

771
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,840
schemas but uh you know hopefully we can

772
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,559
advance on this in in the next uh the

773
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,159
next few months and and come up with

774
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,159
some other uh interesting talk about

775
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,320
this so in summary these are the links

776
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,679
what we're trying to do with this is to

777
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,279
make sure that we have enough

778
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,080
uh context enough understanding and that

779
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,240
can be you know translated into

780
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,480
something actionable and that's how we

781
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,240
can enable more more defenders if you go

782
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,679
to our repo right now we have a number

783
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,039
of sightings there

784
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,480
but i believe that as of now our

785
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,799
colleague alejandro who he will be like

786
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,960
pushing uh the new uh content to the

787
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,480
repo so hopefully we're gonna have that

788
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,320
in the next the next few minutes feel

789
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,679
free to ping us i think he's also on

790
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,559
slack and uh we would love to know your

791
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,240
opinion on this and see if it's

792
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,399
something that's useful for for you

793
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:03,360
all right

794
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,240
thank you thank you

795
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
fantastic presentation and you know i

796
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,720
learned myself you know so many lessons

797
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,799
from this including espetto so i'll

798
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,399
definitely take you up if it's a wide

799
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,720
offer i'd love to uh enjoy it absolutely

800
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,320
uh just a fair warning i don't think we

801
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,840
have time for questions unfortunately

802
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,760
now but you do have a really good queue

803
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,039
from really awesome feedback and

804
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,200
thoughts into slack including some harsh

805
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,760
words from george about football so

806
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,720
i just weren't expecting that one

807
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,370
but thanks again thank you so much

808
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:40,610
[Applause]
