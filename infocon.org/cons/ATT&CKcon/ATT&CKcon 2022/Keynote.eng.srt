1
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:18,910
- So my last duty this
morning in welcoming you

2
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,670
is to introduce our keynote speaker.

3
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,970
So our keynote today, Selena
Larson started her career

4
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:31,320
as a cybersecurity and privacy journalist

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,690
publishing hundreds of
articles before making a pivot

6
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:35,949
into cyber threat intelligence.

7
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:37,360
Previously at Dragos

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,650
today she is a senior
threat intelligence analyst

9
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,269
at Proofpoint on the threat research team

10
00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:46,519
and a non-resident fellow at
the Harvard Kennedy school's

11
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:49,650
Belfort Center, cyber project.

12
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,010
She's also been a speaker
at a number of conferences,

13
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,040
including RSA, S4, San CTI,

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,759
and we're absolutely
honored to have her here

15
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:00,479
as our keynote speaker at ATT&CKcon 3.0

16
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,289
Please help me welcome to
the stage Selena Larson.

17
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,049
(audience applauding)

18
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,810
- Thank you.

19
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,060
Is this on, can you guys all hear me?

20
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,060
Great.

21
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,860
Did I sound totally normal up here?

22
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:17,900
I can't tell.

23
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,080
Hello everybody.

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,580
Thank you so much for
coming to hang out with me,

25
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,690
Adam thank you for that
wonderful introduction.

26
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,490
Super appreciate it.

27
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,920
It's really great to see
all of you in person.

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,180
I don't know about most of you,

29
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,010
but this is my first IRL
conference in a while.

30
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:37,870
And certainly my first speaking
conference IRL since 2019.

31
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,510
So it's really amazing
to be here with everybody

32
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,140
to see everyone's faces and
all of you joining us virtually

33
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,520
as well, hello.

34
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,860
There's a lot of great
stuff on deck today.

35
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,530
So super stoked we could all be here.

36
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:52,200
Today I'm going to be talking to you

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,670
about intelligence
failures of Lincoln spies

38
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,110
and what cyber threat
intelligence analysts can learn

39
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,340
from the civil war.

40
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,180
Adam did a great introduction for me,

41
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,020
so I can kind of go through
this a little bit fast.

42
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,530
That is my Twitter.

43
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,830
If you wanted to tweet comments and GIFs

44
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:17,030
and nice things at me and so
skipping to kind of the end,

45
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,780
since you already know me already,

46
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,910
I do have a focus on targeted cyber crime.

47
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,750
I wanna bring this up because
I think for a lot of us

48
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,060
that work in cyber threat intelligence,

49
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,620
there is a lot of focus

50
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,120
on advanced persistent
threat state actors,

51
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,569
which are definitely important
and very, very valuable.

52
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:39,130
But I have seen kind of a
trend among CTI practitioners

53
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,269
and folks that publish
threat intelligence publicly

54
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,670
that there has been an increase in reports

55
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,809
on targeted cyber crime,

56
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,750
really interesting cyber criminal activity

57
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,110
and increased interest
in tracking those groups.

58
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,060
So if you, anyone in the
audience is interested

59
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,120
in chatting about that
or talking about that,

60
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,260
I'm happy to talk to you

61
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:04,190
'cause it is near and dear to my heart.

62
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,900
So what are we going to be
talking about this morning?

63
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,540
Well, I wanna get started to let you know

64
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,349
that I was inspired to do this talk

65
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:15,290
because I read a really
interesting book by Douglas Waller

66
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,690
called "Lincoln Spies

67
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,319
and Their Secret War To Save The Nation".

68
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,670
It's really interesting
because it highlights

69
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:26,260
a number of actually spies
and intelligence officers

70
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,349
and people working on behalf of the union

71
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:31,750
for Abraham Lincoln during the civil war

72
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,750
specifically four,

73
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,220
but one in particular we're
gonna be talking about today.

74
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,650
You will probably recognize
his name when I introduce him.

75
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,650
But unfortunately there were
a number of reporting failures

76
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,910
that really dogged him
throughout his relatively short,

77
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,200
actually in comparison to
the length of the civil war,

78
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,440
his tenure, as a spy master for the union.

79
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,190
We're gonna take his learnings
and take some of his failures

80
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,510
and learn how effective and
concise intelligence reporting

81
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,819
has the potential to change
the course of history

82
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,420
and in the same way,

83
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,790
how maybe not great intelligence reporting

84
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,849
and disruptions and
ineffective communication

85
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:14,349
could have very large impacts as well.

86
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:17,298
And then finally, because this
is a MITRE ATT&CK conference,

87
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,349
we are going to learn how
the MITRE ATT&CK framework

88
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:21,579
can help streamline and
effectively communicate

89
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,000
actionable threat intelligence.

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,199
It would be great if you could take away

91
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,330
some really key things that you can apply

92
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,380
directly in your role,
no matter where you are

93
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,530
in the organization, whether it's learning

94
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,090
some tips and tricks for
effective intelligence reporting,

95
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,380
whether that's garnering and gathering

96
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,600
intelligence requirements or
possibly just understanding

97
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,790
how there have been
failures throughout history

98
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,650
that we can all learn from, even as

99
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:53,750
we are modern cyber threat
intelligence practitioners.

100
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,340
So who is our main character?

101
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,310
Well, this is detective turned
spymaster Alan Pinkerton,

102
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,720
and that name might be
familiar to a lot of you

103
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,430
because it is Alan Pinkerton.

104
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,830
As in the Pinkerton Detective Agency,

105
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,710
he was the founder of this organization.

106
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,210
He was a very, very successful detective,

107
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,590
so successful in fact that
the company that he built

108
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,049
is still around today.

109
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:22,930
Pinkerton's are still
conducting investigations.

110
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,910
One fun fact about him is he
once smuggled Abraham Lincoln

111
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,880
into Washington, DC to avoid a
rumored assassination attempt

112
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,210
even before he was sworn in as president.

113
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,549
One fun fact, I actually
really like about Pinkerton

114
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,850
is he hired female
detectives to work with him.

115
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,790
At the time that was
actually pretty unusual,

116
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,270
but he did have both female
detectives and female operatives

117
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,460
that worked for him collecting
data and intelligence.

118
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,770
What matters to us in context of this talk

119
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,150
is he worked as a union intelligence chief

120
00:05:54,150 --> 00:06:00,870
from 1861 to 1862, largely
under general, George McClellan.

121
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,770
And then finally what's relevant
for us in this conversation

122
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,799
is he was not great at
reporting intelligence.

123
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,900
We're gonna learn why
here throughout the talk.

124
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,870
So Pinkerton collected
a lot of information,

125
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,620
so he had people both
operating in the union,

126
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,930
as well as behind enemy lines.

127
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,270
He was gathering intelligence,

128
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,409
conducting counterintelligence operations

129
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,690
every so often he tried
to get himself out there

130
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,740
and try his own hand on the
ground intelligence gathering

131
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,400
that didn't necessarily
always go very well.

132
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,620
And he also operated a
vast network of informants.

133
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,080
So he was working with people
who were officially spies

134
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,020
with the union as well as gathering

135
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,758
a lot of human intelligence,
working with informants

136
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,140
and people going undercover,
things like that.

137
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,010
But his information was
frequently poorly vetted.

138
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,849
Oftentimes it was based on single sources

139
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,440
and occasionally it was
received from bias narrators.

140
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,360
He himself as we'll learn in just a bit

141
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,480
also ultimately became a bias narrator

142
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,500
in his own intelligence reporting.

143
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,220
So sometimes the information
was ineffectively communicated

144
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,720
or sometimes it was outright falsified.

145
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,720
So frankly he had a lot of data problems

146
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,860
and shout out to everybody
who replied to my tweet

147
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,650
about how many "Schitt's
Creek" gifs were appropriate

148
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,068
for a keynote.

149
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:31,400
In the end you'll see
how many I actually use.

150
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,739
But yeah, so probably the best example

151
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,699
of his data collection
and dissemination issues

152
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:43,780
is in an 1861 October,
1861 report to the general

153
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,090
where he reported that
the Confederate army,

154
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,830
the number of soldiers was
twice what it actually was.

155
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,889
He oftentimes inflated numbers.

156
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:56,790
In fact, knowingly,
oftentimes by the general,

157
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,509
he patted a lot of the data.

158
00:07:58,509 --> 00:08:01,000
He didn't report what was truly coming in

159
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,270
from some of his informants.

160
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,859
He really wanted to make
the Confederate army

161
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,280
seem on paper a lot bigger than it was.

162
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,159
It was for a variety of reasons.

163
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,099
But mostly it was because

164
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:17,759
that's what general McClellan wanted.

165
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,410
Their relationship was
a very interesting one.

166
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,400
And this quote, I think
sums it up very well,

167
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,159
"Loyal to the point of sycophancy,

168
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,919
Pinkerton never doubted the
General's ability as a commander

169
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:33,568
instead of serving his
country or his president

170
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:38,598
as a true intelligence officer,
he made his friend happy."

171
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,349
His friend, excuse me in this
case is General McClellan.

172
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:45,879
McClellan was very, very hesitant

173
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:49,589
to take any decisive
action as the union general

174
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:51,800
in the early days of civil war,

175
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,810
he had a very, very deep fear of failure.

176
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,859
And so he wanted Pinkerton
to be reporting him numbers

177
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,939
that show that the Confederate
army was a lot bigger

178
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:04,469
than it actually was to be
able to get General McClellan

179
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,529
more bodies, he wanted more soldiers.

180
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:09,700
He wanted to continue
sitting on his hands,

181
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,540
not have to make a decision

182
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,040
because he didn't want to
fail, he didn't want to lose.

183
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:21,748
So in this relationship,
Pinkerton really enabled that.

184
00:09:21,749 --> 00:09:25,629
So this is an example of
something called hippo bias

185
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:29,350
or highest paid person's opinion bias.

186
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,639
This is the idea that
analysts will collect

187
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,639
and disseminate information
in a way that favors

188
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,709
or appeals to existing
beliefs in organization.

189
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:44,138
This is very typically driven
by leadership or the hippos.

190
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:48,420
So for example, if leadership
believes that Russian APT

191
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,069
are the most important and
likely the most targeted

192
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,980
to their organization,

193
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,449
defenders and analysts will
be spending a lot of time

194
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:58,319
and more key resources hunting for

195
00:09:58,319 --> 00:10:02,099
and defending against those threats,

196
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,699
that therefore has the
potential to miss or identify

197
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:09,829
or disregard DTPs associated
with other relevant,

198
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:12,239
but different activity.

199
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,350
Something that actually comes to mind

200
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,699
when I think about this is
the APT versus cyber crime.

201
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,689
So I kind of kicked off this
talk talking about how CTI

202
00:10:19,689 --> 00:10:23,059
spends a lot of resources
focusing on state actors,

203
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:25,529
which of course are very important.

204
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:26,730
They are advanced,

205
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,249
so they can be very
tricky, very important.

206
00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:32,360
And if your organization is
targeted by them, very terrible,

207
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,420
but from a cyber crime perspective,

208
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,979
there are a lot of cyber criminal actors.

209
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,019
Oftentimes they are using the same TTPs,

210
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:42,629
sometimes similar malware,

211
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:44,639
but they have different
goals and objectives.

212
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,799
They often kind of fly under the radar.

213
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:49,959
I mentioned kind of earlier
on when I introduced myself

214
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:52,079
that there has been an
increase in people talking

215
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,219
about cyber crime and these
interesting targeted threats,

216
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,209
especially when we're talking
about initial access brokers

217
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:01,300
that could potentially lead to ransomware,

218
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,279
but oftentimes they really
fly under the radar.

219
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,749
So sometimes leadership
can kind of think about

220
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,839
and focus on those APT actors

221
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,769
and not necessarily give adequate
resources or attention to

222
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,360
some of these cyber crime adversaries

223
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,959
that might be targeting them
or actively in their network.

224
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:20,388
Of course, Pinkerton
demonstrated hippo bias,

225
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,119
but it was also that
he was kind of working

226
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:24,239
in concert with McClellan.

227
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:26,420
So there's this letter that was published

228
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,189
in the book "Lincoln Spies"

229
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,860
in which Pinkerton actually
says, per our conversation,

230
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,009
as I intimated it to you at the time

231
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:37,379
the numbers were inflated so as to account

232
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:40,749
for anything that we
missed, they were padded

233
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:44,730
and McClellan often went and
took Pinkerton's intelligence,

234
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,429
took his inflated numbers
and further inflated them

235
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:49,939
in his own reports to Abraham Lincoln.

236
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:52,279
So it just wasn't very effective

237
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,790
dissemination of information
and really appealed

238
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,819
to the bias of the general.

239
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:01,889
So what can we do to kind of
push back against hippo bias?

240
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:03,559
I really wanna give a shout out

241
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:09,219
to what feels like 100
years ago, MITRE ATT&CK 2.0

242
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,009
and Antonio gave the key note,

243
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:13,790
she mentioned that the MITRE ATT&CK matrix

244
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,699
can be a very powerful corrective

245
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:20,329
to this idea of hippo bias.

246
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:21,589
We can use the framework.

247
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:24,630
We can use the identified
tactics and techniques

248
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:28,029
to create mappings of
MITRE ATT&CK to malware,

249
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:30,889
malware, families, and techniques observed

250
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:33,689
in our own environments.

251
00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:36,089
MITRE ATT&CK has this great feature

252
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,190
where you can click on
the threat actor directly.

253
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,549
You can sort by malware,
you can sort by TTPs.

254
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:44,630
So you can kind of use those
to create visualizations

255
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,230
or mappings that you can then
use to craft search queries,

256
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,209
help with threat hunting
and detection efforts.

257
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:53,969
For example, mapping and searching

258
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,019
on specific execution techniques,

259
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:58,420
such as sort till or bits admin,

260
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,819
which are being used to
download follow on payloads.

261
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:02,139
There are a couple of threat actors

262
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:04,839
that have demonstrated that type of TTP,

263
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:05,980
and you can kind of use this

264
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,769
to hunt in your own environment.

265
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:10,920
So what I did to kind of create a visual

266
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,809
to sort of tell this story
is I looked at Proofpoint's

267
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:15,969
emerging threats dataset,

268
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,739
specifically our serracotta rules

269
00:13:18,739 --> 00:13:23,899
to see what MITRE ATT&CK
tags turned up most often

270
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:26,459
in the detections that we are writing.

271
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,878
Caveat, this is gonna
look a lot different,

272
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,069
so emerging threats is
creating detections and rules

273
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:34,660
for malware that's in the wild,

274
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,719
things that are being discussed,

275
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,759
reports that are coming out.

276
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,910
So new information we're
constantly adding to our database.

277
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,569
Currently we have about 20%
penetration on MITRE ATT&CK tags

278
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:48,769
for the emerging threat
serracotta rule set.

279
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:51,480
And this is the average over seven days.

280
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,500
And this average over seven days

281
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,209
just happened to be captured
when all of the wipers

282
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:58,160
were coming out, the Isaac
wiper, the hermetic wiper,

283
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,219
all of this really
interesting malware associated

284
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,699
with threats in Ukraine.

285
00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:08,990
So with all of those caveats,
those beautiful graph shows

286
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:13,549
that developed capabilities
was the number one TTP

287
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:17,059
that we actually observed,
which is totally reasonable

288
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:18,738
given that we're looking at malware

289
00:14:18,739 --> 00:14:22,109
that is being developed by threat actors.

290
00:14:22,109 --> 00:14:24,569
Unfortunately for me and this talk

291
00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:27,959
developed capabilities doesn't
have a defense mapped to it,

292
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,488
there's no mitigation
really to kind of push back

293
00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:31,489
against that.

294
00:14:31,489 --> 00:14:32,709
So if you're an actual defender,

295
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:35,099
if you're somebody working
in your own environment,

296
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,609
your graph is gonna look a lot different,

297
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:39,740
it's gonna probably see the behaviors

298
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,899
that are most frequently observed,

299
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:45,119
the malware that is coming up most often,

300
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:48,239
the capabilities or the
defensive agents et cetera.

301
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:50,839
But I didn't think that
this was a pretty cool way.

302
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:52,769
Basically I just use our Splunk instance

303
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:55,589
to grab all the MITRE ATT&CK
data and then push out

304
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:58,410
this lovely little graphic.

305
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,560
The other two of the top three
would be exfiltration over C2

306
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,699
and data encrypted for impact.

307
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,029
Again, that kind of aligns with the wipers

308
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,420
that we were looking at.

309
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,500
So this is really beneficial
because you can use data,

310
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,949
you can use MITRE ATT&CK
data to build your case,

311
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:16,290
to push back against the biases

312
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,329
that might be exhibited by leadership.

313
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:21,040
Some of these biases are very much rooted

314
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,889
in what is the big thing going on?

315
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,240
Like what is in the news?

316
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,139
What are we hearing about, what
is everybody talking about?

317
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:31,529
And that's obviously impacting
our organization too.

318
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:34,519
So we have to spend resources
and cycles looking at it.

319
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:36,660
A really interesting example, I think

320
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,259
is again, kind of
referencing Russia Ukraine.

321
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:42,489
There was a lot of concern over,

322
00:15:42,489 --> 00:15:45,109
especially in the early days
of the conflict cyber attacks

323
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:47,179
and the potential spillover, etcetera,

324
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,769
and impact on Western organizations.

325
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:52,179
There wasn't a lot of
evidence in the early days

326
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:54,209
of the conflict that this
was actually happening.

327
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:56,469
However, there are a lot of
people with ruffled feathers

328
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,360
that says this is happening.

329
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,360
There is these wipers that
are appearing in Ukraine.

330
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,360
So we should be looking for them.

331
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,639
They're probably impacting
our organization as well.

332
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,419
Well, you can take this data.

333
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:08,419
You can take these mappings.

334
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:09,829
You can say, this is
actually what we're seeing

335
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:12,569
most often in our organization.

336
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:14,240
Or you can use threat data

337
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,209
that's observed in the
threat landscape and say,

338
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:19,160
this is what's impacting
other organizations

339
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,949
within our similar verticals
to really push back

340
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:24,790
against that bias.

341
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,939
Everyone loves pretty
pictures, including me

342
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,549
and including executives.

343
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:30,529
So it really helps to be
able to sort of visualize

344
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:32,529
what's going on in your environment.

345
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:35,680
Fundamentally and ultimately Pinkerton

346
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,228
really failed his boss.

347
00:16:38,229 --> 00:16:41,239
Instead of really pushing
back against that hippo bias

348
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:45,279
instead of providing these sort
of accurate numbers and data

349
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,959
that his boss could then
I guess, further inflate,

350
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:51,018
but they would be closer to the truth.

351
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:53,290
He really just wanted to make him happy.

352
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,709
And ultimately that misreporting

353
00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:59,939
likely caused the union army successes

354
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:03,728
early on in the civil war.

355
00:17:03,729 --> 00:17:05,559
So another thing that
I think is very funny

356
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:09,439
and worth investigating is Pinkerton's

357
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,150
sort of love of words, his wordiness,

358
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,839
how he actually wrote and
disseminated threat intelligence.

359
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,369
I love this quote because
I think it's very funny

360
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:22,279
and very illuminating
of not just Pinkerton,

361
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:25,449
but kind of the expectations

362
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:27,279
of intelligence officers at the time.

363
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,870
"He always wrote intelligence reports

364
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,408
in the form of a letter

365
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:33,440
and they began with a flowery opening,

366
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,460
officers of the day commonly used

367
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,970
such as I have the honor to report."

368
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:43,169
Imagine starting a tweet off like that.

369
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:46,700
But yeah, so this was
very wordy, very flowery.

370
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,309
It was like writing a letter.

371
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:51,620
A I was looking into this for the talk

372
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,699
and conducting some additional research.

373
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,440
I stumbled across this quote

374
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,940
from George Mason University
lecture in which the lecturer

375
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,500
described Pinkerton's
intelligence reporting

376
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:07,509
as wordy and flatulent
which of all the things

377
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:10,120
that could possibly be
said about my writing.

378
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,008
That would probably be the worst.

379
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:14,600
So it's very interesting
to kind of think about

380
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,459
how he actually reports this data.

381
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,769
So again, it wasn't just Pinkerton,

382
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:22,260
his staff did the same thing,

383
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,408
they wrote very, very long reports.

384
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:26,159
A lot of the key details were hidden

385
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:27,850
amongst flowery language,

386
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,409
tens, sometimes hundreds of pages deep.

387
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,470
There was actually at the
time two French brothers

388
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,200
who were working with General
McClellan and Alan Pinkerton,

389
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,380
who tried to become some of
these intelligence analysts

390
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:44,380
to take and collect
all of this information

391
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,480
that's hundreds and hundreds of pages

392
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,950
and try and distill it down further.

393
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,039
They weren't actually able
to due to some of the issues

394
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,390
with the intelligence itself,
such as confidence issues,

395
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,309
which we'll get to in just a second.

396
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:58,350
And they didn't actually
have access to the raw data.

397
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,779
So even they were looking at these reports

398
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:00,910
trying to be like, okay,

399
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:04,120
can I actually effectively
communicate this to our bosses

400
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,120
as to what's going on.

401
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,110
And they were like, oh, this
is really difficult, I can't.

402
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:13,370
Also fun fact he also
reportedly doodled big fingers

403
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,340
on the edges, like in
the margins of the paper,

404
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,860
like, look at this this is important,

405
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,360
which is very interesting.

406
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,908
I don't think that would
really work these days.

407
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:27,840
But succinctly and effectively
communicating intelligence

408
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,760
through written reports is difficult.

409
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,700
It's not something that you
automatically know how to do,

410
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,250
writing is definitely a skill,

411
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,830
communication is definitely a skill

412
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,659
that you can learn and hone and improve,

413
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,179
but there are ways to do it effectively.

414
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,070
And I'm gonna highlight
some tips and tricks

415
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,540
for your own reporting
and intelligence analysis

416
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,440
that you can take away
today and apply tomorrow

417
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,409
or whenever you're back at your desk.

418
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:54,080
Number one is bottom line upfront.

419
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,350
This is called the bluff.

420
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:59,009
This is a concept that's not
unique to threat intelligence.

421
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:01,039
It's actually something that's discussed

422
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,230
in a lot of business writing

423
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,940
and a lot of writing in general,

424
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,940
but basically you really want immediately

425
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,419
detail the findings of your reporting

426
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:11,789
and why they matter to your stakeholders.

427
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:14,408
You always want to put the
most important information

428
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:15,409
up first.

429
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:17,659
You don't want it 20 pages down

430
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:19,750
with cartoon fingers doodling that says,

431
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,029
this is the important information

432
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:24,350
because chances are, they're
not gonna get to page 20 or 30

433
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,350
at this point.

434
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,189
This can kind of be considered
the, so what portion

435
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,450
of the report, why does this matter?

436
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,500
So what, who cares?

437
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,870
Most people, especially key stakeholders

438
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:39,029
like executive audiences
will not read every word

439
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,600
of an in depth intelligence report.

440
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,519
In fact, a lot of your
comrades of people on Twitter

441
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,519
who are tweeting your story

442
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:48,549
or not your intelligence
reports are not reading

443
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:51,129
every aspect of your intelligence report.

444
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,299
So think about what are
people gonna put in a tweet?

445
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:58,299
That's the cool thing that matters,

446
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,840
but it really is if you
kind of think about it,

447
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,049
you wanna ensure when
someone reads something fast,

448
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:07,129
they can really understand
the points that matter most.

449
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:14,120
We have a limited amount of
energy reserves as people,

450
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,059
mental energy and physical energy.

451
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:18,918
Reading things takes energy,

452
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:23,120
deciding to take action
on something takes energy.

453
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,279
And so by effectively
writing and making sure

454
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:28,690
that the most important
information is detailed

455
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,940
and understood very, very quickly.

456
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,809
You can sort of save energy

457
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:34,658
for your audiences and stakeholders

458
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:36,780
to further make decisions like that.

459
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,299
Especially during COVID, I
don't know about you guys,

460
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,570
but my energy level is
like next to nothing.

461
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:46,519
So I can read about a page
before I'm like, all right.

462
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:50,340
And that kind of takes
us to the next portion,

463
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,340
which is be concise.

464
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:53,928
I've said this before

465
00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:56,429
and if anyone has watched my actual talk

466
00:21:56,429 --> 00:22:00,610
on writing intelligence reports
based on lessons learned

467
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,500
as a journalist, you've probably
heard me say this before,

468
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,169
but I don't believe that people
should require a thesaurus

469
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:10,200
to read and understand
intelligence reporting.

470
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,370
That's not because you think
your audience is stupid.

471
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:16,689
In fact, there are sort of general rules

472
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:18,970
that you learn as a journalist
or that you might learn

473
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,940
when you are a mass communicator

474
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,509
that you really wanna write
to a fifth to eighth grade

475
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:24,840
reading level.

476
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,600
Again, it's not because
people are not intelligent

477
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,529
or the recipients of your
information are stupid.

478
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:33,279
It goes back to that idea that
we have a limited capacity

479
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,279
of attention.

480
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:35,980
We have limited mental energy

481
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,700
that we're going to be spending on things

482
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,480
throughout our day.

483
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,120
Reading and digesting and understanding

484
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,870
threat intelligence reports
takes mental energy.

485
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,768
It takes more mental energy
to read and understand

486
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:50,620
one of those million
dollar words than it does

487
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,258
to read and understand a
sentence or simple words

488
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:56,610
or a handful of sentences or bullet points

489
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,258
that kind of really break it down

490
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:01,289
in the most easily digestible way.

491
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:03,870
Also that way, if it's very concise,

492
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:07,129
if it's easily understood,
if it's broadly understood

493
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:10,570
it can be more effectively
communicated moving on,

494
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,460
your stakeholders and executives
can take that information,

495
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,649
they can take basically the key takeaways

496
00:23:16,649 --> 00:23:18,199
and then further report it to people

497
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,640
that they might be
explaining something to.

498
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,380
So the report should contain
the relevant information

499
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,330
such as what happens,
why does this matter,

500
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:35,000
and what can we and or
what should we do about it?

501
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,490
Sometimes the what can we or
should we do about it piece

502
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,820
is this doesn't impact
our organization at all.

503
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,590
And we should not care about it.

504
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,709
In fact, I think that
that's what a lot of people

505
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,980
might spend their time doing,
like if we're thinking,

506
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,059
going back to talking about hippo bias,

507
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:52,580
something happens in the news.

508
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,149
Something big and explosive
and everyone's talking about it

509
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:57,499
and it's like, oh my gosh, how
does this impact us at all?

510
00:23:57,499 --> 00:24:03,139
It's like, well, it doesn't
so TLDR, don't worry about it,

511
00:24:03,139 --> 00:24:04,729
but you really wanna make it very obvious

512
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:07,200
what the actions that need to be taken

513
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,610
in response to this
information and intelligence

514
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:12,029
make it very, very clear
to your stakeholders

515
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:14,290
so they can make those decisions easier.

516
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,290
Oops.

517
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:18,970
If I laser beam someone
in the eye, I'm so sorry,

518
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,510
I pushed the wrong button.

519
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:24,720
And finally and this is so important.

520
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,720
You really wanna consider your audience.

521
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,530
So I bolded this because
it's like, near and dear

522
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,908
to my heart and very important,

523
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:35,399
but threat intelligence
analysts should always be aware

524
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:40,290
of who is reading your reports and why.

525
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,950
That could be a lot of different people

526
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,710
within an organization.

527
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,090
That could be someone in the stock,

528
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,951
that could be someone
who is doing IT security

529
00:24:47,951 --> 00:24:49,749
could be someone doing OT security.

530
00:24:49,749 --> 00:24:55,999
It could be somebody in HR that
is writing job descriptions

531
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:57,270
for LinkedIn that are gonna be

532
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,269
publicly available information

533
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:01,899
that contain sensitive details
about your organization

534
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:03,279
that could be potentially be used

535
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,519
for opensource information
gathering by an adversary.

536
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:10,860
So you really wanna understand,
who is your audience

537
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,229
for the reports that you're writing

538
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:17,899
and what actual decisions
are being made based on it.

539
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:20,809
Executives likely don't
need Ida screenshots,

540
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:25,370
snapshots of code, eyes
will glaze over and be like,

541
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:28,279
okay, onto the next thing.

542
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:31,210
Security operations likely
don't need geopolitical analysis

543
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,009
of events occurring in places

544
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:35,870
where the business does not operate.

545
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:40,168
That's not to say that
screenshots of malware,

546
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:44,269
like a code or geopolitical
analysis of events

547
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:47,730
going on in the world are not important.

548
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:48,730
It is super important,

549
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,220
it matters who is
receiving the information.

550
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,759
That SOC analyst doesn't
need to know what's going on

551
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,779
because they're not making
decisions based off of that data.

552
00:25:55,779 --> 00:25:57,110
They're making the decisions about stuff

553
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,830
that is impacting the
networks about the malware,

554
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,928
about the behaviors that
is actively going on

555
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:05,990
in the environment and not
necessarily these outside events

556
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:10,820
that have no impact on
the location or operation

557
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,549
of the business.

558
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:14,918
So you really wanna make
sure you know the answer

559
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:18,890
to what decisions are being
made based off this data.

560
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,840
So actually I have a
kind of a funny story.

561
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,230
So we published a pretty
interesting report

562
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:25,700
on some Python malware the other day,

563
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,940
it was a called a serpent backdoor,

564
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:33,450
and it was picked up in a
political newsletter in Politico,

565
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:36,360
and they highlighted the
sort of the targeting,

566
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,729
it was French entities

567
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,499
and construction and
government, et cetera.

568
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:45,379
And the gentleman, the Python
engineer and the gentleman

569
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:46,600
who looked at the malware was like,

570
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,120
they included the most boring
part of the whole thing.

571
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,418
Why didn't they include the
details about the malware

572
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:52,419
and how it operates?

573
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:54,529
I was like, well, the
political newsletter readers

574
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:58,899
are not really that interested
in the malware capabilities.

575
00:26:58,899 --> 00:27:00,268
It was definitely interesting,

576
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:03,909
to him as it was the most
actionable and impactful.

577
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:06,510
But again, to the people
that are reading information,

578
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,408
what matters most is really important.

579
00:27:09,409 --> 00:27:12,009
So gathering intelligence
requirements and understanding

580
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:14,440
how your audience is using intelligence

581
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,710
throughout the organization
can really help shape

582
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,309
and improve your reporting.

583
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:21,940
I said this to a lot of my team members

584
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,759
when we are trying to
develop our Intel program

585
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:28,230
and our intelligence requirements

586
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,950
is that you wanna anticipate the questions

587
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:34,169
that your customers or
your stakeholders have.

588
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:35,529
You wanna be able to know

589
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:36,799
what they're gonna come to you with.

590
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,029
You wanna know what they're
most concerned about.

591
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:43,789
You wanna know what types
of decisions are being made,

592
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:45,429
whether it's from a business perspective

593
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:48,230
or a network defense perspective,

594
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,409
and make sure that you are
collecting and disseminating

595
00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:52,580
and reporting out that information.

596
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,980
So when they come to you and say

597
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,280
do you have information on X?

598
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,899
You can say, actually, yes,
we've proactively collected

599
00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:01,268
and assessed this data.

600
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:03,409
Here's a report on it that
was either already published

601
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:06,320
or that we have this information about.

602
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,450
So it's really important
to kind of be anticipating

603
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,059
the needs of your stakeholders,

604
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:13,000
anticipating the decisions
that are gonna be made

605
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,580
off of the data that you're providing.

606
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:20,960
So you can succinctly,
effectively, concisely communicate.

607
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,110
So MITRE ATT&CK has really
become the universal framework

608
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,918
for threat actor TTPs,

609
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:28,260
and can be used to quickly distill

610
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,250
and communicate threat intelligence,

611
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,950
but where and how it's used really varies

612
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:37,420
based on the audience
receiving the information.

613
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:40,480
As many of you are probably aware.

614
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,249
I feel, I think it's really awesome

615
00:28:42,249 --> 00:28:45,840
that pretty much every intelligence
report that is published

616
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,149
by well for, for example, governments

617
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,340
will include MITRE ATT&CK mappings,

618
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,250
opensource intelligence from companies

619
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,480
will include MITRE ATT&CK mappings.

620
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,960
And I wanted to share an
example recently of two reports

621
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,450
that include mappings of MITRE
ATT&CK but in different ways,

622
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,789
because the audience and
how they were communicating

623
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:09,549
and receiving the information
was a lot different.

624
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:13,090
So Cyclops Blink malware, a
small office home office router

625
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:15,980
that basically replaced VPN filter.

626
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,869
This malware was first
published on in February

627
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:21,320
of this year.

628
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:26,129
It was the NCSC as well as
multiple US intelligence agencies

629
00:29:26,129 --> 00:29:30,269
published some details about
the Cyclops Blink malware.

630
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,720
And I'm including the NCSE reports here

631
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,799
as some fun examples,

632
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:41,279
because I thought that
it was the most striking

633
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,559
and effective way to sort
of show the difference

634
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:46,470
in where and how MITRE ATT&CK is used.

635
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,259
So there are two reports.

636
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:50,909
One is a strategic
report, one is tactical.

637
00:29:50,909 --> 00:29:52,540
Strategic is the blue and yellow.

638
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,809
It says new sand worm, malware
Cyclops Blink VPN filter.

639
00:29:56,809 --> 00:29:59,240
You can see the summary is
very high level strategic.

640
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,960
It goes into sand worm.

641
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,710
It goes into Russia APT
activity sort of overview

642
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,640
of the threat landscape
talks about VPN filter

643
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,179
talks about Cyclops Blink.

644
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:11,179
It's shorter.

645
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:12,669
It's about, I wanna
say it's about 10 pages

646
00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:17,320
and then on the right, I think yes right.

647
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:20,649
The right you have the malware report

648
00:30:20,649 --> 00:30:24,059
also published by NCSC.

649
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:27,369
This one has an executive
summary that dives right into it

650
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:28,369
starts off.

651
00:30:28,369 --> 00:30:29,658
It's a malicious Linux executable

652
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:32,669
compiled for the 32 bit power PC.

653
00:30:32,669 --> 00:30:34,820
So their executive summary
is very, very technical.

654
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,210
It gets into the details.

655
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:42,190
Both of these reports
included MITRE ATT&CK TTPs

656
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,360
in a spreadsheet.

657
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,769
The typical thing that you see.

658
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:49,299
Which one do you think MITRE
ATT&CK acted as a summary

659
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:50,830
versus not?

660
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:53,918
Feel free to point.

661
00:30:53,919 --> 00:31:00,059
Okay I'm gonna pretend
everyone is pointing,

662
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:03,470
yes to the right, yeah to
Cyclops Blink on the right.

663
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,470
Exactly.

664
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:07,700
So MITRE ATT&CK was basically
used here as the bluff.

665
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,929
It was the bottom line up front.

666
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:13,440
It was here are the TTPs
that are being observed

667
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,559
by this malware observed by this group.

668
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,850
And essentially the so what
was make sure you define it

669
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:20,908
against the TTPs.

670
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:22,830
Then it went really in depth into detail

671
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,980
about how the malware actually works.

672
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,210
It included those
screenshots of malware code.

673
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:30,659
It got very, very in the weeds

674
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:33,220
and kind of even about how
the different architecture

675
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:37,260
of the malware and how it
might impact various routers

676
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:42,340
and other things that it
potentially compromises.

677
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,340
On the right or on the left,

678
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,928
the strategic intelligence report

679
00:31:48,929 --> 00:31:49,929
that had the MITRE ATT&CK mappings,

680
00:31:49,929 --> 00:31:52,220
but it was at the very, very end.

681
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,890
So page three, for the malware analysis

682
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,989
where the MITRE ATT&CK mappings with bluff

683
00:31:56,989 --> 00:32:00,249
page like 10 at the very, very
end of the strategic report,

684
00:32:00,249 --> 00:32:03,029
that's where the malware
mappings occurred on that report,

685
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:05,639
because it was essentially learn more,

686
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:08,908
learn and understand how
this malware interacts

687
00:32:08,909 --> 00:32:11,179
with your environment, learn the TTPs

688
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,370
that we're out there looking for,

689
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:15,340
basically dig a little bit deeper.

690
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:20,080
So in the same way, you
have these two reports

691
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,210
on exactly the same threat

692
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:25,360
reported and disseminated
completely differently

693
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,399
using MITRE ATT&CK in
a way that best applies

694
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,498
to the stakeholders, the
people that are reading it

695
00:32:32,499 --> 00:32:33,580
and making decisions off of it.

696
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:40,269
So that was an example of
opensource intelligence.

697
00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:42,080
It was OSINT, it was provided by the NCSE.

698
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,019
It was publicly available, had some TTPs,

699
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:48,789
MITRE ATT&CK data,
defensive recommendations.

700
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:51,980
So this was information
that we used as analysts

701
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:57,990
to sort of inform and add
context to our own reports.

702
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:01,769
But Pinkerton unfortunately
was not very good

703
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:05,690
at evaluating information
and the information

704
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,600
that he was collecting from opensources,

705
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,230
but also from human
sources was often flawed.

706
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:14,470
So rarely did Pinkerton
include his enhanced reports

707
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,139
an evaluation of a source's reliability

708
00:33:17,139 --> 00:33:19,889
beyond a general impression he had of it.

709
00:33:19,889 --> 00:33:23,899
This is what my gut says, which
I mean sometimes is correct,

710
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:25,529
but not really effective

711
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:27,700
for when you're
communicating intelligence.

712
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,809
So you really wanna think

713
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:31,840
about the high, medium, low confidence.

714
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,928
High confidence.

715
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:33,929
This is in my network.

716
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:34,929
I see it.

717
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,049
I know it 100% to be true.

718
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:37,139
Medium confidence.

719
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,629
This is likely true.

720
00:33:38,629 --> 00:33:40,129
Low confidence.

721
00:33:40,129 --> 00:33:43,340
This is possibly true I
don't have high confidence

722
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,470
that it is actually correct.

723
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,869
It could be incorrect.

724
00:33:45,869 --> 00:33:48,090
Pinkerton did not have high,
medium, low confidence.

725
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,869
He didn't really have any assessment

726
00:33:49,869 --> 00:33:52,490
of his source's knowledge or reliability.

727
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,890
He just put it in his 100 page reports.

728
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:58,070
Maybe he poked a finger at it
that says look at this here

729
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:01,860
and moved on.

730
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,610
But it is really important.

731
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:06,620
Our job as analysts and people

732
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,960
that are reporting
information that we're getting

733
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,770
to assess and validate the
opensource intelligence

734
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:15,800
that we're reading about
and seeing on the internet

735
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,329
through Twitter, through
vendors and governments

736
00:34:19,329 --> 00:34:22,369
that are sharing these
intelligence reports.

737
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:26,469
So typically if we're
working at an organization,

738
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:28,839
we have hands on first party data.

739
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:32,299
We're observing this either
on our network, in our tool.

740
00:34:32,299 --> 00:34:34,000
So we know that it's true.

741
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,150
We are collecting this information.

742
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,850
We are doing research on it.

743
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:39,929
We are publishing data related to it,

744
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:41,379
but oftentimes we are using

745
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:44,250
opensource intelligence
analysis to add contacts

746
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,510
to better understand the threat landscape,

747
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,239
to make assessments as to how
the data that we're seeing

748
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,299
might fit into the
overall threat landscape

749
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:53,679
or how the threat landscape is impacting

750
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,480
how we're actually
viewing this information

751
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,041
and how we are going to
be taking action on it,

752
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:01,580
to defend ourselves.

753
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,880
A really interesting example,

754
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,430
keep bringing up Russia, Ukraine,

755
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:10,480
obviously for that's the big
stuff going on right now.

756
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,309
But in the early days
of the Ukraine invasion,

757
00:35:13,309 --> 00:35:15,710
there was a lot of stuff going on online.

758
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:19,690
Like a lot of claims from
anonymous Twitter accounts,

759
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:22,951
both anonymous as in
no name attached to it,

760
00:35:22,951 --> 00:35:25,210
as well as Anonymous, the hacking group,

761
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:28,660
that's not really affiliated
with anyone or anything,

762
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,868
but there was a lot of
tweets that were like

763
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:32,550
I dos this government website.

764
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:35,920
I stole all this data from
this Russian organization.

765
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,520
Here's all this information that I stole.

766
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,870
And I've been releasing that's associated

767
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:43,410
with the Russian banks.

768
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,710
There was just a lot of information

769
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:47,690
that was kind of flying
around, BGP hijacking.

770
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,300
I don't know if you
guys remember that day,

771
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,560
but there was like a ton
of claims of BGP hijacking

772
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,970
that had occurred in Ukraine.

773
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:57,750
Well, unfortunately, a lot of these claims

774
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:02,250
wound up in reports or
had executives talking,

775
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,349
had people asking what is going on?

776
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:06,350
Is this true, are we seeing
this in our information?

777
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:07,710
What is this telling us
about what's going on

778
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,000
in the war in Ukraine?

779
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,710
I wanted to highlight these two reports,

780
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,770
one from MIT technology review

781
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,130
and the other from the New York Times,

782
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:17,630
both of them kind of
discussing and talking

783
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:21,069
about how things happening online,

784
00:36:21,069 --> 00:36:24,400
things being reported online
were sometimes inaccurate

785
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,079
as well as how this sort of
loose group, the Ukraine IT army

786
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:33,960
was given directives to
conduct cyber operations.

787
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,799
Both of these were information
that was being provided

788
00:36:36,799 --> 00:36:38,920
it's out there, it's
available in opensources,

789
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,980
but validating it, confirming
it and kind of understanding

790
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,119
what that means to the
overall threat landscape

791
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,700
can be very, very difficult.

792
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,259
In many cases, the claims of
hacking DDoS BGP hijacking

793
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,859
were correct.

794
00:36:53,859 --> 00:36:55,950
So people got like really
spun up about things

795
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:58,740
before things were able to
be validated and reported

796
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:02,350
as true or false.

797
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,500
But there are multiple questions

798
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,130
that analysts can ask ourselves

799
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,690
when reviewing third party data

800
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,630
to support original research,

801
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:11,670
or to sort of better
understand what's going on

802
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:14,869
in the threat landscape
and whether something

803
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:17,040
is worth digging into
and could potentially

804
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,410
impact your organization.

805
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:23,379
So, number one, what is the
visibility of the individual

806
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,190
or the organization?

807
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,510
An example of this,

808
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:30,809
an antivirus company might
have most of its customers

809
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:33,710
based in certain geographic regions.

810
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,569
If they publish a report
that highlights malware

811
00:37:36,569 --> 00:37:40,310
that's impacting specific verticals,

812
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,529
specific companies and organizations

813
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:45,140
that is going to be clouded or biased

814
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,379
towards the geographies
in which they operate,

815
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:51,420
same thing with an
individual making claims,

816
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,270
for example, on Twitter,

817
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:56,390
what is the visibility of this individual?

818
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:58,279
Are they talking about
first party data collection?

819
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,810
Do they have the information

820
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,130
and they are making
assessments based off of it,

821
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:05,430
or are they using their
own sort of analysis?

822
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,430
Are they making their own judgments?

823
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:09,020
They don't actually have
visibility into what's going on,

824
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,299
but are making their own judgment calls

825
00:38:12,299 --> 00:38:13,730
and sharing information.

826
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:17,940
So what is the visibility
of this organization?

827
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,360
What evidence are there claims based on?

828
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,339
It's really wonderful and amazing

829
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:27,490
when vendors or researchers
publish all of the evidence

830
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:30,009
that are used to make their decisions.

831
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,150
It's great because that
answers the next question,

832
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,470
is this evidence available to me?

833
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,160
Can I take look at this information?

834
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,440
Can I conduct my own research
and analysis based off of it?

835
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,220
If not, then you have
to kind of ask yourself,

836
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,899
who is this organization
or what is the organization

837
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,160
that is publishing this information?

838
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,970
Do I believe, do I trust

839
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:54,169
that they are making high
confidence assessments

840
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,609
based on good evidence?

841
00:38:55,609 --> 00:38:59,029
Do I believe that the
evidence that they have

842
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,500
leads to the conclusions
that they're making?

843
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,730
We keep talking about
the invasion of Ukraine,

844
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:07,720
so I know there was a lot
of criticism for example,

845
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,689
when the US government came out and said,

846
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:13,000
we have high confidence that
there are cyber activities

847
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,890
that are happening shields up,

848
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:18,609
there wasn't any evidence
really that was made available

849
00:39:18,609 --> 00:39:20,620
to support their claims.

850
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,990
But there was a lot of
discussion that says,

851
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,680
well, this is the US government.

852
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,540
They likely have evidence historically,

853
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,619
they have shown to be very trustworthy

854
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:32,500
in what they're putting out or vice versa.

855
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,390
So it's really important
to kind of think about,

856
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:36,069
is this evidence available to me?

857
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:39,770
Can I use it to add context
to my own reporting,

858
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:43,150
to conduct hunting, conduct attribution,

859
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,869
and potentially come to
different conclusions

860
00:39:44,869 --> 00:39:48,309
than what are published publicly.

861
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:51,320
Does this overlap with
known threat activity?

862
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,799
Is this something that I'm tracking?

863
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:55,700
Is this an actor that we see in our data

864
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,700
and I'm using it to sort of
contextualize or validate

865
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,470
what I'm seeing but what's
based on public reporting

866
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:04,279
and we're talking just a
second about how MITRE ATT&CK

867
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,290
are useful to that.

868
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:10,940
And finally, cui bono
who benefits and how?

869
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,160
This is something I think that actually

870
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,230
you have to kind of train
your brain to think about,

871
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,099
it's not really immediately obvious

872
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:20,270
or a part sometimes of the
intelligence analysis process.

873
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:23,619
We're very data focused people
I think in a lot of ways.

874
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:24,750
So we like to look at the evidence.

875
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,760
We like to look at the
indicators of compromise.

876
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,329
We like to look at the TTPs.

877
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:31,970
We don't often think about
the cui bono or who benefits.

878
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:34,890
There are multiple reasons
why an organization,

879
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:40,009
a government, a person might
publish information and data

880
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:41,780
in an intelligence report.

881
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:46,490
It could be economic, financial,
governmental, geopolitical,

882
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:51,899
for example, a cybersecurity
company might team up

883
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,599
with a conservative think tank.

884
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,089
And in 2015 publish information about Iran

885
00:40:57,089 --> 00:41:00,470
hacking the United States,
conducting tons of cyber attacks

886
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,370
against the United States.

887
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:05,350
Well, it might be interesting
to note that that report

888
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:08,549
was also published when
the Iran nuclear talks

889
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,809
were happening.

890
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:15,741
Why might an organization
have bias or would benefit

891
00:41:15,741 --> 00:41:20,180
by publishing details about
alleged Iranian cyber attacks

892
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,319
against the United States

893
00:41:21,319 --> 00:41:24,770
while this major political
event is happening?

894
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:27,880
So it's just kind of
something to think about,

895
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,520
if you kind of identify the benefits,

896
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,740
you can also potentially
identify the biases

897
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,069
in the reporting.

898
00:41:33,069 --> 00:41:34,380
I wanna be clear here.

899
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,349
It's not to say that having biases

900
00:41:36,349 --> 00:41:40,099
or identifying the
benefits to an organization

901
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:43,319
or an individual means
that the data is bad

902
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:44,950
or that you can't use it.

903
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:48,868
It just kind of helps add
context and understanding

904
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:50,510
to the information.

905
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:51,530
It's still totally usable.

906
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:52,730
You might wanna continue to use it

907
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,559
and include it in your own reporting,

908
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:59,599
but it is worth noting
what those biases might be.

909
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,569
So MITRE ATT&CK is a very, very useful tool

910
00:42:03,569 --> 00:42:07,750
for validating opensource information.

911
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,540
It's great because I
feel like Adam and crew

912
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,771
have done a lot of the hard work

913
00:42:11,771 --> 00:42:14,210
by collecting all of this
opensource information,

914
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:16,800
going through the indicators
of compromise in the TTPs

915
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,350
and adding them to this
existing framework.

916
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:20,839
It could be very useful to cross reference

917
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,839
stuff that you are looking
at or stuff that is appearing

918
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:27,390
in opensource data with
the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

919
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:32,650
In many ways, MITRE ATT&CK has
really become this dictionary

920
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:37,670
of threats, this amazing
resource of information.

921
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,430
And I wanna kind of take us back

922
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:44,399
to another fun historical
journey in while Alan Pinkerton

923
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,099
is operating and fighting for the union

924
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:48,730
while the civil war is going on.

925
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,310
There are a bunch of academics in the UK

926
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:53,359
and England and Scotland that
are like, hold on a second.

927
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,369
We have to standardize
the English language.

928
00:42:55,369 --> 00:42:57,789
There are a lot of dictionaries
that exist at the time.

929
00:42:57,789 --> 00:43:00,470
They're just not really
up to those standards.

930
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:03,538
They've colonized a lot
of the world and are like,

931
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:06,140
oh, well, maybe we should
sort of standardize English

932
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:09,750
in a way that sort of is for everyone.

933
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,339
It was really a collaborative effort

934
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:12,630
in the English speaking world.

935
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,920
These academics were like, hang on.

936
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,650
What if we ask the people who
are speaking this language

937
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:19,760
to help us define it and create it

938
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,640
and kind of standardize it.

939
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,558
And really the MITRE tech framework

940
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:26,990
has become the universal
dictionary of TTPs

941
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:30,229
in the same way that the
Oxford English dictionary did

942
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:33,240
in the late 1800s.

943
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,910
In large part due to the
contributions from analysts

944
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:37,879
and researchers all around the world.

945
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,900
So I was talking to Adam when
I was prepping for this talk.

946
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,030
And according to the team,
155 people contributed

947
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,880
to the framework in 2021.

948
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,390
So congratulations, I'm
sure a lot of people

949
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:53,049
in this audience and watching
online were a part of that.

950
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:57,520
So the authoritative
nature of the framework

951
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,380
has allowed analysts to
verify opensource reporting

952
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,391
better understand the
nature and the behavior

953
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:04,960
of threat actors,

954
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,849
has allowed researchers to
more effectively document

955
00:44:07,849 --> 00:44:10,119
and communicate those threat behaviors

956
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:14,880
as well as prioritize
detections and improve defense.

957
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,299
By standardizing how we identify

958
00:44:17,299 --> 00:44:20,540
and classify threat behaviors,
actionable intelligence

959
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:23,190
can be more easily communicated

960
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,430
to a variety of stakeholders,

961
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:27,440
whether that's in depth power analysis

962
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,839
or very high level strategic reporting,

963
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:32,599
MITRE ATT&CK really has a
place in the communication

964
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:35,260
and dissemination of threat intelligence.

965
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:38,570
Unfortunately for him, Pinkerton

966
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:41,069
did not have a reliable
threat intelligence framework

967
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:43,690
or dictionary off which to operate.

968
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:46,130
In fact, he really was
creating and running

969
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:48,569
the nation's first secret service

970
00:44:48,569 --> 00:44:52,279
that would eventually become
capital S secret service

971
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,300
that we know it today.

972
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,260
But by examining the
intelligence reporting failures

973
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:00,560
documented by modern historians,

974
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,450
threat intelligence analysts
operating in the world of cyber

975
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:06,828
can be better prepared
for when one day they too

976
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,109
might be called on to
potentially communicate

977
00:45:09,109 --> 00:45:12,000
and change the course of history.

978
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,690
So that's all I have for you today.

979
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:15,521
Thank you so much for your
time and hanging out with me

980
00:45:15,521 --> 00:45:17,280
and I'll stick around the
conference for any questions

981
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,280
Thank you.

982
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:18,282
(audience applauding)
