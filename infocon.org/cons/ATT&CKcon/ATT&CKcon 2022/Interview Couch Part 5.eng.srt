1
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,980
- Back to a couch con talks.

2
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,340
My name is Katself I'm,
the Mac OS and Linex lead

3
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,570
for ATT&CK.

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,530
And we are here with Santiago and Dimitri.

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,880
oh! Sorry, Dimitri and Santiago.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,980
They gave a talk earlier today about

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,440
Latin America threat actors.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,980
And we're gonna talk to
them a little bit more.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,449
So, for those of you that are online,

10
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:31,740
which this let's be real,

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,610
like this is what this content is for,

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,720
for all of our online viewers,

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,960
to be able to connect with our speakers.

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,140
We really encourage you to
like tweet your questions or

15
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,440
really use a slack room.

16
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,320
That's what I actually have up right now.

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,320
So, if you're in slack,

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,790
tweet your questions for the
speakers that we have here,

19
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,540
and I'll be keeping an eye
and then I'll ask them those

20
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,230
questions for you.

21
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,500
So, first off, amazing
talk on Latin America.

22
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,120
- Thank you very much, Kat.

23
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,949
- I so appreciate, like
there's so few talks or

24
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,521
presentations out there,
regarding Latin America

25
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,879
and threat actors.

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,940
So, just thank you. But
why do you think that is?

27
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,940
Why do you think that there's

28
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,399
this gap on coverage for Latin America?

29
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:14,790
- Well, if we look into the history,

30
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,400
Latin America served for years for decades

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,200
for many refugees running away from,

32
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,109
I don't know, Europe and other countries.

33
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:25,908
And it used to be like a place of calm,

34
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:31,039
peace and Serenity for
many, but in reality,

35
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:34,830
it's a huge region that
it's all ecosystem attacks,

36
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,310
threat actors, motivations,

37
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,119
and usually very few
security vendors and security

38
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,990
researchers have, like a
decent insight into the region.

39
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,130
So, that's why we decided to
come here and to present about

40
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,250
that, to open the Pandora box

41
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:58,359
and to show the beast
living in Latin America.

42
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:01,880
- I love that. That's
so courageous as well.

43
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,039
'Cause like what you all were saying,

44
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,520
like there's a lot of mercenaries there's,

45
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,869
it's a, seems like a very
dangerous arena to be open about.

46
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:11,630
So, I so appreciate that.

47
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,380
'Cause I can only imagine
like the spotlight that,

48
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,380
that puts on you all.

49
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,380
- Yeah.

50
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,180
Also I come from Argentina, so
I expect things to not work.

51
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:25,450
So, I, I kind of, got used to,

52
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,760
dealing with problems and,

53
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,950
and as Dim has said before,

54
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:32,420
we kind of go with the
flow, but beyond that,

55
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,149
we've been working on these
campaigns for close to 10 years.

56
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,209
So, there is no
improvisation on the research

57
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:38,209
(Santiago chuckles)

58
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:41,430
we improvise in our lives,
but the research is solid.

59
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,209
We live and breathe what
we presented before.

60
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:47,780
So, it was a long flight,
but I think so far,

61
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,799
the conference for me has been amazing.

62
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:54,590
My Twitter handle is (indistinct)
and he's Dimitri best,

63
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,620
I'll be tweeting memes
for the rest of the day.

64
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,620
- Yes.

65
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,620
So, (Santiago laughs)

66
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,620
- There's.....

67
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,620
- Now that the presentation is finished.

68
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,620
Just memes.

69
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,700
- I love it. Oh my gosh.

70
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,179
I love it, I so appreciate that.

71
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,330
So, we're clear.

72
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,330
- Yeah.

73
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,909
- There's been some
great memes going on too.

74
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:15,440
Also You've gotten a lot of
kudos for such an amazing

75
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,879
presentation.

76
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:17,879
- Thank you.

77
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,179
For us, it's such a privilege to be here.

78
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,030
We feel so great. And especially,

79
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:27,959
being surrounded by so many
experts and the receptions

80
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,610
we received when we got here.

81
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,150
It's, it was worth all that.

82
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,349
It's so good to be here, Thank you.

83
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:37,140
- That makes my heart so happy to hear,

84
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,268
'cause I know you came here from Miami.

85
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:41,560
I know that's a long flight and
I know a 15 hour flight from

86
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,560
Argentina.

87
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,430
- Yeah, yeah.

88
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,140
But we were talking before,

89
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,130
After two years of being at home,

90
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,689
I was at home with my dog, just my dog.

91
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,599
So, we're we're brothers now,

92
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,459
but after two years you kind
of want to meet people again.

93
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:57,510
So, yeah.

94
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,179
Thank you for the opportunity
and we felt welcome here.

95
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,400
So, thank you for that.

96
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
- Good.

97
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,490
I'm really glad you did.

98
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,490
- Thank you.

99
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,370
- So, You're always welcome, especially on

100
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,370
the ATT&CKcon couch.

101
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,370
- Thanks.

102
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,370
- All right.

103
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,370
Is there anything that you guys
wanna kind of say to all of

104
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,769
our viewers that are streaming today?

105
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:17,890
- One thing from my side as
we are releasing all the Jason

106
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,219
files, all the, the
things that we actually

107
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,350
did on our presentation.

108
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,870
And I consider this presentation kind of a

109
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,860
rolling release, because we'll be,

110
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,180
maybe writing a blog post.

111
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,620
It depends on what feedback we get,

112
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,880
but we actually want to
keep on developing this.

113
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,110
So, give us your feedback.

114
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,280
If you think it's worth it,

115
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,669
we will keep on adding stuff.

116
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,450
- Absolutely, Yes.

117
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,349
And by next week we will
have our blog post also like

118
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,450
mentioning the conference because

119
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:50,580
this is a great conference and
whoever, who's interested in

120
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,310
researching together, Latin
American threats, threat actors,

121
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,550
we are here.

122
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,310
we are available on Twitter slack.

123
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:03,630
We can speak during the break
lunch, evening, and it'll be

124
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:08,940
very nice to work together
and providing more visibility

125
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,530
and actionable intelligence
to the community.

126
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,479
With the help of the community
and for the community.

127
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,090
- I love that. We're all
about community here,

128
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:18,869
but I will say, watch what you asked for.

129
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,790
'Cause I know Matt Malone
already inside of the slack room

130
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,660
was like, we're collaborating after this,

131
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,130
get with me after the talk.

132
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,630
I have someone on my team
that really wants to write

133
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,170
Spanish and Portuguese articles.

134
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,200
So, we're very excited about that.

135
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,479
So, I will definitely
connect you with some of,

136
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,600
some of our key individuals
that are trying to bring

137
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,420
more awareness into that area as well.

138
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,420
- Thank you.

139
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,070
Yeah, It will be our pleasure.

140
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,070
- You guys are amazing.

141
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,070
Thank you so much again.

142
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,070
- Yeah.

143
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,070
- Thank you for having us here.

144
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,070
It's been a pleasure.

145
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,070
- Thank you.

146
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,070
- Thanks.

147
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,070
- All right.

148
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,500
So, you all got to meet
Dimitri in Santiago,

149
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,941
and next step, we're going
to be talking to David.

150
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:58,969
David did a great talk earlier on engage.

151
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,330
So, now we get to talk to him about,

152
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,849
what does that look like?

153
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,220
Like how, actually better yet?

154
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,900
How are you feeling about the
talk now that you're done,

155
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,159
now you can relax and enjoy
the rest of the conference.

156
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,520
How do you feel?

157
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,080
- So, I feel pretty great good.

158
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,750
And also looks like this
is a Latino coach today.

159
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,750
because I'm from Spain.

160
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,750
- that's awesome.

161
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,260
So, Argentina, Miami are not Spanish.

162
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,260
So, looks like.

163
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,289
- Miami is Spanish. I
shouldn't probably say that,

164
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,200
but I might. Yeah, it's got
the best also dancing down.

165
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
- Certainly Yeah.

166
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,510
So, yeah, I feel pretty great.

167
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,140
Yeah, I think the audience great.

168
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,630
The atmosphere is fantastic.

169
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,100
The confidence is awesome.

170
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,260
So, yeah, I think everything is fantastic.

171
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,599
- Did you fly here from Spain?

172
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
- Yes.

173
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,840
- Oh, my gosh! How long was that flight?

174
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,280
- Well, I went through Munich,

175
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,489
so, it was like the entire
flight was like 18 hours, Yeah.

176
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,940
But I needed two go through Germany.

177
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,940
So.

178
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,940
- Thank you. Yeah.

179
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,940
- You are welcome.

180
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,940
- Thank you so much for flying here.

181
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,940
That's, I know that's taxing.

182
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,580
How has the time zones been affecting you?

183
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,440
- Yeah, I'm still bit jet lagged.

184
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,370
So, I feel a bit dizzy today,

185
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,020
but I guess that well know
today we'll have some party,

186
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,130
so, we'll have some fun.

187
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,040
- Its nice thing about
being in the conference

188
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,250
is that you get enjoy all it's funny,

189
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,530
I was talking with some people yesterday

190
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,369
and there's the conference
and then there's the

191
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,370
presentations, right?

192
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,580
These amazing technical talks.

193
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,770
But then there's also just
the connecting with people

194
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,880
afterwards, where you're like, okay,

195
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,380
let's get down to real talk.
Like what are you working on?

196
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,680
And then trying to like
foster those relationships.

197
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,930
So, I'm really glad you'll
be able to enjoy those.

198
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,330
So, when in your talk,

199
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,280
something that you had briefly discussed

200
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,210
was the active defense.

201
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:35,080
What do you think the
difference is between engagement

202
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,750
and then hacking back?
Like what does that line?

203
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,740
- So, I think that's a very hot topic,

204
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,050
always have been on a very hot topic,

205
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,090
because when we talk about active defense,

206
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,150
there is like a huge and
broad spectrum between like a

207
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:51,469
passive defense, active defense.

208
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,430
And as I said, I think
that we have hacking back.

209
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,630
So, hacking back is something
that only law enforcement and

210
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,610
military can do, not like a
normal people or civilians.

211
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:05,410
So, when we say active defense is more,

212
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,020
what (indistinct) engage is proposing.

213
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,599
So, trying to engage with
adversity with the threat doctor,

214
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,020
but without hacking back,

215
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,539
just trying to collect
information from the attacker,

216
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,340
gather threat intelligence,

217
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,440
try to force the attacker
to make some mistakes,

218
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,680
try to show the intentions.

219
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,750
So, try to deny their, everything
that they're trying to do.

220
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,490
So, it's not hacking back.

221
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,110
So, we are not trying
to attack the attacker.

222
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,279
We are just wanted to first detect that

223
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,970
activity of the attacker.

224
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,990
Second, try to impose some kind of cost,

225
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,210
like about denying something

226
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,670
or making life harder for the attacker.

227
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,709
And then finally we want to
collect that information.

228
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:49,349
So, it's nothing about hacking back.

229
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,139
Hacking back It's only for
law enforcement and military.

230
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:53,720
- What do you think about the price.

231
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,740
I know some organizations, what
they'll do is they're like,

232
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,329
okay, we know you're in here,
but we wanna observe you.

233
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:00,329
So, we'll just like,

234
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:01,819
let you have some of our
sensitive information,

235
00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:03,380
but nothing that really hurts us.

236
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,350
Like what do you think about like how,

237
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,910
is there any advice you can
give for people that are trying

238
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,209
to do engagement that are,

239
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:11,290
have someone in their environment

240
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,649
And they're trying to
collect information on it,

241
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:15,290
like when to draw that fine
line or how to make those

242
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,300
decision points?

243
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,589
- So, I think that there is a
previous phase before engaging

244
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:22,589
with attacker.

245
00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:24,639
That is the planning phase.

246
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,730
When you need to specify very clearly

247
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,560
what is going to be your success criteria

248
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,800
or what are your main
objective for that engagement?

249
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,910
So, if you define very well,

250
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,469
what you want to do in
that planning phase,

251
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,889
then I think everything will be easier.

252
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:41,850
But that planning phase for me is

253
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,350
one of the most important ones.

254
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,040
So, you need to define who are
you going to interact with,

255
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,930
because you need to know
something from (indistinct) actor.

256
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:53,079
You need to know at least
intentions and the tools they're

257
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:56,359
going to use so that you are
capable of trying to show

258
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,040
something interesting for the attacker.

259
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,930
But of course, then you
need to create narrative

260
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,400
that will engage with the attacker.

261
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,009
So, depending on, if you
want to give that information

262
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:09,420
to the attacker or not,
that's something that needs

263
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,750
to be defined the planning phase.

264
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,720
So I guess that the main advice would be

265
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,960
focus on the planning,
because not engagement

266
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,279
is not only about technical stuff.

267
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,379
It's about thinking carefully
what you want to do,

268
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:24,870
and then analyzing what you're
going to do with information

269
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,160
you have collected. But the
technical staff is important,

270
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,230
but it's, I think it's more,

271
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,260
more important to define
everything on the planning.

272
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,329
- So, that reminds me of saying
like, a plan to fail is a

273
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:36,368
failure to plan.

274
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,369
- Yeah.

275
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:38,369
That's a good one.

276
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:39,369
- Yeah, that makes sense.

277
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:40,369
Is there anything that you
wanna share with our online

278
00:10:40,369 --> 00:10:43,660
viewers to kinda like, anything that you,

279
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,019
whether it's with engage or
your own personal topics that

280
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:49,610
you've kinda found that you
just like always want to share

281
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,059
on and make a a point?

282
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:55,199
- So, I think that one of the
things that I think we need to

283
00:10:55,199 --> 00:11:00,490
change as defenders, is that
as both teams are doing.

284
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,930
We need to create our own set of tools,

285
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,329
and try to do something more.

286
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:07,829
So, because sometimes we just

287
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:10,949
receive tons of alerts from
different security products.

288
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:15,579
We just try to respond
for every single incident,

289
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:17,859
but we need to try to be more proactive,

290
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,029
perhaps trying to
replicate many things that

291
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:23,019
the red teams are doing,
like be more proactive,

292
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:25,519
trying to defend our
perimeter or defend our data.

293
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,630
So, I guess that, it means that
we need to change sometimes

294
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:32,220
our mindset and trying to be more active.

295
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,740
So, I think that's the big
advice I can do this Way.

296
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,740
- I like that.

297
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,549
'Cause red teams are always
like, what's new, what's next?

298
00:11:38,549 --> 00:11:39,549
- Yes.

299
00:11:39,549 --> 00:11:40,549
- What's the tool I can
automate this with. Right?

300
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:41,549
So, I don't have to do this manual work.

301
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:43,890
And then the same would
go for blue blue teams.

302
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:44,890
- Yes.

303
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:45,890
Where it's like, what's new, what's next,

304
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:46,890
what's a new way to detect.

305
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:47,920
What's a new tool I could develop.

306
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
- Yeah.

307
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,740
But I think the good thing is
that there are more and more,

308
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,230
like a open source tools
or any type products that

309
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,740
have designed for helping the
blue team or the defenders.

310
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,260
So, I think things are
changing, but still,

311
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,730
I think we need to be more
proactive from the defender's

312
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,730
point of view.

313
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,730
- That makes sense.

314
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,920
Now, thank you so much for sharing that.

315
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,099
I really appreciate what...

316
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,100
- You're welcome. Thank you.

317
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,100
- So, yeah.

318
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,080
So, next step we get to
talk about insider threat.

319
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,639
This is a huge, super spicy topic actually

320
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,490
for a lot of different organizations.

321
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,309
So, Matt is gonna tell us all about how,

322
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,990
so, first, first and foremost,

323
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,269
how are you enjoying the
conference is the last day.

324
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:28,269
How are you feeling?

325
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:29,310
- Yeah, it's awesome.

326
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,630
It's been a great conference and just,

327
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,360
it's amazing to see,
'cause this is the first

328
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,180
conference I've been to in two years.

329
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,160
How, how well run it is,

330
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,930
how everything's taking, starting on time,

331
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,430
finishing on time.

332
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,430
Everything's so well put together.

333
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,309
It's, it's refreshing to be back with

334
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:47,740
your peers in the industry and talking

335
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,079
and seeing what they're
doing and learning more.

336
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:52,138
- Well, thank you.

337
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:55,939
We have an incredible team
that's kind of behind the scenes.

338
00:12:55,939 --> 00:12:56,939
That's definitely running this.

339
00:12:56,939 --> 00:12:57,939
- And definitely

340
00:12:57,939 --> 00:12:58,939
handling all the stress for everyone.

341
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:04,498
So, full shout out to all of them.

342
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:05,720
For the insider threat,

343
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,279
you brought us some fantastic
topics on everything from

344
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:13,189
how to collect from how to go
about it, how to build that,

345
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,519
build it out.

346
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,620
What do you think is like,

347
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,940
you know there's always like big brother,

348
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,940
- Yes.

349
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,940
- that we always talk about.

350
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,579
And then a lot of organizations where,

351
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:25,599
there's even countries, right?

352
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,870
That refuse to have their
information collected, right?

353
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,870
- Yes.

354
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,129
- Like there's, there's so
many different topics on

355
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:34,509
why I wanna have privacy
or I wanna autonomy.

356
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:38,100
What is the fine balance between being a

357
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,949
company that is trying to
preserve their company, right?

358
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:41,949
- Yes.

359
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:43,859
- Because we like, if
the company goes down,

360
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,899
there are no jobs. Right?

361
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:45,899
- Exactly.

362
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,730
- So, and then also being an employee

363
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,339
that feels with their
privacy is respected.

364
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:51,850
What do you think that balances.?

365
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,689
- It's I think it's intent,

366
00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:55,610
you have to understand
what your program needs

367
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,110
to accomplish first

368
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,250
and you build for towards
specific objectives.

369
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,110
And that's what I think using MITRE ATT&CK

370
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,620
has really helped us here to say.

371
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,860
we wanna find these specific events.

372
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,150
We're not looking to just
collect everything and then be

373
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,189
able to make arbitrary decisions.

374
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:15,790
I think the biggest fear
employees have with insider threat

375
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,149
monitoring is that they're going

376
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:19,790
to become the target of the company that,

377
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,889
what if they fall out
of favor with leadership

378
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:25,279
or something happens and
then now all of a sudden,

379
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,439
all of this information, all of this

380
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:29,819
user telemetry is gonna
be used against them.

381
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:30,889
And that, that can't happen.

382
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:33,819
And if you're at an organization
that's allowing that,

383
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:36,490
then you are creating
more insider threats,

384
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,490
then you're solving.

385
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,600
So, I think the key is knowing
where you're going to draw

386
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
that line.

387
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,269
And I think one of the
successful ways you can do that,

388
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:45,750
is with risk based alerting.

389
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,939
And so, it's a process of understanding

390
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:49,349
where your risks are

391
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,170
and then identifying what
threshold you're gonna set at.

392
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:55,748
And so, you're not looking
at everybody's activity,

393
00:14:55,749 --> 00:14:58,720
you're looking at the
activity that exceeds

394
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,040
a reasonable threshold.

395
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,259
So, when you do a review
and you're looking at this,

396
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:05,029
you're not looking just to see,

397
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,319
who's browsing YouTube videos

398
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:08,819
or maybe who's hunting for a new job.

399
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:10,110
Because Hey, it happens.

400
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,779
People leave good companies and,

401
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:12,839
that's the fact of life.

402
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,930
You shouldn't be punished or,

403
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,118
put through the ringer
because you're doing that.

404
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:19,829
What becomes interesting is,

405
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:21,508
if you are looking for a new job

406
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:22,850
and then you're also collecting data,

407
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,170
and then you're also
exfiltrating that data.

408
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,219
That then becomes something that, Hey,

409
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,589
warrant's a second look, not
just specific activities.

410
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:33,100
We want to see patterns of risky behavior.

411
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,069
And so, we can take steps to
address the risky behavior,

412
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:42,128
not just a one risky thing that we saw.

413
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:44,939
- How early do you think
that alerting should be?

414
00:15:44,939 --> 00:15:47,149
'Cause I know for some companies
that's like by the time

415
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:50,160
the data has been ex field.

416
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,860
It is so expensive to drop a lawsuit,

417
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,560
it's almost better to just let it go.

418
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,560
- Yes.

419
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,160
And that's where working with
your business partner comes in

420
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,269
understanding that line from legal,

421
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:02,540
because I can't set that line,

422
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,240
legal in HR and your privacy

423
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,709
teams need to say that, Hey,
here's where your boundary is.

424
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:09,388
if a user crosses this,

425
00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:10,389
this is what we're gonna do.

426
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:13,050
So, having those conversations
before something happens

427
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:16,368
with your legal and your
privacy and your HR teams

428
00:16:16,369 --> 00:16:17,529
to understand that.

429
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:20,009
Say, okay, well, what if
somebody does ex filtrate data?

430
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:22,240
What do we wanna do if
they're still an employed?

431
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,019
What are our remediation efforts?

432
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:26,100
So, we don't have to go to that lawsuit,

433
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,720
is there something that we can do where we

434
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,980
just send them maybe a, a
firmly written letter to say,

435
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,970
"Hey, we saw this happen."

436
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,519
Here's the steps to remediate
this that are acceptable

437
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,949
and, let your legal team
use the tools available

438
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:40,649
to them to solve the problem.

439
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:42,610
It's, I can't solve that problem,

440
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,779
and I think on the security side,

441
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:46,089
we can't solve those problems.

442
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,949
Let's let our business partners
solve them where they can

443
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:54,929
solve those problems. And
let's give them the tools,

444
00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:57,679
you want to let you wanna
solve it before they take that

445
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,709
data to a competitor.

446
00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:02,829
And then now that competitor
has the tools that they need to

447
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,699
be more competitive or
go to market quicker,

448
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:08,930
getting involved and finding those,

449
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,039
we need the help from the business.

450
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,819
- You know, that makes sense.

451
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,649
'Cause I think that there is a
lot of times we keep thinking

452
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,569
like, oh! you just need to
be at Jack of all trades.

453
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:16,569
- Yes.

454
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,708
- But that really means you
really are a master of none.

455
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:19,709
Exactly.

456
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:21,970
- And like, especially
with ethical decisions,

457
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:26,700
I feel like that in and of
itself is like its own specialty.

458
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,700
- It is.

459
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,330
And I think that's important
with the insider threat

460
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,710
program. if I'm building a program,

461
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,620
I shouldn't be the person
making those ethical decisions,

462
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,620
because what am I gonna do?

463
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,540
I'm gonna make decisions in
favor of myself and my program.

464
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,260
So, you need to partner
with your privacy team,

465
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,470
your HR team and your legal
team and say that Hey,

466
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,690
these are the things we want to do.

467
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,830
What do you want to allow us to do?

468
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,250
How do we build those
controls in place to say, Hey,

469
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,190
we're gonna build a, a fair program.

470
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,420
That's gonna treat people
with respect and dignity.

471
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,070
We're not gonna be big brother.

472
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,350
This is the threshold.

473
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,360
This is how we measure that threshold.

474
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,750
And this is how we have
confidence in that threshold that

475
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,790
when it is crossed that it is action.

476
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,300
I think with employee monitoring,

477
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,180
you can make one mistake,
after that your program's done,

478
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,180
- Yeah.

479
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,430
- you lose the trust and the
confidence in the business.

480
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,530
And so, it's important
as practitioners that,

481
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,149
we draw very clear lines and
we set very high standards.

482
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,150
- And transparency. Right?

483
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,150
- Exactly.

484
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,750
- Like I feel like when
you find out something

485
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,762
and it's after the fact, it just,

486
00:18:24,762 --> 00:18:26,620
it doesn't matter how
great the intent was.

487
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,620
- No.

488
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,139
- like the way it was initially presented,

489
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,140
like first impressions.

490
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,140
- Yes.

491
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,140
- Right?

492
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,140
- Yeah.

493
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,140
- Once, once you lose
trust, you've lost trust.

494
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,840
And then your program is
supposed to be bringing these,

495
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,280
violations of trust.

496
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,990
And if you violate that trust
from a program that's supposed

497
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,160
to be kind of the most trusted program,

498
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,410
you have nothing to stand on.

499
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,410
You're done.

500
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:50,040
And I've seen it where programs
get shut down because they

501
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,460
make these well meaning missteps
and they cross the line and

502
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,460
that's it.

503
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,460
- Yeah.

504
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,080
I worked previously for a
company where they were like,

505
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,560
it's one thing to be secure.

506
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,690
Like the company can probably take a hit,

507
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:02,790
but our brand cannot.

508
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,909
- No. It can't.

509
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,420
- And it's interesting to differentiate

510
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,640
the difference between, how
do you defend a company versus

511
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,640
defending a brand.

512
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
- Yes.

513
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
- And it's a very different perspective.

514
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,640
- Yes.

515
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
And I think one of the
things that is missed

516
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,630
on the insider threat program is,

517
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,900
you're not only protecting
the company and the brand,

518
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,550
you need to protect the company's culture.

519
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,020
So, that's a big thing.

520
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,460
If we're operating counter
to the company's culture

521
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,950
that does not do us any good because

522
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,540
we're contributing to threats.

523
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,440
If people feel like
they are uncomfortable,

524
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,140
that they're a target,

525
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,240
that they're not free to operate and work

526
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,530
and use their computer to

527
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:39,670
print zoo tickets for
their family day off.

528
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,050
They're not gonna do their
best work and we don't want to

529
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,280
build a program That's gonna do that,

530
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,280
because I've done that.

531
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,629
I've used my computer to buy tickets

532
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,370
or do this or that because it's convenient

533
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,510
and it's right there.

534
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,879
And I would hate for somebody
to feel like they can't do

535
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,570
these basic things because
they're being watched.

536
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:56,919
I think that's a sign.

537
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,650
If you were to pull your
employees and understand how do

538
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:02,310
they feel doing some
of these basic things,

539
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,929
do they feel comfortable or not?

540
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,130
That's gonna give you a
really good indication

541
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,610
of what employees think
your program's doing

542
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,040
or trying to do.

543
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,040
- That is really insightful.

544
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,409
And I really appreciate you
reiterating the culture and kind

545
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,090
of giving us some more clarification
on like what those fine

546
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,290
lines would be.

547
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,409
Then also like how to go
forward with that intent.

548
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,410
- Yes.

549
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,590
- So, I really, really appreciate that.

550
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,590
- Thank you.

551
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,590

556
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,890
- Yeah. Awesome.

00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,890

00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:31,890

00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:32,890

561
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,870

I feel like I should,

568
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,970
like Saturday night live at
like hashtag ATT&CKcon and then

569
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,610
have a meme on whether
it's, how you use ATT&CK,

570
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,100
whether it's your impressions of ATT&CK,

571
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,310
but let's see what you get.

572
