1
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,860
- So our next speaker is gonna
be Matt Snyder from VMware.

2
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,380
So going from sort of interesting

3
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,660
and different responses
that people can take

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,680
to ATT&CK techniques,

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,600
we have another theme today

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,340
of interesting use cases, which
we're always intrigued by.

7
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,400
So ATT&CK's focused on the behaviors

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,900
of external threat actors,

9
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,760
but our next speaker is putting it to use

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,390
in the important space of insider threat.

11
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,230
Please welcome the ATT&CKcon
stage, Matt Snyder.

12
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,199
(audience clapping)

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,160
- Thank you everyone.

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,510
I'm really excited to be here

15
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,108
and discuss this really important topic.

16
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:51,879
So over the last few
days and even into today,

17
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:54,870
you know, we've heard a lot
about external adversaries,

18
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,519
and what they're doing
and how we can use ATT&CK

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,769
to defend against them.

20
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:02,429
And I'm here to talk about
one of the biggest adversary

21
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,640
in everybody's environment,
and that's our insider threat.

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,790
So this talk's broken into three sections

23
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,110
and we're gonna build upon
each section as we go through.

24
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,110
There's a lot of slides.

25
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,570
I'm gonna fly through some of 'em,

26
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,610
just so we fit our time formatting

27
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,390
and I'm happy to make these
slides available after the talk.

28
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,780
So the first thing, like I said,

29
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,340
everybody has an insider threat problem.

30
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,900
It doesn't matter what industry you're in

31
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,590
and it doesn't matter what
size your organization is.

32
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,050
And that threat over the last few years

33
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,429
has really grown significantly.

34
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,980
Here I'm showing two reports.

35
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,460
One from Code 42 and one from Hitachi ID.

36
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,910
That's really showing how
this threat has evolved.

37
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,490
Since the beginning of COVID,

38
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,270
we've seen this big shift
in employee's attitude

39
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,920
towards their body of work.

40
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,210
They now believe that
this work belongs to them,

41
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,770
not the company that they work with.

42
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,320
And when they leave that organization,

43
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,250
they feel comfortable taking
that information with them.

44
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,130
And we're in the middle
of the great resignation.

45
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,699
So as you can see from this other metrics

46
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,700
that over half of companies,

47
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,660
we need to build a program

48
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,470
that's gonna rely on
more technical abilities

49
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,599
that we develop ourself.

50
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,359
But sometimes we struggle
with getting started

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,680
and it looks a little bit like this.

52
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,780
You know, we're looking for that any key

53
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,110
to get our foot in the door
so we can start doing this.

54
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,170
And then what ends up happening?

55
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,809
You know, we don't have that framework.

56
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,750
We don't get started,
you know, time flies,

57
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,060
and we end up being rolled
onto different initiatives.

58
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,390
And before, you know, we know
it, nothing was ever done

59
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,910
and the program's left
where it continued to be.

60
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,650
But what if we took
something like MITRE ATT&CK

61
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,730
and we map that to our insider threats.

62
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,340
'Cause when we look at
the insider threat cases,

63
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,340
they're not that different

64
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,150
from the things that we're seeing here.

65
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,780
They operate in similar
ways as an adversary,

66
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,210
because what is an adversary trying to do?

67
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,010
They're trying to look like an employee

68
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,220
so they can carry out their ATT&CK longer.

69
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,100
So instead of building our
own insider threat program

70
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,380
that's completely devoid of
anything that already exists.

71
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,930
You know, we've treated it like
this own individual problem

72
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,720
that needed its own solution.

73
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,540
We needed its own tools.

74
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,690
We had to treat this
completely differently.

75
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,880
And then we've kind of
come to the realization,

76
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,049
at many organizations is,

77
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,930
this is just too complicated
of a problem to solve,

78
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,850
so nothing ever gets done with it.

79
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,980
But what if we looked at it like this.

80
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,739
Here we have an insider
that's more focused

81
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,420
on exfil trading data.

82
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,260
So some of the threat
profiles that this might,

83
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,500
you know, hit against are
like the oblivious user,

84
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,990
more importantly, the
negative or the negligent

85
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,500
and the data hoarder.

86
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,209
These people know what they're doing.

87
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:45,540
They're after this information.

88
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,970
And these are the people
that are gonna try to take it

89
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:47,970
when they leave.

90
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,550
And when we zoom in, 'cause
I know that's hard to read,

91
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,310
now we can see that the insider,

92
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,650
because they already likely
have access to all of this data

93
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,150
they're not that concerned

94
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,260
with initial access and persistence.

95
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,609
They're really just after
the data and exfiltrating it.

96
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,870
And these techniques are rudimentary.

97
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:10,040
It's right click, copy, paste.

98
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,380
You're downloading things
from some internal repository

99
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,980
that's easy to get to,

100
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,430
and you're copying it
to an external drive.

101
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,500
Most organizations allow a hard drive

102
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,910
to be connected to a device.

103
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,600
They allow things like
external file shares

104
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,669
and things like that.

105
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:28,530
Even if it's against
policy, it can still happen.

106
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,248
So we don't have to have
these really advanced users

107
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:36,840
taking advantage of some
really easy-to-use techniques.

108
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,969
Getting into the rogue employee.

109
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,879
This one's where it
gets really interesting.

110
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,210
This is the one that kind
of mimics an adversary.

111
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,508
You know, they're out to
create chaos, inflict damage,

112
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:48,229
maybe they have a score to settle.

113
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:49,279
And because they're an insider,

114
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,870
they have got this tremendous access

115
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,949
to your organization to
carry out any type of attack

116
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:56,439
that they might want to.

117
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:58,129
And when we zoom in,

118
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:00,580
what I think is really important
about this threat profile

119
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,308
is persistence and defense evasion.

120
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:08,120
With this malicious insider,
you can look for them

121
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,249
to find ways to stay in the environment.

122
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:12,559
Expecting that their attack

123
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:14,699
is eventually going to be discovered,

124
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:18,499
what can they do to get back
in to prolong the attack?

125
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:19,499
What are the things that they can do

126
00:05:19,499 --> 00:05:21,099
to avoid being discovered?

127
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:23,839
You know, are they trying to
disable things like antivirus?

128
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,360
Are they messing with fogs?

129
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,419
You know, if this is a domain admin

130
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:30,419
and they have the ability
to shut down some tools,

131
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,139
you know, are they trying to do that?

132
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:36,250
So that's really important
that if you suspect,

133
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,759
you know, an employee of being rogue,

134
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,029
you need to find persistence

135
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:43,599
and you need to make sure
that you close those doors

136
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:48,099
before you take action
against that employee.

137
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:50,080
Now this kind of brings the last example,

138
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,990
is this accident or was this intentional?

139
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:56,909
This is what I really love
about the insider threat,

140
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:58,900
because you're gonna
have one of two outcomes

141
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,120
when you talk to that user.

142
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,090
And I'll zoom in a little bit more.

143
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,138
They're either gonna say,
"Oops, that was an accident.

144
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,409
"I didn't mean to do that."

145
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:07,529
Or they're gonna pretend
that it wasn't them,

146
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:08,529
that they didn't do it.

147
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:11,319
It doesn't matter what evidence
that you bring against them.

148
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,409
You know, you could have video evidence

149
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:14,058
and you can have your forensic evidence

150
00:06:14,059 --> 00:06:15,900
and then you could have anything else.

151
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,248
You know, you could have a statement

152
00:06:17,249 --> 00:06:18,969
from their mom that said they were there

153
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:21,529
and they watched this
employee do this activity,

154
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:23,539
and they're gonna still deny it.

155
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:26,628
So I think what's important
for us as investigators

156
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:30,300
is being able to use a tool
like the MITRE ATT&CK framework

157
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,650
to understand all the possibilities.

158
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,628
So when we do these investigations,

159
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:36,849
and sure enough, when you
get that user that says,

160
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:37,849
"I didn't do it."

161
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:40,210
And you need to go back
with your legal department

162
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,619
and HR department and say,

163
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:43,650
"Okay, well, they said they didn't do it."

164
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,179
They're not gonna take my word for it.

165
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,639
They're not gonna just accept that.

166
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,939
"Hey, security said they did that."

167
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:50,539
I think that would be a great addition

168
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:54,490
to either the detection or maybe the car.

169
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,849
And MITRE just security said so.

170
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:59,310
And that way we can take a
shortcut on some of these

171
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,550
because it happens on, you
know, Friday afternoon,

172
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,099
we need that, you know,
that MITRE car to say,

173
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:06,180
"Hey, yeah, this is an
official investigative

174
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,869
"because we said so."

175
00:07:07,869 --> 00:07:09,439
So put that in the chat.

176
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,319
Maybe we can get that
happening here at ATT&CKcon.

177
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,569
But what I've found was valuable

178
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:17,070
is I can go back and meet
with these business partners

179
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,119
and say, "Hey, these are
the things that I've done."

180
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:20,939
You know, they said they didn't do it.

181
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:23,840
So let's look at it from
an adversary perspective.

182
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,900
We don't see anything from initial access.

183
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,099
That all looks good.

184
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:28,199
Everything looks in line.

185
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,940
We see no indicators there.

186
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,409
We don't see any indications

187
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,860
that something malicious is being executed

188
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,119
that would give a third party

189
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:38,379
a foothold to carry it out this attack.

190
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:39,939
We don't see any lateral movement.

191
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:41,349
So they're not coming from anywhere else

192
00:07:41,349 --> 00:07:42,740
within the environment.

193
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,719
We don't see any other signs

194
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:47,379
that would support the claim
that they didn't do it.

195
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:50,680
What we do show is all of these techniques

196
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,270
that indicate that they did it.

197
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,330
We see that some of this activity,

198
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:58,159
maybe it's aligning with
work that they already do.

199
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:00,889
It aligns with the user's
technical capabilities.

200
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:03,639
Maybe it even aligns with
some of the information

201
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,219
that we're finding
throughout our investigation,

202
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:07,469
and these logs that were
collected that supports,

203
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:09,849
that says, "Hey, this person did it."

204
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:13,020
So now that we've
identified these key TTPs,

205
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,080
we need to build intelligent detections.

206
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,150
And I know that everybody here

207
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,349
that's ever built a detection

208
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:19,319
has done the home or dance of victory

209
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,580
when we think that we've
built the perfect detection,

210
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:24,770
and in the background,
the sock is on fire.

211
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,878
So we can't do that.

212
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,729
And Haley talked about this yesterday,

213
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:30,740
but risk-based alerting is the answer.

214
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,669
And this is an example of
what it kind of looks like

215
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:35,079
when we're mapping it to
the insider threat problem.

216
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,320
We've got our user base,

217
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,159
we've got all of our
tools and all of our logs,

218
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,588
and then we're doing
data analysis on this.

219
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:45,959
And here you can see we're
looking for key techniques.

220
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,670
This is gonna help us understand

221
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,209
the risky behavior that's taking place.

222
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:51,779
Then we're gonna do our risk analysis

223
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,829
where we can score these events.

224
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:55,969
And then we can also add in risk modifiers

225
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,300
because maybe this user is on a watch list

226
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,199
because they're on some performance plan

227
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:02,469
or maybe they're about
to leave the company

228
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,250
and that's the prime time for them

229
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,230
to finally act on something.

230
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,839
Same thing with the rogue employee.

231
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:12,050
We've got all of our logs,

232
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,310
we're applying our risk
analysis on top of this,

233
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,790
and we can see the pattern
of behavior that allows us

234
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:23,000
to see a full, clear
picture on what's going on,

235
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,560
that, hey, yeah, this aligns

236
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,300
with what that person's saying.

237
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,189
We see the clear signs
of the phishing emails.

238
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,259
You know, this is a phishing
campaign and we see it

239
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:33,459
that's pretty widespread
that could, you know,

240
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:36,219
indicate that there's some
truth to that statement.

241
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,510
And then we can understand
some things like,

242
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,220
hey, is this a repeat offender?

243
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,370
Or is this somebody
that should know better?

244
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,790
And they're continuing to act

245
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,719
in these really risky types of endeavors,

246
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,230
and we need to take firmer action on that.

247
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,480
And then lastly, you can
have a really simple rule

248
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,649
that's just looking for
tactics and techniques.

249
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:55,820
And if it crosses at a certain threshold,

250
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,360
then you can take action against that.

251
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,920
And that brings me to trying
to starting to wrap things up,

252
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,870
is if you're not testing your detections,

253
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,649
you have no idea if
they're actually working.

254
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:07,230
So here's a basic Python script

255
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,670
that'll help you generate
a bunch of dummy files.

256
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,099
And in line six through nine,

257
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,040
you can add in some customization

258
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,769
to generate the types of files

259
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:16,610
and the naming conventions that you want

260
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:18,690
so you can run this through some testing.

261
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,790
Last thing.

262
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,000
If you've done everything
that I've talked about,

263
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,230
this answer should be really clear.

264
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,459
If you get into the situations

265
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,128
where at the end of the your investigation

266
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:31,350
you're not quite clear,
remember your Occam's razor.

267
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,839
The most likely explanation is going to be

268
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:38,120
what's most likely happening.

269
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,560
Here's some pointers on what
Meyer may not be happening.

270
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,869
And then wrapping it up.

271
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,279
You know, prioritize and execute.

272
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,279
There's a lot of tactics

273
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:48,370
and a lot of techniques
that you need to cover.

274
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,140
Start with the ones that
are most important to you.

275
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,230
Look at your previous
cases, map those to there

276
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,470
so you can start to pay down

277
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,000
some of that technical debt
in your investigations,

278
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,440
and then you can grow your program

279
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,120
with the time that you're saving there.

280
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,279
You've gotta work with your business.

281
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,089
You need to understand
what's important to them

282
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:05,110
because you can't bring
cases that don't matter.

283
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,740
And then the last thing is
follow the ATT&CK pattern.

284
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,829
These are proven techniques
of risky behavior.

285
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:12,469
When we start to align to
that, it gives us two things.

286
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,779
It gives us greater confidence
in our investigations

287
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:16,040
that we're finding everything.

288
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,860
And it's allowing us to save time

289
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,209
because we can front
load these investigations

290
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:22,268
by finding these things in our logs

291
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:26,269
and being proactive versus being reactive.

292
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:29,250
With that, here's some additional
resources and some links.

293
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,529
That brings us to the end.

294
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:31,529
Thank you everyone.

295
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:32,529
(audience clapping)

296
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:33,529
- Thank you so much.

297
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:42,410
And I think this is a topic
that resonates with all of us.

298
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,449
Exactly as you said,
whether it's an accident,

299
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,110
or intentional, or rogue employee,

300
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,829
it really is something
that we have to really bake

301
00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:49,849
into our own threat models.

302
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,170
And I love what you said in
terms of a lot of the practices

303
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,670
and a lot of the operations

304
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,040
and processes we already have apply.

305
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,640
You just have to think about the problem

306
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,640
a little differently.

307
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,640
- Exactly.

308
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
- Yeah.

309
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
Thank you so much.

310
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
- Yeah, thank you.

311
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,640
I'm happy to be here.

312
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
Thanks everyone.

313
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:04,641
