so

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,720
uh so i'm a a devops engineer and just a

32
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,640
little bit about me um i've been at

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,439
mitre for about 12 years now and i've

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,240
had the pleasure of um being able to

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,000
uh work on a lot of great with a lot of

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,280
great people a lot of great teams i have

37
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,600
some background in android forensics

38
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,479
where i

39
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,840
had

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,640
created some tools to assist with the

41
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,200
automated detection of potentially

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,960
unwanted applications

43
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,119
um and it was uh during that time that i

44
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,040
fell in love with automating everything

45
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,200
i fell in love with python i fell in

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,799
love with uh creating code that was not

47
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,840
just

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,680
code that could work on my computer but

49
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,240
my colleague's computer and then as we

50
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,240
transitioned that project to other

51
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,920
people both internal and external to

52
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,920
that team

53
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,960
specifically packaging up

54
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,240
tools for other people to use

55
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,440
anyway so i've been with the uh attack

56
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,878
team for

57
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,520
uh several uh about six months now and

58
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,560
uh i get to manage um both what you see

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,280
here um uh on these bullet points from

60
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,360
uh things from the website to attack

61
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
navigator uh the workbench we're gonna

62
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,440
be going over some updates on on these

63
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,840
things here uh in in my discussion uh

64
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,959
today

65
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,920
so let's go ahead and uh dive in now for

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,840
the website actually for a few of these

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,599
things you've already

68
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,040
been briefed by you know previous

69
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,360
members of the team so one of the

70
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,000
specific updates is that the ics uh the

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,879
industrial industrial control systems

72
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,480
attack matrix

73
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,720
currently sits on a media wiki instance

74
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,560
um out there and it is no longer going

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,840
to be a separate uh um uh tooling but

76
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,080
will be uh incorporated uh into

77
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,280
attack.miter.org uh a little hard to see

78
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,840
there but it's just um you know the

79
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,640
styling of the of the website um uh

80
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,640
today so really looking forward to being

81
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,599
able to

82
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,519
uh for those of you in that space to be

83
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,120
able to uh you know pivot around the

84
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,920
website and just you know be uh in one

85
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,680
space instead of having to bounce around

86
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,920
to multiple areas

87
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,800
um

88
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,239
after that um

89
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,480
you can also see uh once again from

90
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,799
lex's talk uh yesterday

91
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,959
we're adding the detection

92
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,599
specific pages to the website so that

93
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,959
you'd be able to

94
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,840
same idea as ics it's just in one space

95
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,519
uh be able to um

96
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,920
go and you know for any given object

97
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,840
whether it's a technique a group

98
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,959
whatever

99
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,159
be able to

100
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,440
see um

101
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,400
see more

102
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,920
information on the website um that way

103
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,840
and that's coming in april for both of

104
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,640
the

105
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,159
ics and

106
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,599
um

107
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,640
uh

108
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,400
the the thing i just said yes the

109
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,239
detections that's what it was uh all

110
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,480
right as opposed to campaigns here uh

111
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,519
which uh is is coming soon uh still just

112
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,000
trying to breeze to this uh as matt

113
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,159
malone already mentioned there's gonna

114
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,239
be a lot of community engagement as to

115
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,798
specifically how we collect the data on

116
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,839
our team but then also on the website we

117
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,120
don't have you know final you know

118
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,120
screenshots yet of of what it will look

119
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,160
like but that's in the october release

120
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,199
v12

121
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,840
of uh of attack so really looking

122
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,240
forward to that one um

123
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,560
let's see moving on to the next slide

124
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,120
here so this one is my absolute favorite

125
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,960
and i think it might be some of your

126
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,199
favorites as well um

127
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,680

128
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,919
um

129
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,400
so i

130
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,120
yeah just just wait for it like you know

131
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,199
i have an animation no wait maybe i do

132
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,080
maybe i don't you'll find out later um

133
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,800
so

134
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,759
the the the website it's uh it's it's

135
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,199
what we know and love to be able to

136
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,120
access all the information uh about

137
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,680
attack uh however uh while we can search

138
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,880
there's you know

139
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,560
let's go if there's issues with that and

140
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,479
it's a high priority this year i don't

141
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,320
have a date on that but we are

142
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,160
prioritizing it on my team so that it

143
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,560
will be able to um

144
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,360
uh

145
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,440
we'll just go with be more usable uh

146
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,520
soon this year

147
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,400
all right um moving on from the website

148
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,160
uh some other updates that are more

149
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,639
recent so the attack navigator um a few

150
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,080
people had mentioned attack navigator

151
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,160
and we've seen screenshots and and from

152
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,120
the layers

153
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,680
layer files there uh just uh a one quick

154
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,479
snapshot um uh when you when you're

155
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,520
working with the attack navigator

156
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,919
there's a bunch of tools um

157
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,560
one of one of which you can export has

158
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,919
json uh to work with or export as excel

159
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,320
um for those of you you're continuing to

160
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,120
to do

161
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,960
the work that you need in excel we also

162
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,280
have svg export and if you can see the

163
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,360
font sizes are just kind of wonky when

164
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,440
you use that and if you haven't used svg

165
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,440
export in the last few months because

166
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,560
you remember this uh in january uh

167
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,600
thanks to lily wong she uh

168
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,080
created a pull request on github uh to

169
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,120
at least minimally make it look a little

170
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,680
better right we so while we this is not

171
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,880
the end state we still want to work on

172
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,280
attack navigator this year

173
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,120
to be able to

174
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,600
export in various formats not just svg

175
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,199
but also with the express plan to

176
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,520
not require third-party browser

177
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,000
extensions to make good screenshots of

178
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,720
the attack matrix um

179
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,479
so that's a that's a goal of ours this

180
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,680
year but this svg export uh was uh

181
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,639
already released in january of this year

182
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,800
um another addition uh from uh since in

183
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,400
the last several months uh is the

184
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,800
ability to add custom links and just to

185
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
walk through what that means uh if you

186
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,360
were to open up the navigator and uh you

187
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,280
know click on a technique such as audio

188
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,960
capture you can click on this button

189
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,680
right here to add your own custom links

190
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,360
and just to you know zoom in a little

191
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,400
bit uh there it's fairly simple all

192
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,680
right you just you know give it what

193
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,520
it's just a url what do you want to call

194
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,880
it where does it go that's it and you

195
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,960
can add several of those and then when

196
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,840
you export those uh navigator layers to

197
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,840
share with your colleagues um however

198
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,680
you want to do that or yourself or later

199
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,360
of course then you can come back and see

200
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,400
that there is uh it's you know there's a

201
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,240
blue underline under audio capture if

202
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,240
you uh uh can't see that but if you

203
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,319
right-click on it then it shows up at

204
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,720
the bottom of the the context menu so a

205
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,880
little update that has been requested

206
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,080
multiple times and then you can just

207
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,479
kind of see oh this is

208
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,479
extra context that someone added to this

209
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,080
layer so you could click that's just the

210
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,800
url that's all it is so you can make use

211
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,400
of that

212
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,440
um

213
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,680
uh so that's navigator um actually

214
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,520
before i uh dive into the workbench

215
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,560
stuff i was talking to several of you um

216
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,840
just you know between yesterday and

217
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,080
today about some other anticipated uh

218
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,879
updates for navigator so um what i

219
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,120
really want to say about that is if you

220
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,680
have ideas for navigator and this is

221
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,120
going to be a theme for any of the

222
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,960
things that i mentioned here today if

223
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,680
you if you're able to go on github and

224
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,919
find the repository uh we have issue

225
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,199
trackers for all of our projects and um

226
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,639
if you want to go straight to poll

227
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,479
requests that would be awesome but if

228
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:25,919
you even just want to have discussion

229
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,919
right feel free to open issues as

230
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,160
feature requests or bugs um so that we

231
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,958
can uh have a conversation about how to

232
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,519
improve um uh or

233
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,440
or fix things that are fix things that

234
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,559
are actually incorrect or broken um

235
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,080
moving on to the workbench so i wanted

236
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,560
to uh give a shout out to uh ivan

237
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,279
ninachuk uh from his talk yesterday uh

238
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,120
as uh he's the first person i've met in

239
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,360
real life uh who's actually using

240
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,519
workbench i know some several uh people

241
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,600
do but he's uh that was

242
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,920
a a really great plug so if for those of

243
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,560
you not familiar with what attack attack

244
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,720
workbench is um

245
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,040
it's a web application that is open

246
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,680
source that's on github um and you can

247
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,760
uh stand up your own instance of it and

248
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,839
then you can import collections of um

249
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,279
of attack uh in sticks format so you

250
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,360
don't have to understand stixx format it

251
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,560
will do it for you um and then uh it's

252
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,240
actually the tool that we are using uh

253
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,320
starting to use internally ourselves uh

254
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
it's it's been around for about a year

255
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,440
publicly i think now um but it's how we

256
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,560
edit the the content of um

257
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,440
of

258
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,519
of attack um and

259
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,560
uh

260
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,399
there's oh i'm not really gonna go

261
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,920
through this whole road map here right

262
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,440
now it's just we have constant

263
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,920
improvements that we need for ourselves

264
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,600
and that other people will also be able

265
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,920
to make use of

266
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,760
and one of the things i mentioned

267
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,000
yesterday is that it has a rest api that

268
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,680
is just um in my opinion fairly

269
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,920
easier to work with than

270
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,959
um

271
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,880
manually working with stakes we'll go

272
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,640
with that um

273
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,800
and then speaking of sticks you can't

274
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,160
talk about sticks without talking about

275
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,000
taxi of course right

276
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,120
standardization joke no okay um

277
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,640
so taxi uh so we uh

278
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,560
some of you may know not all of you know

279
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,360
we uh host a publicly available uh taxi

280
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,959
2.0 server at cti taxi.minor.org

281
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,560
no need to pull that up in a browser

282
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,160
because it is not interesting in the

283
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,120
browser um however it it is already

284
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,040
available it's public the documentation

285
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,200
for it is available on github and i'm

286
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,279
not going to say it's buried but it is

287
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,279
in that file right there um and uh

288
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,279
so it is available

289
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,680
six 2.0 uh only

290
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,560
and uh the reason i kind of wanted to uh

291
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,399
bring that up is because uh

292
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,880
on the heel of the version 11 release in

293
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,839
april um and coming in may uh we plan on

294
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,200
standing up on a public 2.1 server

295
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,720
for all intents and purposes maybe that

296
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,920
doesn't mean anything to you

297
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,640
specifically however it does have

298
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,279
a couple of things that i feel are worth

299
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,600
mentioning one is the specific

300
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,839
integration with workbench if you have a

301
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,079
workbench instance set up if not that's

302
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,680
fine don't have to worry about that it

303
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,920
does have a rest api compliant a rest

304
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,320
api that is open api compliant with

305
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,360
dynamic documentation so while going to

306
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,279
the website today

307
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,480
might not get you a whole lot of

308
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,640
information uh in the in the future

309
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,240
there would be dynamic documentation

310
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,120
that is available for you to make use of

311
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,360
uh and it will be supporting sticks 2.0

312
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,519
and 2.1 for um

313
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,279
all the attack content

314
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,120
um uh

315
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,880
zooming through here so we've got

316
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,880
another thing that

317
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,399
once again some of you know some of you

318
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,480
don't we have a python library that you

319
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,120
can pip install uh kind of maybe hard to

320
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,720
read on that but they've installed miter

321
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,959
attack python and

322
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,000
um

323
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,959
just uh three top level three top level

324
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,279
things that it does for you is it works

325
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,680
with sticks once again so you don't have

326
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,440
to um and it's sort of a grab bag

327
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,600
of functionality it's just a tool that

328
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,480
we use ourselves that we feel might be

329
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,560
useful for others so it can convert

330
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,880
sticks to excel or collections for use

331
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,360
with the workbench um

332
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,040
and you know a few other things really

333
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,120
the the point i want to make on this

334
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
here though is for the future of mitre

335
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,959
attack python i want to work with the

336
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,720
community to find out what it is that

337
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,440
you want in there one of the things that

338
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,680
we feel might be useful is to add

339
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,920
convenience methods to connect to the

340
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,760
public taxi server

341
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,079
things of that nature there's also

342
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,600
another github repository we're going to

343
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,000
try to merge in with

344
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,680
but yeah that's another resource that

345
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,000
you have available to you

346
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,560
and really lastly to wrap this up

347
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,639
there's a lot of stuff that's open

348
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,959
