1
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,160
- So first off, this metaverse thing,

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,789
if I say the word three times,

3
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:19,021
I will probably vomit in my mouth,

4
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:22,270
so, I'm not gonna wander on that

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,899
but my idea for this talk
was to actually focus

6
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:28,720
a bit on the things that we all deal with,

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,668
struggles we deal with,

8
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:34,129
but also some of the things
we don't talk about often,

9
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:35,829
we talk about really
constructive things today,

10
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:40,149
but also maybe some of the
things that aren't going as well.

11
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:44,910
And that's something I'd
like to touch on today.

12
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,078
And obviously I'm not gonna
talk about a certain company

13
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,379
rebranding itself, but I do
have some philosophical thoughts

14
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,440
about if we should consider ATT&CK

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,050
as sort of like a metaverse.

16
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,489
'Cause I think that, a lot
of the things we're doing,

17
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:01,608
we're actually doing that within ATT&CK

18
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:06,979
and within all the new
matrixes, for example.

19
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:08,520
But there's also a lot of lessons in there

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,130
and today I'd like to
share some of the lessons

21
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,440
I add at least on my side for
mostly on what I like to call

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,440
scenario-based defense.

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,600
And that is also
something I'm a big fan of

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,729
next to being a Lego Aficionado,

25
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,360
I'm also a big fan of
actually working like,

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,790
what is the bigger picture?

27
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,070
What is the red line we're
seeing across campaigns,

28
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,460
across actors, et cetera?

29
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,960
And I try to figure that out,

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,570
make it actionable for companies,

31
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,029
have them test it and work through that

32
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,430
and I actually build programs for example,

33
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,070
threat intelligence programs which then

34
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,250
actually work with that and test that

35
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,330
and really qualify that threat angle,

36
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,140
'cause I don't think
that's happening often.

37
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,880
I'm not a Call of Duty 1v1 knifing expert,

38
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,830
but I do enjoy gaming and
you can also hit me up

39
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:03,929
if you wanna do some cool
painting and stuff like that.

40
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,800
And first how I'd like to
shape this conversation

41
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,230
is just addressing the evolution part

42
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,280
with some of the things we all
actually we probably all know

43
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,830
then I'd like to go into
the nuance discussion

44
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,170
of who's adopting ATT&CK, but also then,

45
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:27,030
who has adopted ATT&CK and
then actually started using it.

46
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,569
And let's get immediately
down to business.

47
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:36,069
So, for those of you
aren't familiar with ATT&CK

48
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:38,958
and have seen it for the first time,

49
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,019
one thing I always get is,
what the heck is this thing?

50
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:43,629
It is completely terrifying me

51
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:46,439
and I get this question actually often

52
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:49,379
more than I'd like to, it's
because of the complexity.,

53
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,879
it's because of the amount
of techniques in it,

54
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,649
and if you're like me and
you've been around doing this

55
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,010
for quite a while, I've
been working with ATT&CK

56
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,798
since 2017, to be precise,

57
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:05,390
and I actually saw it grow
from that little, you know,

58
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,488
amount of techniques or
at least a little overview

59
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:13,469
it was at the time, to something
which it is now, you know,

60
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:16,750
188 techniques, many supporting
tools, many matrixes.

61
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,090
You know, if I have this conversation

62
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,400
with a lot of people are pretty scared

63
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,790
and even though we have, I
sometimes make fun with Adam

64
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,798
and ask him like, do you have a new flag?

65
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:29,099
Because the flags keep getting bigger,

66
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,119
now they actually getting smaller, huh,

67
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,419
so that's good, but
people, I'm not gonna lie,

68
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:37,760
this is what they tell me at least.

69
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,480
So I'm also curious how that
discussion will, you know,

70
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,429
evolve over the next three years

71
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,370
if people will have more opinions on that.

72
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,010
And another thing that I find sometimes

73
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,909
getting a bit of less attention

74
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:55,578
is the amount of frameworks
we currently see matrix

75
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:56,709
is we're currently seeing.

76
00:03:56,709 --> 00:03:58,459
I get that we need to expand

77
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:03,489
and I think that's really good,

78
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:07,120
but I also think that it's
sometimes confusing for some

79
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,659
that they don't really understand
what is in what component,

80
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:12,078
what is in what matrix.

81
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:15,799
And one of the issues you
have with these matrix is

82
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:18,540
is that you also have the
issue of compartmentalization.

83
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,738
So what that means is, for example,

84
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:22,330
you can have similar techniques,

85
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,680
but the procedures differ
completely within ICS

86
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,150
and from Cloud.

87
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,969
And that is something
that all of us might get

88
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,390
but when we have to explain
that to other people,

89
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,500
people are like, yeah, but
it's the same technique

90
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,870
how does it work then?

91
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,270
So that is sometimes an issue.

92
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,780
And obviously still a
shout out to PRE-ATT&CK,

93
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,369
I do love it indeed,
it's too bad it's gone

94
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,620
but actually the
replacement is pretty good.

95
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,130
So this is also one of the things

96
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,850
that terrifies the people I work with.

97
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:56,920
And now the third element
in terms of evolution,

98
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,100
and then I'll probably
close the evolution bit

99
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,330
is the way we tell stories with ATT&CK.

100
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:05,310
You know, naturally it is
a good means to do that,

101
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,100
you can actually simply grab the matrix,

102
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,430
grab a framer or grab, grab, fill it in,

103
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,100
and then you have a good story to tell,

104
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,340
but to actually tell that story

105
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,500
that requires a lot of
technical understanding.

106
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,780
And sometimes people
underestimate that, you know,

107
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,219
people underestimate the
fact that we all can explain

108
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,530
real the technical
procedures, but, you know,

109
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,840
we forget that we have
to rule that narrative up

110
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,710
to people that don't really get it.

111
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:36,270
And another, yeah, two other components

112
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,859
which I personally think
are also some fallacies

113
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,600
in terms of how people use it

114
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,330
is that the assumption that it's complete,

115
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,370
that is a finite thingy.

116
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,220
And people ask me like,
hey, why isn't this?

117
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,480
You know, it's like, yeah,
because it isn't complete,

118
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,180
you can actually evolve this, right?

119
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,940
And that is actually, this
is sometimes giving me

120
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,300
a really hard time when
I'm helping clients

121
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,060
with this kind of work and
I really think that this,

122
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,060
especially the assumption,

123
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,470
that's something we all
need to manage on that.

124
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,400
And finally, when I tell
a story about ATT&CK,

125
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,979
it's also good that I
can grab all the stuff,

126
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,570
the team from Adam worked
on and put in the matrix,

127
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,370
but there's also a lot of
people also take these contents

128
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,970
at phase value, right?

129
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,250
I'm sure all of you have seen the example

130
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:29,990
where you would have a certain
individual enthusiastic

131
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,400
dive into the matrix
and then grab, you know,

132
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,940
select five actors or anything
and then work with that.

133
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,020
But then again, it could be

134
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,729
that these are outdated results, right?

135
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,110
It could be that these
were from three years ago

136
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,440
where your team might be focusing

137
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,540
perhaps on things that are,
I don't know, three days ago.

138
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,120
Let's say a certain invasion happens

139
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,450
and you want to know a
latest on a certain group,

140
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,610
you know, where do you grab that from?

141
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,950
And is that the latest?

142
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,960
Something to think about
but this is also something

143
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,169
I'm sometimes having limitations with.

144
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,700
So not get into evolution part anymore,

145
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,210
now I'm focusing on adoption

146
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,810
and I would like to make a big nuance

147
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,450
between adoption and usage.

148
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,680
And why is that?

149
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,710
Because I see sometimes
people adopting the framework,

150
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,560
but then actually starting
using it actively,

151
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,770
I consider that a different thing.

152
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,799
And now, the elephant in the room

153
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,710
who is actually using ATT&CK?

154
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,580
And when I was making the slide,

155
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:35,000
I thought this was controversial

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,270
because we all think if we
trust all the research papers,

157
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,330
then we all think
everybody's using it, right?

158
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,330
Everybody's probably using it.

159
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,729
I mean, I open up a research paper

160
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,780
and then you find that 80-100%
of the people are using it.

161
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,500
But I tend to think
that that is incorrect.

162
00:07:52,500 --> 00:08:00,130
I tend to think that we perceive
that adoption too greatly

163
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,360
and I think that that leads
to certain assumptions.

164
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,690
For example, people
tailoring marketing materials

165
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,040
just to fit ATT&CK.

166
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,110
And I think there, you know,

167
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,600
there's a difference between obviously

168
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,730
the enterprise size companies

169
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,590
and also the small medium-sized companies

170
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,060
and I do think that, you know,

171
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,610
all enterprise-sized
companies adopted ATT&CK,

172
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,870
I do also think that the enterprise

173
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,870
below the large companies,
they also have adopted ATT&CK

174
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,510
but that's where you
see the nuance happening

175
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:34,169
between full adoption and nuanced usage.

176
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:39,829
And we aren't discussing
this enough, in my opinion.

177
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,820
And another thing I was thinking

178
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:47,140
when I was building this
story is also like, you know,

179
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,930
who is actually adopting this is?

180
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,390
Are there any differences?

181
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,530
My experience and actually there is not.

182
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,110
I tend to think that the private sector,

183
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,340
but also the public sector,

184
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:02,090
they both adopt it in an efficient way.

185
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,140
And what I tend to see is that this also

186
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,510
has to do with the consulting companies

187
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,180
that they have with that.

188
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,459
So for example, if you
have a consultancy company,

189
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,300
then, fair chance that that company

190
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,199
has mapped everything to ATT&CK, right?

191
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,120
So you can't really do
anything without, you know,

192
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,040
falling over ATT&CK, so
that's pretty good I think,

193
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,839
and I didn't really see any differences

194
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,580
in the company size, for example, as well.

195
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,650
So, then again, you know, bottom line,

196
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:35,740
I don't see any differences, I
think adoption is everywhere.

197
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,540
And one of the limitations obviously

198
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,490
is ATT&CK is a operationally driven,

199
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,940
tactically driven concept, right?

200
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,400
But at the moment we all
start to explore, you know,

201
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,890
new applications beyond that,

202
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,310
we struggle, and obviously
there are, you know,

203
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,130
people that have found new ways
to rethink risk management,

204
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,390
found new ways how to tell a good story,

205
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,710
but this is also leading
to some, you know,

206
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,870
some biases on simple things like,

207
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:09,300
people wanting to simplify
stuff, for example.

208
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,219
And what that means is for me,

209
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,390
that's a trigger when people,

210
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:15,620
they can't really work
with the level of detail

211
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,210
and then they resort to obviously

212
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,710
like we are all humans, right?

213
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,490
So we all simplify that is all what we do,

214
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,270
but what I tend to see is
that if we have a bunch of,

215
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,860
and I think the previous speaker
has also alluded to that,

216
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,001
it's a lot of details and
we have to visualize it

217
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:30,250
in a good way to understand it

218
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:33,050
and I think this is a problem.

219
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,609
Not everyone can work with that,

220
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,610
so we have to roll that up

221
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,920
or work with that anywhere we can.

222
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,569
And the framework also allows us to do

223
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,360
very granular risk management
and one thing I do find

224
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,950
and I think the granularity
is for me personally,

225
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,310
is really awesome because
I can, when I help clients

226
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:53,170
and I investigate, I perform assessments

227
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,610
to understand what their
threat landscape is

228
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,090
and who is operating in that,

229
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,940
and then allow that granularity allows me

230
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,370
to help them prioritize and I think

231
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,400
that is the most important thing,

232
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,290
prioritize what kinda
basics you need to do

233
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,040
versus what kind of detailed nuance stuff

234
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,150
you need to focus on.

235
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,240
And that is also, I
think for most companies,

236
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,030
the main driver of using
ATT&CK, where do you start?

237
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,650
What is the one thing you should do?

238
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,850
And I'd like to also make
the analogy of the kill chain

239
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,420
where I personally think
that the kill chain

240
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,550
is a sequential concept

241
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:32,240
and ATT&CK is maybe a
quantum thing, right?

242
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,810
You can have things simultaneously
but also sequentially,

243
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,150
but the thing, what
I'd really like is that

244
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,550
it allows you to look
left and it look right

245
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,630
and work with that.

246
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,520
But that prioritization, then
you can have a discussion

247
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,970
within your company to actually see

248
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,940
where do we wanna focus on or not.

249
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,330
One way to use that is
obviously the navigator, right?

250
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,660
The navigator we talked about this,

251
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,660
and I think somebody will, excuse me,

252
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,310
will talk about that soon as well,

253
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,349
I think that still is a
pretty useful concept,

254
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,490
I think it's a bit, yeah,
rigid if you ask me,

255
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,670
but I still enjoy the applications of it.

256
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,120
And I really enjoy the fact that people

257
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,860
start to move away from
bingo cards to, you know,

258
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,350
nuanced feed maps, I think that
was a win when we got that,

259
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,180
but it also created another discussion

260
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,630
and what actually I like to
call the scoping discussion.

261
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,830
And I still find a lot of companies

262
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,660
just selecting everything and then,

263
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,850
you know, grabbing what is trending,

264
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,420
what is red or whatever
at that point in time.

265
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:42,140
I think the scoping discussion
is always very important

266
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,640
personally, because that allows
you to focus, to prioritize,

267
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,120
we don't have all the
time in the world, right?

268
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,470
We just have to focus on the
main things that are happening.

269
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,060
And that's why I think
the scoping discussion

270
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,439
is also very important, what
you select in the framework

271
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,350
and how you then use that.

272
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,600
And there's also a little thing
that is sometimes forgotten

273
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,500
is the way you can tell other
types of stories, right?

274
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,589
So there's a lot of techniques in there

275
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:08,810
which you can actually tie
to a different data set.

276
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,060
So for example, I'm gonna
shamelessly plug it,

277
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,439
sorry for that, two years ago,
I tried to tag, for example,

278
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,661
the techniques associated
with how much effort it is

279
00:13:17,661 --> 00:13:19,589
for a threat actor to perform that.

280
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:21,600
And I worked with my
colleagues at the time on that

281
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,611
to actually evaluate that.

282
00:13:22,611 --> 00:13:25,750
That created a pretty cool
data set for me to work with.

283
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,720
And I mean, this is just one example.

284
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,110
I mean, there are plenty of other examples

285
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:36,580
and that allows us to figure
out new ways to prioritize.

286
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,149
And now, usage.

287
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:41,180
So again, adoption, yeah,
people have adopted it,

288
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,839
we have it in our network, et cetera,

289
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,810
we are using it, no, you have adopted it

290
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,550
and now you start using it

291
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,020
and then you get into these
interesting discussions.

292
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,970
And so, for example, what
I'm seeing on screen now

293
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,959
is two questions I get asked often

294
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,550
and they actually more or
less are the same questions

295
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:03,540
and they basically show
the difference between

296
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,060
teams new with ATT&CK and teams

297
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,400
that are actually
seasoned in using ATT&CK.

298
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,589
So this for me is like a
little gradient to see, okay,

299
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:14,580
so this is where they
are, okay, okay, okay.

300
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,340
But one thing I want to
highlight here is that

301
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,650
both are fine, both are important,

302
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,370
and I'd like to just emphasize that,

303
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,810
but the thing I'm trying
to highlight here is that

304
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,280
using ATT&CK is something
that might appear easy,

305
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,750
but it's pretty hard to
actually start using it.

306
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,310
Huh, you get into nuances instantly,

307
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,660
you focus on a certain technique, okay,

308
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,209
that technique has 20 procedures
to actually execute that.

309
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:41,709
Do you want to focus on that?

310
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,320
And then some people are like,

311
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,740
ah, you completely lost me here.

312
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:46,810
So that's what I'm seeing often

313
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,810
and I think this is something

314
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:51,489
I really need to set the stage on

315
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,830
and this is also important for my work

316
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,720
when I'm doing this so-called
scenario-based defense,

317
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,910
where I actually create those scenarios

318
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:03,640
and then starting to use that
ATT&CK method in this concept.

319
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,480
And with that, let's instead
of just diving in immediately

320
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,120
into the details, I'd like
to start with another thing

321
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,660
as well and that is
that ATT&CK is not sexy.

322
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,959
I'm gonna highlight it instantly,

323
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:21,489
I do think that if people, I
know alluded to this before,

324
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,120
the first thing people
look at is that matrix

325
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,870
and they're like, holy cow, what is this?

326
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,180
And I think, we have
to do some love making

327
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,020
to actually make it work a bit
better for everyone, right?

328
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,300
And I can imagine people
who have spent some time

329
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,839
in making it, you know,
readable for people

330
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,160
or explain it to somebody
else outside of this room,

331
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,550
for example, it has been a bit difficult,

332
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:46,899
but I'd like to emphasize that
first impressions do matter

333
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:50,710
and if people, I'm not
sure about all of you,

334
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:54,670
but if I meet some of executives
that basically give me

335
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,349
that they just don't care
about the ATT&CK matrix,

336
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,839
they just wanna, you know,
see what is the conclusion

337
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,870
coming out of that and first impressions

338
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,009
on that matter, right?

339
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:07,860
And that's also where
you see creative ways,

340
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,300
luckily for us creative ways

341
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,579
to actually report this coverage

342
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,650
and I think the previous
speakers also showed that,

343
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,980
that you could use different ways

344
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,250
to actually visualize that
and I think the TRX team

345
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,220
also showed some ways with the video.

346
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,089
And I like that a lot and
in every threat landscape

347
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:26,790
I produce, I really try to
steer away from the bingo card

348
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,930
and I encourage every one
of you to do that as well,

349
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,459
because I'm not saying we
have to make ATT&CK sexy,

350
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,280
but we do have to figure out ways,

351
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,890
new creative ways to
at least make it stick,

352
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:42,550
that's it, put like that.

353
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:46,180
And another problem or
limitation I tend to see

354
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:50,469
is people focusing on
they've adopted ATT&CK

355
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,010
and then they started using it

356
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:55,100
and then they think, oh
crap, this isn't working,

357
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,810
this is too complex.

358
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,459
You might have seen that.

359
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,300
And what then happens is
that people try to combine

360
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,890
techniques for example.

361
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,270
And that really scares me if that happens,

362
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,829
because if that happens, that means

363
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:10,519
that we have custom
techniques, custom everything

364
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:13,099
that costs me additional time to prep,

365
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,539
it costs me additional time
to actually make mappings

366
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:17,520
if I'm responsible for that.

367
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,139
But I have a lot of issues
with local customizations,

368
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,520
obviously because of the
standardization bit, right?

369
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,660
I think when I was starting
to bleak late last night,

370
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,900
I think one of the ideas on
initially getting to ATT&CK was

371
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,520
the whole standardization part.

372
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,700
So why do that?

373
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,040
So always be on the lookout
for if people try to customize

374
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,200
this, because for me it's a clear red flag

375
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,930
and maintaining that central
data model or metaverse,

376
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,780
if you will, I think that is key

377
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,560
for all of us to stay using that.

378
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,100
And also the relationship
to different matrixes,

379
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,770
but also the relationships to
different other frameworks,

380
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,820
it could be the kill chain,
it could also be something new

381
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,850
that comes up in two years, I don't know.

382
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,620
Well, what I do think is that
we need to standardize more

383
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,979
to keep it relevant.

384
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,010
And you might think, is
this really a discussion?

385
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:22,330
You wouldn't believe the many
times I had this discussion.

386
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:25,649
And another one, one of those discussions

387
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,570
is the TTP discussion.

388
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:32,389
So, obviously when we in
the cybersecurity community

389
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,830
love to borrow stuff from the military

390
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:39,370
and police, et cetera
and obviously we also do

391
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:42,000
a pretty poor job in
adopting these phrases

392
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
and I think people from that
background can relate to that

393
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,260
and one of those things,
also the TTP discussion.

394
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,550
And I personally think for
me, it's really important

395
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,240
because it provides me the granularity

396
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,150
to go from a procedure level notation

397
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:58,110
and then move upwards
into what does that mean?

398
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:01,229
But it's also a problem,

399
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,400
people tend to stay high level, right?

400
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,660
Because if they don't
understand the technical jargon,

401
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,990
then they just start to simplify stuff.

402
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:15,610
And even though with the
introduction of sub techniques

403
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,850
and the introduction of,
not the introduction,

404
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,010
but the use of procedures, you know,

405
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,710
we've been at this detailing
bit for quite a while,

406
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,610
but I'd like to at least
give some attention

407
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,649
to the fact that we don't have any issues

408
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,840
making it more complex, we have issues

409
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,850
making it more simpler, right?

410
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,809
And that leads to, you know,
some of the thought biases,

411
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:37,620
you know, is this complete?

412
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,840
Is this fresh?

413
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,889
Do we have any problems with that?

414
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,740
What do we think on that?

415
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,950
And obviously I'd like to also reference

416
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,930
finally on the process,
the procedure side,

417
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,210
I think that's the most important

418
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,000
because that's where the nuance happens.

419
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,080
If you have like, you know,
14 ways to do PowerShell,

420
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,840
you know, when do you have
certain completion on that?

421
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,970
When does that happen?

422
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,760
What I'm trying to say
with this is nuance matters

423
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,929
and with everyone you're speaking with

424
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:12,830
nuance you put in that
conversation, it's so crucial,

425
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,960
especially in this TTP discussion.

426
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:22,110
And now I'm gonna do a bit
of how I usually go through

427
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,830
the whole scenario-based defense

428
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,620
and the first step I usually
bring all these limitations

429
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,560
together is the hypotheses part.

430
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,110
And this is basically just
brainstorming with a team I help

431
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,479
and then work on that to
actually figure out, okay,

432
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,930
so how do we proceed on that?

433
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:40,490
And ATT&CK obviously allows
me to prioritize greatly

434
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,760
because I can simply say, okay,

435
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,740
during this vertical and Sarah,

436
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,030
but there's two main limitations
I've found over the years,

437
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:51,000
and then one is that context
is not usually understood.

438
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,450
And what I mean by that is that sometimes

439
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,000
we see people working in certain contexts

440
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,250
that aren't, as I would say, effective.

441
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,250
So for example, they would
execute certain scenarios

442
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,250
if they don't have any data
sources in that environment.

443
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,080
And that is pretty dumb if you ask me,

444
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,760
but then again, you know,
that's what's happening

445
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,030
all the time, people wanting to test stuff

446
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:17,030
but it's not really in
that, you know, data space.

447
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:21,200
And related to that is that
you sometimes see more benefit

448
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,280
if you have a certain, for example,

449
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,470
if you have an R&D environment,
or an insider component,

450
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,570
then you sometimes want to focus more

451
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,510
on the behavioral aspect of things.

452
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:34,850
So I tend to spend also
some thoughts on that aspect

453
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,129
and figure out that because
that gives me more insight

454
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,130
into context and some
more places of attention

455
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,600
where we should address the data sources.

456
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,480
And finally, one final
lesson I have on that

457
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,580
is when I create these
hypothesis, is this a lab thing?

458
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,470
Or is this a thing we
actually do in the real world?

459
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,570
And I think Selena in the
beginning alluded to this,

460
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,960
you know, why focus on these APT actors

461
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,870
if there's like thousands
of ransomware actors

462
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:03,059
coming after you which are
more likely to do that.

463
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:05,690
And you can have a discussion
on priority on that.

464
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:09,090
I think that is one and the second is also

465
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,560
what are some of the lab techniques,

466
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,809
some of the really sophisticated
stuff we're seeing,

467
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:14,180
and that's also, by the
way, some of the things

468
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,770
I would love to hear the
the MITRE team talk about

469
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,200
some of the abstract
techniques they get reported,

470
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,679
but that's a different story.

471
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:24,830
If you have an hypothesis,
then you build scenarios

472
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:28,540
and how I actually always
try to emphasize it is

473
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,720
make a decision first if
you want to use ATT&CK

474
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,250
as your metaverse.

475
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,250
And what I mean by that
is that it will dictate

476
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,309
how you report everything
afterwards, right?

477
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:43,370
This could be simply talking
about results of a report

478
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,620
or anything, or a pen test,

479
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,590
or a red team operation or whatever,

480
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,620
or just simply the purple team,

481
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:52,969
but making sure that
there's common ground,

482
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,080
that you focus on ATT&CK,
I think that is key

483
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,580
and that discussion is
sometimes not held explicitly.

484
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,760
Obviously, when you get that
done, you can think about,

485
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,860
do we involve certain groups?

486
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,090
Or on that angle and I'd like to call that

487
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,919
the adversary playbook in which you say,

488
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,330
this is a certain group
that has certain techniques,

489
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,918
and we combine that into a playbook.

490
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,570
And I find that really useful

491
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,450
because that also allows
me to have a discussion

492
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,429
on what kind of sequencing we should use.

493
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:21,780
And what I mean by sequencing
is the order of events.

494
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:26,700
And obviously I think the trx
team also mentioned is that

495
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,230
the sequencing is super important

496
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,110
because some of these
sequences of activities,

497
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:34,070
you know, they can happen
in 10 seconds and that is,

498
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:37,379
yeah, I think that is also a
really underestimated aspect.

499
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,140
If you put it in a list,
if you put it in a tag

500
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,770
in a just a dropdown, whatever,

501
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,790
and you don't get that nuance.

502
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:48,809
And I think also one of the
other speakers alluded to that

503
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:51,690
if you see certain activities
happening in context,

504
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:54,240
that also gives you some
opportunities to actually monitor

505
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,160
on that as well.

506
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,330
So I think that that element is important

507
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,500
and that leads me to the other point

508
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,900
is the time stamping thing

509
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,679
and I'm really adamant on that.

510
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,890
I also think we always
have to emphasize that,

511
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,270
and this is not happening
enough in my opinion,

512
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,720
the time stamping bit,
because that also dictates

513
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,940
what kind of time cost rates do we have?

514
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,970
Do we have people focusing
30-minute reconnaissance

515
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:19,350
or 32nd reconnaissance?

516
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:23,049
And that are nuances
which I think are really,

517
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:25,290
really interesting to see that happening.

518
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,350
And that also leads you
to think about, okay,

519
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:32,730
so what is the freshness
of a certain scenario?

520
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,380
And then you actually validate them

521
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,530
and you can either validate
them manually or automatically,

522
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,668
and manually is obviously
the whole red team,

523
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:42,559
penetration testing expertise

524
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,750
and there you can have a discussion

525
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,400
on what is the value of each of these.

526
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,600
One thing I tend to find
limiting in some cases

527
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,610
is the discussion when
we do manual testing,

528
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,040
is if we should test a
certain technique or not,

529
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,470
it's the simulation or
ambulation discussion?

530
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:00,350
I'm not gonna start to brawl
to actually encourage this,

531
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,159
but this is a real problem sometimes

532
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,640
and I do see that some
of the people emphasize

533
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,590
that you've paid for a red
team, so we are gonna find ways

534
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,590
around it.

535
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,720
Yeah, but did we have
explicit conversations

536
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,940
with the client to actually figure out?

537
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,020
Or did they just wanna test
that specific technique

538
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,590
if that works?

539
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:23,820
And I think that is a
limiting factor if some.

540
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,620
On the automatic side, I could talk about

541
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:29,030
all the practical uses of that,
but I do want to emphasize

542
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,080
what I don't think is
working well, you know,

543
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,080
this relies on the whole
procedural operation.

544
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,340
And this, you know, then you
have to know all the procedures

545
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,270
and that sometimes when you
have automated everything,

546
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,690
you know, then, and what's next?

547
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:46,280
And that creativity bit
that is sometimes limiting

548
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,280
for some of the teams I work with.

549
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,030
And finally, the reporting bit.

550
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:52,240
The reporting bit is
also how you tie back in

551
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,030
all the things, if you use
ATT&CK as your metaverse.

552
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:02,740
And so, I might have
alluded to a few things

553
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,990
I don't think are working
as well as I hope,

554
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:09,860
but I do want to emphasize
the following, and that is,

555
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:12,750
I personally think that
ATT&CK is one of the greatest

556
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,650
cybersecurity achievements
of the last decade

557
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,710
and I can say that with a straight face

558
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,919
because every day I'm using it,

559
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:21,380
I can actually relate to everything I knew

560
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,280
and I there have a team behind it,

561
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,350
which actually listens
and works on, you know,

562
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,360
providing feedback, et cetera
and I really enjoy that.

563
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,110
And I think that is so awesome

564
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:33,459
and I think that is also
a testament why they keep

565
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,230
the things we see today, we
have this big crowd online

566
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:41,490
and physical, I think that is awesome

567
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,540
and one thing I do like to see more

568
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,850
is people who are emphasizing the things

569
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:50,830
that don't work well, maybe
like this conversation,

570
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:54,049
but maybe even more blunt, if you will

571
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:55,179
and if you would ask me afterwards,

572
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:57,520
you know, what are the
couple things that I think

573
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,700
we should be focusing on,

574
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,720
or at least some points of attention?

575
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,670
I think, if I would put
it on the people process

576
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,679
technology angle, I think first of all,

577
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,270
we need to expand the knowledge
of the adopting community.

578
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,990
And especially the people
just starting with ATT&CK,

579
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,049
there are more people
just starting with ATT&CK

580
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:16,049
than we all think.

581
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:18,370
You know, everyone in this
room might be biased and think,

582
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,699
you know, everybody uses this.

583
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,330
Well, it's not the case,
you know, on a daily basis,

584
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:23,870
I still have conversations with people

585
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,020
who never heard of it and
who've been in the industry

586
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,020
for more than a decade, right?

587
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,080
And that is fine, but
that is also something

588
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,100
we need to focus on.

589
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,520
And I think also the
sharing feedback aspect

590
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,270
is completely unevaluated

591
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:41,600
and what I mean by that
is that it's very easy

592
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,178
to send a tweet to think about, you know,

593
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:46,789
why is this a SharePoint technique?

594
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:47,789
Why isn't this in ATT&CK?

595
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:50,210
And then send tweets, and I'm like, yeah,

596
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,350
but actually that was the reason

597
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:55,610
why I've held this talk just
because somebody did that.

598
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,178
But the reason why I'm saying is,

599
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,800
is that it's super easy with this team

600
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,210
to actually just, you know,
there's an email address,

601
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,049
there's a community, there's
Twitter, there's everything,

602
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,460
you know, why not use that?

603
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,460
So I encourage every one of you online

604
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,230
and in this room to actually do that

605
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,730
and just help, you know,
and maybe they should

606
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,470
do something cool like
I contributed to ATT&CK

607
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,809
and have a t-shirt, I dunno, but the point

608
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:21,039
I'm tryna make is sharing feedback.

609
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,520
And finally, we should also
challenge the vendor ecosystem

610
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,370
because I also think that sometimes

611
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,280
the vendor ecosystem isn't emphasizing

612
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,350
that procedural discussion enough.

613
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:35,219
So, everyone challenge
our vendors accordingly.

614
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:40,610
I already mentioned to
that feedback is key,

615
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:44,659
don't complain, just, you
know, send the feedback,

616
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,480
the community decides where
this framework is going,

617
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,970
I think they won't explicitly
say it, I hope they will,

618
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:53,230
but I think it's
underestimated people think,

619
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,250
hey, that's MITRE, it's funny,

620
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,280
people also refer to ATT&CK as MITRE,

621
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,570
MITRE is just a huge company

622
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:04,240
and ATT&CK is just one component.

623
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,730
but that is my key message here

624
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:09,270
and if you go back to
the office on Thursday

625
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:12,850
and think, you know, what
is the true level adoption

626
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,949
you have?

627
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:18,100
That is my challenge to all
of you and also, you know,

628
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,500
how are we telling the right nuance story

629
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,960
from procedure to base, to boardroom?

630
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,870
And with that, I will leave you to it.

631
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:31,830
(audience clapping)

632
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:36,010
- Wow, and great parting
words, I'll leave you to it,

633
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,590
I love it, thank you, my
friend, that was amazing

634
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:41,168
and honestly, I will explicitly say

635
00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:42,940
this ATT&CK is our framework.

636
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,870
Exactly as you highlighted,
it's not something,

637
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:47,540
you know, if we could tell
you the best way to do cyber,

638
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,629
we would would, ATT&CK grows
and is built by the community.

639
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:54,010
So, exactly, as you said,
not just that, the feedback,

640
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,700
you know, the adoption,
that was really powerful,

641
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,140
so thank you so much.

642
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,140
- Good stuff.

643
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:04,500
- I don't think we have
time for questions, but--

644
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,480
- Sounds good.
