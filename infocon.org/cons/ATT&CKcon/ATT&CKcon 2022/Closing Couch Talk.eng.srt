1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,160
hey i'm catself back with the attack on

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,440
couch

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,080
and we have ivan and andy here with us

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,320
today so we kind of are wrapping up the

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,880
day it's gonna be the last three talks

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,320
um so we're not gonna keep you too long

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,760
because i know you guys are like

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,519
literally these conversations and then

9
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,000
there right like it's like security

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,279
conference that's when the real work's

11
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,440
done right of course actually it's funny

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,320
that you say that because we were

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,440
talking i was talking with some other

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,440
speakers and we were all talking about

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,440
how we come here and we do these

16
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,440
presentations but the real work is like

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,120
these side conversations where we're

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,440
just connecting with each other exactly

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,280
right like oh you have this dude like i

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,960
am dealing with that same issue and like

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,879
you're an expert in this space

22
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,440
so um during your talk which i love the

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,680
orchestra like that was a fantastic

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,680
analogy i really want to hear even more

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,760
about that but you also mentioned a task

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,399
force so what tell us more about that

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,199
task force yes um

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,320
basically

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,640
like i said when i got to simplify last

30
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,240
april i saw a need to start exploring

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,680
how to really utilize attack in soar

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,400
and that's where me and andy met because

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,560
he did a webinar on attack and i was

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,240
like wait a minute someone did a webinar

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,600
i need to meet him and become his best

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,200
friend

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,720
and then i gathered a small group of

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,240
individuals and and we went to

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,720
leadership and they said yeah go for it

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,799
you know you can you can use work time

41
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,640
and and you know be able to do it as a

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,159
main project

43
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,280
and it you know they no promises on

44
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,920
product timelines or anything but they

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,320
did say that you know go for it you know

46
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,119
see see how far you can take it

47
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,079
and so

48
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,840
um i i put together a team of ses ps

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,360
engineers developers and we were able to

50
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,040
start you know working out what would be

51
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,520
some integrations with attack that would

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,399
really

53
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,320
use automation to a level where it

54
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,479
hasn't been and that's where we got the

55
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,000
idea of you know secondary

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,639
investigations um using the data

57
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,758
components

58
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,480
hopefully one day participating in the

59
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,160
attack sightings

60
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,800
and using more the ctid tools i'm just

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,360
blown away by how many tools there are

62
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,520
like workbench i just learned about the

63
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,959
attack flow where you're going to have

64
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,040
change of attacks so that definitely

65
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,280
plays into um you know what andy was

66
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,440
talking about about you know looking at

67
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,760
the groupings of them and so we're

68
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,599
really excited you know to be working

69
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,040
with all that and the fact that there's

70
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,800
all these wonderful apis for us to play

71
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
with andy did you want to say anything

72
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,560
about your experience

73
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,840
yeah i mean the only thing to add really

74
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,840
is um i feel like we're always uh 10

75
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,599
steps behind these guys because when we

76
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,519
started to put mitre into the into the

77
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,480
kind of like the front end the

78
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,000
experience think oh i really need

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,519
something to do oh yeah that's right

80
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,440
might have kind of already got that done

81
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,720
oh i need to build it in like the

82
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,239
navigator oh no hang on they've

83
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,239
literally built navigator okay we need a

84
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,599
way to predict oh no they've already

85
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,680
done kind of sighting so i feel like

86
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,200
these guys are so many steps ahead that

87
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,560
we you know when we're trying to deploy

88
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,840
and implement it in the in solution to

89
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,599
make it look pretty you're like yeah i

90
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,800
think we're always one step behind these

91
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
guys just too good

92
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,440
that's so kind and it does not feel like

93
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,400
reality at all but it's so kind because

94
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,480
i can tell you on this end like we'll

95
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,640
talk to so many subject matter experts

96
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,840
and it's like

97
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,519

you know these wonderful side

114
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,680
conversations that we talk about one

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,640
been really exciting that we've got this

121
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,319
in person again because it's a lot

122
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,159
easier to have those conversations in

123
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,120
person

124
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,519
and i you know for anybody who's never

125
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,160
come to an attack con come to 4.0

126
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,399
because it rocks it's literally the

127
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,160
happiest place on earth

128
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,479
and so yeah come to attack con that's

129
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,680
all i can say

130
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,919
i love it you are so wonderful thank you

131
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,360
so much thank you

132
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,040
i really alright so i will say this last

133
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,120
conversation like last question so like

134
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,800
what drove this whole orc like i think

135
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,560
you all hit to it in your presentation

136
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,320
like what drove this whole orchestration

137
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,440
like that visual that actually came from

138
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,280
a teaching um tool a presentation i made

139
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,360
um and that presentation was called the

140
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,840
so what of attack

141
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,919
because we we got that question a lot

142
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,919
from different people that didn't have

143
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,080
you know the sec ops and cti backgrounds

144
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,800
you know what what is attack um i had

145
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,560
developers tell me oh i know how to

146
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,000
program everything with it i know the

147
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,840
json sticks but i don't know what it

148
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,800
does

149
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,919
and so i needed a simple way of telling

150
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,199
them how it affected my life in security

151
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,600
what it gives me the value

152
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,039
and for me it gave me a way to visualize

153
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,199
it and for me it's music

154
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,360
um you know like i said i literally my

155
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,479
phishing

156
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,400
data is the pianos the edrs the violins

157
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,080
and then i start hearing the drums which

158
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,680
is the network data

159
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,680
and that's it gives me

160
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,039
that power to understand what's going on

161
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,960
and and once i can do that then we can

162
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,400
start sorting it out we can start

163
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,560
figuring out what's important what's not

164
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,320
and that's that's a power that attack

165
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,840
gives us it's a language you know i

166
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,759
brought up the rosetta stone you know

167
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,000
it's a language that connects so many

168
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,160
different levels of data and viewpoints

169
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,639
and biases it's just mind-blowing what

170
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,560
it does and the only way i can describe

171
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,759
it is music

172
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,840
i love the fact that you bring such a

173
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,680
diverse background and like other

174
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,400
passions into it i'm a history major i

175
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
love that because like that's it takes

176
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,919
all of it right like not everyone

177
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,560
understands it in the same exact way so

178
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,759
and the fact that you both can

179
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,199
collaborate together and you have

180
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,800
different aspects and strengths to bring

181
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,160
to the tables really i always say he

182
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,240

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,639
um

193
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,840
so

194
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,600
this needs no introduction can i just

195
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,240
say i love your presentation style well

196
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,000
thank you it's all based on utah

197
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,520
was just watching and inspired by this

198
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,440
broadcast all day i was like how do i

199
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,440
bring that cat energy

200
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,199
it's an homage to you we actually redid

201
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,520
our slides 13 minutes beforehand but you

202
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,720
know

203
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,800
i believe it

204
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,840
i am the coolest cat i know

205
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,240
all right so how is it at the end of the

206
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,840
day like you've been able to see all

207
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,160
these different presentations and in

208
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,840
person conference you said this is the

209
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,280
first one you've been back at first of

210
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,080
all yeah i did cyber work on earlier and

211
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,680
then this is it so

212
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,599
only the best conferences get me out of

213
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,199
my house

214
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,520
obviously so what has been your favorite

215
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,360
talk out of the day

216
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,720
i

217
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,199
love history and i love threat

218
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,720
intelligence so i do think the keynote

219
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,560
for me was really something i enjoyed

220
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,000
quite a bit because i like being able to

221
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,759
pull lessons from the past

222
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,520
and pull to the future because not a lot

223
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,360
has actually changed so i think celia's

224
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,840
you know really resonated me especially

225
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,759
because it really set up well for our

226
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,440
talk which was kind of going through the

227
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
the tactical version of the strategic

228
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,440
problems she brought up so i liked it as

229
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,360
a one-two punch of just like she brought

230
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,520
up a lot of aspects of synthesizing

231
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,039
information and getting it through where

232
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,639
we were providing a tool to actually do

233
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,160
that for analysts who are trying to do

234
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,319
these tasks so i like that part quite a

235
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,120
bit and olaf's talk um

236
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,440
always a great person with great

237
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,599
information that i learned a lot from

238
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,440
yeah his talk is both of those talks

239
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,639
have been mentioned a couple of times

240
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,160
today and i agree and it's been

241
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,599
beautiful parallels throughout like the

242
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,080
storytelling has been interwoven through

243
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,759
multiple presentations

244
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,840
and then everything from what you all

245
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,599
have been releasing and then how

246
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,879
different presentations have stacked

247
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,639
have just been really beautiful no it's

248
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,919
a credit to the and i know i've said

249
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,440
this before but there's an art of doing

250
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,840
a conference where there's a i can't

251
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,759
believe i'm using this word but synergy

252
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,679
all the way through and that actually

253
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,679
happened today which was fun

254
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,279
no um so we're wrapping up the day um

255
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,599
everyone's kind of like had well try to

256
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,839
give everyone an opportunity to um kind

257
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,200
of share something like we have these

258
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
amazing viewers that have been on

259
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,760
all day streaming um is there anything

260
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,959
that you kind of want to tell them

261
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,560
whether like

262
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,920
but yet i'll give you a targeted

263
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,120
question so you actually have something

264
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,760
to answer how about that um what are one

265
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,200
of the obstacles that you see a lot of

266
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,360
people getting into this field

267
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,279
and how have you seen them overcome it

268
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,439
with grace

269
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,880
silence um the biggest thing i see

270
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,160
people getting into is this cyber

271
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,600
security or attack because we can go

272
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,200
either way here

273
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,600
you're that dealership no no no no see i

274
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,120
threw it back

275
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,519
uno reverse that

276
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,120
cyber security

277
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,560
for getting into cyber security the

278
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,240
single biggest thing that i've seen been

279
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,000
accelerated for people's careers is

280
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
networking um i think a lot of people

281
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,680
get into cyber security because they

282
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,080
like the tech and tech is a huge part of

283
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,360
it you have to have the chops but the

284
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,959
reality is the way people's careers

285
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,680
advance is through other people and

286
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,519
unless you have god-like abilities in

287
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,519
front of the keyboard which are very few

288
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,839
you have to be able to have the

289
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:47,200
personalities you have to be understand

290
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,680
who's there get new opportunities and

291
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,279
the way you do that is through exposure

292
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,839
or well places like this uh sands where

293
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,399
we met actually sans uh hunting summit

294
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,800
other places like that are great ways to

295
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,480
get more exposure to different people

296
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,079
and talk that opens up a lot of new

297
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,680
opportunities and i think that's the

298
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,279
biggest thing i see people have a

299
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,800
problem with who are new to cyber or

300
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,720
getting into this career field is they

301
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,800
feel pigeon holed they don't see how

302
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,120
many different areas there are from

303
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,040
extremely technical reverse malware

304
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,320
engineering to

305
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,560
very non-technical but just as valid and

306
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,800
just as useful on more of a

307
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
intelligent side or writing and i think

308
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,560
there's a lot of possibilities on either

309
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,560
side that people aren't aware of until

310
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,399
they see that and have representation

311
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,760
shown to them

312
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,920
i think that is a really really valid

313
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,560
point um i've heard like the terms like

314
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,320
oh well it's clicks and you know like

315
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,880
you're people and i actually called out

316
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,480
um i was talking to

317
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,640
one of the who's now a vp of cyber

318
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,640
security at target and i was like what

319
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,279
is it about these clicks like apparently

320
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,640
you have to be one of someone's people

321
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,399
and she was like okay let me break this

322
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,240
down for you um

323
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,399
when you say your people what you're

324
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,839
actually saying about you people yeah

325
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,519
like what do you mean by you people um

326
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,959
she was like

327
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,640
really what it is is as you go

328
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,959
throughout your career you find people

329
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,800
that have just proven themselves time

330
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,959
and time again that whether it's work

331
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,480
that they want to do or they don't want

332
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,399
to do they'll do and they'll do it well

333
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,079
absolutely and like that's a discipline

334
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,000
that i feel like we often glance over

335
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,839
right on like the being the god of the

336
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,959
keyboard

337
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,560
there's an aspect of there i think we

338
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,760
had a wonderful conversation with my

339
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,000
team last night and we were discussing

340
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,880
the problems of cyber and threats

341
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,160
which is predicated by there's a

342
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,680
wonderful gentleman scott roberts who

343
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,320
wonderful threat intel man and

344
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,399
he has this concept kind going over it's

345
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,000
extremely difficult for threat

346
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,079
intelligence to become larger because

347
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,320
the skill sets are so difficult and one

348
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,480
of my very unpopular opinions is threat

349
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,360
intel is dead and i say that because i

350
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,200
don't believe it's possible to scale up

351
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,120
the skills required as the industry is

352
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,120
today you're gonna have very large csps

353
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,040
with very mature threat intel shops

354
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,880
you're gonna have consumers of threat

355
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,720
data and you're gonna have creators of

356
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,880
threat intelligence and i think that is

357
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,480
going to be where we start having this

358
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,639
big divide so the question was well how

359
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,000
do people learn these things like you

360
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,360
can't go to school for this you can't go

361
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,880
to college for this like you can get a

362
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,639
cs degree with a security focus and

363
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,800
great you know how to code secure c but

364
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,480
what are you doing how does that help

365
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,760
you with anything we just talked about

366
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,000
today yeah and the big thing we came

367
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,200
through is the reality is this was an

368
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,959
apprenticeship program you like that is

369
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,480
how we've designed this and going back

370
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,920
to the history lessons that selena

371
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,680
talked about earlier today you find

372
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,880
yourself someone who's teaching like

373
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,639
okay you've proven yourself let me show

374
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,320
and there's been lots of great research

375
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,760
like anthropologists have embedded

376
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,480
themselves in socks and actually study

377
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,240
the way socks train each other and kind

378
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,839
of go through this and we're still not

379
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,320
getting great of getting out of that um

380
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,079
but i think there's still this concept i

381
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,680
you know you could argue as a debutant

382
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,079
ball where i'm sponsoring you and we're

383
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,399
i'm gonna walk you around and say

384
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,959
this is cat i vouch for her and they're

385
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,639
like oh okay i'll spend time with this

386
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,600
person because you said so and we're not

387
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,880
going to get much further until that

388
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,399
expands but i also haven't found a great

389
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,600
way around it

390
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,200
that's true honestly that's actually the

391
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,680
way i wound up getting a lot of exposure

392
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,519
was like like david bianco was amazing

393
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,760
and like he did a co-presentation with

394
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,279
me and that's right

395
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,120
you know and like a hundred percent it's

396
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,959
like allies in the field that like take

397
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,279
that risk to be able to like

398
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,279
i will stand by you and like help you

399
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,120
along this path because i know it's hard

400
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,320
to see something i'm passionate about

401
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,600
there's allies there's advocates and

402
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,959
there's mentorship and i think people

403
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,800
think the bar for mentorship is

404
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,480
extremely high but advocating is as

405
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,920
simple as making sure the door is open

406
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,680
for everyone to walk through and anyone

407
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,320
can do that oh my god i love that yes

408
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,519
100

409
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,079
ah okay that is so well said that i

410
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,360
don't even know if anything can actually

411
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,000
come after that so um

412
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,279
and i just

413
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,519
dropped mike

414
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,720
it's not gonna work i actually won't

415
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,920
keep talking to you about this but we

416
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,320
have the last speakers um that we need

417
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,560
to bring on and uh this is our service

418
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,800
for the audience so um but seriously

419
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,399
thank you so much for your presentation

420
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,399
the work that goes into it wonderful i

421
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,000
loved it so thanks everyone for watching

422
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,120
it was very fun you should have come it

423
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,079
was much better in person

424
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,800
but we're super glad that you were

425
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,120
online and that you're with us because

426
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,920
you all the best meme means you get the

427
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,040
attack flag

428
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,760
so

429
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,320
um definitely like do your research on

430
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,160
memes there was a great one from south

431
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,920
park earlier that i personally loved

432
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,160
because it definitely described getting

433
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,519
wider and not taller um so definitely

434
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,440
take a look at that one um be sure to

435
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,680
heart or retweet the ones that you guys

436
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,000
really like uh or just comment on them

437
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,360
so that way we can track which ones you

438
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,360
like so cause that's that's just as

439
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,079
important um so our last speakers of the

440
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,199
day that we're going to be able to

441
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,079
interview with um

442
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,120
ah i love i love things changing up last

443
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,560
minute it's awesome um

444
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,920
so i'm stephan chanette from attack iq

445
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,440
nice to meet you guys thank you it was a

446
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,040
pleasure to meet you i love the fact

447
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,079
that you all talked about jupiter

448
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,920
notebooks like thank you because that is

449
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,160
how i we did so when i was on target's

450
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,360
threat hunting team that was actually

451
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,199
something that we moved towards because

452
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,639
just like you said like it was so much

453
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,160
easier to use a jupiter notebook to kind

454
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,399
of do these live presentations and we

455
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,680
would do these hunts and when we were

456
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,519
doing this hunt kind of read out we

457
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,880
would actually have this jupiter

458
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,639
notebook that had all the data that we

459
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,800
had like painfully cleaned at this point

460
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,720
right and then we could just quickly

461
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,040
move through that data so i really

462
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,720
appreciated your walk through that so

463
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,279
thank you so much yeah we i mean i think

464
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,279
jose and i have used jupiter notebooks

465
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,600
so much and then we've helped you know

466
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,680
our customers and our users use jupyter

467
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,360
notebooks and at first it's just to sift

468
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,959
through the data and you kind of look

469
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,040
through it interacting with kind of a

470
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,240
workbook

471
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,040
but

472
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,560
as there got to be more and more data

473
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,440
and the audience was the executive or

474
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,959
someone on the tactical team it's like

475
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,320
this is a great opportunity to use it

476
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,199
for presentations and jupiter notebooks

477
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,959
allows for markdown language and so you

478
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,560
can really start to visualize and paint

479
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,480
a great picture get that emotional

480
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,959
reaction drive some some kind of you

481
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,880
know actionability but with the jupiter

482
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,040
notebook is that a powerpoint or like an

483
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,600
excel file you know something just more

484
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,800
interactive

485
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,399
so during your presentation you made

486
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,320
this comment that i was like huh i don't

487
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,920
know like i'm curious how you guys have

488
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,079
faced this like um i know for a lot of

489
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,639
the leadership meetings

490
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,800
normally there was always like we need

491
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,040
to know how to answer questions during

492
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,639
meetings right like if you don't have an

493
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,320
answer like if there's an anomaly and i

494
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,759
cannot speak to it that is not a good

495
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,000
thing right um but you all talked about

496
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,600
using like live data

497
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,279
like how would you address that with a

498
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,959
jupiter notebook if you're using live

499
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,320
data

500
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,839
i mean that's a good it's a good

501
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,000
question right because

502
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,519
well you know in i think in our

503
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,120
experience um

504
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
you know we've probably with a certain

505
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,279
customer had dozens of jupiter notebooks

506
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,959
maybe for a certain customer not

507
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,000
hundreds

508
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,759
um we've dealt with hundreds of jupiter

509
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,839
notebooks but within those notebooks

510
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,480
that customer has gone back to them on a

511
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,519
daily or weekly basis so hopefully

512
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,680
it's not so you know

513
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,199
outrageously different than what they

514
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,320
expect

515
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,680
um but what what most of our our users

516
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,120
and our customers are using the jupiter

517
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,199
notebooks for is to kind of

518
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,880
they're trying to drive the conversation

519
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,480
you know yes they're being prepared to

520
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,640
answer a question but instead of getting

521
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,280
in that like reactionary response kind

522
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,480
of driven

523
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,119
like mode they want to come to the table

524
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,199
saying hey here's the agenda we want to

525
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,640
set so here's the set of jupiter

526
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,679
notebooks

527
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:18,799
that we want to drive a certain

528
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,359
emotional response so it's strategic we

529
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,439
want get support on these resources if

530
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,599
it's tactical it might be like here are

531
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,480
clearly detection logic rules we need in

532
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,240
this particular area and so they're

533
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,960
trying to set the agenda with

534
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,280
jupiter notebook driving it from a data

535
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,840
kind of viewpoint versus uh just telling

536
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,600
them presenting through a powerpoint let

537
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,280
me show you the data let me drive the

538
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,120
agenda to make some changes

539
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,960
so there was a lot of really positive

540
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,559
feedback on the scenario

541
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,080
um and uh and how you guys went over it

542
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,840
um and then one question from slack and

543
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,799
actually

544
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,320
let's see i have it written down from

545
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,200
who

546
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,520
b all right so i don't know if these are

547
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,760
like abbreviated names i'm assuming it

548
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,080
is it's like b mara sky

549
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,960
um

550
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,240
but they wanted to know if there was

551
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,520
like well there was a couple of things

552
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,280
right one was are there any github

553
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,880
examples that you guys have released so

554
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,559
that way you know it's much easier to

555
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,440
walk through these things when you're

556
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,520
like okay that's the code

557
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,880
yeah that's something that we talked

558
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,880
about we had quite a few people

559
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,320
kind of ask the same question and i

560
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,360
think we'll probably put something

561
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,880
together and you know from our

562
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,559
perspective put together some base data

563
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,799
set so to your point all the data we've

564
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,160
pulled all the data we've manipulated if

565
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,600
you can get in that point i think you

566
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,200
can get some of the output that we've

567
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,240
put together

568
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,280
with the folks that we work with we've

569
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,440
done quite a bit so i'll be happy and i

570
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,120
think that's part of the whole point too

571
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,640
about the notebooks is you can easily

572
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,799
share them right and it's not only just

573
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,960
plugging it in and getting the output

574
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,280
but for analysts see you know the

575
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,960
iterations that stefan did with some of

576
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,200
our customers see how that logic ends up

577
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,559
going right where do we start with the

578
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,640
raw data and how do we drive it to

579
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,480
provide that message that we want to set

580
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,799
the stage for uh people can learn from

581
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:55,919
that perspective too and that's the

582
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,919
beauty of it is that code is there you

583
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,200
know they're not abstracted and they can

584
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,360
modify it when their executive says what

585
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,960
about this they can just change it as

586
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,600
well so that's the beauty of it

587
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,520
no that's fantastic all right so then

588
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,600
another question from slack was

589
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,000
um for those that want to drive this

590
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,200
scenario

591
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,679
um on their own right like where

592
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,840
couldn't they look for that data right

593
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,120
like that's actually there was a lot of

594
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,400
questions on that on how do they find

595
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,679
that data

596
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,679
well i'll take this one so in terms of

597
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,960
the scenario

598
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,240
i mean i guess are we referring to

599
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,160
setting the agenda are we talking about

600
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,120
you know part of getting that data is

601
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,600
first uh understanding you know what is

602
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,039
the scenario that you want to drive from

603
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,360
a you know attack

604
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,960
adversary emulation perspective so

605
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,120
there's a lot of free tools obviously

606
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,120
red team atomic red team caldera there's

607
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,480
a lot of things that you can run and

608
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,400
then you know jose and i come from the

609
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,000
commercial side where you know for the

610
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
last almost nine years we've been

611
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,919
building an attack iq an adversary

612
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,000
emulation platform so lots of choices

613
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,200
out there in terms of how you want to

614
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,360
generate that data yeah right one of the

615
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,880
things that we

616
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,200
um and i should say jose has taken part

617
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,120
in is the center for threatened form

618
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,360
defense and the attack flows and that

619
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,280
new release and so attack iq has pivoted

620
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,240
a lot towards that as has many many

621
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,320
vendors in the space to look at

622
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
emulating uh threat actors not just

623
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,520
atomically

624
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,880
you know because there's various

625
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,480
security controls that won't catch it if

626
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,480
just one technique exactly it's a

627
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,240
combination of techniques exactly

628
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,320
exactly and so in the presentation we

629
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,320
gave today with jupiter notebooks we

630
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,720
focused much more on attack flows how do

631
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,120
you emulate that attack behavior

632
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,280
um through an attack flow and attack

633
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,840
graph and attack chain so that they are

634
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,640
uh

635
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,120
judged the adversary behaviors judged

636
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,799
after a sequence of number of things

637
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,240
have happened

638
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,559
and so once you have that data

639
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,720
important part of any emulation is that

640
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,799
you have what has the attacker done and

641
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,600
then what has the defender been able to

642
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
detect or prevent once you have that

643
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,600
data now jupyter notebooks come into

644
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,679
place how do you present it

645
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,200
so for the viewers and for the people

646
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,559
that ask the questions

647
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,480
essentially get your simulation set up

648
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,000
first yes and get the data from that

649
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,520
simulation and then play the jupyter

650
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,200
notebooks with the scenario yeah i think

651
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,720
and then my feedback to that that person

652
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,400
as well would be you already have some

653
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
data start with that right at the end of

654
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,320
the day you know where you have gaps you

655
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,520
know where you have concerns you know

656
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,799
where you need more support from your

657
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,039
management so whether it's vulnerability

658
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,039
scans whether it's a pen test from last

659
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,360
month right all that's information you

660
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,159
have pull that in start using that and

661
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,679
then at the end of the day right start

662
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,000
working towards using uh you know atomic

663
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,440
red team and collecting that information

664
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,799
collecting the information at the level

665
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,039
that we had in our presentation right

666
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,159
but you have something that you can

667
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,080
start with today and build on top of

668
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,840
that is going to be my suggestion too

669
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,240
from that perspective i love that so

670
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,120
what kind of like you guys did actually

671
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,000
mention this little bit of your

672
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,440
presentation but like what were some

673
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,360
driving factors for you all to kind of

674
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,720
like come up with this idea for the

675
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,640
jupiter notebook and then realize like

676
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,400
this is actually really helpful for a

677
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,280
lot of people we should present on this

678
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,360
yeah i i think for us we we started

679
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,120
using jupiter notebooks internally at

680
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,880
the company okay i put something

681
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,240
together and i just threw it over the

682
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,000
fence and said go look at what i did and

683
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,400
how i got there and you know slowly but

684
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,080
surely the developers were using this as

685
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,080
a way of you know quickly iterating and

686
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,280
putting something together because it's

687
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,440
not just reporting you have full python

688
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,039
capability so anything that you can

689
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,120
orchestrate or manage you can do it

690
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,480
through these notebooks and i think we

691
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,799
saw that kind of pick up like fire

692
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,880
internally with our customers or

693
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,640
internally as at our company right and

694
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,559
our developers then we started showing

695
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,840
it to our customers they really liked

696
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,840
that and you know i think the call to

697
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,600
action of our talk that we wanted is

698
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,200
start using what you're already using

699
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,039
today right in this different way that

700
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,440
you maybe not have thought about and um

701
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,120
yeah i think that that was a driver for

702
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,280
us just seeing that kind of uh get

703
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,520
picked up uh just creating this

704
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,120
collaboration that i didn't see

705
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,720
otherwise was one of the main reasons

706
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,240
why i you know i wanted to talk about

707
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,159
this today

708
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,520
yeah i mean

709
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,000
i mean very similarly um i think you

710
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,120
know once you start doing something

711
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,120
internally and it picks up speed and

712
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,880
then you show others outside how to do

713
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,640
it we thought you know mitre attack con

714
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,720
was the perfect place to present it this

715
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,880
very collaborative community right and

716
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,640
jupiter notebooks being

717
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,039
this ability to you know build out a

718
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,880
notebook uh share it amongst the

719
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,159
community going here's how we're

720
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:15,600
actually presenting the data in real

721
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,320
time um within one security team another

722
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,080
security team might pick it up but as

723
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,440
you said before these jupyter notebooks

724
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,360
aren't in a get repository somewhere so

725
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,600
we'd love to you know start maybe

726
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,799
collaborating with someone who wants to

727
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,120
start that effort um certainly helping

728
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
to show what we've done but i think this

729
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,039
is a great effort that could get started

730
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,039
no i love that i think that's that's

731
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,720
beautiful like just the whole idea of

732
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,679
like

733
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,919
that innovation that you have internally

734
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,919
and then like celebrating that and then

735
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,640
like recognizing it and then testing it

736
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,480
out right in these safe environments so

737
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,640
you can fail fast and then

738
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,000
seeing it work and then very

739
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,279
intentionally bringing it to other

740
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,279
collaborative environments like that's

741
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,000
fantastic so we really really appreciate

742
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,360
all of the work that went into it and

743
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,640
just the

744
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,240
i guess you could say like the pause

745
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,360
where you guys could like take that

746
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,520
moment to reflect back and then like

747
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,919
realize the impact of something and then

748
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,200
intentionally bring it forward to the

749
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,520
rest of us so thank you so much we

750
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,880
really really appreciate you being here

751
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,080
yeah thank you so yeah thanks so um that

752
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,799
wraps up our day thank you guys so much

753
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,360
for paying attention and just being with

754
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,559
us today online i know it's tough we

755
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,240
make jokes like you should be in here in

756
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,279
person

757
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,000
but the reality is you can't right like

758
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,440
like not everyone can attend the

759
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,480
conference

760
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,679
but that doesn't mean that you don't get

761
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,320
to be part of it like you are a part of

762
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,720
it here like you guys are the only ones

763
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,960
in the meme contest um only ones with

764
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,600
the flag um and you're also the only

765
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,919
ones on this live stream so the the

766
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,440
people that were in person didn't get

767
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,760
that so hopefully you all got to enjoy

768
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,279
being able to see the human side of all

769
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,080
of our presenters um incredible people

770
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,360
that definitely put a lot of time and

771
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,760
passion into all of these presentations

772
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,679
so thank you guys so much for being with

773
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,679
us today we look forward to kicking it

774
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,320
off again tomorrow and i will definitely

775
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,400
be reviewing these memes so bring your

776
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,400
game
