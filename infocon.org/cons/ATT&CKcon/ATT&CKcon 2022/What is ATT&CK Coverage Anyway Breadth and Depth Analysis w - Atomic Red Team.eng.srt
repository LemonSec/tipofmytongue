1
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:14,620
- For our first after-launch speaker,

2
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,680
we'd like to continue
on our pre-launch theme

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,250
looking a little bit at Atomic Red Team.

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,390
So writing detections of ATT&CK techniques

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,750
is all well and good,

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,410
but how do you know if they actually work

7
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,850
without the expense and
complexity of a red team?

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,030
So tackling common problems
in working with the tech,

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,820
how do you define and improve coverage

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,900
using these types of tools?

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:43,280
So please welcome to the stage,
Red Canary's Brian Donohoe.

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:51,020
(audience applauds)

13
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,889
(indistinct)

14
00:00:54,889 --> 00:01:14,229
- All right, now it's on.

15
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:18,100
So I'm gonna focus on it from
two different sort of angles.

16
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,880
One, the first thing
we're gonna talk about

17
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,089
is how, there we go,

18
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,890
how we define coverage in Atomic Red Team.

19
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,580
And then, I'm gonna talk about an exercise

20
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,670
we went through to sort
of actually figure out

21
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,330
like what our coverage is.

22
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,490
And the reason for this is
kind of twofold as well.

23
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,490
We want to be able to show folks

24
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,670
like what kind of coverage

25
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,440
they can expect to get
with Atomic Red Team.

26
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,090
We also want people to know,
like, if they want contribute,

27
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,500
like where are our weak spots,

28
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,490
where can we improve coverage
so they can contribute there?

29
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:51,979
All right, again, I'm Brian Donohoe.

30
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:54,659
That's me right there.

31
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,240
So I spent some time as a journalist,

32
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,729
covering information security and privacy

33
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,250
at a news outlet called "Threatpost".

34
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,660
I then became a cyber
threat intelligence analyst,

35
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,560
worked for a little company down the road.

36
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,920
You might have heard of
called Booz Allen Hamilton.

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,538
I've dabbled briefly in marketing

38
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:11,950
since I'm now the principal
security specialist

39
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,369
on the community team at Red Canary

40
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,390
where I kind of do a mix

41
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,879
of all of the things I've always done.

42
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,399
So basically I write, I
help other people write.

43
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
I do research.

44
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
I help other people do research

45
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,450
and I talk all about security.

46
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,530
So this is my fourth
time attending ATT&CKcon

47
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,450
my third time speaking.

48
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,149
So huge, thanks to the MITRE team

49
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,500
for continuing to invite me here.

50
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,730
Big apologies to everyone
who has to listen

51
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,060
to my dumb voice again

52
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,780
although really the reason I'm here today

53
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,820
is 'cause I live close ATT&CKcon

54
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,120
my co-presenter lives quite
far away from ATT&CKcon

55
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,060
this is Adam Mashinchi, right there.

56
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,360
He is the director of Open
Source Programs at Red Canary.

57
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,950
So he's sort of like a product manager

58
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,069
for Atomic Red Team and
some other things as well.

59
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:57,319
And one of the things that I guess

60
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:00,060
he's, you know wanted to
do is sort of take a look

61
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,590
at Atomic Red Team from like
a really product D perspective

62
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:06,550
which is kind of what we're
gonna be talking about.

63
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,280
So in case anyone's wondering
Atomic Red Team is a library

64
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,910
of tests they're designed to test

65
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,599
your detective controls or
validate your visibility, right?

66
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:17,959
Like someone tells you that
a tool will alert on a thing.

67
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:20,270
You run the atomic test and
you see if it alerts or not.

68
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,740
Now you might be asking yourself

69
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,340
what does this have to
do with MITRE ATT&CK?

70
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,120
Well, MITRE ATT&CK is
our Dewey decimal system.

71
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,810
It is the classification
system that we use

72
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,739
to organize Atomic Red Team.

73
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:33,340
So if you go into the Atomic Red Team repo

74
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,520
you open the atomic folder

75
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,440
you're gonna notice a bunch
of technique IDs in there.

76
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,800
So that's how we organize it.

77
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,920
All right.

78
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,329
So back to the actual problem.

79
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,260
So let's start with sort
of defining coverage.

80
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,470
So the naive approach to it

81
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,660
is like this breadth approach, right?

82
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,109
And a lot of people have
talked about that going

83
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:56,430
from like you know, top left
of the matrix to bottom right.

84
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,430
And putting a checkbox

85
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,569
on every technique you have a test for.

86
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:03,510
There's value in that,
but it's kind of naive.

87
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,730
What we're also interested in is depth.

88
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,530
Like how well do a group
of tests cover a technique

89
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,750
and then the kind of like counterintuitive

90
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,260
or not so intuitive.

91
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,180
Other aspect of coverage
that we've been thinking

92
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,819
about is test difficulty,

93
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:20,180
because we want Atomic Red Team

94
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,599
to kind of be like a big tent

95
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:23,900
with a lot of people welcome in it.

96
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,159
So we don't wanna have the
tests be only available

97
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,650
to people who are super experienced.

98
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,159
We wanted them to be simple to run.

99
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
All right.

100
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,350
So Adam told
me that this problem,

101
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,950
one problem B thing was
a joke in the slide deck.

102
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,300
It's a joke that I don't get

103
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,240
but so like we've defined coverage

104
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,530
but we also have to figure out now

105
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,820
like how do we actually
figure out what our coverage

106
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,840
is in Atomic Red Team, but
like who works on free stuff?

107
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,070
Atomic Red Team is pretty much

108
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,400
100% percent community maintained.

109
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,330
And it gets harder when we
have like a really big project

110
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:00,320
to do say like doing a
holistic gap analysis

111
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,500
of how well we cover MITRE ATT&CK.

112
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,340
So we hired an intern and
in true Red Canary fashion

113
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,869
I think this is our first
intern we've ever hired.

114
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,009
We were like, let's have the
intern work on the free thing.

115
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:19,740
So a couple of things about internships

116
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,740
like first and foremost,

117
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,180
if you're gonna hire an intern
pay them, it's really scummy.

118
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,600
If you don't pay your interns,

119
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,949
also work with educational institutions

120
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:29,100
like we're in DC right now

121
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,180
just down the road is the
Harvard of Fairfax, George Mason.

122
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,509
They've got plenty of
potential interns there.

123
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:37,030
Once you've actually hired them,

124
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,679
like treat them like they're
actually like your teammates,

125
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,340
Don't just make them do menial tasks.

126
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,109
We all do menial tasks sometimes.

127
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,810
Hopefully not exclusively.

128
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,250
So give them work that is like beneficial

129
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,229
and is gonna help them in the long term.

130
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:53,849
Also don't rely on like your
great culture as the benefit

131
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,590
because your culture's
probably not that great.

132
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,679
And that's a weird
benefit to offer somebody.

133
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,790
So shout out Cameron the intern,

134
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,380
Cameron Roberts gets all the credit

135
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,280
for all the work that was done here.

136
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,820
He is a great cyber security

137
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,820
or he is a great open source
contributor rather he's worked

138
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,380
for a few cyber security
firms in the past.

139
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,719
He also enjoys hacking video games

140
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,360
which is funny because
we were talking yesterday

141
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,650
about how like the pipeline
for tomorrow's CNA CNO folks,

142
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,650
is probably coming

143
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,758
from like the video game
hacking scene today.

144
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,270
So if you guys wanna find good hackers

145
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,340
I guess go hang out wherever
video game hacking happens.

146
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,929
And if you wanna keep up

147
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,580
with Cameron Roberts exploits he is junior

148
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,590
or one equals one on Twitter.

149
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:39,400
So what did Cameron do?

150
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,549
So first we wanted to do an analysis

151
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,110
of Atomic Red Team coverage.

152
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,280
So he created a script that would run

153
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,580
through Atomic Red Team, generate a report

154
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,889
that we could do analysis on

155
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:52,290
create visuals so that we could sort of,

156
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,360
like communicate the coverage externally.

157
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,930
We also wanted to be able
to sort tests by difficulty.

158
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,350
So we had to create another means

159
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,610
of sort of figuring
out a test's difficulty

160
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,139
and then generating data on that.

161
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:07,490
And right now we're sort of
in this gap analysis phase

162
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,630
where we're reviewing all
the work that Cameron did

163
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,719
looking at gaps in Atomic Red Team

164
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,720
and then making a plan to fill them based

165
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,410
on some pretty funny math

166
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:20,380
and some effort to value ratio stuff.

167
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,240
So counting things, this is
kind of the breadth analysis

168
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,770
all of the breadth and depth analysis

169
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,840
like there's some gray area between them.

170
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,549
So first we started with Python

171
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,660
and I know what you're all thinking.

172
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,300
You're thinking I can count.

173
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,800
Well, it's a little more
complicated than that.

174
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,259
There's a lot of nuance
in Atomic Red Team.

175
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:39,530
The example that we chose here

176
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,090
is like the thing that
you're running a test on

177
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,799
isn't necessarily the same thing

178
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,110
as what you're running the test from,

179
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,180
which may seem obvious,

180
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,220
but it wasn't super obvious

181
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,080
when like mostly we just had windows tests

182
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,539
because then you're running
it on windows against windows.

183
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:55,849
But like when you get

184
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:57,750
into the infrastructure as a service land

185
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,940
like maybe you're running
a test against AWS

186
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,630
but you're running it
from like a bash script.

187
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:05,360
So more complicated than
just manually counting.

188
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,790
We got all these platforms.

189
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,830
Things are getting
deprecated in MITRE ATT&CK.

190
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,270
They're getting deprecated
in Atomic Red Team as well.

191
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,270
They're sub techniques.

192
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,750
So we created a Python
script, shifted it to a CSV.

193
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,000
And then we did pivot tables.

194
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
'Cause that's what you do,

195
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,240
once we did it in Python
and looked at everything

196
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,419
we kind of repeated the
process using JavaScript

197
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:27,448
so that we could create
these nice graphics.

198
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:28,770
So in the background here

199
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,409
is the heat map that basically shows

200
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,669
you know, green, lots of
tests for a technique.

201
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,019
Red, not as many, the
foreground image here

202
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:39,690
is just a look at it by technique where,

203
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,019
or by tactic rather where
dark red is techniques

204
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:43,049
that have coverage

205
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:44,498
and light red is ones that don't,

206
00:08:44,499 --> 00:08:47,329
for what it's worth we used
Google charts to do this.

207
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:49,140
So you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

208
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,079
Then there was the categorizing of things.

209
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:54,118
So this is where we wanted to figure out

210
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:56,850
like, okay well this test
has lots of tests for it

211
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,950
but it doesn't have any Linux tests

212
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,589
or that test has tests, but
they're all really hard.

213
00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:03,790
And like, this is kind
of further complicated

214
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,540
by the fact that some techniques

215
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,959
like inherently tricky, right?

216
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:10,479
So like cloud storage and object
discovery is a good example

217
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,269
because you have to
like pay for an account.

218
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:15,420
You might have to like cram
credentials into a script

219
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,969
and send them out over
the internet much harder

220
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,149
than just copying and pasting a command.

221
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:22,019
So how did we come up
with this Scoring Rubric?

222
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,800
Well, all of the atomic
tests are in YAML files.

223
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
So we wanted something

224
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,290
that could just scrape those YAML files

225
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,589
and spit out a score.

226
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:30,200
So we created multiple if statements

227
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,319
and it kinda looked like
this, this is just an example.

228
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:35,939
But bit like the things we wanted to know,

229
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:38,149
like can you just copy and paste the test?

230
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:39,420
Are there prerequisites?

231
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,490
Are there default arguments?

232
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,220
Do you need a second machine?

233
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,129
Do you have to elevate
your privilege level?

234
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:46,059
Do you need credentials?

235
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:47,059
All the things

236
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:49,709
that led into this zero
to nine difficulty scale.

237
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:53,388
Once we had done all of that,
we knew two things, right?

238
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:55,009
We knew where our coverage gaps were.

239
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:58,819
So we knew where we had a
technique that didn't have tests

240
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:00,149
or a technique that didn't have tests

241
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:01,860
for all of the associated platforms.

242
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,860
And then we had these
difficulty gaps as well, right?

243
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,670
Like we knew where techniques
only had super tricky tests.

244
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,878
So that led us to the next point,

245
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,949
which is like how do we fill these gaps?

246
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:16,709
How do we make things better and easier?

247
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:18,219
So this is kind of the heat map

248
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,889
to end all heat maps in a sense,

249
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:21,800
which I think is like the
third time someone said

250
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,319
that at ATT&CKcon over the years.

251
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:25,680
So it's probably not actually the heat map

252
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
to end all heat maps.

253
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,680
There will be more heat maps.

254
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,059
So anyway, this one kind of
looks more at difficulty,

255
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:33,219
So red are techniques

256
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,129
for which the tests are all
kind of tricky to execute.

257
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:38,149
And as you get to green, they get easier.

258
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:41,519
And then white there's no
tests for those techniques.

259
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,759
So what we wanna do

260
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:47,740
is like turn this whole
ATT&CK navigator layer green,

261
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,459
I admit like there's never gonna be a day

262
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:52,268
when all the tests are gonna be easy

263
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:55,709
but we can strive to make
them easier and easier.

264
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:59,339
This is, Adam's funny math
about like how you figure out

265
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,749
what to do first and then what to do last.

266
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:06,899
Like start out, prioritizing
the things that are easy to do

267
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,209
and provide value and
then work your way back

268
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:10,800
until you get to those
things that are hard to do

269
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,449
and provide less value.

270
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:17,339
So when do we get to
see all of this stuff?

271
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,549
So we're gonna launch a cool new website

272
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:22,610
and it's going to include the outcome

273
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,610
of all of this analysis.

274
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,029
So all of these graphs and
stuff are gonna be on there.

275
00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:27,240
You're gonna be able to see,

276
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,360
like, basically you're
gonna be able to understand

277
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,279
what you can expect to get
out of Atomic Red Team,

278
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,319
like as a product.

279
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,988
And it also can serve as a guide

280
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:38,600
for folks who want to contribute tests,

281
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,000
but they don't know where
to get started with that.

282
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,129
We'll also be adding more Atomics

283
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:45,819
in an effort to sort of start closing up

284
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:48,579
some of these gaps and
we'll write up a blog.

285
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:51,359
That's gonna detail like how
and why we did all of this.

286
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,629
And that blog effectively
will be like a better

287
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:59,139
more eloquent and more
detailed version of this talk.

288
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:04,279
So final takeaways, once
again, pay your interns people

289
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,920
also like to reiterate what I just said

290
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,358
like coverage and gap
analysis are underway.

291
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:11,369
New site and new tests are coming soon.

292
00:12:11,369 --> 00:12:13,029
Also, please, please, please.

293
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:15,279
Like this is community developed.

294
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,370
Please contribute to Atomic Red Team.

295
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:20,389
You can see us at atomicredteam.io

296
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:23,129
hit me up on slack or on Twitter.

297
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:24,129
Talk to Adam Mashinchi.

298
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:26,399
We've got a community
manager named Morrell Bailey

299
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,779
like come to any of us

300
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:31,810
and we'll help you figure
out how you can contribute.

301
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:36,209
And that's my talk.

302
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:39,149
(audience applauding)

303
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:40,619
- Fantastic.

304
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:42,389
And difficulty
is something I like peaked.

305
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:44,019
I was like, well, that's awesome.

306
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:45,019
Never really thought about that.

307
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:46,019
So thank you.

308
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:47,649
And also just thank you and you
of the rest of the community

309
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:50,119
for, you know, not only adopting this idea

310
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:51,179
'Cause a couple years ago we saw it.

311
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:53,569
We're like, that's really
clever, but exactly as you said

312
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:55,839
rallying around it and kind
of leading the way in terms

313
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,489
of how to build, maintain,
and really push a community

314
00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:00,489
in the right direction.

315
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:01,489
So thank you.

316
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,489
- Yeah.

317
00:13:02,489 --> 00:13:02,491
Thank you.
