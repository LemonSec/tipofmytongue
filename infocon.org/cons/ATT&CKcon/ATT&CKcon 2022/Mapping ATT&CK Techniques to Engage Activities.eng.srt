1
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:13,650
- So we're gonna be changing
directions a little bit

2
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,889
with our next speaker.

3
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:19,869
So next up is gonna be David
Barroso from CounterCraft.

4
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:22,779
So as I said, my intro,

5
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:24,710
a lot of my background
is actually deception

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,320
cyberthreat intelligence.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,759
And so I'm excited about this.

8
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:31,079
MITRE and ATT&CK talks a lot

9
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:33,320
about detections and mitigations.

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,620
We believe there are
other possible responses

11
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,250
that ATT&CK doesn't cover.

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,570
So with deception, adversary engagement

13
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,980
being near and dear to my heart,

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,608
give a nice welcome to David.

15
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:45,559
- [David] Thank you.

16
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:46,849
(audience applauds)

17
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,350
Okay, thank you also for organizing

18
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,210
such a awesome conference.

19
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,090
It's great to be here with you today.

20
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,639
So today we are going to
talk about how we come up

21
00:00:56,639 --> 00:01:00,980
some ATT&CK techniques
to some Engage activities

22
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,239
and we'll explain what MITRE Engage is.

23
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,369
So, but before starting,
I want to say like

24
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,710
like send big cue to the MITRE Engage team

25
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,750
because they are doing a fantastic job.

26
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,320
Actually, they did a very
good presentation last week

27
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,869
at the Shmoocon here in Washington DC.

28
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,630
So I recommend you to
watch that presentation

29
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:21,630
where they were showing how
they were doing some operations

30
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,710
in this case with HSBC, the bank.

31
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,380
So real operations trained
to engage with adversities.

32
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,699
So I recommend you to watch
that video is very awesome

33
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,190
and also go to the
website of MITRE Engage.

34
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,020
Yesterday I was saying that I felt a lot

35
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,339
of pressure because I was
talking about MITRE Engage

36
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,620
at the MITRE conference
inside the MITRE building.

37
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,650
So I will try to do my best

38
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,380
try to say how MITRE
Engage is really cool.

39
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,050
And we'll try to show some
examples of how can we use Engage

40
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,450
for engaging with
activities with adversaries.

41
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,760
So before starting just a quick intro

42
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,970
about MITRE Engage.

43
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,658
So MITRE Engage appeared
like some months ago,

44
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,350
but the latest version
that the official version

45
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,770
was on February this year

46
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,840
so uses cyber denial and cyber deception

47
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,560
as foundations or pillars

48
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,170
of trying to engage with redactors.

49
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,420
So that's the main goal trying
to engage with redactor.

50
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,750
And for that also we need to think

51
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,109
not only about technical stuff

52
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:23,540
but also about planning on analysis.

53
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,269
And for me, that's something really good

54
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:29,230
that they did, when trying to
create this engaged framework

55
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,078
because it's not always
about technical stuff.

56
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,930
It's always about planning

57
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,090
and also trying to analyze what's happened

58
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,930
so that we can reduce those information

59
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,170
for improving our
operations with adversaries.

60
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,309
So of course there are
like some like procedures

61
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,560
when try to Engage with attackers.

62
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,409
And I guess that there
are three main goals

63
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:51,590
that Engage is trying to state.

64
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,650
The first one is how can we
get like a high fidelity alerts

65
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,060
or try to detect redactors
as soon as possible?

66
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,060
The second one would be

67
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,190
how can we impose cost to the adversary?

68
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,530
And you know, that there is a lot

69
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,999
of like discussions around
Twitter about imposing cost

70
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:09,329
but I think that's a good idea

71
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,329
and a good way to express that.

72
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:12,959
And the third one would be

73
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,140
how can we collect as much as intelligence

74
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,909
from the attackers so that
we can use that intelligence

75
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:21,608
with other tools or other
products for sharing with peers.

76
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:24,019
So something that, how can we
collect that kind information?

77
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:26,909
And for that, they have created based on,

78
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:29,189
like a lot of military
stuff, because as we know

79
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:32,040
deception comes from the military

80
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,429
they have created this 10 step
process where as you can see

81
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,030
the yellow ones are more about
planning and analyze than

82
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,720
and only the blue ones
are about technical stuff.

83
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,980
So we need to focus a lot on planning.

84
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,709
So trying to answer those questions

85
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:49,469
and to prepare those different steps

86
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:53,049
from knowing your enemy, if
you remember that good article

87
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:56,989
from the hundred knowing like
20 years ago, lot of time ago.

88
00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:00,500
So from knowing your
adversary for instance,

89
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,919
one of my favorites is trying to determine

90
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,859
step number six and the
success and getting criteria.

91
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:09,579
When do we need to stop

92
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:11,769
its because we have
collected enough Intelligence

93
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:14,090
its because the redactor has noticed

94
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,430
that this is a deception scenario.

95
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,048
So you need to define
very clearly those steps

96
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:20,820
so that the output and the success

97
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,070
of the operation will
depend on the answers

98
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,240
and the preparations in
this preparation plan.

99
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,030
And then you can execute the operation

100
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:30,469
and then train to
understand what happened.

101
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,890
How can you extract in raw intelligence

102
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,520
that you can share with
products or third parties,

103
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,560
as I said.

104
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,880
So Engage also has different
terms are similar to ATT&CK.

105
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,170
For instance, we have
approaches and activities.

106
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,760
Approaches are tactics
from that same meaning

107
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,849
that in ATT&CK and activities
are techniques in ATT&CK.

108
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,820
But they decided to use different terms

109
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,340
because then we cannot, I dunno,

110
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,289
it's easy to differentiate if
we are talking about Engage

111
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,890
or talking about ATT&CK,
but also they have

112
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,360
something more in the top of
the matrix that is the goals.

113
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,990
So we have different goals.

114
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:11,760
Like we can see preparation,
expose, affect, elicit

115
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,909
and then understand.

116
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,530
So those are main goals that
can be different strategic

117
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,260
or for engagement goals.

118
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,610
So these are the key terms

119
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,960
and we can see also we have a matrix.

120
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,919
Similar to ATT&CK, where
we can see the yellow ones

121
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,510
that are the strategic
goals, from preparation

122
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,730
to then to the end to the last one

123
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,260
that is how can we understand
everything that happened?

124
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,469
And we can see the different
approaches and activities

125
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,800
from planning, of course.

126
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,110
And how can we define many and answer many

127
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,750
of those questions that we were seeing

128
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,390
at the beginning of
those 10 step processes.

129
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:50,180
So like the gating criteria,
if we need to create personas

130
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,800
for our narrative story
boarding for what's

131
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,240
that's also one of my favorites.

132
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,840
We need to create a narrative so that then

133
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,840
we can have an opportunity
to engage with the adversary.

134
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,679
And then we have the last one is analyze,

135
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,020
and we can of course, try to re-use

136
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,390
and feed everything that we
have found to our threat model,

137
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,110
or perhaps we can use the
information that we are getting

138
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,260
for improving our defenses

139
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,390
or sending everything to
the sock to the blue team,

140
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,320
so that they can be prepared
for the next wave ATT&CK

141
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,240
coming from the same redactor.

142
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,210
So I think that's really cool.

143
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,180
And then also we can, we
have the technical stuff

144
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,870
the blue one, so where we
need to first expose redactors

145
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,900
we need to try to affect them.

146
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,330
And then we need to collect

147
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,690
we elicit information from them.

148
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:40,690
So as you can see

149
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,920
we have different activities
or techniques from ATT&CK.

150
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,370
So activities that we can use

151
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,220
for trying to collect information,

152
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,500
how can we force them to make mistakes

153
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,270
so that we can collect
even more information

154
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,219
or perhaps how can we try to confirm

155
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,430
that they are like a in a real scenario,

156
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,160
and so that we force them to think

157
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,460
that they are in real scenario,

158
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,950
not in a deception scenario.

159
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,120
So as we can see different activities

160
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,390
from network manipulation
security controls

161
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,610
I don't know,

162
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,750
deploying vulnerable
applications in specific networks

163
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,840
could be changing the security controls

164
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,210
from an application, malware detonation.

165
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,799
The Shmoocon presentation was about that.

166
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
One of the use cases

167
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,170
how HSBC was detonating
malware from fin seven,

168
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,190
the director group.

169
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,990
So that they can collect
like a second stage payloads

170
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,430
that for them was really
important to collect them.

171
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,830
But then of course we can use Lures

172
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,020
that all will be the classic decoys

173
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,240
like those machines that we are deploying

174
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,810
so that we can collect more information.

175
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,090
And I think it's
important also to reassure

176
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,950
we need to make everything credible.

177
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,770
So credibility is key

178
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,700
and also trying to make
everything as credible

179
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,020
as possible, so that the
more credible the scenario

180
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,210
is the more time the adversary
will be getting around

181
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,888
and playing around and messing
around with our scenarios.

182
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:02,389
So those are the different activities

183
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:05,330
and approaches the question would be okay

184
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,070
so we know now the engaged framework

185
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,530
how can we map all the ATT&CK techniques

186
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,888
to those Engage activities?

187
00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:15,710
So the MITER Engage has
done an incredible job

188
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,818
trying to start mapping those
techniques to activities.

189
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:21,170
So for instance, what
they are doing is, okay

190
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,740
we have attack technique X.

191
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,580
So we can map this to this
activity from like Engage.

192
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,330
So for instance, like
in a very quick example

193
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,838
Attack technique would be like a using RDP

194
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:35,440
or Remote System Activity.

195
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,630
And then what we can do is
try to deploy some Lures

196
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,559
so that the attacker will find
those remote services that

197
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,300
we have published in the internet.

198
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,010
And then we can extract information

199
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,800
from the attacker after
they log into those systems

200
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,680
they collect information
and deploy the tools.

201
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,569
So we can collect not only TTPs

202
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,110
but also IOCs from the attacker.

203
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,870
Also just two quick examples,
the first one Team TNT

204
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,900
I dunno if you know about Team TNT

205
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:08,449
they are gone, in words
one of their members,

206
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,870
used to be like a active group that

207
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,010
were doing a lot of stuff in internet.

208
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,590
So imagine that we are an organization

209
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:18,310
and we want to check if we
know that TNT is targeting us

210
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,329
because I dunno they like
to target our sector.

211
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,580
And we have lots of token
demos connecting internet

212
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,900
I want to try to check

213
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,310
if they are trying to scan
our networks and do something

214
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,329
and then SSH from the container itself

215
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,630
to the host through SSH, so that then they

216
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,790
will be root in the host.

217
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,069
So that's what they are doing.

218
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:45,440
So we can try to map everything to Engage.

219
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,440
So if we know that Team TNT is
doing this type of techniques

220
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,460
then we can know which type
of activities from Engage

221
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,460
we can do.

222
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,510
So for instance putting some Lures

223
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,120
also try to change the security controls

224
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,050
of those token demos so
that they can be easily

225
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,529
compromised without
authentication, for instance.

226
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:05,630
So we can play a lot

227
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:08,540
with different activities
so that we can collect more

228
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,120
and more information from this factor.

229
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,900
Another quick example,

230
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,890
the infamous look for J vulnerability.

231
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:20,240
So imagine that also we have
lots of vulnerable machines

232
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,250
and internet that we cannot
patch because whatever reason

233
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,690
and we want to check if someone is trying

234
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:29,490
to exploit them and also what
they do after exploiting them.

235
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,700
So in this case, it's very easily.

236
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,450
We check one of those
look for the incidents

237
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,300
we know that people are
just scanning could be

238
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,849
a redactor that is specifically
scanning our organization.

239
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,810
It could be a random attacker,
then exploits the system.

240
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,569
Then for instance, in this case,

241
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,839
they install power solar scripts,

242
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:49,540
execute them, download
the second stage binary,

243
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,050
and do a lot of different stuff.

244
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,490
In this case, for instance, at the end

245
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,940
they are going to install a crypto miner.

246
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,080
That could be a normal use case.

247
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,000
So what we are doing is
trying to map everything

248
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,640
to engage activities, and
again, what we can do,

249
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,060
what can we do, for trying
to detect those activities

250
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:07,329
and then collect
information about attackers.

251
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,650
So Engage is for that.

252
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,060
So we can then deploy some lures,

253
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,349
create different network diversity

254
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,089
like different applications

255
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:16,520
with different Java
versions, different, I dunno

256
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,939
using struts or Tomcat, anything.

257
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:23,241
So we can easily play with
that kind of information.

258
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:24,310
Finally, some engagement tips,

259
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,900
like something that
we've been playing a lot

260
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,310
with engaged in the last time.

261
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,270
So for instance, some engagement tips

262
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,630
so we can deploy different
types of service and systems

263
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,620
in order to attract attackers
from vulnerable system

264
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,620
non vulnerable systems,

265
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,460
credentials in a pay being
pointing to web server

266
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,870
or to SSH or to our RDP.

267
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,060
So we can play with
different type of work crimes

268
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,089
and then we can also play with attackers

269
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:51,540
trying to do kind of a bait and switch.

270
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,380
So trying to impose cost,
trying to create confusion

271
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:58,020
among them, or trying
to delay their actions

272
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,689
or force them to make mistakes

273
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,880
so that we can collect more information.

274
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,580
So for instance, a very good example

275
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,210
is imagine that we detected
APT28 in our networks.

276
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:11,690
We can deploy APT29, IOCs
and TTPs in the same network.

277
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,970
So the APT28 will see that a APT29

278
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,020
is also in the same network.

279
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,110
And they will create a
lot of confusion and chaos,

280
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,589
I guess that back in their office.

281
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:22,980
So that's an example, but many others

282
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,440
how can we try to play on

283
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,480
and post cost to all the attackers?

284
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,310
And that's pretty much everything.

285
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:34,339
So, well, thank you very much.

286
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,020
(audience applauds)

287
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,020
Thank you.

288
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,020
- Thank you so much.

289
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,460
You know, adversary engagement
is a very interesting topic

290
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,490
that a lot of us, including
myself are just starting

291
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,110
to really understand all
the nuance of, so thank you.

292
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,970
I think we have time
for one quick question.

293
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:58,250
If there's anyone, oh, right here.

294
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,630
(indistinct)

295
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,430
So just to repeat the
question for the live audience

296
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,310
how do you deal with the
legality of adversary engagement

297
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,959
especially when thinking of terms

298
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,081
like hack back and, you know

299
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:10,100
are you playing in red space
and gray space, blue space?

300
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,980
What are your thoughts there?

301
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,230
- So that is a good question.

302
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,260
I guess, that there is
a very broad spectrum

303
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,420
between like a passive
defense to active defense.

304
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,500
And then we have, I think hack back.

305
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,090
So hack back is fully for
law enforcement or military.

306
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,380
So I guess that we are
totally very far away

307
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,320
from hacking back, but
active defense where we can

308
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,250
you can run operations
against your adversaries.

309
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,740
Like I dunno the ones that would be saying

310
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,490
like deploying things on
internet so that we can study

311
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,480
and collect information,
detect the activity.

312
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,540
I think that's totally legal.

313
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,750
You are not doing nothing illegal

314
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,410
but hacking back is only for
law enforcement or military.

315
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,410
- Thank you.

316
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,410
- Thank you.

317
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,410
- Great presentation.

318
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,410
- Thanks, bye.

319
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,329
(audience applauds)
