up with tim who's going to be telling a

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,960

okay so good afternoon everybody thanks

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,719
for sticking around for the last

17
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,640
presentation um

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,000
let's just do a little bit of

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,199
interaction because i want to keep

20
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,479
everyone awake uh so here here

21
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,920
who here knows

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,600
what the systems are that keep the

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,200
lights on in their business the systems

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,200
that make you the money the systems that

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,840
mean that your your customers your

26
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,320
your users um can actually do the thing

27
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,280
that they

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,640
need from your organization

29
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,280
there's one man that's kind of saying

30
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,799
ish um

31
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,200
anybody else here got a view on what

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,960
matters to their organization what the

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,759
crown jewels are

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,360
cool

35
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,119
we like to think we do okay cool right

36
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,200
so um

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,720
this is the problem space that i had

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,360
having um i go into organizations and i

39
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,880
help them work out

40
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,799
what actually matters what the threats

41
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,840
look like

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,640
and

43
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,079
in order to do that i use mitre's attack

44
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,240
so

45
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,000
let's move on

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,159
here we go so yeah so i think we've all

47
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,680
agreed over the course of the last two

48
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,840
days attack's awesome

49
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,560
it's brilliant for expressing the

50
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,280
generic the the attack that affects

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,599
every organization the windows the linux

52
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,560
the active directory the exchange etc

53
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,160
but oftentimes

54
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,160
by the time they get to the customer

55
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,360
they're kind of going well actually

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,040
we've got something quite important

57
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,879
quite specific to our organization quite

58
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,280
specific to our industry and we really

59
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,560
don't know what that looks like and yeah

60
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,400
it could be something as

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,440
interesting as a payment platform a

62
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,680
payment platform that maybe allows you

63
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,560
to

64
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,480
transfer money internationally could be

65
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,480
something like an mpls network or a

66
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,720
software defined network um yeah they're

67
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,280
a service provider guess what if so if

68
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,360
if the carrier network goes down they're

69
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,720
in a whole heap of troubles for all of

70
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,800
their customers so these are the yeah

71
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,319
these are the things i talk about when i

72
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,480
talk about the crown jewels the keeping

73
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,280
the lights on and so my job is to sit

74
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,040
there work with the customer and build

75
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,440
out that threat model and

76
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,640
i'm going to go through a little bit of

77
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,959
what we've been doing um some use cases

78
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,080
that we've come up that are quite

79
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,280
specific

80
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,159
um and hopefully give a bit more light

81
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,920
on how you might do this within your own

82
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,159
organization when you go back to work on

83
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,120
monday or friday if you're going back to

84
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,680
earlier this week so anyway so why can i

85
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,040
talk about this so my background um

86
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,360
my very first sock that i helped build

87
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,200
was almost 20 years ago financial

88
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,159
services and those were the days before

89
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,680
um seems

90
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,519
before edr

91
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,720
before um devsecops so we were cooking

92
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,319
up all of this stuff from scratch

93
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,000
retrospectively i wish i'd known that

94
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,840
these were what these things were called

95
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,200
because it would have been super helpful

96
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,640
to have been the person that coined the

97
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,400
terms great from a perhaps from a

98
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,799
branding perspective but yeah so us our

99
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,239
sock um at the bank ran on sql server

100
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,080
all of our events went into sql server

101
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,200
we ran

102
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,519
nightly queries with sql to go hunting

103
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,560
so yeah

104
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,280
not december from what we do now just in

105
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,519
a slightly less um

106
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,239
customized tailored form

107
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,000
so anyway yeah so that that's my

108
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,760
background i started there i spent 15

109
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,080
years doing kind of reddish activities

110
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,799
of varying different flavors for

111
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,680
interesting uk customers um government

112
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,519
private sector but always the ones that

113
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,279
yeah had the money and had the

114
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,960
challenges that they that they really

115
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,639
needed to solve so that's yeah that's

116
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,800
why i think i'm capable of talking i'm

117
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,199
now back at cisco i'm doing the same

118
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,080
thing

119
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,960
as i was 20 years ago helping customers

120
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,880
build their sock capability and

121
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,560
answering the question well actually you

122
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,360
know

123
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,960
that system over there this is what you

124
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,600
need to worry about

125
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,440
so

126
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,320
protecting the typical network um this

127
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,880
is taken from the perspective of

128
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,560
a vendor

129
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,919
a carrier

130
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,720
somebody who's responsible for a global

131
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,400
infrastructure of some description and

132
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,320
they want to protect it and it's theirs

133
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,800
to theirs to do as they see fit

134
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,479
so

135
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,600
that's

136
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,840
a publicly available threat model

137
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,759
that we built for

138
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,360
an organization called meth which is

139
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,440
essentially a standards group for

140
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,639
carriers

141
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,520
and

142
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,160
carrier vendors

143
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,520
to describe how sd-wan might be attacked

144
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,039
now those of you that have come across

145
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,320
threat modelling and i'm going to ask

146
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,759
another question at this stage who here

147
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,039
has done threat modelling or some

148
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,080
description in the past

149
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,560
cool so there's more people who've done

150
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,759
threat modelling than understand their

151
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,759
crown jewels that's interesting okay so

152
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,120
for those of you who've done threat

153
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,199
modelling before um

154
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,800
that threat model is produced with

155
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
microsoft threat modeling tool

156
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,720
so it's

157
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,919
very developer centric um so it uses a

158
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,520
framework called stride

159
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,600
um microsoft and framework for doing for

160
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,360
doing threat modeling but on there you

161
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,880
can kind of see the moving parts and

162
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,000
it's

163
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,600
a good place to start right if you're in

164
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,520
an organization and you want to start to

165
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,520
think about the assets that matter

166
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,840
microsoft tools probably as good a place

167
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,919
to start as any and on this diagram we

168
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:04,880
can see

169
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,759
all of the constituent parts of a global

170
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,319
network um from the client through to

171
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,639
the business systems they're accessing

172
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,720
we can see some of those parameters we

173
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,960
can start to look at what flows go

174
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,560
across them and we can start to think

175
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,919
about well actually what kinds of

176
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,800
threats might exist in there

177
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,520
moving our step along uh microsoft's

178
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,440
direct modeling tool does a really nice

179
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,440
job of enumerating all of the artifacts

180
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,720
that you've pushed in

181
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,800
and outlining what kinds of threats

182
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,199
might exist against them so again a

183
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,880
really useful place to start if you've

184
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,720
not done this kind of thing before it's

185
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,800
a catalogue um

186
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,560
but it's not a catalog that's lined to

187
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,680
attack

188
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,840
so one of the challenges i have

189
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,400
is how do you translate something like a

190
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,160
software development lifecycle threat

191
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,880
model into operational terms and you

192
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,479
look at the numbers there

193
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,319
that threat model was produced between

194
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,080
multiple vendors and multiple service

195
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,680
providers so it's a reasonably valid

196
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,759
reasonably well validated threat model

197
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,440
but guess what

198
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,520
even within the standards we know that

199
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,960
94 out of 113 things

200
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,759
we can't possibly as a vendor tackle in

201
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,960
isolation

202
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,560
we need to understand the implementation

203
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,080
we need to understand the operation we

204
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,440
need to understand the use case so

205
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,120
that's where for me

206
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,199
attack plays a huge part

207
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,000
because i'm no longer thinking about

208
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,520
sql injection

209
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,400
and input validation which

210
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,160
would be nice to be thinking about but

211
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,759
isn't really going to help the average

212
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,080
stock analyst isn't necessarily going to

213
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,318
help the average detection engineer

214
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,919
so let's look at some more specific

215
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,360
examples of kind of how you jump from

216
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,720
theoretical

217
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,240
software development

218
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,599
um threat

219
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,840
to to practical threat that we might

220
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,000
talk about here in fact at least a

221
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,360
number of these threats are things we've

222
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,879
already heard from other speakers on

223
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,840
over the course of this week

224
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,919
and it's really nice

225
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,599
isn't it that we can share that language

226
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,160
and i can immediately go the previous

227
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,960
talk

228
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,400
was talking about things that i

229
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
understand and we called on this thing

230
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,160
and therefore we're all talking the same

231
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,280
language

232
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,120
so yeah let's let's take a specific

233
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,240
example

234
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,080
so knowing your customer

235
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,840
any ideas what this might be a

236
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,638
representation of

237
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,559
no no i okay right say

238
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,080
take it on a step four um so

239
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,000
this was one we discovered during an

240
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,080
incident so i occasionally get involved

241
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,880
in this response we were called into a

242
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,720
customer who had a leisure platform that

243
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,959
processed money uh perhaps you might

244
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,399
guess what kind of platform that might

245
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,120
be

246
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,399
but they were suffering from a

247
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,320
credential stuffing attack

248
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,959
curiously at that point i'd never heard

249
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,880
the term credential stuffing um

250
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,240
an ir colleague was like this is

251
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,760
credential stuff and i'm like no this is

252
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,399
brute forcing um and we started to map

253
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,320
out where about it actually landed we

254
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,600
kind of went well actually it's valid

255
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,959
accounts

256
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,640
it is an example of credential stuffing

257
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,959
and i learned a little bit more um in

258
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,880
the process of the investigation but

259
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,000
yeah so the customer called in the

260
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,839
instant response team and said

261
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,480
we're having this problem um can you

262
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,600
help

263
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,440
ironically i've done the software

264
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,760
architecture part of the platform that

265
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,080
was being built and i specifically from

266
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,240
a development perspective said this is

267
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,519
something you're going to need to worry

268
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,320
about

269
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,640
and they'd said oh well it will put it

270
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,959
on the backlog as developers sometimes

271
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:37,760
do

272
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,839
so anyway so something i'd predicted

273
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,360
could be a problem from a software

274
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,800
development perspective became an

275
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,399
operational problem

276
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,320
and we started to dig into it

277
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,760
we did some threat intelligence

278
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,600
gathering we identified the tools and

279
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,839
configurations and we're like okay so

280
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,600
now i'm sitting in the detection

281
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,000
engineering and response space how do i

282
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,320
help the customer get better from this

283
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,760
it was credential stuffing but it was

284
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,360
lots of different ip addresses that

285
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,880
didn't appear to be a particularly good

286
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,800
pattern with regards to

287
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,320
the user agent

288
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,760
um sure we could just shut the site down

289
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,000
or we could kind of pursue law

290
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,440
enforcement or things like that we

291
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,560
wanted something that was actually going

292
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,600
to work in

293
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,440
in practice and quickly

294
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,519
because crown jewels

295
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,440
this particular platform

296
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,720
guess what if they didn't have people

297
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,800
logging in and putting money in and

298
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,480
taking money out they weren't making

299
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,680
very much uh making very much business

300
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,160
and actually

301
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,399
they want to pay their staff um they

302
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,480
want they want to be able to support the

303
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,240
endeavors that they're committed to the

304
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,680
contracts that they signed up et cetera

305
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,600
so what did we do

306
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,800
so we

307
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,120
looking at the exe we started to reverse

308
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,360
engineer it it didn't get very far

309
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,279
because we didn't actually need to

310
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,600
we had the the exe

311
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,279
we unpacked it

312
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,120
open ssl was sitting in there

313
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,360
interesting what version of open ssl was

314
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,279
it it's an old release

315
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,360
so we kind of went okay so can we do

316
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,040
anything with the ciphers

317
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,720
the ciphers might be our way of of

318
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,640
locking out the attacker it doesn't

319
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,079
matter what ip address they come for if

320
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,240
we can block them because we can detect

321
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,880
them like that via scifix and guess what

322
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,440
that's where we ended up um we looked at

323
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,519
the size of the cipher suite selection

324
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,600
that was being made realized that it was

325
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,920
a fairly unique number by comparison

326
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,399
with some of the other um customers to

327
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,519
the site

328
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,959
looked at the ciphers that were actually

329
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,480
being invoked

330
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,880
inside the exe and we're like yeah this

331
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,079
this will work

332
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,480
and so we built a detection um we

333
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,880
configured the f5s with some eye rules

334
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,920
and we blocked out the bad guys

335
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,360
why do i say

336
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,200
know your customers

337
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
because guess what every single one of

338
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
you could do that tomorrow

339
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,640
you could go to your web server you

340
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,120
could say log my

341
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,519
tls exchanges log the ciphers that are

342
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,560
being requested and then you could go

343
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,519
actually

344
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,800
this subset of ciphers comes from

345
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,279
this particular country or comes from

346
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,120
this particular service provider we

347
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,680
don't do any work with them

348
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,399
why are we servicing traffic to them um

349
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,720
or you could say well actually we've

350
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
figured out that you're using an old

351
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,320
browser because the version of the

352
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,480
surface that you're asking for um and

353
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,600
you could present a page that

354
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
essentially says to your customer hey

355
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,839
you should probably upgrade your browser

356
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,839
so there are things you can do

357
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,320
if you understand your application you

358
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,880
understand how it works and how and how

359
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,880
the user interoperates with it

360
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,680
so the next example

361
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,000
this one ties very nicely into the work

362
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,800
that cat's been doing um

363
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,880
preparing for blackout any ideas what

364
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,439
this might be

365
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,000
so this one's ad on linux

366
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,839
so contesso for those of you that don't

367
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,839
know is microsoft's name for their

368
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,519
fictional company that they use to

369
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,079
demonstrate all of their products um the

370
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,000
page at the bottom is a representation

371
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,160
of the utc password file but this was a

372
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,040
piece of research that i did in 2018

373
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,120
looking at how you attack adjoined linux

374
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,480
systems

375
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,440
um

376
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,800
and as it says there we ended up

377
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,240
presenting a really nice interesting

378
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,480
talk um this was driven by sitting on a

379
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,000
customer site and realizing that

380
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,279
everyone

381
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,720
in their organization that was running

382
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,040
linux platforms had it had the

383
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,040
integration in place they were they were

384
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,839
tied back into a.d single authentication

385
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,320
really good but also a novel attack

386
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,920
surface that they've not really ever

387
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,200
considered

388
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,880
you'd be hard pushed to ask a sock

389
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,560
engineer

390
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,959
and not get a response along these lines

391
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,800
if you talked about windows but the

392
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,639
average sock engineer probably wouldn't

393
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,000
think actually

394
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,320
our linux systems are adjoined all the

395
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,399
same attacks possible and guess what

396
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,399
yeah they are in fact

397
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,839
in many cases substantially easier

398
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,519
os credentials

399
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,760
sql like database in one case

400
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,199
um

401
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,120
granted only available to the root user

402
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,639
but you know if you look at modern

403
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,079
windows and all the things they do to

404
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,240
try and stop you messing with lsas and

405
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,519
the sam file

406
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,920
quite substantially easier and kerberos

407
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,320
tickets just files under slash temp

408
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,920
again file commissioners will protect

409
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,240
you but not a huge amount more so

410
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,839
for this piece of research i was wearing

411
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,079
my offensive hat and i wrote linux which

412
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,760
is a tool that essentially allows you to

413
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,600
enumerate all of these guess what it's

414
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,519
very similar to mimic asphalt just for

415
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,839
linux

416
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,399
um

417
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,320
how would you defend against it

418
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,839
so this is this is what i ended up

419
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,079
building for black cat because i was

420
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,600
like i'm not really sure i want to

421
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,360
present the offensive tool without

422
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,240
giving

423
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,399
defenders some opportunity to

424
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,440
protect

425
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,760
and so we yeah we went and looked at the

426
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,600
syscalls that were underlying our

427
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,800
operations

428
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,680
um

429
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,360
i'm not a huge fan of

430
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,720
file hashes

431
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,199
really not and on linux even less so um

432
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,760
i like auditing i like logs and i like

433
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,440
logs at the lowest level possible

434
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,399
because

435
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,560
let's be entirely honest everything

436
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,160
that's further up the stack is far

437
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
easier to tamper with so yeah we went

438
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
and looked at the ciscos that linux was

439
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,480
triggering we picked out the interesting

440
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,560
files that you might want to access

441
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,480
um and we built some audit d rules for

442
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,880
this one um looked at the constants

443
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,240
looked at the parameters that were going

444
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,680
through the statisticals and were able

445
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,680
to identify that for example

446
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,720
even a generic connect string actually

447
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,920
look different from a linear cast

448
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,160
perspective versus everything else

449
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,120
because it was a unix socket um

450
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,959
and you could detect that but based on

451
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,199
the length of the string

452
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,680
am i getting am i yeah i'm running out

453
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,199
of time damn it

454
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:41,920
yeah

455
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,920
you're over jet lag we can blame jeff ah

456
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,160
we've got one more got time for one more

457
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,720
virtually not thank you so much and

458
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,410
happy belated birthday by the way

459
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,600
[Laughter]

460
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,580
thank you

461
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:02,459
[Applause]
