1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,820
- So with that,

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,420
it's time to actually get started

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,163
on our technical program for today.

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,220
So our first speakers
are Santiago Pontiroli

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,762
and Dmitry Bestuzhev from the
wilds of Argentina and Miami.

6
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,950
Today's first talk was the actually

7
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,360
the highest rated submission
by our program committee.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,920
We don't often hear about
Latin American threats.

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,120
It's kind of an under reported space

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,349
and we are really excited
to hear about some actors

11
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,750
that we either haven't
heard about much in the past

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,940
or haven't heard about at all.

13
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,070
So we're intrigued to hear
about the attack techniques

14
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,790
being leveraged by these groups

15
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,680
and how they might be
different from the ones

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,870
that we're used to.

17
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,632
So please welcome to the
stage Santiago and Dmitry.

18
00:00:57,818 --> 00:01:00,309
(audience applauding)

19
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,143
Big green button.

20
00:01:01,143 --> 00:01:02,701
- [Santiago] Which one is the?

21
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:03,534
- [Male] Big green.

22
00:01:03,534 --> 00:01:04,983
- [Santiago] Okay, thank you.

23
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,360
- So, hello everyone.

24
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,982
Should I say Buenos Dias

25
00:01:11,982 --> 00:01:14,333
because we're gonna speak
about Latin America?

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,890
For us, it's a big privilege
to be here with you.

27
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,320
Thank you for having us

28
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,919
and I have also privilege
to introduce to my colleague

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,420
and my friend, Santiago Pontiroli

30
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,180
who's senior security researcher.

31
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,013
Santi?

32
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,780
- Thank you, Dma.

33
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:30,260
Buenos Dias, good morning, everyone.

34
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,640
Thank you for being here.

35
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,760
I know last night or last
evening you had some drinks

36
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,300
so thank you for waking up.

37
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:42,300
So I'm presenting here
with Dmitry Bestuzhev.

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,890
He's the director of the
global research analysis team

39
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,615
for Latin America and
we've been working together

40
00:01:49,615 --> 00:01:51,520
for nine years so we know
each other really well

41
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,080
and we are going to speak
about what we work everyday.

42
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,377
So thank you again for being here

43
00:01:57,377 --> 00:01:59,277
and let's start with the presentation.

44
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,373
So has anyone been here before?

45
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,390
One, one in the room.

46
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,330
You need to travel here.

47
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,250
This is beautiful.

48
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,083
- Two.

49
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:10,000
- Two, two people.

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,833
Nice.

51
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,852
So this is forest Iguazu,
or cataratas del Iguazu,

52
00:02:12,852 --> 00:02:16,072
or Iguazu waterfalls.

53
00:02:16,072 --> 00:02:19,870
So Iguazu comes from the name E or Y,

54
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,880
that means big and Yguasu from Guarani,

55
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,299
that means water.

56
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,200
So big water.

57
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,713
It was a pretty simple name.

58
00:02:27,784 --> 00:02:31,510
So we have these beautiful
landscapes in Latin America,

59
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,720
but we also have some conflicts.

60
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,859
If you see this picture,

61
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,860
you wouldn't imagine the
administration of George W. Bush

62
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,450
saying that this is a conflict zone,

63
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,089
that there are terrorist
groups operating here,

64
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,110
that there are very, a lot of
criminal activities going on

65
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,861
and this is a conflict
zone mainly because of the,

66
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:55,030
of the triple frontier.

67
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,080
You have Argentina.

68
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,913
You have Brazil,

69
00:02:56,913 --> 00:02:57,920
and you have Paraguay,

70
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,899
sharing pretty much a single point

71
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,301
that crosses over this waterfall.

72
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:07,140
So what we are going to speak about

73
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,634
is the other side of the
coin, the virtual side,

74
00:03:09,634 --> 00:03:13,420
because as we see, Latin
America is a beautiful place,

75
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,410
but we also have some
cyber espionage operations

76
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:21,410
that do not get the attention
that we think they should.

77
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,700
So knowing the culture,
knowing the context,

78
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,686
is important as we mentioned
yesterday in several talks,

79
00:03:28,687 --> 00:03:31,910
the importance of storytelling,
the importance of,

80
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,388
of knowing what, who, and where
are doing these operations

81
00:03:36,388 --> 00:03:38,830
and we are going to speak
about several groups.

82
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,920
I'm going to start with,

83
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,989
with one that is from
the bottom of our hearts,

84
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,443
and this is Machete.

85
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:47,478
- Thank you.

86
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:50,047
Yeah, so probably you've heard
a lot about Machete, right?

87
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:52,913
At least at some
conferences, but in reality,

88
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:54,482
everything you have heard,

89
00:03:54,482 --> 00:03:56,510
it's not the full picture.

90
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:01,347
I found Machete by myself
before EDR existed,

91
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:05,167
Igs-DR and all those
(inaudible) we have nowadays.

92
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:08,940
It was a very interesting
story when one of the generals,

93
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,650
militaries from Ecuador called

94
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,850
and told that he had a trip to China

95
00:04:14,723 --> 00:04:15,556
and he was like freaking out

96
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:17,700
thinking that his machine was infected.

97
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,589
I went to the, to work with his machine.

98
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,529
I just sat down and I
worked with his machine

99
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,239
and I found actually Machete.

100
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,780
I didn't know it was Machete.

101
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,429
I didn't find anything Chinese

102
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,760
but something very suspicious,

103
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,260
like a presentation on EPT,
with an embedded file which,

104
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,110
basically in the end, ended
up in this executable.

105
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,937
So Machete is also known originally,

106
00:04:38,937 --> 00:04:41,540
Machete, this is the name, marketing name,

107
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,540
I put to this thing,

108
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,290
but originally it was called
as Arkantos Live Control

109
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,480
and we're gonna see
that later, also Ragua.

110
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,850
So here is one of the
example of those documents

111
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:57,180
they also used and that
exists at least since 2010,

112
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,670
we found also traces
leading to mobile implants.

113
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,780
Imagine even to, you remember Blackberry?

114
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,275
When people use those mobile device?

115
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:07,349
They had implants for
that Blackberry as well,

116
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,240
same as for Android,

117
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,400
and of course they rely a
lot in social engineering.

118
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,469
So Santi?

119
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,710
- So we found Machete during 2014,

120
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,202
but actually their operations
go as far back as 2010.

121
00:05:19,202 --> 00:05:21,810
I always make fun,

122
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,194
we laugh about this, that we had the,

123
00:05:23,194 --> 00:05:26,470
the brightest idea of
presenting Machete in Colombia

124
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,303
in Cartagena,

125
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,730
but after that presentation, of course,

126
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,810
Machete went underground
for a couple of years.

127
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,110
We didn't see any more
of their operations.

128
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,680
Then in 2016, 2017, we
saw some new samples.

129
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,250
We saw they were consolidating
their operations.

130
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,180
They were starting all over.

131
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,120
So there was a different set of malware,

132
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,270
a different infrastructure.

133
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,044
It was everything done from scratch.

134
00:05:52,044 --> 00:05:56,349
Then we saw in 2019 also
using human intelligence.

135
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,027
So they were using documents
that they would steal

136
00:05:59,027 --> 00:06:01,469
from victims,

137
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,930
so these were secret documents
that they would steal,

138
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,054
for example, from embassies
and use those documents

139
00:06:08,054 --> 00:06:10,890
as a lure to catch new victims.

140
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,300
So for example, the documents,

141
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,510
if you would see the
slide before was about,

142
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,900
for example, about a coup in Venezuela.

143
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,359
So at the bottom of the
document, it says Chavez Vive,

144
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,537
or Chavez is alive.

145
00:06:22,537 --> 00:06:26,849
So they would use this type of
documents to get new victims,

146
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,000
documents that no one had seen before.

147
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,473
This is very targeted spearfishing.

148
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,733
- Finally.

149
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:34,566
Yes, thank you, Santi.

150
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:36,602
Finally, during the
pandemic, we thought, okay,

151
00:06:36,603 --> 00:06:40,366
Machete is gone because
literally we brought so much,

152
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,360
let's say attention to them,

153
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,560
that they had like a very
busy time, you know, even the,

154
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,540
one of the operators who used to be

155
00:06:49,756 --> 00:06:50,823
an active military personnel,

156
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:53,200
he got transferred inside
of the military unit

157
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,000
to something like construction
or something like that

158
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
until in 2020, 2021,
they just got back again.

159
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,327
It was right inside of the pandemic.

160
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:06,730
The original name of the operation,

161
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,830
they put it was COVID 19.

162
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,520
Then they changed it to Ecorys

163
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,859
and what was about,

164
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,230
about targeting the office
of general prosecutor office

165
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,280
in Ecuador.

166
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,113
Why?

167
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:20,190
Because the ex-president, one
of the ex-presidents of the,

168
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,732
of Ecuador, he got in
problems, in troubles,

169
00:07:22,732 --> 00:07:26,050
and he was called basically
to get to the court

170
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,810
and to respond, you know, to the justice.

171
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,270
So basically Machete,

172
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,113
from a military unit,
ended up in mercenaries.

173
00:07:32,113 --> 00:07:36,360
Now they're still alive and kicking

174
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,813
and they work for money.

175
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,810
For this operation,

176
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,330
they got payment in
cryptocurrencies and what they did,

177
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,430
they attacked the computer

178
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,070
of the secretary of the
general prosecutor office

179
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,430
who led the case.

180
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,650
They stole the information.

181
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:55,539
Those screenshots are published
on a website, fake website,

182
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,230
built by Machete to also to,

183
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,410
to like set up a fake news portal,

184
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:05,040
news portal to make people
believe that there is injustice,

185
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,220
like, you know, unjust-full
treatment to the ex-president

186
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,330
and you see here is in the
script about the visitors,

187
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,330
when people visit the portal,
it says like, you know,

188
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,900
the number of visitors
like it's, I don't know,

189
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,950
thousands of people.

190
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,580
In reality, it was just fake.

191
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,159
So those, I mean, these
pictures, you can see here,

192
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,410
it's taken by Machete, not by us.

193
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:28,160
It's not from the evidences,
it's basically by, by them.

194
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,740
So the purpose of this presentation

195
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,159
is to let you know about
the contents, right?

196
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:36,732
What's going on and also
to show, how can we map it?

197
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:38,880
How can we put it, to transfer it,

198
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,090
into the MITRE ATT&CK
framework, TTPs, right?

199
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,120
Some of them, like Machete,
it's already available public,

200
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,360
but still we work with those
existed TTPs available on the,

201
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,053
in the internet and also we,

202
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:57,053
let's say, try to enrich it
with the information we have or,

203
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,720
or just to show you something
like very interesting

204
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,550
and it's, we usually put it
like in highlight in yellow,

205
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,426
as you can see here.

206
00:09:04,427 --> 00:09:06,750
One of the very important things here,

207
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,980
you can see the exfiltration,

208
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,971
one of the exfiltration methods
used, it was not only FTP,

209
00:09:12,971 --> 00:09:16,380
but also a special USB device.

210
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,057
Why we say special?

211
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,340
Because that special USB device

212
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,220
was linked and hard coded in
the code by the serial number.

213
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,330
What it means,

214
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,560
air gap networks were there's no internet

215
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,400
still were affected because spies, people,

216
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,730
let's say other personnel
working in the affected,

217
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,260
in the victims facilities,

218
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,950
and we should remember
between the victims,

219
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,434
we had embassies, military
unions, police forces,

220
00:09:42,434 --> 00:09:46,233
prison systems, and so on.

221
00:09:47,168 --> 00:09:49,160
So someone also like those victims had a,

222
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,889
let's say like intruders or, you know,

223
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:54,223
people, like spies, using
basically that USBs,

224
00:09:54,223 --> 00:09:55,473
they inserted those USBs,

225
00:09:56,509 --> 00:09:57,342
without doing anything,

226
00:09:57,342 --> 00:09:59,288
the information was copied
automatically to the USB

227
00:09:59,288 --> 00:10:00,690
and that's it.

228
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,590
Santi, do you have anything to add here?

229
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,419
- Yeah, I remember the
first campaign that we,

230
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:08,050
we saw Machete using, for example,

231
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,310
pornography images,

232
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:12,849
but also they were using, for
example, The Art of War ebook.

233
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,070
So it was kind of a, you
know, a shotgun approach,

234
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,470
like maybe you want to
read a very, you know,

235
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,470
deep book or maybe you
just want some pornography.

236
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,420
It's fine.

237
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,930
But after that in 2016, 2017,

238
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,880
they started using these stolen documents.

239
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,782
So Machete evolved, we've
seen like a clear evolution,

240
00:10:32,782 --> 00:10:37,782
but also the name Ecorys
comes from the C2 server.

241
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,320
Actually, they would embed the
credentials in their malware.

242
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,550
So everything was custom.

243
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,689
For each operation,

244
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,523
they had a,

245
00:10:44,523 --> 00:10:46,410
let's say a Dropbox or a,

246
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,002
or a drop server.

247
00:10:48,003 --> 00:10:49,875
After that everything was burned

248
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,640
and a new operation was created.

249
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,605
- Yes, and that is a
screenshot of one of those

250
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:57,130
Arkantos Live Control, you remember?

251
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,280
They also had a feature,

252
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,113
a special feature,

253
00:10:59,113 --> 00:11:02,290
to spy on such are called
offline conversations.

254
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,410
You know, like, hey, I
want, Santi, can you speak?

255
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,260
Yeah, sure, but face-to-face.

256
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,093
- Yeah.

257
00:11:06,093 --> 00:11:08,589
- Okay, and we are here, let's
say, but the computer is on,

258
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:12,460
or my mobile device is on
and you can see they were,

259
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,300
they had those features like
audio, geolocation, video,

260
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,300
WebCom and so on.

261
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,280
So it was like a full,
actually, full operational,

262
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,548
like framework to spy on
whoever and right now it's,

263
00:11:25,548 --> 00:11:30,460
it's still running and they
also rely a lot on open source

264
00:11:31,544 --> 00:11:33,800
and for example, for video,
let's say, like conferencing,

265
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,459
they use Getsee, you know, Getsee thing.

266
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,340
So it's, there's something also,

267
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,504
they like it very much.

268
00:11:39,504 --> 00:11:40,947
Blind Eagle.

269
00:11:40,947 --> 00:11:41,780
- Blind Eagle.

270
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,000
This was the best picture I
could find of a blind eagle.

271
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,312
I am sorry for this, (chuckles)
like, I really tried to,

272
00:11:47,312 --> 00:11:49,640
to have some memes or something, you know,

273
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,479
so Blind Eagle,

274
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:53,830
now that we're speaking
about Colombia also

275
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,960
is one of these APTs and I
would call it a nation state.

276
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,793
I mean,

277
00:11:58,793 --> 00:12:01,270
some other other
companies have called this

278
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:03,569
a kind of a mercenary or
financially motivated group,

279
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:08,030
but actually I don't think
so because of the targets

280
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,180
and the way they operate.

281
00:12:09,181 --> 00:12:14,181
So I think there are very important things

282
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,300
about Blind Eagle.

283
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,420
One of those is, thank you, Jose-lia,

284
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,134
for mapping it, (chuckles)

285
00:12:19,134 --> 00:12:21,240
but also beyond that

286
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,901
is that they use a
bunch of different RATs,

287
00:12:23,901 --> 00:12:27,290
Remote Access Trojans,

288
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,930
and between those we could find,
for example, Projector RAT,

289
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,959
or some RATs that are
made in Latin America

290
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,365
and also some phishing emails,
for example, from DIAN,

291
00:12:36,365 --> 00:12:40,920
DIAN is Department del
Impuestos Aduanas Columbia,

292
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,520
that's the tax and customs
department from Colombia.

293
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,703
So they are using very
specific phishing documents,

294
00:12:46,703 --> 00:12:48,805
not as specific as Machete

295
00:12:48,805 --> 00:12:52,386
but they are targeting
pretty much the same kind of,

296
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:56,879
let's say, of entities,
embassies, military services,

297
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:01,879
anything that has strategic
relevance to their operations.

298
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,170
Again, we are adding context,

299
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,560
but also we thought it
would be good for you

300
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,900
to have also the TTPs.

301
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,189
So it's not only the
context you have, you know,

302
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,110
or mappings as well,

303
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,309
and you can do something
with it. (chuckles)

304
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:19,141
- Actual things.

305
00:13:19,142 --> 00:13:20,725
- So, for Blind Eagle,

306
00:13:20,725 --> 00:13:23,880
I was checking the mapping
that there is available on,

307
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,490
on the MITRE ATT&CK website
and I had a problem mapping,

308
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:31,370
just one TTP that was related
to network infrastructure.

309
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,950
So when Blind Eagle is
developing resources,

310
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,883
they would hack routers or modems,

311
00:13:40,094 --> 00:13:43,110
but they won't use it
as an execution phase

312
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,075
or they won't use it to deploy anything.

313
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,730
It's just developing the
resource and use it later

314
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,640
for maybe proxifying the connection

315
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,939
or as a multi proxy or something like that

316
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,680
but it's actually resource irrelevant

317
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,766
and I couldn't find this
exact TTP in my term.

318
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:00,620
Other than that,

319
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,560
we added some other
TTPs and as you can see,

320
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,191
the discovery tactic is
marked with an asterisk

321
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:11,123
and this is pretty common
with all the threat actors

322
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:12,576
that we want to show here.

323
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:15,980
Latin American threat
actors are really noisy,

324
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,260
really, really noisy.

325
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,520
The discovery phase is amazing.

326
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,353
I mean,

327
00:14:21,353 --> 00:14:24,329
I would need another slide
just to show everything.

328
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,233
- Correct.

329
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:27,577
- So Puppeteers.

330
00:14:27,577 --> 00:14:31,660
This dates back to 2015, 2016,

331
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,536
we are going to present about Puppeteers

332
00:14:34,537 --> 00:14:36,262
at a security conference in Tenerife,

333
00:14:36,262 --> 00:14:41,262
one week before we saw the
report that Citizen Lab published

334
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,330
and we thought, okay, we
cannot talk about this anymore.

335
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:48,910
So we published a different threat actor

336
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,760
that we will talk about
later, but nevertheless,

337
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,830
Puppeteers is one of those
groups operating in Latin America

338
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:59,972
that you should be aware of
because they are mercenaries.

339
00:14:59,972 --> 00:15:04,270
They target journalists,
they target opposition,

340
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,870
they target prosecutors.

341
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,830
So they target high profile
victims, not entities,

342
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,503
but persons, people.

343
00:15:10,503 --> 00:15:15,503
I remember the first sample
that we saw was using Alien Spy,

344
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:22,500
I think, protected with
Allatori, a commercial hacker,

345
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,330
and when you see the email,
now Dima will talk about this,

346
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,724
but they would ask you like,

347
00:15:28,724 --> 00:15:30,760
do not read this email on your phone,

348
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,569
please open it on your desktop computer

349
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,599
and things like that, you know. (laughs)

350
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:35,578
(audience laughs)

351
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:36,411
Of course.

352
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:37,992
- Right, so yeah, Puppeteers,

353
00:15:37,993 --> 00:15:39,670
it's interesting because they also,

354
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,880
the person behind, his
unique name as he's known,

355
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,989
it's El Russo, like the Russian, but he's,

356
00:15:45,989 --> 00:15:48,860
he's not the Russian. (chuckles)

357
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:52,340
So here is also one example
of those like real examples,

358
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,343
what happened, basically the
guys behind this campaign,

359
00:15:55,343 --> 00:15:57,481
it's a group of threat actors.

360
00:15:57,481 --> 00:15:58,973
One of them,

361
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,770
he started like psychological warfare

362
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:05,276
when he was like also in
the military, now career.

363
00:16:05,276 --> 00:16:07,459
So now it's a mercenary thing

364
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,320
and they're also targeting people.

365
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,153
In this case,

366
00:16:10,153 --> 00:16:11,090
in this particular case,

367
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:14,314
first they infected the
president of Ecuador's daughter.

368
00:16:14,314 --> 00:16:16,380
Then from her email,

369
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,945
they went to the president of
the Ecuador and they got like,

370
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:23,437
you know, his communications
completely on.

371
00:16:23,437 --> 00:16:26,425
Again, that is not the only one victim.

372
00:16:26,425 --> 00:16:27,880
Between the victims,

373
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,880
we saw journalists protected by the,

374
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,217
the State Department of the United States.

375
00:16:33,217 --> 00:16:34,762
Boom, infected.

376
00:16:34,762 --> 00:16:37,369
People who were in
opposition, boom, infected.

377
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,749
And then in like working with the victims,

378
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,240
I mean, working with them as persons,

379
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,100
it was also very interesting
because they, they show like,

380
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,060
I think I'm infected.

381
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,430
Okay, show me your email,
like, okay, I have a Gmail.

382
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,401
Okay, log in, boom,

383
00:16:49,402 --> 00:16:53,110
and then like you see those
emails and they say like,

384
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:56,360
I tried to, I tried to open
the file but it didn't work.

385
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,193
Can you send it again?

386
00:16:57,193 --> 00:16:58,263
Man!

387
00:16:58,263 --> 00:16:59,096
(laughs)

388
00:16:59,096 --> 00:17:02,010
Like how many times did you
click on that thing, you know?

389
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,167
So Puppeteer used also
something very interesting.

390
00:17:05,167 --> 00:17:07,017
For the ex-filtration,

391
00:17:07,018 --> 00:17:09,300
for the command and control ex-filtration,

392
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,899
they use a multi-hop proxy.

393
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,819
How it works,

394
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:15,158
they wanted also to bring
a false flag operation.

395
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:20,005
Basically first, they infected
some of network devices

396
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,200
of a military unit of Ecuador.

397
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,906
It's a military unit and it's
a communication like unit,

398
00:17:25,906 --> 00:17:28,229
like in charge of, you
know, communications

399
00:17:28,229 --> 00:17:32,107
and they basically use it
as a first step, you know,

400
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:35,918
like fast so any like
incident responder, like with,

401
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,615
you know, like, not that like
high expertise would say,

402
00:17:39,615 --> 00:17:43,530
look, the military of Ecuador
targeting his own president.

403
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,570
Like it's a shame, it's a shame.

404
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,965
You have to go to the jail
and here, as you see the,

405
00:17:47,965 --> 00:17:51,360
the compromised webcam
and also their router

406
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,979
and stuff like that and,

407
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,100
Pisco Gone Sour, Santi.

408
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,148
- So, Dima got to name Machete,

409
00:17:58,148 --> 00:18:00,129
and I go to name this one, Pisco.

410
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,525
If you know the drink, guilty as charged.

411
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:06,212
So I named this one after
being in Chile and Peru,

412
00:18:06,212 --> 00:18:07,660
Pisco Gone Sour,

413
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,205
it's a campaign that we
saw several years ago

414
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:14,129
and it was happening at the same time

415
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:19,033
as some cyber drill exercise
done by the Southern Command.

416
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:22,820
So we saw the same TTPs
as this cyber drill.

417
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,753
So they were teaching some military units

418
00:18:25,753 --> 00:18:28,324
about doing offensive operations.

419
00:18:28,325 --> 00:18:30,650
These offensive operations

420
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,760
use some pretty common frameworks,

421
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,500
such as PowerShell Empire
and things like that.

422
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,053
So at the same time, or after
this cyber drill finished,

423
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,520
it seems the teams
wanted to put it to use.

424
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,910
So we saw this operation and
if you look at these documents,

425
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,380
it's targeting,

426
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,370
targeting a system developer

427
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,229
that has access to the
ministry of defense of Chile.

428
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:56,790
So actually they weren't
targeting directly

429
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,710
the ministry of defense,

430
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,803
but indirectly by using
one of their developers.

431
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,490
- Yeah, that's correct.

432
00:19:07,305 --> 00:19:08,209
- So all the TTPs are new.

433
00:19:08,209 --> 00:19:09,042
So the, we, we don't,

434
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:11,110
we didn't highlight anything on this one,

435
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,368
but we can hope we can share it.

436
00:19:13,368 --> 00:19:14,810
I don't know if it's going to make it

437
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,700
to the MITRE ATT&CK
website, but nevertheless,

438
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,900
we will share the adjacent files of,

439
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,090
of all the attack navigators that we did.

440
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,169
So we --

441
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,360
- Exactly, because I think nobody knows

442
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,169
about Pisco Gone Sour
attack at all, right?

443
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,079
Probably you heard about the previous one,

444
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,003
but about this one not

445
00:19:34,003 --> 00:19:35,990
so here you have also
these so fresh things.

446
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,090
Now there's another group,

447
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,995
because we have heard
like a lot of military,

448
00:19:38,995 --> 00:19:40,510
military, military, but now we're,

449
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,577
we're gonna speak about
Initial Access groups, right,

450
00:19:43,577 --> 00:19:47,961
and that is something we
have forecasted years ago

451
00:19:47,961 --> 00:19:50,440
and we see today, right?

452
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,910
Even like groups like Conti,

453
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,320
we just saw them on the news,

454
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,283
basically also using,

455
00:19:54,283 --> 00:19:56,947
relying on somebody else,
you know, to get access.

456
00:19:56,947 --> 00:20:00,830
So Latin America also
has those guys, you know,

457
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,100
and one of them is Poseidon.

458
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,804
Santi, what can you tell
us about Poseidon, please?

459
00:20:04,805 --> 00:20:05,638
- Well, if you remember,

460
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,310
I told you that we were going
to present about Puppeteer

461
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,525
and at Tenerife and we couldn't do it,

462
00:20:09,526 --> 00:20:12,341
well, we have Poseidon
also at the same time.

463
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:17,341
And actually Poseidon is
also a mercenary group

464
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,460
but it's different from Puppeteer.

465
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,490
Why is that?

466
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,910
Because Poseidon presents itself

467
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,220
as a penetration testing company.

468
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,568
So it goes to the customer
and offers the services,

469
00:20:29,568 --> 00:20:33,430
but once it's inside the network, once it,

470
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:37,119
it has access to the customer
files and private information,

471
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:39,764
it starts to blackmail the customer

472
00:20:39,764 --> 00:20:42,490
and it offers that
information to the competition

473
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:45,993
and also they have like
another leg of their operation

474
00:20:45,993 --> 00:20:49,290
that is called financial
forecasting services.

475
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:52,990
So if your company is on
the stock market, of course,

476
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,860
if you have private
information of the company,

477
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,830
I have the best forecasting system ever,

478
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,426
because I know everything about you.

479
00:20:58,426 --> 00:21:01,362
So they would sell this service as well.

480
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,813
So one of the, let's say,

481
00:21:08,896 --> 00:21:11,370
TTPs that we can highlight for Poseidon

482
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,760
is the use of digital
certificates but also again,

483
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,800
for the discovery phase,

484
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,909
I remember they have this
huge file that was called

485
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,480
coll-eta sequel, or
information gathering tool,

486
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,330
that was like 16 megabytes.

487
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:29,470
So that tool is noisy as hell.

488
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,920
It just tries to get information
from every possible product

489
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,476
that Microsoft ever did,
starting from Windows like 3.11.

490
00:21:36,476 --> 00:21:38,098
So after this,

491
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:41,240
they will get all that
information and exfiltrate it

492
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,506
but again, it's not a
mercenary group like Puppeteer.

493
00:21:45,506 --> 00:21:49,163
It's more of shady business.

494
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:51,362
- It's like, unrequested, you know,

495
00:21:51,362 --> 00:21:52,763
and then Santi look what I found.

496
00:21:53,634 --> 00:21:54,536
- Yeah.

497
00:21:54,536 --> 00:21:55,434
- You want me to keep it in secret?

498
00:21:55,434 --> 00:21:56,340
No?

499
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,244
You want to pay?

500
00:21:57,244 --> 00:21:58,140
- Yeah.

501
00:21:58,141 --> 00:21:59,039
- You better pay.

502
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,636
So, but Santi, what can you
tell us about Satellite Link?

503
00:22:01,636 --> 00:22:02,639
- Oh, well,

504
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,141
we are going to talk about
different groups as well.

505
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:08,562
There's going to be a mention
about Satellite Trula,

506
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:10,800
but in the case of Poseidon,

507
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,730
the common control server
was actually, and, and we,

508
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,060
we tried to single a couple of the domains

509
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,950
that were using for exfiltration

510
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,070
and we found one that was on a ship

511
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,659
in the middle of the ocean

512
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,845
so it was a hijack satellite connection.

513
00:22:23,845 --> 00:22:26,610
So you can see that it
was pretty difficult

514
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,969
to track these guys and I
remember when we did this, the,

515
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,590
the first presentation of
Poseidon, I used a phrase,

516
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,782
I don't know if you saw the
movie Ferris Bureau's Day Off?

517
00:22:36,782 --> 00:22:39,714
So life moves pretty fast.

518
00:22:39,714 --> 00:22:42,250
If you don't stop once in
a while, you could miss it.

519
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,750
The same is for Poseidon.

520
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,090
If you miss it, that's it.

521
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,072
You will never find it again.

522
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,243
- And we, we were just joking, like, okay,

523
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:50,793
you got to take down that C2.

524
00:22:50,793 --> 00:22:51,695
- Yeah.

525
00:22:51,695 --> 00:22:54,500
- Like, and ship, you know,
like how to take down, you know.

526
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,840
Another one, Saguaro,
Saguaro comes from Mexico.

527
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,879
It's confirmed.

528
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,995
They also, they targeted mostly in Mexico,

529
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:01,354
but also many other countries.

530
00:23:01,355 --> 00:23:03,230
Comparing, you know,

531
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,649
Mexico with like 3
million victims to others,

532
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:08,168
let's say tens of thousands,
tens of thousands is like 1%,

533
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:11,967
you know, but still, that
was like a huge, huge thing.

534
00:23:11,967 --> 00:23:16,967
So they targeted companies,
stealing RDP accesses,

535
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,999
VPN connections,
certificates, email accesses,

536
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:24,615
mobile things, all sort
of, you know, everything,

537
00:23:24,615 --> 00:23:27,650
everything they could steal.

538
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:30,610
and then it's about
commercialization, of course.

539
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:33,686
So here also with Saguaro
was something interesting.

540
00:23:33,686 --> 00:23:36,750
You see sometimes when
they think about their RDP

541
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,170
and mapping those things, we
say, okay, initial access,

542
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,003
I don't know, right?

543
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:43,750
But they never use those accesses.

544
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,120
They just, they use it to resell it.

545
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,273
So it's RDP in this case, it's like,

546
00:23:48,273 --> 00:23:49,530
what it should be like?

547
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,363
Impact?

548
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:51,450
Resell of RDP?

549
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,578
I don't know.

550
00:23:52,578 --> 00:23:53,478
- Yeah.

551
00:23:53,478 --> 00:23:55,190
It's like, oh, stealing like BTC wallets.

552
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,950
Yeah, that is the impact.

553
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,470
But how can we put it in the navigator?

554
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,070
So it's like, you know,

555
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,970
it's financial actually impact, right?

556
00:24:05,803 --> 00:24:06,705
- Well,

557
00:24:06,705 --> 00:24:07,538
and then we have global threat actors

558
00:24:07,538 --> 00:24:08,950
operating in Latin America.

559
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,100
So this is, this is my meme time,

560
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:14,949
I try to, to do that
with this one. (chuckles)

561
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,600
So yes, you have some
operations with Lazarus

562
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,120
and we have a particular one

563
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,831
that we are going to speak about.

564
00:24:23,831 --> 00:24:28,831
So this was like two or
three years ago, new,

565
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,423
they were targeting the bank
of Chile, Banco de Chile.

566
00:24:36,163 --> 00:24:37,065
- It's public, it's public.

567
00:24:37,065 --> 00:24:37,970
- Yeah, this is public.

568
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:38,870
I'm not, I'm not --

569
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,767
- We're not bringing shame to anyone here.

570
00:24:39,768 --> 00:24:41,610
- Everything has been rehearsed. (laughs)

571
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:45,520
So this operation was
pretty known by Lazarus

572
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,810
but they were targeting
Chile and Mexico at the time.

573
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:52,810
So this was unexpected for such a group

574
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,530
that has so many aliases

575
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,590
and has done so many operations

576
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:58,041
but with the Banco de Chile,

577
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:01,070
what was interesting was the,

578
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,889
the resource development phase
and the reconnaissance phase.

579
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:07,936
So they would take a lot of
time to find the right victim

580
00:25:07,936 --> 00:25:10,209
to start the spearfishing attack.

581
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,073
It's not like Machete or Poseidon

582
00:25:12,073 --> 00:25:14,707
that they use secret documents
to lure their victims,

583
00:25:14,707 --> 00:25:17,750
they just find the right guy

584
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,370
and Dima's going to speak about that.

585
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,300
- Yeah and that was through
LinkedIn, of course.

586
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,310
So basically they contact
one guy and they said,

587
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,889
hey, you want your dream job?

588
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,670
You know, like working
for a foreign company?

589
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:28,503
Sure, yes.

590
00:25:28,503 --> 00:25:31,230
So just get our special
secure application.

591
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,620
You get to install it and run,

592
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,790
it will enable your VPN
connection to our servers

593
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,697
and that is the screenshot
of this, you know,

594
00:25:37,698 --> 00:25:40,760
thing and the code, of course,

595
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,927
that executed malicious code and goodbye.

596
00:25:42,927 --> 00:25:45,199
- And then we have finally,

597
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,070
we get to pronounce Mish-tah again.

598
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,970
So we have TA505.

599
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,916
This is also a financially
motivated actor.

600
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:56,916
I think that the most interesting
thing about TA 505 is the,

601
00:25:58,537 --> 00:26:00,235
the Living Off the Land binary usage

602
00:26:00,235 --> 00:26:03,840
and also their campaigns
related to CLOP and CLOP Leaks.

603
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,291
So we highlighted this and
this was the only group

604
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:10,223
that we could map with an impact.

605
00:26:12,891 --> 00:26:13,793
So I think there is something also that,

606
00:26:13,793 --> 00:26:15,520
for Latin American threat
actors, we couldn't find,

607
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,830
I still don't know why,

608
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:19,230
but it's open for conversation.

609
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:22,900
So if you need to, to do a
purple team engagement or,

610
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:27,017
or you need to emulate TA
505, LOLBAS is your friend.

611
00:26:27,017 --> 00:26:31,200
Then cognitive biases, just
to wrap up our presentation,

612
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,120
of course, survivorship bias that we also,

613
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,714
that we always see the,

614
00:26:36,714 --> 00:26:39,780
the things doesn't mean
that it's going to happen

615
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,613
every single time,

616
00:26:40,613 --> 00:26:43,110
the same as the Monte Carlo
or the gambler's fallacy.

617
00:26:44,148 --> 00:26:46,187
Please hold us accountable
of what have we done here

618
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,410
and check.

619
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:50,750
- Last but not least,

620
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,280
you see we don't have enough time

621
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,969
to present you about everything

622
00:26:53,969 --> 00:26:55,470
that is happening in Latin America.

623
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:58,623
So things like Satellite
Turla targeting Chile,

624
00:26:58,623 --> 00:27:00,680
a very interesting thing is not here.

625
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,425
Dark Tequila Anejo is not here.

626
00:27:03,425 --> 00:27:06,080
Ransomware targeting hospitals,

627
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,260
now everybody is thinking,

628
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,098
okay, the, you know, it's now,

629
00:27:09,098 --> 00:27:10,413
but it's not now.

630
00:27:10,413 --> 00:27:15,280
First Brazilians started with
that, had started years ago,

631
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,113
xPan.

632
00:27:17,373 --> 00:27:19,110
We're gonna, maybe like if
we're invited next time,

633
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,873
if we're accepted, we'll
present all of them.

634
00:27:20,874 --> 00:27:21,781
- Next year!

635
00:27:21,781 --> 00:27:23,720
- And something else also, Green Deer,

636
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,970
also very interesting
campaign, super unknown yet.

637
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:30,317
Also it's an outsource
campaign relying on,

638
00:27:30,317 --> 00:27:33,080
looks to be a Chinese threat actor,

639
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,101
targeting Latin America on the name,

640
00:27:35,102 --> 00:27:38,420
the country of one of the
countries of Latin America

641
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,750
on the name of the other country,

642
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:44,410
which got very much upset
because of a political decision,

643
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,350
you know, like playing all those things.

644
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:49,040
- And I'm a sucker for quotes

645
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,240
and I love this one because this is where,

646
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,700
what I remind myself before
working on our report.

647
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,180
"Tell me what, you know, then
tell me what you don't know,"

648
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,310
and this for me is the
most important thing.

649
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,947
We know a lot about Latin
American threat actors,

650
00:28:00,947 --> 00:28:03,590
but of course we don't know what you know.

651
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,610
We don't know the gaps in our knowledge.

652
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:10,026
So again, hold us accountable
of everything we said here,

653
00:28:10,027 --> 00:28:13,432
check the adjacent files
and thank you for your time

654
00:28:13,432 --> 00:28:14,265
and attention.

655
00:28:14,265 --> 00:28:15,440
- Yeah, thank you very
much and one more thing,

656
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,520
one more thing, the last thing.

657
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,250
Machete also goes ransomware.

658
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,720
The, I don't know for what,

659
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,993
they also use like an open source project

660
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:26,720
based on Python, it's on GitHub,

661
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,542
and I don't know if, if
they're gonna use it for,

662
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:31,697
let's say like a smoke screen

663
00:28:31,697 --> 00:28:36,379
or it's like diversification
of business who knows, but --

664
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,596
- Emerging market.

665
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:40,010
- Yes, and thank you,
thank you very much again.

666
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:40,843
Thank you.

667
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:41,708
- Thank you.

668
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:44,800
(audience applauds)

669
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,358
- I'll get in the middle.

670
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:47,760
Oh, thank you.

671
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,148
Thank you so much and we
really looked forward for that

672
00:28:50,148 --> 00:28:51,520
and like I said, yesterday was amazing.

673
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,550
We had a couple code drops.

674
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,940
Today we're getting Intel drops.

675
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,950
So fantastic.

676
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,450
Thank you for really, you know, being a,

677
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,585
you know, great contributors
to the community.

678
00:28:58,585 --> 00:29:00,692
We have time for a couple questions

679
00:29:00,692 --> 00:29:03,960
and I wanted to start with
one that we got from online

680
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,793
that was really awesome.

681
00:29:04,793 --> 00:29:06,520
Barry Anderson, thank you.

682
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,198
The question was, since, you
know, as you mentioned some,

683
00:29:10,198 --> 00:29:11,031
you know,

684
00:29:11,031 --> 00:29:13,635
governments actually have
threat actors fund themselves,

685
00:29:13,635 --> 00:29:15,440
do you think that, you know,

686
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,485
complicates or kind of muddles the,

687
00:29:17,485 --> 00:29:20,033
the separation between economic operations

688
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:22,860
and nation state activity like that nexus?

689
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,414
How do you kind of perceive that?

690
00:29:24,414 --> 00:29:25,739
- Well, Latin America,

691
00:29:25,739 --> 00:29:29,370
it's always about improvisation
and sometimes it's cows,

692
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,449
like what's the plan?

693
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,337
We'll see.

694
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:32,296
It's like that is the difference

695
00:29:32,296 --> 00:29:33,822
between like soccer players,

696
00:29:33,822 --> 00:29:36,750
you know, in Europe,
okay, this is the plan,

697
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,730
like Germany team,

698
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:39,018
like we're gonna attack
this and, and in Lat Am,

699
00:29:39,018 --> 00:29:42,180
it's like, okay, let's go
and play, enjoy it guys.

700
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,013
Woohoo.

701
00:29:43,013 --> 00:29:43,904
(chuckles)

702
00:29:43,904 --> 00:29:47,140
So it's same --

703
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,522
- It's very difficult for us to,

704
00:29:48,522 --> 00:29:53,260
to separate financial
threat actors from APTs,

705
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,160
that fine line for us it's,

706
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,073
it's so hard because sometimes
these are financially

707
00:29:58,073 --> 00:30:00,500
motivated actors but
also at the same time,

708
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,070
if they find something interesting,

709
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:05,540
they will take it just as a
leverage for the next victim.

710
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:09,950
So I don't know, for the moment
the answer is, I don't know.

711
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,980
- It gets back to what you
said earlier about context too.

712
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,813
- Yeah.

713
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:13,910
- You really have to immerse
yourself in understanding,

714
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,885
you know, what's the
motivation, what's the intent?

715
00:30:15,885 --> 00:30:18,580
I see how a couple really eager faces.

716
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,689
So I definitely want to open
it up to the audience here,

717
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,804
if there's anyone that
has, oh, right here.

718
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:27,070
- Okay, so on the Ecuador, when the,

719
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,335
the hopping into the military state,

720
00:30:29,335 --> 00:30:32,689
I just want know when you were
dealing with that situation,

721
00:30:32,689 --> 00:30:35,687
since you had this high level
breach with the president,

722
00:30:35,687 --> 00:30:37,822
and then you have it
going to the military,

723
00:30:37,823 --> 00:30:39,982
how forthcoming were
the various departments

724
00:30:39,982 --> 00:30:44,139
that handle those key
security problems in Ecuador

725
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,260
cooperating with you,

726
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,140
especially once you
were able to show, hey,

727
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,540
the camera is showing pictures.

728
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,373
- Yeah.

729
00:30:50,264 --> 00:30:53,231
- Again, Latin America, it's
about people, it's humans.

730
00:30:53,231 --> 00:30:54,140
It's talking.

731
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,883
You have your connections.

732
00:30:55,883 --> 00:30:57,577
You just speak to the people

733
00:30:57,577 --> 00:30:59,511
who say you got hacked, you see?

734
00:30:59,511 --> 00:31:03,464
And then, and they also
share with you like, oh,

735
00:31:03,464 --> 00:31:06,431
now I know why, like that day,

736
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:10,263
that month, they did do
like stupidity against,

737
00:31:10,263 --> 00:31:14,394
like, oh, okay, we got
the, you know, the reason.

738
00:31:14,394 --> 00:31:17,840
So yeah, it's basically
always like, you know, just --

739
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,428
- Yeah and it also that,

740
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:21,748
that case of the camera,
that was publicly accessible.

741
00:31:21,748 --> 00:31:24,360
So we had that MITRE ATT&CK router

742
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,290
with the full credentials
but we didn't log in.

743
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:29,600
Just by using the same
IP and a different port,

744
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,179
it was just, you know,

745
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,320
the battalion of Ecuador

746
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,929
having their monitoring system
wide open for the internet,

747
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,260
that's not cool as well.

748
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,430
So of course we will
inform them. (chuckles)

749
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,361
- Yesterday we had Aspetta,
today Pesco, thank you so much.

750
00:31:42,361 --> 00:31:43,400
(group laughs)

751
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,233
- Thank you, too.

752
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:45,066
Thank you very much.

753
00:31:45,066 --> 00:31:48,228
(audience applauding)
