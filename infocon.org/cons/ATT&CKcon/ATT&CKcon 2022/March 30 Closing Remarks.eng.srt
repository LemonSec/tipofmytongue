1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,880
and so now we're coming to the end

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,880
and so i'm going to invite uh kat to

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,560
come up and join us on the stage as well

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,880
she's coming from her couch

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,160
and jamie was wondering if you could

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,680
kick us off talking a little bit about

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,800
what you saw today

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,880
mike's actually on um notes again sorry

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,719
so i think we started off with a lot of

10
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,040
really great you know highlights and

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,040
coverage of you know looking back at the

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,640
apt playbooks from latin america

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,640
starting with that adversary is a real

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,399
people defenders are real people there's

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,120
a huge human factor in you know anything

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,800
we're doing in this space so you know

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,000
more than anything and you know these

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,120
problems aren't going to be binary

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,239
they're not going to be something that

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,239
we can just you know whether it's attack

21
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,399
or in another framework or any technical

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,239
solution we're not just going to you

23
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,239
know as cat said so gracefully we're not

24
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,760
just going to be done it's going to be

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,440
something that over time you know and i

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,520
love the the later talks about more

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,920
diving into detection and analytics you

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,920
know from snap attack and in red canary

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,720
it's going to be something that we're

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,920
going to need to measure we're going to

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,920
need to validate we're going to need to

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,920
you know know the status of it it's not

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,080
something that as much as i would love

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,520
you know just to say you know we've

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,960
solved the problem we've you know won

36
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,400
the war it's gonna be something that

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,840
really is gonna be a day-to-day problem

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,159
so connecting those two ideas you know

39
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,320
we really need to not only you know

40
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,280
respect and kind of take a heed of the

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,040
long-term horizon and the goals and

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,880
really be able to kind of set realistic

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,119
expectations but take care of the people

44
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,640
because the people that are solving your

45
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,479
problems you know they're waking up day

46
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,799
in and day out a lot of really i'm you

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,960
know i think about haley's talk a lot of

48
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,399
risk a lot of things we're gonna need to

49
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,479
measure so making sure you know we are

50
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,799
absolutely a community and that you know

51
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,040
we're not uh we're factoring in the

52
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,680
technology the process but also the

53
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,439
people and final thought you know and

54
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,680
this is one of my biggest uh you know

55
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,119
anytime i brief attack to a new

56
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,119
community uh getting back to yesterday's

57
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,880
big theme of stories

58
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,759
um

59
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,759
the best one of my favorite things about

60
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,479
attack is the ability to tell almost any

61
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,399
story you know think about you know some

62
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,840
of the domains we have whether it's

63
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,280
enterprise mac os linux ics mobile

64
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,360
looking at social engineering looking at

65
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,280
you know clouds and containers whatever

66
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,480
it may be

67
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,400
you know name your favorite i think uh

68
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
forgot who said it but actually otis

69
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,800
attack for blank you know uh please you

70
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
know respect our uh our trademark and

71
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,560
our patents and such

72
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,160
please do not actually call it attack

73
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,280
for blank

74
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,239
said

75
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,840
the paradigm of understanding your

76
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,599
adversary understanding their behaviors

77
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,519
and really codifying that into the

78
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,080
tactics you know why what goal they're

79
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,080
trying to achieve the techniques how are

80
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,760
they going to do that procedures what

81
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,360
are they actually going to do that is

82
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,680
pretty universal so as we you know i

83
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,640

modeling you know from tim and others

86
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,360
it's you know we really need to

87
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,840
understand our threats how that applies

88
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,760

of the conference

263
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,040
and i think was part of talking us into

264
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,640
doing the conference in the first place

265
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,760

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,440
real little insurers you know we're

267
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,600

268
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,120
really our thing

269
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,519

270
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,440
together it's been great to do this past

00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,080
[Applause]

280
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,800
for my own team who stepped up after

281
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,360
some staff losses to take on a bunch of

282
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,680
roles she had no intent of doing when

283
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,760
she started her weeks into her

284
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,880
employment

285
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,360

286
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,680
making us help look good and do this

event

288
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,240
so with that i can think of no better

289
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,000
way to end this conference than to give

290
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,240

291
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,160
