1
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,040
so our final speakers of the day

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,760
so i was a bit worried when marcus lefer

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,080
and ryan kovar from splunk

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,840
were the first speakers at attack con to

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,640
ask me for a photo

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,640
so many of us are painfully aware of the

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,240
problem of extracting attack techniques

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,920
from prose reporting we do it on our own

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,679
threat intel team

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,680
we've we've done research into it

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,760
ourselves in the past

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,200
and so we're really interested in these

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,559
problems as much as we'd love to

14
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,399
convince everyone to share using

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,480
structured formats like sticks

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,399
it's not the reality today

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,760
so looking forward to hearing about a

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,079
new open source tool that might make

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,800
cyber a little less hard

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,120
so please welcome the stage ryan and

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,160
marcus

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,600
thank you adam

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,039
[Applause]

24
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,399
see i think you have to stay they said

25
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,920
you have to stand there

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,000
yes boss yes

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,040
okay so we were asked to be the closers

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,920
today

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,439
and adam begged me to sing a song i'm

30
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,840
not going to do it this

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,200
time maybe later we'll see what happens

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,280
for tonight uh but first before we go

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,200
any further this is a phenomenal venue

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,640
this is the first in real life

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,320
conference i've been to since the end of

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,920
the world occurred so i'd like everyone

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,000
stand up for a second come on up up up

38

so uh we have a wonderful talk today

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,920
automating them and

51
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,759
automating them and day to day

52
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,640
mundanity of technique ids with attack

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,320
detections collector so i've known

54
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,759
marcus for 20 years i had a speech

55
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,680
impediments child he intentionally

56
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,439
chooses to give me talk titles that i

57
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,200
cannot say out loud

58
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
so thank you marcus my pleasure let's

59
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,360
see if this works boom i would actually

60
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,800
call this talk why is so cyber so hard

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,520
thank you adam

62
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,360
my name is ryan kovar i've been a splunk

63
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,959
for seven years but before that i had a

64
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,440
real job for about 20. i've done network

65
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,840
defense all over the world mostly in dod

66
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,800
and darpa um

67
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,560
what else have i done things that's

68
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,080
really all i have done but most

69
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,920
importantly recently i have taken over a

70
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,160
small strategic cyber security research

71
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,360
team at splunk which i now happily lead

72
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,599
and i am marcus lofferrer i've been with

73
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,000
splunk for about two years now most of

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,680
my career before this was supporting the

75
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,239
dod or darpa in one way or another

76
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,840
i love to open source things so you'll

77
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,680
see a lot of my code out there

78
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,200
what we're talking about today is one of

79
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,080
them

80
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,319
and really i spend most of my time

81
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,840
outside of coding watching ryan trying

82
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,599
to print something he has actually

83
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,200
broken my printer for the last four

84
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,720
months i have not been able to fix it

85
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,239
highlight of my career

86
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,760
so i first got introduced to attack back

87
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
when it was really mostly on

88
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,720
multi-colored wires and government

89
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,200
skiffs but my first formal introduction

90
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,440
was with andy applebaum and it was at a

91
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,840
secret squirrel conference here in dc it

92
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,360
was a really good time i was super

93
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,720
enthused by and i said wow this is

94
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,400
something our customers and people i

95
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,560
visit all over the world can really use

96
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,319
i want more information and i've kind of

97
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,959
been into attack ever since then

98
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,560
uh you can see the little note there i

99
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,920
assume that was from the incredibly

100
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,440
successful talk that andy gave in 2016

101
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,440
and then life has really just taken off

102
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,400
for attack

103
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
why do i bring this up selena talked

104
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,000
about it in the keynote this morning the

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,760
thing that i find most fascinating about

106
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,760
attack is not the nerd part but it gives

107
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,760
us a common taxonomy to really talk

108
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,720
about

109
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,319
basically threat intelligence and that's

110
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,680
the dirty secret

111
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,280
a lot of people just look at attack as a

112
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,200
way to do sock operations and detections

113
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,720
but it really is a former life way to

114
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,400
talk about threat intelligence which i

115
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,640
love and that has taken off especially

116
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,840
with vendors

117
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,200
and i think if you look at the number of

118
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,560
speakers today we are very well

119
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,959
represented frankly so here's a good

120
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,040
example we have palo alto we have

121
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,200
sentinel we have splunk and we're all

122
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,680
using mitre attack ttps to map to our

123
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,680
detections and content why because it

124
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,680
makes it so much easier to talk about

125
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,920
what we do and provide value back and

126
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,599
forth and we're not trying to explain

127
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,759
things it's just so much better and so

128
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,199
much easier

129
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,880
katie nichols and i talked about this a

130
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,880
couple years ago at blackhead and the

131
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,400
big thing we talked about there was this

132
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,120
provided a taxonomy for the ciso to the

133
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,720
red teamer to the blue team or to the

134
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,400
purple team or to the yellow teamer to

135
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,000
any sort of color teamer you want to

136
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,639
have and it really gave this way for us

137
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,560
to speak and it hasn't really happened

138
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,320
before

139
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,320
those ttps man sometimes they're hard to

140
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,639
get to they are buried right

141
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,479
like when i look at these

142
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,160
eventually

143
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,160
this is a report from sissa wonderful

144
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,000
piece of prose once again selena kind of

145
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,400
referred to this earlier today

146
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,720
it's all in there but like except for

147
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
like six people in this room maybe seven

148
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,120
i don't know if blake is still here like

149
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,720
i'm not gonna remember off the top of my

150
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,800
head what

151
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,320
t1505.003 is anyone off the top who

152
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,199
isn't from mitre

153
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,280
anyone from mitre

154
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,880
okay

155
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,560
okay

156
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,639
give that guy a raise

157
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,360
one person out of the 490 who are still

158
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,120
in the room

159
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,160
yeah you guys get my joke so that's not

160
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,759
really helpful right it's helpful for us

161
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,120
to go back through later but short of

162
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,320
clicking that link i'm not really

163
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,240
getting the information i need

164
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,080
i love this new methodology that people

165
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,680
are doing very similar if you're in the

166
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,280
government world to a terror line at the

167
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,720
bottom where you've made unclassified

168
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,960
indicators now people are making a table

169
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,639
of the indicators or in this case the

170
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,039
ttps tactic and technique but now it's

171
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,720
disassociated from everything and i

172
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,400
still have to cut and paste i'm still

173
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
having problems

174
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,600
this little thing called solarwinds

175
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,720
happened you might have heard of it it

176
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,560
was a little bit of a big deal why am i

177
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,960
talking about this there were a lot of

178
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,120
reports that were created very quickly

179
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,639
from a lot of vendors and governments

180
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,039
fire eye microsoft sysa all sorts of

181
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,039
people and i was desperately trying to

182
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,400
work one of the things that my team at

183
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,240
search does is allow the raptor response

184
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,080
for splunk for the first out the gate we

185
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,520
try to get a blog out with as much

186
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,199
information as we have as fast as

187
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,120
possible so i'm frantically going

188
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,560
through all these reports i'm cutting

189
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,160
and pasting i'm putting into an excel

190
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,759
spreadsheet i'm trying to get this

191
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,919
through we write a blog i'm mapping it

192
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,400
through and i create a super super duper

193
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,319
useful

194
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,680
869 page pdf

195
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,520
to the three people who downloaded it

196
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,720
thank you

197
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,639
but that's really not good enough and

198
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,720
now i'm lazy and i just said i'm just

199
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,479
going to hire this guy to go make this

200
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,720
better for me so i did there's got to be

201
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,639
a better way right

202
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,880
let's see

203
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,639
and there is we'd like to introduce you

204
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,120
to attack detections collector uh we've

205
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
open sourced it a few months ago but

206
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,400
we've been using it on the team for a

207
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
little bit over a year now

208
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,680
um

209
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,560
is it we designed it to help simplify a

210
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,120
lot of our processes for producing the

211
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,280
detections that we have and mapping it

212
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,680
to attack techniques and really it was

213
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,400
meant to save ryan about six hours of

214
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,560
copying and pasting as much as i enjoyed

215
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,720
watching that

216
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,160
i do want to highlight this is open

217
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,560
source apache 2o license ready to go

218
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,639
anyone can use it today a lot of our

219
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,160
examples are obviously going to be

220
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,240
splunk focus because we work there and

221
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,400
that's what we're producing this content

222
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,560
for however it's a python library it's

223
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,199
really simple it's extremely portable

224
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,880
and if you have a dev on your team or

225
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,880
you want to use it in your own pipeline

226
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,039
it's readily available to to do that

227
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,039
outside of splunk content as well

228
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,400
there we go

229
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,319
installing it super simple clone the

230
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,599
repo go ahead and install the

231
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,800
requirements and you're pretty much

232
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,120
ready to go there's not much else to it

233
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,199
once you run it you can do it in a

234
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,479
couple of different ways if you know

235
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,800
what techniques you want to

236
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,720
find detections for go ahead and put

237
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,039
them in there in the command line one at

238
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,080
a time

239
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,160
several of them it's up to you

240
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,560
or in most cases the way we end up using

241
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,720
it if there's a vendor report or a sisa

242
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,960
alert or something like that whereas

243
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,879
ryan highlighted earlier those attack

244
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,960
techniques are everywhere

245
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,720
uh all you have to do is throw the url

246
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,759
in there

247
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,599
edc will automatically go ahead and

248
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,520
automatically scrape all those attack

249
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,240
techniques and go ahead and map those to

250
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,680
your detections

251
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,759
in both cases the output is going to be

252
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,800
an html table which this is about as

253
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,720
pretty as i can make it as ryan will

254
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,039
attest i don't do pretty ui i do pretty

255
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,360
code

256
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,280
that's all pepe

257
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,880
yeah

258
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,958
uh and as you can see we have a few

259
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,200
columns here uh we have the attack

260
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,440
technique the title for it and on the

261
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,640
right hand side we have all the

262
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,760
detections that map to that technique

263
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,680
if you click on any one of them it'll

264
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,440
take you to a link that has additional

265
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,640
context

266
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,240
so you can get a better understanding of

267
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,160
what that detection is

268
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,160
and probably some background on it as

269
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,040
well

270
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,680
if attack navigator is more your speed

271
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,360
that's fine too it can output into a

272
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,800
nice pretty json file that you can

273
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,360
import into attack navigator and you're

274
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,640
pretty much set

275
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,880
uh this is obviously

276
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,399
the colors are gradient

277
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,399
so the lighter the color uh the less

278
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,080
detections the dark color the more

279
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,920
detection i love this example this is

280
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,519
actually from like three weeks ago we

281
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,880
had a whole bunch of people ask us like

282
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,040
oh man all this reporting just came out

283
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,440
from cisa like what are the ttps for

284
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,519
russian adversaries about ukraine and we

285
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,040
said oh well that's easy literally i

286
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,320
point this towards three different

287
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,120
postings by cisa output this get a nice

288
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,279
little json level and of course we use

289
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,519
blue because we like to make sure that

290
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,120
everyone can read this even if they're

291
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,519
colorblind and also uh katy and i talked

292
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,279
about this in our talk i think olaf you

293
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,360
talk about this by not using red and

294
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,440
green you don't create biases about good

295
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,760
and bad this is just more or less so i

296
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,680
can't recommend that enough to just use

297
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,279
concentration of colors rather than

298
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,720
colors that have meanings the majority

299
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,080
of people or it's discriminatory

300
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,000
uh and if you highlight over any of

301
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
these you'll see a complete listing as

302
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,680
well of all the detections that are

303
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,760
available in a url where again you can

304
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,160
get more context

305
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,240
it's extremely portable like i said

306
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,920
so if you want to use this in jupiter

307
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,800
notebooks or google cloud or whatever

308
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,680
other python visual visualization

309
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,279
tool you want to use you can go ahead

310
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,079
and import it super simple to do

311
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,320
this is actually how our team uses it

312
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,240
that way everyone on the team has access

313
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,600
to it we don't have to worry about them

314
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,440
setting up an environment or them

315
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,360
knowing how to use python or installing

316
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,360
python or anything else

317
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,120
so those are the that are less command

318
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,279
line savvy or python savvy this is a

319
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,040
great way to do it so we just have our

320
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,320
team go ahead

321
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,800
put in the url or the technique ids and

322
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,480
spit out the table and then we can go

323
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,760
ahead and use it how we need to

324
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,920
which made my life much easier so we've

325
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,440
been using this pretty actively since i

326
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,760
think about july uh i went from about

327
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,360
four or five hours to get all that data

328
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,120
out and formated and reviewed to about

329
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,440
35 seconds which paid for marcus's

330
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,760
salary for about five minutes

331
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,279
good investment by me that's how i

332
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,160
figure it um what i love about this is

333
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,600
yeah we're using it for splunk that's

334
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,440
who pays for most of my clothing

335
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,040
but this is useful for anyone who just

336
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,880
wants to extract that text out if you

337
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,720
use a different vendor for the repo make

338
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,399
it work for you that's all cool that's

339
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,320
what we're here for but it really

340
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,959
provides the input that i need from just

341
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,160
the things that i'm trying to pull out

342
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,560
to improve my protections detections and

343
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,079
if i go back to haley's talk from

344
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,600
earlier today like we need that

345
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,760
information faster better more gooder

346
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,519
this gets it to me in a nice well it's

347
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,519
not a nice table but it's a table

348
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,320
work

349
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,839
so

350
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,760
yeah in a couple of other uses cases

351
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,079
we've used it for outside of the obvious

352
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,079
blogging is to be able to get a better

353
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,519
understanding of some adversarial

354
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,600
capabilities so we can kind of map that

355
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
to future research or future projects

356
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,480
that we want to focus on as well

357
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,160
so with that that's all we have we

358
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,200
didn't want to take up all the time

359
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,800
because we're in between you and alcohol

360
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,480
and for the user at home i hope you

361
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,079
already started drinking frankly so

362
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,399
thank you

363
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,519
very generous of you and unfortunately

364
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,959
i'm the last one between us and the

365
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,519
alcohol so i'll steal that uh that badge

366
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,920
of glory from you um i also have to

367
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,760
admit you just happened to collide to

368
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,839
the handful of tids i actually memorized

369
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,360
so thank you i know my mom is watching

370
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,760
as well and she'll be very proud

371
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,240
buy me the drink

372
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,600
we have a couple minutes for questions

373
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,360
obviously um you know we're wrapping up

374
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,360
here but oh right in the front

375
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,760
first of all

376
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,040
um

377
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,959
given the advice for people who have

378
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,240
rules that are already at an

379
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,480
organization

380
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,079
whether it's pulling in a lookup table

381
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,959
of the existing rules

382
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,800
so just to repeat for the live audience

383
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,399
the question was you know obviously

384
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,000
first off a big thank you for open

385
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,839
sourcing and really being a you know a

386
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,040
strong member of this community and kind

387
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,800
of leading the way but the question of

388
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,040
the essence was how do you for someone

389
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,560
already has a rule set and already has

390
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,240
done a lot of this off the side how do

391
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,519
they integrate their work with your

392
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,760
product maybe you know chart to achieve

393
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,079
that one plus one equals three effect

394
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,040
so

395
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,040
it's if you if you have the data and you

396
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,800
have the detections already mapped to

397
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,079
techniques um so long as it's in a

398
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,200
enterprise security analytics story yaml

399
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,680
format it'll it'll read the file you

400
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,279
just basically have to tell it where

401
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,040
that that content is

402
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,160
if it isn't it it's a pretty easy way to

403
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,399
be able to map your own data so again so

404
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:31,839
long as that mapping is already done on

405
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:32,880
your part

406
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,399
it should be pretty easy to map that

407
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,200
data to the technique ids so all the

408
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,199
script is essentially doing is going out

409
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,199
finding the technique ids and then

410
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,880
pulling down the the

411
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,920
enterprise

412
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,160
json file and then finding the

413
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,079
detections and packaging it up for you

414
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,000
and it pains me to say this but marcus's

415
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,440
code is usually pretty easy to reverse

416
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,040
engineer to expand that functionality

417
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,480
it's not going to be buried i learned

418
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,440
from ryan because he doesn't code so

419
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,959
now i hire people to do who's the idiot

420
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,800
i saw a couple other hands come up i

421
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,160
think we have time for maybe one more

422
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,719
oh over here

423
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,680
so just to repeat for the audience um in

424
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,880
terms of that enrichment and kind of

425
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,440
providing that output um some of you

426
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,880
know an input or a prerequisite

427
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,480
something like data sources how easy

428
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,320
would it be to kind of correlate that

429
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,160
you know not just in you know in general

430
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,800
but also for per organization like you

431
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,079
know could they integrate kind of their

432
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,959
needs and their particular kind of um i

433
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,959
guess prerequisites we'll call them yeah

434
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,800
so right now that is definitely not

435
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,920
something that is that's in it um but it

436
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,000
it should be pretty easy to add

437
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
especially if you wanted to extend it on

438
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,440
on your own for your kind of your own

439
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,120
formatted data

440
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,800
all it does is it pulls that data in and

441
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,040
puts it into a table so if the data is

442
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,720
there with the detection and the

443
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,320
technique id

444
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,800
just add another field for the uh the

445
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,639
actual content or data sources that you

446
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,040
need and you can add it to the to the

447
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,880
output so that should be pretty simple a

448
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,920
great pr that's what i'm hearing yep

449
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,199
absolutely

450
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,480
um we can take one more question i think

451
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,440
we're coming on time but yeah um

452
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,839
um so the question was will it only pull

453
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,560
techniques based on the tids or also

454
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,320
kind of parse for names or other kind of

455
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,240
nuances that might identify a technique

456
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,720
yeah it's just the tids it is a regex

457
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,360
that ryan absolutely did not write no

458
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,440
not my capabilities and yeah it's just a

459
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,199
regex that searches for the tids

460
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,880
excellent thank you thank you and thank

461
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,800
you for your photo yeah i had a lot of

462
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,000
fun there you go thanks guys
