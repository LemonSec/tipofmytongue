1
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,740
- So next up and our final
talk, before we go to break

2
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,360
and cat's couch

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,720
gonna have our attack for
industrial control systems lead,

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,410
just Alexander give you our first update,

5
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,410
attack update of the day

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,640
on attack for ICS.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,440
Big green button.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,450
- My name is Otis Alexander.

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,200
I've worked at MITRE since 2014.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,900
I've been really lucky to focus on

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,670
industrial control systems, security,

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,870
cyber physical security,

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,970
the whole time.

14
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,269
I feel like the area is really important.

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,660
I'm passionate about it,

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,760
and I think it's important
to all of us as well.

17
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,620
So I'm the co-founder and
lead of ATT&CK for ICS.

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,440
And I'll be given a little update about,

19
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,030
you know, where

20
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,320
what we've done since release and recently

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,290
but also what's in the
pipeline, what's to come,

22
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:06,760
what you can expect from ATT&CK for ICS.

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,130
So just as background

24
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,110
for people who aren't
familiar with ATT&CK for ICS

25
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,040
or ATT&CK for industrial control systems.

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,450
We released it in January, 2020,

27
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,799
right before chaos ensued in the world.

28
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:21,840
So,

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,840
you know,

30
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,960
I like to say that it's really nice to see

31
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,279
all your guys' faces
cause I've been speaking

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,729
to screens for a long time.

33
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:32,090
So it's nice to be here
with all of you guys.

34
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,130
What we focus on with
ATT&CK for ICS is really

35
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,298
impacts to industrial control systems

36
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,310
and what adversaries are doing to

37
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,700
impact these systems.

38
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,310
So industrial control systems
can be found in all kinds of

39
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,310
critical infrastructure.

40
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,350
It could be energy,

41
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,399
whether it's generation, transmission,

42
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,930
distribution, manufacturing,

43
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,369
water, waste water treatment.

44
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,299
Those are all in critical infrastructure

45
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:03,780
and things that we focus on.

46
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,170
And in terms of impacts

47
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,789
it's not just the loss of
availability to these systems.

48
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:09,789
It's not just

49
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,420
monetary impacts.

50
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,109
The business is really what

51
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,890
happens to human life, how it affects us,

52
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,238
how it affects the environment.

53
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,239
So,

54
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,590
In this room, how many people
were affected by the colonial

55
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,180
pipeline incident?

56
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,180
Anybody?

57
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,230
Not many people from Virginia area here?

58
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,230
(laughs)

59
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,190
So, you know, a lot of people
experienced long lines.

60
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:42,319
They experienced seeing
people panic buying gas.

61
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,230
They also experience gas
stations that were just

62
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,230
out of service, completely.

63
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,929
So that really

64
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,349
teaches us something about this attack.

65
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:56,629
You know, it was an indirect
impact to this system.

66
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:58,329
And you know, really
when we think about it,

67
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,640
how many people really understand

68
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,238
the infrastructure that brings us

69
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,880
some of our most basic services?

70
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,659
How many of us really understand
it at a granular level?

71
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:09,100
Not many people.

72
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,930
So let's switch this to the adversary.

73
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,230
Do you think they understood
the underlying system

74
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,720
and the impacts, the dependencies

75
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,740
between the systems that
they were affecting?

76
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,220
Do you think that they understood

77
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,489
the incident response plans
for colonial pipeline?

78
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:25,709
I see some head shaking.

79
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:27,430
No, I agree with that.

80
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,720
I, I think

81
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,310
that colonial checked boxes for them.

82
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,870
It was

83
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,959
a well known company.

84
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,150
It had the money,

85
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,689
they had access to it and

86
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:40,420
they knew that they would pay out.

87
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,480
So some of these things may have been just

88
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,760
indirect consequences of this attack.

89
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,760
Who knows?

90
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,109
What I do know is that
there's a growing trend

91
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,180
of ransomware impact in ICS operations

92
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,930
and likewise commodity malware.

93
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:56,930
And that's something that

94
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,519
we've had a real focus
on in ATT&CK for ICS.

95
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:03,660
It's a big trend right now.

96
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,359
So how many of you guys have a backup plan

97
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,030
if you don't trust your

98
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,450
water coming out your tap?

99
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,769
You have a backup plan, you got filters?

100
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:14,770
Creek.

101
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,180
What about if there's no water coming out?

102
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,870
So that's kind of the risk that were

103
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,329
brought to light

104
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,690
with

105
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,900
the Olds mar incident.

106
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,969
Risks to water and waste water systems.

107
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,830
And you know, this is preventable.

108
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,982
It's unsecure connection
for remote access.

109
00:04:30,982 --> 00:04:34,990
Remote access is used ubiquitous

110
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,570
throughout these industries
to manage remote systems

111
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,080
but this one was unsecure and
it allowed an adversary to get

112
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,000
in and change particular parameters

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,470
in the system.

114
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,790
So there's a huge focus here

115
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:51,940
on importance of safety, resilience,

116
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,550
can systems step in and stop

117
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,550
some of these parameters

118
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,460
from going down and propagating
through the system ?

119
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,349
Also kudos to the operator.

120
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,860
He was looking at the system,
he saw something wrong

121
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,550
and he changed

122
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,000
the thing back to,

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,970
to prevent something from happening bad.

124
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,310
So these are the type of
incidents that we look at.

125
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,470
I just brought up someones

126
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,180
that are recent,

127
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:20,690
that affected US because I
think they all resonate with us.

128
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,280
So since the last time we talked, I

129
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,849
I don't know when it's been,

130
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:29,770
if it's been since released or ATT&CKcon

131
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,030
another ATT&CKcon.

132
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,820
We've had a lot of updates to

133
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,310
ATT&CK for ICS, such as technique updates.

134
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,670
Of course, you know, there's
different things happening

135
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,160
in the world across the world.

136
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,190
We keep track of those.

137
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,980
But also something I'm excited about

138
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,500
is mitigation objects that
we've mapped to each technique.

139
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,940
So these really talk
about how you can prevent

140
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,969
or slow down some things

141
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,960
or risks that may affect the system.

142
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,719
We've also mapped these
mitigation objects to

143
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,980
security controls NIST 800-53

144
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,250
and the international standard IEC 62443

145
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,690
which is well known in the

146
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,620
industrial control system community.

147
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,330
So basically what this helps us to see is

148
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,359
how security controls can prevent

149
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,350
certain techniques from being executed.

150
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,220
Another important thing is

151
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,450
the ATT&CK for ICS Stix bundle.

152
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,159
This has been crucial
for integration purposes.

153
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,680
It allows us to integrate
with all the services that

154
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
are available

155
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,120
in the ATT&CK ecosystem,
which has been very beneficial

156
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,720
especially tools like ATT&CK navigator.

157
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
And last

158
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,760
we

159
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,760
mapped

160
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,020
specific ICS attacks

161
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,049
that were relevant

162
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,900
to enterprise ATT&CK.

163
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,049
So that you get the holistic view

164
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,320
of the attack or life cycle

165
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,750
as they move through enterprise systems

166
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,710
or traditional IT systems

167
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:57,780
to either target ICS or to impact ICS.

168
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,679
So this is kind of bittersweet for me

169
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,620
but we have something coming in April.

170
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,310
We're gonna transition
away from the Wiki site.

171
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,610
I'm sure some of the people

172
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,470
in the community are
really happy about this.

173
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,470
It's bittersweet to me

174
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,470
because this is kind of our
experimentation grounds.

175
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,890
It's allowed us to mature.

176
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:21,469
It allowed us to experiment
with different use cases

177
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,760
and see what worked, but I'm very happy

178
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,930
that we're moving to attack that mitre.org

179
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:29,930
get everything

180
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,260
in the same domain.

181
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,940
The users in the community can

182
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,020
take advantage of all
the different features

183
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,520
that are provided

184
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,780
and you get a holistic view
of all the technology domain.

185
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,150
So this is a really good thing.

186
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,599
So what's in the horizon,
what's in our pipeline.

187
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,330
What are we doing in the background?

188
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,340
What can you expect in the future?

189
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,869
Well, first we want to do an asset revamp

190
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,310
based on ICS verticals.

191
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,810
So

192
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,620
what we hear from a lot of people

193
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,200
is what about ATT&CK for X?

194
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,060
I got the best idea, right?

195
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,440
So ATT&CK for

196
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,690
renewable,

197
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:13,980
ATT&CK for transportation,
ATT&CK for maritime, right?

198
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,270
This is an important question, right?

199
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,000
Because there are threats
to these different verticals

200
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,830
but a lot of times we
don't have the incident

201
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,900
data really to back something like that up

202
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,239
nor do I think that is what some

203
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,240
of the people in ATT&CK want to do.

204
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,410
But if you look under the hood

205
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,929
on some of these attacks

206
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,640
or some of these verticals

207
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,610
the assets are similar to
what we already have in ICS.

208
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,549
They may be named a different thing

209
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:45,089
but essentially it's the same asset

210
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,820
with the same functionality.

211
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,600
So we really want to tease that out.

212
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,170
So our question to the community is

213
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,360
what do you call your cyber
assets in your vertical?

214
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
Let us know.

215
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,910
Because that'll help us be able to map

216
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,719
two techniques that are relevant

217
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,650
and give you the cases, showing that

218
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,439
these techniques are relevant
to your environment too.

219
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,560
And another thing I'm excited
about is ICS detections.

220
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,650
So that's one thing
that's missing right now.

221
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,850
And we plan to

222
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,700
work on detection strategies

223
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,890
and adding them to each technique.

224
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,960
And

225
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,270
last August,

226
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,620
we

227
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,340
released our results from the first round

228
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,780
of ATT&CK Engenuity

229
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,430
or MITRE Engenuity ATT&CK
evaluations for ICS.

230
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:32,800
And we focused on the
Triton malware ATT&CK and

231
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,380
against a petrochemical
company in Saudi Arabia.

232
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,300
And we had five vendors that participated

233
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,170
and we got to see how they detect these

234
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,150
techniques being emulated.

235
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,410
And we also saw what
detection contacts they gave.

236
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,630
So this was very important
and insightful for us.

237
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,830
Also, we got to see a diverse set

238
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:00,090
of data sources that
could be potentially used

239
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,570
to detect some of these attacks.

240
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,300
So data sources from ICS applications

241
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,430
and operational databases.

242
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,560
So we're gonna use the insights from this

243
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,099
plus the insights from
us working in the lab

244
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,630
and any contributions
to provide detections

245
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,130
for each technique.

246
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,130
By the way, thank you to Armas clarity

247
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,520
Dragos III and Microsoft

248
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,910
for really participating
in this during COVID.

249
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,120
I know it was hard.

250
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,520
So last we want to release a blog series

251
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,840
on technique sequences.

252
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,590
So we've had some
interesting interpretations

253
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,380
of techniques and ATT&CK for ICS

254
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,960
and I'm not gonna go into
the reasons for that.

255
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,010
But what we think is we can create more

256
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,460
communication

257
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,420
around what techniques
mean, how they fit together,

258
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,890
where the sequences,
preconditions, post-condition

259
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,562
for various use cases in ICS?

260
00:10:54,562 --> 00:10:56,960
And we think that would be important.

261
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,320
So we really wanna release
this blog post series

262
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,210
to get some talk around this subject area.

263
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:08,990
So always feel free to reach out,

264
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:09,990
feedback,

265
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,990
comments,

266
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,240
especially the things that
we're mentioning on the horizon.

267
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,300
We're always looking for
feedback here to incorporate it.

268
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,599
Thank you.

269
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
(applaud)

270
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,840
- [Man] Time for questions.

271
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,140
- Excellent presentation.

272
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,750
And you know, even while
listening to you speak

273
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,930
I was looking around the room
and you know, I see power

274
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,189
I see water, I see HVAC.

275
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,290
And I'm like, just like
the insider thread,

276
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,750
it's starting to resonate
and really, you know,

277
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,730
this problem starting to
ferment as something that

278
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,430
really needs to be at the top of our mind.

279
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,141
So thank you for your, all
the work you've done and

280
00:11:39,141 --> 00:11:40,740
for your team.

281
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,680
We had a great question online

282
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,650
but I wanted to, you might
hear that at the couch.

283
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,650
So I wanted to see

284
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,750
if anyone from the audience
had anything upfront?

285
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:56,950
- [Person Fro Audience] Yeah.
In the mapping to 353-643

286
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,785
was there a consideration for 882?

287
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:00,785
The overlay for 53

288
00:12:00,785 --> 00:12:03,380
- There was the background for that is 53.

289
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,300
Everything that they
referenced in there is.

290
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,130
So I actually, Adam Hahn,
which is one of the authors

291
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,420
for 882, kind of headed up that.

292
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,829
So he has some background in
how they mapped everything.

293
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,830
- Question.

294
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:29,680
(Another person from
the audience speaking)

295
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:36,239
- So repeating for the live audience.

296
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,281
Sorry about the last one

297
00:12:37,281 --> 00:12:39,930
basically the question was,
there's been some, you know

298
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,949
different opinions about,
you know, the progress

299
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,010
of IC security and what's
happening in the space.

300
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,770
What have you seen in terms of adoption

301
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,680
of ATT&CK and kind of that maturity model

302
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,920
of expertise, you know,
expanding, especially the

303
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,050
the bridge of OT experts
and it experts and cyber

304
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,109
and really mushing that together.

305
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,630
- Right, Yeah. That's a lot, I
don't have all the visibility

306
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,430
but I can point to a couple of things.

307
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:05,609
So one is I work with a
lot of utilities, right?

308
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,910
So I have other sponsor
engagements that I have to fulfill

309
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,680
and you see them using
it or pointing to it.

310
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,959
So that's one thing I always
love when the asset owner

311
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,850
and operator is using or
referencing ATT&CK just period.

312
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,840
The second thing is I'm
seeing more and more mappings

313
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,140
within security tools,
which I think is great.

314
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,550
So, you know, kudos to
the security vendors

315
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:32,099
for mapping to their detections,
giving that extra context

316
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,750
to the user to understand
really adversary behavior

317
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,000
and what's being detected.

318
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,110
So I think that's one of the
biggest things that we can do

319
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,750
for adoption is getting
in the security tools.

320
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,540
- Final question, short
and sweet, my favorite

321
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,661
for all the ATT&CK presenters,
what can we do for you?

322
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,050
You know, just, you know

323
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:52,269
quick call for action for the community.

324
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:54,550
- Right. I, I, I know

325
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,170
that ICS isn't everybody's
technology domain.

326
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,180
They don't have the expertise there

327
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:02,229
but for the ones that do,
you know, help contribute,

328
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,660
give us feedback on what we're doing
