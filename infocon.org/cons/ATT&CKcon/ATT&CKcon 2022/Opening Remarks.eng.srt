(audience applauding)

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,170
- Thank you.

3
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,310
And welcome back to day two at ATT&CKcon.

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,669
So to start off and
welcome you here today,

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,383
we have MITRE's Wen Masters.

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,140
Wen Masters is MITRE's Vice President

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,510
for Cyber Technologies.

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,330
And in that role she
drives MITRE's Corporate

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,310
Cybersecurity Strategy.

10
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,879
She oversees MITRE's innovation
centers in cybersecurity,

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,630
leading a team of more than 600

12
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,430
including most of us supporting ATT&CK.

13
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,320
Before joining MITRE,

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,970
Wen was Deputy Director of Research

15
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,129
at Georgia Tech Research Institute

16
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,560
and spent more than a decade

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,370
in the Senior Executive Service

18
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,459
at the Office Naval Research.

19
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,410
We appreciate Wen supportive ATT&CK

20
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,220
and for joining us here today.

21
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,089
Please welcome to the stage Wen Masters.

22
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,257
(audience applauding)

23
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,373
- Thank you, Adam.

24
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,869
Good morning everyone?

25
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:13,740
- [Audience] Good morning.

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,740
- Yes, I feel the energy both
in the room as well as online.

27
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,750
And I have to tell you

28
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,750
this is my very first
attendance at ATT&CKcon.

29
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,650
And of course we all
know the past two years

30
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,810
with all the pandemic

31
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:39,410
and all the working from home remotely

32
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:44,410
we were not able to
hold another gathering.

33
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,623
So this is just feels so exhilarating.

34
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,520
And yesterday I spent some time

35
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,510
meeting with many of you

36
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,643
and of course learning what you do.

37
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,402
It's just phenomenal.

38
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,269
I certainly feel the energy
and feel the inspiration.

39
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,829
Thank you so much

40
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,603
for your engagement and contribution.

41
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,140
Yesterday we all heard Adam

42
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:29,053
giving some very, very impressive stats.

43
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:35,570
So, since the initial
release of ATT&CK in 2015,

44
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:42,310
today we have grown so much

45
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,290
both in terms of the content

46
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,222
as well as in terms of the community.

47
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,840
And we have more than 300 organizations

48
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,810
and individuals contributing to ATT&CK.

49
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,810
And this just, first, I
think, right, very phenomenal.

50
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,380
And we also heard yesterday,

51
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,380
a lot of updates and future
directions of MITRE ATT&CK,

52
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,550
and those are very
encouraging inspirational.

53
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,759
So, MITRE ATT&CK, I think
I will just say ATT&CK,

54
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,602
has always been a community driven.

55
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,800
And I think we will continue
to do that and to grow

56
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,680
and making sure this will
continue to be community driven.

57
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:46,350
We are here all doing a
very, very important work

58
00:03:49,487 --> 00:03:52,412
and having great impact.

59
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,830
So I congratulate you,

60
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:56,893
I salute you.

61
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,709
And MITRE, you heard MITRE is committed

62
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,620
to continue to work this

63
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,660
and you heard yesterday also from Adam,

64
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,490
MITRE has 40 plus people working this.

65
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,280
And of course, the community,

66
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,019
the big community is really helping us.

67
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:21,549
So we are moving this
forward all together.

68
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:26,090
So I'm really looking forward to future,

69
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,409
many, many ATT&CKcon's to come

70
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,920
and to reconnect with
you at the next event

71
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,450
and to touch base with you,

72
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:36,020
see how you're doing

73
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,460
and I'm sure you will all
be doing great, right?

74
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,460
And I look forward to see many, many more

75
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,460
creative applications of ATT&CK

76
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:54,540
as well as new content, new
capabilities within ATT&CK.

77
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,340
So thank you so much for your engagement,

78
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,803
for your contribution.

79
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,909
And have a wonderful second
day at ATT&CKcon 3.0.

80
00:05:09,563 --> 00:05:12,729
