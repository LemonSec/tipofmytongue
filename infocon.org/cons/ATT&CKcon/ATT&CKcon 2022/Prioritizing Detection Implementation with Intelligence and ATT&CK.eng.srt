1
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,810
- So, our next speakers are Lindsay Kaye

2
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,410
and Scott Small from Recorded Future.

3
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,640
So, we've often talked about
using threat intelligence

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,280
to prioritize detections,

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,410
but that isn't necessarily a small ask.

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,340
It's both hard to understand
what intelligence is important

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,950
and where to focus
resulting detection efforts.

8
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,180
Next speakers are gonna
be talking about a process

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,040
for using ATT&CK to bridge this gap

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,320
in getting ahead of Boom.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,989
So, please welcome to the
stage Lindsay and Scott.

12
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:42,099
(crowd clapping)

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:47,510
Big green button.

14
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:58,320
- Okay, hi, everybody.

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,910
I'm Lindsey Kaye, and this is Scott Small.

16
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,510
And, thank you for coming to our talk

17
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,530
on prioritizing detection implementation

18
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,550
with intelligence and ATT&CK

19
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,210
Sweet.

20
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,070
So, I'm director of operation
outcomes for Insikt Group.

21
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,009
So, I run the technical arm of
our threat intelligence team,

22
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,180
where we do the large
majority of malware analysis,

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,750
network detections, Yara segments,

24
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,230
smart development for the team.

25
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,649
So, by trade I'm a malware
analyst reverse engineer

26
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:25,280
and I was a software
engineer for many years

27
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,750
before doing this.

28
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,110
- Alright, and I'll
kind of get us started.

29
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,200
I'm Scott Small,

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,090
I'm a threat intelligence consultant

31
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,759
on Recorded Futures'
customer success team.

32
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,640
Our team engages our clients, enterprises,

33
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,840
and agencies worldwide every day

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,390
on security applications of intelligence.

35
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,250
And, I'm happy to report that MITRE ATT&CK

36
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:49,250
remains very alive and well in
the cyber threat intel space.

37
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,510
We're consistently being asked

38
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,179
for more ATT&CK mapped intelligence

39
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:55,789
and seeing more interest
in using intelligence

40
00:01:55,789 --> 00:02:00,310
to inform ATT&CK emulation
and purple teaming.

41
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,619
So, without a doubt,

42
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:07,119
as interest and focus on
TTPs continues to grow,

43
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,538
MITRE ATT&CK remains
the best lens in my view

44
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,640
for analyzing TTPs.

45
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,269
However, there are nearly 600
techniques and sub techniques

46
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,069
in the enterprise matrix,

47
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:20,170
and countless more implementations,

48
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,780
and we'll circle back to this later,

49
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,890
but we recently took a survey

50
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,518
of publicly available
detection rule repositories,

51
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:30,420
and we found nearly 10,000 of these rules

52
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,679
aligned with MITRE ATT&CK.

53
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,270
So, the need for prioritization is clear,

54
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,430
and thanks to the efforts
of this community,

55
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,129
I'm definitely seeing a shift in awareness

56
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:44,629
that intelligence should
inform that prioritization.

57
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:46,310
What we'll add today is more detail

58
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,010
about how this functions.

59
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,140
We'll give some takeaways from,

60
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,179
derived from our recent
client engagements,

61
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,250
and I'm really excited,

62
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,489
we have the opportunity to kind of debut

63
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:58,629
a new open source tool here today,

64
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:01,849
intended to help speed up identifying

65
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:05,869
and closing control gaps.

66
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,590
This theme of gaps is going to run

67
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,590
throughout our talk today.

68
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,680
So, I wanna start with
how intelligence allows us

69
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,019
to bridge gaps

70
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:14,340
and why I see intelligence teams

71
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,629
really as critical within a
security maturity journey.

72
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:22,010
Three key ways, number one,

73
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,879
intelligence teams usually
have a strong understanding

74
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,190
of the external threat environment, yes,

75
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,239
but also the unique
ATT&CK surface or profile

76
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,920
of the organizations they support,

77
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,599
what technologies or assets or processes

78
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,379
exist within their environment today,

79
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:40,510
and what transformations might be coming.

80
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,510
Number two,

81
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,388
intelligence teams
typically have knowledge

82
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,189
of both the strategic
and the tactical levels

83
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:48,170
of the threat space,

84
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,599
what adversaries exist,

85
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,238
what motivations and targets are out there

86
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,409
and how are attacks actually carried out

87
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:56,239
and defended against.

88
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,620
And, finally,

89
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,689
by maintaining that awareness of both

90
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:02,828
the external threat environment

91
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:06,499
and the internal operating
and control environments,

92
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:08,519
intel teams really are perfectly situated

93
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,999
to bridge between the offensive
and defensive disciplines

94
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:13,269
of security.

95
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:16,810
An adversarial relationship
often exists between these,

96
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,700
however, when there are
closer lines of communication

97
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,459
and tighter feedback loops,

98
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,520
we really have the opportunity

99
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,539
to achieve the quickest

100
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,390
and most measurable
improvements in security.

101
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,930
Two tools supporting these
themes are, of course,

102
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:32,930
MITRE ATT&CK,

103
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,840
whose structure really
enables us to better bridge

104
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,450
that strategic and tactical
levels of the landscape,

105
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,780
and truly our analytical brains.

106
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,929
This is...

107
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,979
The adversary is constantly innovating.

108
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:48,699
And, so we too must be able to adapt

109
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:51,400
and logically break down attack patterns

110
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,419
so we can adjust our defenses accordingly.

111
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,710
This is also a reminder that
we should continue working

112
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,460
to offload automatable security tasks

113
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,340
and leave ourselves as
much time as possible

114
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,229
for the more valuable critical
thinking and analysis work.

115
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:07,639
So, before I hand it Lindsay,

116
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:10,830
I want to cover key sources
that we use and recommend

117
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,430
for surfacing ATT&CK mapped intelligence,

118
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,910
three types of sources that
you might already be using,

119
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,889
open, close, and technical,

120
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:23,490
can all yield value for
MITRE ATT&CK alignment,

121
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,870
if you know where to look.

122
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,280
Close sources will
include your own telemetry

123
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,309
and internal reporting, sure,

124
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,840
but there also is opportunities
for aligning to MITRE ATT&CK

125
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,130
on sources like restricted access forums.

126
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,630
So, Lindsay's gonna cover cases

127
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:46,710
where we see actors sharing
tools on the underground,

128
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,710
but there's,

129
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,229
we also map some of our reporting

130
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:52,859
when we see actors selling
illicit network access

131
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,220
on criminal forms, for example.

132
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,600
This gives us really interesting insights

133
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,990
into access techniques, specifically.

134
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,190
Most of you are familiar
with the government

135
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,719
and vendor reporting that exists

136
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,479
and is increasingly being
aligned to MITRE ATT&CK,

137
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,539
but one of the less commonly used sources

138
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:13,740
for open source TTP intelligence
is actually social media.

139
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,850
There exists many opportunities
where security researchers

140
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,659
are publishing content

141
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:21,819
that contains either direct
references to techniques,

142
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:24,349
or in some cases, even T
code identifiers themselves.

143
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:25,909
And, you can search these platforms

144
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:27,610
for that type of content.

145
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:30,800
Finally, some of you may be
utilizing technical sources

146
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,020
that automatically map to MITRE ATT&CK,

147
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,250
things like sandboxes and
network security tools.

148
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,810
A common struggle that
I hear in this space

149
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,870
is that the same execution
or fishing related techniques

150
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,910
oftentimes consistently bubble
up within these sources.

151
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,470
So, what I recommend,

152
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,020
and we've had clients recently

153
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,190
expressing a lot of interest in,

154
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,219
is looking at the techniques

155
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,419
where we see the most monthly
or quarterly increases

156
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:00,380
in how much they're being observed.

157
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,629
This gives us a little
bit more nuanced look

158
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:05,620
at which techniques may
be trending over time.

159
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,830
The bottom line is that sourcing
from each of these areas

160
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,580
gives us the most comprehensive view

161
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,449
of the threat landscape.

162
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:15,220
Also, when we begin to
look at observations

163
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,110
from multiple of these sources,

164
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,199
we oftentimes see overlaps in techniques

165
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:22,889
and we start to see some that
have higher concentrations

166
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:23,889
than others.

167
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:26,610
This really gives us a
good foundation to focus in

168
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,629
and potentially get higher
return on investment,

169
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:32,290
if we're looking at the highly
concentrated techniques.

170
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,259
And, very finally,

171
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:35,460
just to reiterate,

172
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,409
certain of these sources inherently

173
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:40,639
will be looking retroactively at threats

174
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,139
that have already been
observed in the wild,

175
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,060
whereas other ones
really kind of enable us

176
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,270
to start strengthening controls
in a more proactive manner.

177
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,318
This is gonna be a perfect
segue to Lindsay's content,

178
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:52,960
where she's gonna cover her team's process

179
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,500
for surfacing and creating detections

180
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,139
around these truly
emerging and novel threats.

181
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:00,949
- Awesome, thank you, Scott.

182
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:04,539
So, one of the things that
our clients talk a lot about,

183
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:05,539
being worried about,

184
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:06,900
is the threat of a ransomware attack

185
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,260
and what it could do
to their organization.

186
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,680
So, for simplicity's sake,

187
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,310
I've divided the kind of four
stages of a ransomware attack

188
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,310
into these four stages.

189
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,560
So, generally ransomware attacks
are not just initial fish,

190
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,620
suddenly they're ransomware.

191
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,129
So, it generally involve
some sort of initial access.

192
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:23,930
So, how a threat actor first
gets onto the target system,

193
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,110
then, once they're on,

194
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,479
they'll do probably a
couple of different things,

195
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,729
which I'm sure you're familiar with.

196
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:30,080
So, try and move to
other systems laterally.

197
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,199
They might look for other
information they want.

198
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,690
Escalate their privileges
to get higher access.

199
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,690
Persist their attack,

200
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,849
so once they're in, making
sure they're able to stay in,

201
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:40,510
and then finally looking for other data

202
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,510
that they may be interested in.

203
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,100
Next, the data exfiltration aspect.

204
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,750
So, not every ransomware attack

205
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,580
will involve data exfiltration,

206
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,580
but for threat actors

207
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,060
who are looking to further
extort their victims

208
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,229
and provide more incentive
to pay the ransom,

209
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,330
this might be a key component.

210
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,990
And, then finally the
dropping of the ransomware.

211
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,790
So, a couple examples
of different techniques

212
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,380
that you might see at each of these stages

213
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,710
and not every ransomware attack

214
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,850
will involve all of these stages.

215
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,720
Fishing remains eternally popular

216
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,280
among many types of threat actors,

217
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,189
both state sponsored and ransomware.

218
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,790
Generally, the lures are pretty timely,

219
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,400
but we're not gonna get into that,

220
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,810
'cause I think everybody's familiar.

221
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,140
Exploits also remain pretty popular.

222
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,819
So, we're not really gonna
get into those as well.

223
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,550
But, one thing I wanna
talk a little bit about

224
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,319
is the use of stolen credentials.

225
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,400
So, there are a couple different ways

226
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,740
that actors will do this.

227
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,690
So, first they can drop some
sort of credential stealer,

228
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,490
so things like Red Line, Raccoon
Stealer, Thicker Stealer,

229
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,640
and Azuralt might be used

230
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,580
to gather victim credentials
and exfiltrate them,

231
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,580
but for threat actors

232
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,860
who maybe don't wanna do that themselves,

233
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,000
they can actually purchase
the exfiltrated logs

234
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,110
from these systems on the dark web.

235
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,130
Very similarly, there are...

236
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:47,270
If you're already on the system,

237
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,840
you can look in bash history

238
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,910
for somebody who accidentally
type their password into it,

239
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,600
private key files laying around,

240
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,980
system administrator notes,

241
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,250
or an internal application
that was developed

242
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,220
that was never supposed to
see kind of any external use,

243
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,370
but has baked in credentials

244
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:05,140
for accessing different
accounts on the system.

245
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,270
So, additionally,

246
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,600
we see people called
initial access brokers,

247
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,900
who are threat actors that
pretty much specialize

248
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,189
in selling and obtaining initial access.

249
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,320
So, couple different things here,

250
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,230
not gonna get into all details here,

251
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,160
but things to like VPN
appliances, so things like Citrix,

252
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,910
which I'm sure you're familiar with,

253
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,699
and domain access up to and
including administrator.

254
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,510
There's a whole wide variety
of different accesses

255
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,580
that they will sell,

256
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,570
and generally advertising it
as selling access of this type

257
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,320
to an organization
approximately this size of,

258
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
this value.

259
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,200
So, never like I have access
to this specific place.

260
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,270
So, that's kinda what
you're looking at here.

261
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,240
Next, moving into that second stage,

262
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,360
so Cobalt Strike deserves
a special mention here,

263
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,960
eternally popular among state-sponsored

264
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,680
and ransomware threat actors,

265
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,650
mostly because it's so full featured.

266
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,600
So, pushing and pulling of
data, running applications,

267
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,010
dropping additional tools
and aggressor scripts.

268
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,280
With further help, threat actors automate

269
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,900
a lot of these techniques,

270
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,610
make it even easier for
somebody to want to use.

271
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:02,860
Then, you might see something

272
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,340
like active directory enumeration

273
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,360
with tools like AD Fine,
Sharp Hound/Blood Hound,

274
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
further credential harvesting.

275
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,990
So, once you're already on,

276
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,430
gaining SSH access or RDP or VNC

277
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,140
to other systems on the network
can also be pretty helpful.

278
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,250
Living off the land techniques,

279
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,020
so those are those benign Windows binaries

280
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,930
that are used for malicious purposes.

281
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,520
So, something like certificate utility

282
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,650
to do second stage tool downloads,

283
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:31,220
CSC and MS Build to compile
code on disc and run it.

284
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,920
Just, those are kind of a
couple of examples there.

285
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,780
And, then finally something
like curb roasting

286
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,050
with a tool like Rubius.

287
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,209
For data exfiltration,

288
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,580
so something that ransomware threat actors

289
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,460
will sometimes use are these benign tools.

290
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,020
So, I'm sure you're familiar
with 7Zip and WIN SAP

291
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,850
for their more benign purposes.

292
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,070
So, these are just a
couple examples there.

293
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,710
And, then only then do we
get to the actual dropping

294
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,710
of that ransomware,

295
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,940
so when we talk about
different threat actors

296
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,690
like Revel, Black Matter, and Alpha,

297
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,560
generally this is what
these specific ransomware

298
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,560
kind of comes in here,

299
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,560
but, as you can see,

300
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,609
there's so many other things
that have happened before

301
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,570
and so many other opportunities
to have caught them.

302
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:07,830
So, generally, what we wanna do

303
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,630
is we try to focus our
signature development

304
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,939
as left of boom as humanly possible.

305
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,670
And, we found a lot of opportunity

306
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,410
for developing detections here

307
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,819
rather than once the
ransomware has already dropped.

308
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,570
So, our tools and TTPs team
sources their information

309
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,280
from a wide variety of sources
that's got alluded to before.

310
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,540
So, we have open source
data, closed source data,

311
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,540
and technical sources.

312
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,689
And, part of the premises, let's say,

313
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,700
threat actor shared a new C2 framework.

314
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,170
They're discussing a new credential dealer

315
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,339
that they are advertising proof
of concept for an exploit.

316
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,480
Generally, if we have access
to it on the internet,

317
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,130
so does a threat actor,

318
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,580
and they will learn from it.

319
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,210
So, you can think of things
like incident response reports,

320
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:50,110
seeing how defenders are detecting them.

321
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,670
Hey, here's a cool new C2 framework.

322
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,860
I wanna use this too.

323
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,980
And, it just lowers the bar so much

324
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,250
and makes it a little bit harder

325
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,720
to specifically attribute it.

326
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,390
And, it's kind of like
download it, use it,

327
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,470
and they see it too.

328
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,680
So, our tools and TTPs team will look

329
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,890
through this variety of sources

330
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,939
for things that we consider leads.

331
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,870
So, these are high potential
tools that look very credible.

332
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,801
So, a credible GitHub or a
credible kind of threat actor

333
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:14,130
talking about selling tools

334
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,240
or some kind of technique
that they're using,

335
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,780
and then what we do is we'll
put together a TTP note.

336
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,189
So, again, these really function as leads.

337
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,940
Maybe, it's not really
using the wild as yet,

338
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,510
but it's something that we wanna
inform our customers about.

339
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,700
They might wanna be concerned.

340
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,320
For tools that we actually
see used in the wild,

341
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,180
maybe think people are
publishing copies of it,

342
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,180
different things like that,

343
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,689
or we really feel it's a high
impact piece of software,

344
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,890
what we'll do is we'll write
an Insikt validated TTP.

345
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,910
So, these, in addition to
kind of the context behind it,

346
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,680
we'll produce a signature,

347
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,739
so Yara, Sigma, or Snort, depending,

348
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,600
maybe some combination of the three

349
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
that allows customers,

350
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,580
not only to get the context
and know what it is,

351
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,460
but then they can also detect
it in their own environment.

352
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,070
And, what we'd make sure to do

353
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,000
is we align these all to ATT&CK.

354
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,990
So, each of these types of
notes has the ATT&CK techniques

355
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,830
that it is relevant for,

356
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,870
mostly because we are an
intensely technical team.

357
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,350
And, we know that most customers

358
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,880
aren't familiar with all
the different nuances

359
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,939
between this type of
stealer or that exploit.

360
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,940
And, we really wanna provide
them that link with franca

361
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,620
between what it is that this thing does

362
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,730
and help them understand it,

363
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,160
whether or not it would be
something they wanna incorporate

364
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,790
into their defensive strategy.

365
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,790
Cool.

366
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,579
So, an interesting case study
that I wanted to highlight

367
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,720
is out of Jester Stealer.

368
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,750
So, Jesture Stealer,

369
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,030
for all intents and purposes,
is an information stealer.

370
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:44,439
So, taking information
from the victim's browser,

371
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,310
stealing passwords,
different things like that,

372
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,310
pretty run in the mill.

373
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,739
But, what we saw in August, 2021,

374
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:54,040
is a threat actor who
released this Jester Stealer

375
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,160
on the dark web.

376
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,640
And, what we did was
we produced a TTP note,

377
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,370
hey, customers, be aware of
this, something interesting,

378
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,230
nothing really indicated
it was in use as yet.

379
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,000
Then, a couple months
later in January, 2022,

380
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,570
we saw another user on social media

381
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,150
sharing a sample of the
malware on Malware Bazaar.

382
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,000
So, this started to suggest
that this was something

383
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,520
that wasn't just interesting,

384
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,500
maybe it was being used, or could be used,

385
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,460
or there was something
a little bit more to it.

386
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,080
So, what we wanted to do is publish

387
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,280
this Insikt validated TTP

388
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,439
along with a Sigma rule to
help our clients detect it,

389
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,920
now that it was more of a series threat.

390
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,449
So, here is part of the Sigma rule

391
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,300
that we made for Jester Stealer.

392
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,380
So, as you can see,

393
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,920
not only were we providing the context,

394
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,430
so explaining to clients what it is,

395
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:41,079
we are also providing this rule

396
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,400
that is also mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.

397
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,930
So, they have as much context

398
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,569
about whether or not Jester Stealer

399
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,140
could be a potential problem for them

400
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,140
in their environment.

401
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,830
And, if they wanna incorporate this rule

402
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,130
into their defensive strategy,

403
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,630
they totally can.

404
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,140
And, what was actually
kind of really validating,

405
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,140
really awesome,

406
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,580
is that about a month later,

407
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,410
another vendor who sees a
wide swath of malware samples,

408
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,579
so not just kind of the ones
that we're starting to see,

409
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,680
actually identified Jester Stealer

410
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,310
as a high priority threat,

411
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,939
so the fact that we were able to, kind of,

412
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,570
get on it as early as August,

413
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,320
and be able to provide that
detection early to our clients,

414
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,730
really did start to suggest
that our process was working.

415
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,120
I'm gonna hand it back over to Scott.

416
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,120
- Cool.

417
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,980
Alright, so in case there was any doubt

418
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,310
that these intelligence
driven detection approaches

419
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:28,540
can scale,

420
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,130
I want to illustrate some examples,

421
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,040
and see kind of how this plays
out at a wider scale for us.

422
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,569
So, what you're seeing right now

423
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:38,260
is a heat map of the top techniques

424
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,060
in the day to day reporting
from Lindsay's team,

425
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,260
over the past year.

426
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,310
So, these emerging notable
threats that we're tracking

427
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,630
on a variety of sources

428
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:49,290
and writing multiple of
these reports per day,

429
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,260
this is kind of what the top
concentrations look like.

430
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,060
We can then compare this
to the top techniques

431
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,880
in the mappings to the Sigma detections

432
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,550
that her team has also produced

433
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,939
over the same timeframe.

434
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,140
And, when we directly line these up,

435
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,730
we actually see quite a lot of
overlap in the top techniques

436
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,520
observed across these sources.

437
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,280
So, what this emphasizes is
the day to day notable threats

438
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,649
that we are analyzing,

439
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:19,059
the top ones, top 15, are
shown on the left here,

440
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:20,059
really are reflected

441
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:24,259
in our detection development
program at scale.

442
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:28,490
So, here we're seeing
the lining up of these.

443
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,360
We all have limited resources
to commit in our case

444
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,500
to developing detection rules
and probably, in your case,

445
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,740
to deploying new rules, fine tuning them,

446
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,970
adding new data sources and
maybe tweaking those sources.

447
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,190
So, it's absolutely worth being thoughtful

448
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,419
about what is driving the
allocation of those resources.

449
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:51,130
And, we clearly believe
that threat analysis

450
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:55,019
should play a key role
in this thought process.

451
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:59,559
So, I also want to, keeping
with the same heat map here,

452
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:02,460
I wanna underscore this
point about the value brought

453
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,950
by strengthening controls

454
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,380
in line with top technique concentrations.

455
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,950
Again, it's about giving
you the highest ROI

456
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,100
for control validation resources.

457
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,129
So, across a year's worth of reporting,

458
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,950
we saw over 300 discrete
techniques and sub techniques

459
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,059
reported at least one time, again,

460
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,930
in Lindsay's team's reporting.

461
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,309
What I find interesting is when we zoom in

462
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:27,519
on the top techniques.

463
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:28,600
So, let's use, for example,

464
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,669
the top 15 that I highlighted
in this previous slide.

465
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,710
When we look at those,

466
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,830
we actually see that a
wide variety of adversaries

467
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,879
are all associated

468
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,289
with that relatively
short list of techniques.

469
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:43,690
So, certainly over the past year or two,

470
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,330
we've reported a ton about ransomware.

471
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,600
And, we do definitely
see some similarities

472
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,649
in the techniques used by
these ransomware groups,

473
00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:52,340
especially when we look at certain areas

474
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,750
like defensive evasion.

475
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,409
However, when we expand
out a little bit broader,

476
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:00,230
we actually see, across the board,

477
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,980
a wide range of different tools

478
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,730
associated with just this
short list of techniques.

479
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,120
So, we see remote access
and banking Trojans,

480
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,350
offensive security
tools, stealers, botnets,

481
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,549
really a whole host of different tools,

482
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:17,908
all utilizing this same
short list of 15 techniques.

483
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:20,799
If we go even a little bit further,

484
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,129
we've actually basically
seen the entire litany

485
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,120
of major threat actor categories

486
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,600
associated also with this
relatively short list

487
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
of techniques.

488
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,059
So, we've got advanced
cyber criminal groups

489
00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:34,059
and that does include
ransomware groups as well.

490
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:36,799
We see Russia, China, Iran, EPT groups

491
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,500
associated with this list of techniques,

492
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,940
even some activist organizations.

493
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,850
So, all of this, I think,

494
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,340
emphasizes that it's worth remembering

495
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,789
that if you allocate resources

496
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:52,750
to defending against even
some of the techniques

497
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,889
on kind of a top priority list like this,

498
00:19:55,889 --> 00:19:57,090
you are, in reality,

499
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,340
likely closing gaps
that could be exploited

500
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,570
by a wide range of adversaries.

501
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:06,059
Alright, so many of the insights

502
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:08,379
and recommendations we covered today,

503
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,200
drive from support
engagements and conversations

504
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,129
that we've had with our
clients out in the field.

505
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:16,699
Some of the most valuable
discussions that we've had

506
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,749
have come from support for threat

507
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:20,630
or risk profiling exercises

508
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,550
with our clients.

509
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,470
I'm highlighting now some of the main

510
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,889
high level considerations
that we recommend

511
00:20:28,889 --> 00:20:29,889
taking into account

512
00:20:29,889 --> 00:20:31,860
when building a risk profile

513
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,428
and deciding the best approach forward

514
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:37,090
for validating controls
in line with that profile.

515
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,840
What I think is important
to emphasize here

516
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,879
is that it's not at all
just about external threats.

517
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,640
Key considerations come down
to entirely internal factors

518
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,640
and when we engage

519
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,210
with cyber threat intel
teams especially, oftentimes,

520
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,879
some of these internal pieces

521
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:54,649
are some of the most challenging for us

522
00:20:54,649 --> 00:20:56,840
to kind of get a complete handle on.

523
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,039
So, for example,

524
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:01,600
do we really have a complete
and up to date inventory

525
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,320
of all of our internal assets?

526
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,529
Maybe we haven't had a chance yet

527
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:07,259
to line up our internal controls

528
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:10,559
with the threats that we
specifically are facing.

529
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,399
Maybe we don't even have great visibility

530
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:14,439
into our own detection capabilities

531
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,620
as a result of not having
great lines of communication

532
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,879
with the sock,

533
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:20,809
or maybe we're using something
like a managed service

534
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:22,720
who doesn't really give
us that direct visibility

535
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,940
into what kind of detections
we actually do have in place

536
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,530
running within our organization.

537
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:31,049
These are all very real
internal focus considerations.

538
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:35,620
So, clearly, we talk a ton
about threat intelligence,

539
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,110
but in order to help give
our clients some time back

540
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:40,629
to focus on those most valuable tasks,

541
00:21:40,629 --> 00:21:42,820
the critical thinking and analysis,

542
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,039
we've put a ton of effort
into supporting them

543
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,139
around some of those
internal factors of risk,

544
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:50,580
especially around the
internal controls environment.

545
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,769
And, that leads me into the last portion

546
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:53,769
of our presentation.

547
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:56,029
I'm really excited we
have this opportunity

548
00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:59,539
to share some of these resources
with the community today.

549
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:01,980
So, with just a few minutes remaining,

550
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,059
I will mostly start to point you towards

551
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:08,460
where we're hosting this,
controlcompass.github.io.

552
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,090
This is all open sourced,

553
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,350
the data and the site code for
you to download, pick apart,

554
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,649
tailor it for your own needs.

555
00:22:14,649 --> 00:22:17,459
And, we'd love to keep this
conversation absolutely going

556
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,809
after our talk here,

557
00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:20,940
but essentially what we've done

558
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,610
is we aggregated a pretty huge collection

559
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,360
of publicly available
detection repositories.

560
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,820
So, in total,

561
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,428
we've got over 9,000 of
these detection rules,

562
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:36,399
as well as over 2100 offensive
security or red team tests

563
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:39,479
to complete that control
validation feedback loop.

564
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,600
And, ultimately, we've
made it all easy to surface

565
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,139
all of these resources,

566
00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:45,998
since everything we included

567
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:50,860
came with a mapping to an ATT&CK
technique or sub technique.

568
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:53,799
So, we followed our instructions

569
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:54,999
and just included some screenshots.

570
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:55,999
We don't...

571
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:56,999
This is live now.

572
00:22:56,999 --> 00:22:57,999
You can go check out the site,

573
00:22:57,999 --> 00:22:59,519
but just to kind of walk you through

574
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:01,470
some of the features of the tool,

575
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,700
you can start really simple.

576
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,019
If you already know a TTP of interest

577
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:08,480
and surface all of the various
ATT&CK mapped resources

578
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,490
that exist for it, at
least the public ones,

579
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:14,539
that we included across
15 detection repositories

580
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:17,960
and six red team test repos.

581
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,159
You can then also look up
all detections, and tests,

582
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:22,900
and their mappings for your secure...

583
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,809
Portions of your security tech stack

584
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:27,029
and the third party
detections or test sets

585
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:29,240
that you might be using.

586
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,950
And, finally, and this is, again,

587
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,580
derived directly from a lot
of the client engagements

588
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,259
that we've had over the past couple years,

589
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:39,659
you can then overlay some threat intel

590
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:42,630
in MITRE ATT&CK navigator layer format,

591
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,139
on top of those control mappings

592
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:47,939
with the end goal being
to instantly identify

593
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,190
where there might be gaps

594
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,470
between your own threat profile

595
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,269
and the controls that you
currently have in place.

596
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:57,929
So, then you can go about more
quickly closing those gaps,

597
00:23:57,929 --> 00:24:00,460
either by strengthening existing controls,

598
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,880
or if you don't have
detections or controls in place

599
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,869
around certain techniques,

600
00:24:04,869 --> 00:24:06,789
you can use the tool to hopefully surface

601
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:10,620
some additional ones that
you could start to implement.

602
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,998
And, just to highlight
kind of with the tool,

603
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:14,140
hopefully you go check it out,

604
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,059
but this does include just the mappings.

605
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:19,340
We're not trying to kind of
consolidate all of these rules

606
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,889
in a single location.

607
00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:22,490
It's mostly pointing
you towards resources.

608
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,590
And, so there is a fourth tab on here

609
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,678
that will give you some
guidance around how to navigate.

610
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,159
As I'm sure most are familiar with,

611
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:30,820
there's a wide variety in structure

612
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,908
and formatting across these repositories.

613
00:24:32,909 --> 00:24:35,080
And, so it gives you
a little bit of detail

614
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,350
about how to most quickly kind
of navigate through those.

615
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,980
So, tons more to cover,

616
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,929
hopefully in some follow on conversations.

617
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:44,080
But, yeah, I think that
brings us to a close.

618
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,408
We try to leave a little bit of time live

619
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:46,460
for some questions.

620
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,620
So, thank you all for
having us and for the time.

621
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,908
(crowd clapping)

622
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:55,759
- [Conference Admin] That was amazing

623
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:57,570
and who doesn't live a
conference code drop.

624
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:00,139
I mean more tools, more tools, we all--

625
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,140
- [Scott] Exactly.

626
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,450
- Like you said, we do have...

627
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,450
We're coming up on break,

628
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:05,600
but we do have a couple
minutes for questions.

629
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,949
Things like building intel
teams and managing those,

630
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:09,950
like how,

631
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:10,950
what advice would you give

632
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,519
in terms of injecting
that kind of culture?

633
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:17,429
You mentioned how every type of the org...

634
00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:19,110
Our process of the organization

635
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,149
can kind of sit around intel.

636
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:22,270
How do you, kind of,

637
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,090
kind of push that to organizations,

638
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,860
so that leadership and
champions really adopt that,

639
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,218
and are willing to kind of
put you on their shoulder?

640
00:25:30,219 --> 00:25:31,799
- I can start with that one.

641
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,450
Yeah, so a couple things to keep in mind.

642
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,110
I think one of the biggest
things that we encounter

643
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,918
is really trying not to
like necessarily force it

644
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:38,980
on organizations,

645
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,429
because it really is...

646
00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:43,200
They're gonna have to
be in a people, process,

647
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,869
and technology correct place

648
00:25:44,869 --> 00:25:47,379
to really put some of this into use.

649
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,730
Sometimes, you can go out

650
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,019
and purchase a bunch of these tools,

651
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:52,520
and it honestly just creates
additional alert fatigue.

652
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,320
So, that's not really like that helpful,

653
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,590
but it's something to keep in mind,

654
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,049
that you don't wanna force it
if the timing is not right.

655
00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:00,230
Take into account some
of those considerations.

656
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,879
Beyond that, obviously, we're
all biased in being here,

657
00:26:02,879 --> 00:26:06,918
but I do truly try to point
folks towards MITRE ATT&CK

658
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:09,080
to kind of get started with that process.

659
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,909
Even if they're not
thinking about it explicitly

660
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,879
in an intelligence focus,

661
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:15,619
it gives that blend of both
the adversary perspective

662
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:17,299
and the defensive perspective,

663
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:19,129
and it really just puts
them in a good foundation.

664
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,869
And, so just using a lot of
the freely available resources

665
00:26:21,869 --> 00:26:24,090
from MITRE and a number
of other sources as well,

666
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,000
I think it's really a
great starting point.

667
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,190
I know it can be challenging

668
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,970
to kind of start dipping
your toes into it initially,

669
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,149
but, hopefully, conferences like this,

670
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:34,959
everything else is
demonstrating the value.

671
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
- And--

672
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,960
- It really...

673
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

674
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,960
- And, something, I
also wanna add is like,

675
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,960
as a threat intelligence team,

676
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,080
making sure that the decisions
you make are data driven.

677
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,490
So, like I talked a little bit about,

678
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:43,730
when we're looking for what it is

679
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,500
that we wanna write detections on,

680
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,480
it's never just like, I feel like...

681
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,480
No, it's like, okay,

682
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,210
well what are the different
things that are coming out?

683
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,100
And, what are the actual
threats that we face?

684
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,009
It's like, everybody
kind of wants to go after

685
00:26:54,009 --> 00:26:55,090
those new zero days,

686
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,750
but are those really the
most popular sort of exploits

687
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,799
that people are using?

688
00:26:58,799 --> 00:26:59,799
Things like that.

689
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:00,799
- That makes a lot of sense,

690
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:01,799
and, like I said,

691
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:02,889
I do wanna get the audience here.

692
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:03,889
I know I've been...

693
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:04,889
Might have been neglecting you

694
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:05,889
with my own selfish questions,

695
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:07,629
so definitely wanna give you
an opportunity to weigh in.

696
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,630
Oh, right here.

697
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:11,499
(questionee talking in the background)

698
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:22,169
- Well, that's an amazing question.

699
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:29,620
Just to repeat for the live audience,

700
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:30,768
the question is effectively,

701
00:27:30,769 --> 00:27:33,220
you mentioned the various
types of intel sources you use,

702
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,690
when you see a tool drop

703
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:38,299
and a new GitHub project
or some type of new TTP,

704
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:40,490
what's typically the
timeframe between observation

705
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:41,490
of its existence

706
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,470
versus actually seeing it operationalized?

707
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,110
- Oh, that's hard to say.

708
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,110
So, I think it's...

709
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,600
It kind of differs and
I don't wanna be wrong.

710
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,199
So, I might take a rain check on that one

711
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,850
and get back to you.

712
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,959
Another one that we had seen a while ago

713
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,210
was actually Replace

714
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,259
that was a new kind of
file encryption technique

715
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:57,769
that we saw in ransomware.

716
00:27:57,769 --> 00:27:59,279
I think that was a couple months later,

717
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,239
we actually saw a threat actor

718
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:03,169
writing Thanos ransomware using it.

719
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:04,350
So, that was couple months,

720
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,629
just to give you kind of an example,

721
00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:06,629
but it could be longer.

722
00:28:06,629 --> 00:28:07,629
It could be shorter.

723
00:28:07,629 --> 00:28:08,990
- Yeah, and I know we're
running outta time,

724
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,530
but I can point you to
some specific examples

725
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:14,168
if you just wanna search for them.

726
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:16,489
Empire has seen very quick adoption.

727
00:28:16,489 --> 00:28:19,200
Octopus, I think, C2 is
one of the classic cases

728
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,230
where we saw, I mean, it
was a time span of months.

729
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,669
We've definitely seen faster than that.

730
00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:24,090
It really is kind of across the board,

731
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:27,889
but it's anywhere between
maybe literally hours, to days,

732
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:28,890
to months.

733
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,449
Very fast, basically, is the takeaway.

734
00:28:31,449 --> 00:28:33,529
- So, I guess we have time
for maybe one more question

735
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:34,529
from the audience.

736
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:36,200
I saw a couple hands go up.

737
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,120
If not, again, I'll go back
to my selfish questions,

738
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,549
'cause I love your presentation.

739
00:28:41,549 --> 00:28:43,559
I could probably put together a list.

740
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,418
So, really looking forward
to you being on the couch

741
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:46,419
with Kat as well,

742
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:50,409
but you mentioned the
different types of data sources

743
00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:52,410
or intel feeds,

744
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:56,220
open source, closed source,
all the different types,

745
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,220
as an intel team,

746
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,220
how do you track that?

747
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,129
You mentioned how you assess
it and kind of see value,

748
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:01,879
but kind of keeping tabs of those,

749
00:29:01,879 --> 00:29:04,580
so that all your analysts
are kind of on the same page,

750
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,350
what advice would you give in that domain?

751
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:11,199
- Oh, that's a big one.

752
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,679
Trying to maintain some sort of blend.

753
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:14,769
I don't, I can't honestly think...

754
00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:15,769
I don't, maybe this is a useful takeaway,

755
00:29:15,769 --> 00:29:19,409
but of anyone who necessarily
has a structured balance,

756
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:20,470
and they're saying

757
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,249
we need to get X percentage
of our collection

758
00:29:22,249 --> 00:29:23,500
from these sources.

759
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,909
It's mostly making sure that there is

760
00:29:24,909 --> 00:29:27,580
at least some collection
from the various angles,

761
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,220
because truly, like Lindsay emphasized,

762
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,789
with that one example,

763
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:32,119
there are components flowing in

764
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,610
from open, closed, technical,

765
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:36,189
that can all feed into a single threat.

766
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,080
- Yeah, I know that's a tough one.

767
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,489
In the spirit of common languages,

768
00:29:39,489 --> 00:29:40,909
I wish it was an easy answer,

769
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:43,070
but, yeah, I think that's
a really great insight.

770
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,070
It's just, like you said,

771
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,509
work with what you have and just...

772
00:29:45,509 --> 00:29:46,509
Yeah.

773
00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:49,870
So, with that, we are at
our final break of the day.

774
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,070
Thank you both for your presentation.

775
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,129
And we...
