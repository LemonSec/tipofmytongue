00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,320
end of last attack on but they were

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,039
still a few days from being able to

9
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,120
land the punchline

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,120
but um

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,600

free things

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,079
that are useful to the attack community

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,320
over the past two years and so i wanted

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,680
to give them the opportunity to talk

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,600
about some of those things that people

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,760
can actually make use of today

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,199

and

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,320
putting on an event like this is really

31
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,799
freaking hard in normal times and this

32
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,880

have connected ahead of time so i could

66
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,480
drum up and see why they're not using

67
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,079
attack and get some love there

68
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,519

we have a lot of smart people who have

86
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,200
been talking the last couple of days who

87
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,599
are our members i feel really privileged

88
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,280
to get to work with all of you

89
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,200
some are sponsors as research

90
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,840
participants and affiliates

91
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,200
and

92
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,640
what we do is collaborate on r d

93
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,760
projects

94
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,640
brian was mentioning earlier that

95
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,480
open source work

96
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,480
takes people not all of us have cool

97
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,640
interns to be able to

98
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,239
manage that so

99
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,319
we all come together with the collective

100
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,040
goal to improve r d

101
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,599
and put it out in the community so that

102
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,400
folks can leverage it work on it take

103
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,120
advantage of it

104
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,000
all of these projects you see some

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,319
little snapshots of what we put out are

106
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,879
freely available to everyone everything

107
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,040
we do goes out there for the community

108
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,519
to use

109
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,160
and how do we decide what we do um our

110
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,919
acting director john baker who couldn't

111
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,040
be here

112
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,960
these last couple of days

113
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,479
described as a funnel you can see the

114
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,759
picture right there

115
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,759
we take in lots of ideas from our

116
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,919
members from folks that we meet at

117
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,600
conferences like this

118
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,280
what do you see as a problem what do you

119
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,880
see as a gap what do you wish you could

120
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,520
do but it just doesn't make sense in

121
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,080
your particular company to have that

122
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,040
happen

123
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,840
we collect them all down select and see

124
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
what's a priority for us what what do we

125
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,479
feel we can push forward and actually

126
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,800
make a difference on working

127
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,720
at that point i have the great privilege

128
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,440
of taking great miter subject matter

129
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,080
experts to lead projects

130
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,800
and work with our members to create them

131
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,880
and push them out into the public and at

132
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,560
that point we show our thought

133
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,000
leadership of

134
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,400
hey here's this great thing we created i

135
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,240
hope you all can use it and tell us what

136
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,960
you think about it

137
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,960
so

138
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,360
my job is both easy and hard today

139
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,720
because i've been playing the memory

140
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,800
game of all the lovely things that you

141
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,479
all pointed out about our projects that

142
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,560
you're using and how those connect so

143
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,240
it's going to test me of how i can

144
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,440
remember this

145
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,280
but also it makes it great right i'm

146
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,840
trying to projects to impact talk about

147
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,759
we put out these cool things

148
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,320
we want you to use them so

149
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,919
giving you some examples of how to do

150
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,919
that

151
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
first one up our adversary emulation

152
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,039
library

153
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,000
when selena opened us for us yesterday

154
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,840
she talked about bottom line up front

155
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,600
the bluff thing

156
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,520
this is our bluff we always whenever we

157
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,720
do a project

158
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,960
talk about what problem we're solving

159
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,479
what the solution is

160
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,360
and what impact we hope that it brings

161
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,639
so for

162
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,319
adversary emulation

163
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,520
we're having a conversation at the

164
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,280
center just the other day

165
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,160
and

166
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,800
when you have teams that are bringing in

167
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,479
that different threat intel and trying

168
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,319
to create a picture of an adversary

169
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,160
that's a lot of curation work right it

170
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,880
takes effort to fill in all the gaps map

171
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,120
the attack techniques and create that

172
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,680
through line of how an adversary

173
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,800
works

174
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,680
to get to their stated goal

175
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,960
we as a center for fin6 and for

176
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,160
menupaths

177
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,759
created these adversary emulations for

178
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,479
you to use we have a common methodology

179
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,479
we have all the material out there and

180
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,080
better yet

181
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,960
the attack evaluations team also

182
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,880
puts into this library so there's things

183
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,919
like apt-29 and other adversary

184
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,080
emulations in there for you to use as

185
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,318
well

186
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,280
how how do we hope you're using them in

187
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,199
your red teaming and purple teaming you

188
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,800
have to think through what adversary

189
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,039
makes sense to you what what's going to

190
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,039
fit your purpose and

191
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,400
and metrics of interest that you want to

192
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,120
drive to but please take our work we

193
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,199
don't want to have to have you duplicate

194
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,199
the hard work that we put in to create

195
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,840
that through line of the story

196
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,919
and one thing that i want to call back

197
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,919
to yesterday when trellix was talking

198
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,599
about storytelling and so many people

199
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,360
have touched on that right

200
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,240
is

201
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,560
we're going to be improving the library

202
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,639
coming soon with that storytelling

203
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,840
aspect because we feel like that's a

204
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,120
really powerful part of the emulation

205
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,840
that exist

206
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,280
the next few slides i have are around

207
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,360
our mapping work so i'm going to kind of

208
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,800
go through these a little quick and then

209
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,080
hit on my

210
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,440
main point

211
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,280
so the first one i want to highlight is

212
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,639
when we mapped attack to cve

213
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,639
this was us attempting to bridge

214
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,479
vulnerability management with threat and

215
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,000
form defense

216
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,759
and i didn't get at it before but

217
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,599
threatened form defense really is using

218
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,400
adversary behaviors as the lens through

219
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,759
which we view our defenses

220
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,240
so being able to do that connection

221
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,319
between vulnerability management and

222
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,400
adversary views is a really valuable

223
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,800
thing right

224
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,720
another one for those who live in

225
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,560
compliance world have to deal with nist

226
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,240
853

227
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,839
mapping those controls to attack seeing

228
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,559
where they map up

229
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,679
further

230
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,240
for the cloud we've done security

231
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,880
control mapping for both azure

232
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,680
and aws and we're working on gcp right

233
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,640
now that'll be coming out

234
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,720
shortly so i stole this picture from

235
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,000
jorge he um uses it for the ethical

236
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,360
maturity

237
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,320
model

238
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,480
jorge and i don't know each other i just

239
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,000
like to follow really smart people

240
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,240
online and absorb what they put out

241
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,120
there

242
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,880
and i thought this was very useful that

243
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,440
he talks about it in maturing from

244
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,680
vulnerability management up to

245
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,279
purple teaming and adversary emulation

246
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,880
but really you don't

247
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,800
abandon those early vulnerability

248
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,440
management functions as you mature right

249
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,200
you want those teams to be able to talk

250
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,360
haley said a lot of smart things in your

251
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,200
talk but one of them you're talking

252
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,800
about connecting the teams and having

253
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,120
that common purpose

254
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,440
attack is our common language right

255
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,760
we've mentioned rosetta stone we've

256
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,640
mentioned selena with the dictionary if

257
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,040
we have everything with that common

258
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,160
framework

259
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,200
we can start to bridge cves and look at

260
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,800
our vulnerabilities

261
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,680
mapping to the adversary behavior

262
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,519
but then also looking at the control

263
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,600
environment and

264
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,800
azure

265
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,040
amazon to see

266
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,040
where are we hitting things where aren't

267
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,640
we shored up

268
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,000
and you know from the great

269
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,440
presentations we've had this is where

270
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,519
i'm dragging my memory the great tool

271
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,519
that came out of recorded future with

272
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:14,959
the compass tool

273
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,200
leveraged the mappings work that the

274
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,480
center put out to create that tool which

275
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,120
is so great

276
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,920
and finally

277
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,160
jared thank you this helps me from

278
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,040
explaining a lot the workbench i've met

279
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,600
more people than just the attack team

280
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,240
and ivan who use it

281
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,079
it is used widely and i think it's

282
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,480
really fantastic it lets you for your

283
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,519
local

284
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,240
use augment and grow and work with

285
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,920
attack in the way that makes sense to

286
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,320
you there are some close hold things of

287
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,720
oh shoot we're not short up here that

288
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,320
you might want to annotate not share

289
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,440
with the world

290
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,200
you also like our crowdstrike friends

291
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,560
said the other day

292
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,760
have enough

293
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,320
austrian australian australian

294
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,800
friend who's saying hey i tried to map

295
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,680
this

296
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,440
and there's not a technique in attack

297
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,720
i'm going to submit it back to the

298
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,360
attack team to be able to add that

299
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,279
workbench is a way

300
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,600
that you can start to have that

301
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,560
so you're both adding new objects but

302
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,079
augmenting

303
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,800
with different pieces of work and we had

304
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,240
heard from folks that you were all doing

305
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,480
this with like sticky notes before

306
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,560
or spreadsheet sometimes

307
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,880
no hate for spreadsheets but

308
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,000
we think this is a better way

309
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,760
so for anyone who

310
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,760
attended the threatened forum defense

311
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,360
conference

312
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,160
late last year this might look familiar

313
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,279
and what i want to show is a little bit

314
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,880
of where we're going so there's the

315
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,040
impact report that's out there

316
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,959
and i highlighted some of our projects

317
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,480
that we have

318
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,240
we want to be more thoughtful we've

319
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,000
existed for coming up on two and a half

320
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,760
years and we have these kind of great

321
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,240
one-off projects that we're proud of we

322
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,079
want to be more strategic than that

323
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,000
we're going to work on these focus areas

324
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,079
with our membership to say

325
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,760
where are the gaps that are hurting us

326
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,880
the most

327
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,440
where can we really think about what

328
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,120
helps people in the community because we

329
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,600
want that impact we don't want to do

330
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
things that are just cool and we move on

331
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,040
and you can't adopt them into your

332
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,800
environment they're not helping your

333
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,120
team when you onboard new people it

334
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,880
isn't giving you value it's not where we

335
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,399
want to be we want to have those

336
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,959
projects that you can actually run with

337
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,000
and use and it makes your life easier

338
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,800
so

339
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,399
working on that but also being

340
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,800
thoughtful about o m attack updates all

341
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,920
the time right so we want to be not

342
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,279
throwing up a mission accomplished

343
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,279
banner when we push these things out and

344
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,600
let them get dusty in the github world

345
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,000
we want to maintain them we want to hear

346
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,120
your input what sucks what's awesome

347
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,480
what could be improved and we can

348
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,920
iterate on to get better

349
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,720
which brings me to

350
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,839
my last

351
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,200
call to action

352
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,639
which is

353
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,040
tell us what you think if you are using

354
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,600
our projects or check them out we want

355
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,760
to hear your thoughts

356
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,920
these are three that we just published

357
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,160
recently there's been a lot of

358
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,720
the last couple of days about sequences

359
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,959
and a tack flow project that we just had

360
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,920
out is one attempt to be able to start

361
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,320
to communicate in that language

362
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,560
sightings ecosystem you know the latin

363
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,160
american playbook

364
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,320
talk earlier today made me think

365
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,720
so much of that data would be fantastic

366
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,120
in our sightings ecosystem which is real

367
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,680
world observables of adversary

368
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,240
techniques that folks can start to pull

369
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,160
on and understand what's happening out

370
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,040
there

371
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,120
and finally the insider threat knowledge

372
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,320
base that matt so helpfully was talking

373
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,399
about earlier with his own work how we

374
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,720
can start to coordinate on techniques

375
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,800
that those insiders use

376
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,360
um and if you want to i would love you

377
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,279
to join us if you're not already a

378
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,600
member come talk to us about how we can

379
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,199
collaborate how you can get involved um

380
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,519
yeah

381
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,920
that's it

382
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
hey jane thank you so much and you know

383
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
the center has really been a trusted

384
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,040
partner with us you know the attack

385
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,399
speaking from the attacking perspective

386
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,519
in terms of

387
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,360
not only like you said spreading that

388
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,040
threat informed mindset and really like

389
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,440
you know applying that to other domains

390
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,880
but looking ahead you know whether it's

391
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,079
cloud containers mapping attack to cve

392
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,160
really helping us you know exactly as

393
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,920
one of the themes of today and yesterday

394
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,560
has been glue back to the community um

395
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,680
so we have a couple minutes for

396
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,800
questions um definitely want to give

397
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,839
folks a chance to uh ask ingrid anything

398
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,160
but you know just a starter would be you

399
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,480
know what's next or you know where

400
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,920
you know say someone in the community

401
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,920
community has an idea how do they really

402
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,120
reach out to the center and kind of

403
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,959
share that idea or be involved you know

404
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,560
whether it's something you know new and

405
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,680
a potential idea to work around or you

406
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,040
know you mentioned everything is

407
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,480
published online for the community to

408
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,160
use you know where where can people you

409
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:10,800
know

410
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
individual researchers inject themselves

411
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,880
yeah great question so as i mentioned

412
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,560
before we take ideas from everyone it's

413
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,320
not just members we want to hear from

414
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,000
the community so if you have an idea you

415
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,600
just want to talk to us we're really

416
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,800
open to that this is my full-time job so

417
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,480
help keep me employed if you want to

418
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,560
reach out and talk about something love

419
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,720
it we do have current projects underway

420
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,880
one of them i mentioned the gcp security

421
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,079
mapping that we're really excited to

422
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,680
push out soon we have another couple

423
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,519
that i'm not going to tease yet but that

424
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,880
are coming out next couple of months

425
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,519
that we're excited for um

426
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,000
and if you want to investigate becoming

427
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,839
an affiliate becoming a research member

428
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,680
or something also reach out excited to

429
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,480
talk

430
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,880
fantastic yeah i love you know really

431
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,000
just the the trust of you know not just

432
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,920
investment and you know just commitment

433
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,440
to you know pushing attack and pushing

434
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,199
this threat in four minutes forward but

435
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,320
all the different perspectives that

436
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,000
brings you know in terms of you know you

437
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,440
know we share a lot of similar problems

438
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,720
there's probably a baseline we're all in

439
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,959
the same place but as we push towards

440
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,880
solutions having you know different

441
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,480
perspectives you know what might one

442
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,959
work what might work for one group might

443
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,320
not work for another but really finding

444
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,440
that middle

445
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,839
um another question i was just kind of

446
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,160
thinking of is you know

447
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,759
going forward and looking for research

448
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,759
avenues you know in the spirit of you

449
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,279
know threat and form defense is there

450
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,279
any type of scoping you know as people

451
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,959
start to come up with new ideas like

452
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,240
even now we're looking in slack and

453
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,839
people are what about this what about

454
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,160
that you know what is for just a quick

455
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,360
kind of summary i know you touched on

456
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,120
this earlier what is

457
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,279
like what's a really kind of short

458
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,880
understanding of what is threatened from

459
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,720
defense and what kind of problems are

460
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,360
you looking for yeah so we all have

461
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,680
limited resources right and you know

462
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,279
some of the folks in the audience the

463
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,360
reason you're members of the center you

464
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,279
have very sophisticated large teams

465
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,360
you're all super lucky that you have

466
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,279
like a red team and a blue team and

467
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,959
everything a lot of folks that i've

468
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,560
worked with and i know jamie and kat and

469
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,720
everyone i've seen have like an i.t

470
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,880
person who's also the security person

471
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,319
and we're asking them to learn attack

472
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,599
and stuff so

473
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,280
scoping is an important thing that we

474
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,400
can't be

475
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,799
all things to all people

476
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,640
but we should be targeted and

477
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,039
communicate that targetedness of for

478
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,359
each project who we're hoping to help

479
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,280
whether it be the really sophisticated

480
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,599
teams that we love having as part of the

481
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,240
center down to that one it guy who's

482
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,679
really just trying to get his arms

483
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,600
around the problem figuring out where he

484
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,200
can make improvements

485
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,039
oh yeah we definitely sympathize and try

486
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,880
to do everything we can looking out for

487
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,200
that you know small shop large shop

488
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,919
wherever you are you're here um just

489
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,520
kind of more general question you know

490
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,720
and one of the things i really

491
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,559
appreciated about you know the outputs

492
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,360
of the center is it's very unbiased you

493
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,440
know you're not necessarily going to

494
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,880
just sing the praises of attack and

495
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,720
throw attack at every problem it seems

496
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,320
like they're very often you know it's

497
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,480
not a you know a criticism but we take

498
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,480
we look a lot of the outputs both the

499
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,400
insider threat matrix and all these

500
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,760
things and it's you know it's almost

501
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,400
like a an accelerator of sorts you know

502
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,240
push more ask you know like johnny said

503
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,960
earlier ass take risk ask more questions

504
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,559
you know how do you how do you kind of

505
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,640
see the future of you know kind of

506
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,240
bridging the gap between the center

507
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,160
what's inside uh being coming out of the

508
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,480
center and infusing that to you know as

509
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,160
we've seen the last two days all the

510
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,600
work that people have already been you

511
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
know integrating with attack

512
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,400
yeah

513
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,640
it's such a hard question because

514
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,559
i believe in

515
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,559
failure i believe in

516
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,200
sharing when we mess up on something and

517
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,720
we don't get it right and i believe

518
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,880
there's a lot of power in iterating and

519
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,480
living up to that and taking the

520
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,760
criticism

521
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,600
um which is a valuable thing right that

522
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,120
we talk with our team so sometimes you

523
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
look at with projects and you're like oh

524
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,120
there's a lot of biases in that did you

525
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,720
think about this problem did you think

526
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,440
about that which is such valuable input

527
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,360
to try and make our things better and

528
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,559
even though we don't have a bias about

529
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,320
what we're putting out everyone has

530
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,480
biases there's the cognitive biases

531
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
there's the trying to do the best work

532
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,120
so we try and be very upfront about that

533
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,360
um and yeah so it's just really that

534
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,039
conversation of the community of trying

535
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,720
to get the feedback and no i don't

536
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,400
believe in perfect but i believe like

537
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,160
cat was saying we do get to a point of

538
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,480
done and then done allows us to iterate

539
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,640
and communicate and move forward i love

540
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,640
that philosophy because even in those

541
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,200
you know oh air quote failure even you

542
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,440
know nine things out of ten might not be

543
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,520
perfect or done but there's always that

544
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,280
one gym where wow you made me ask a

545
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,720
question or really think about something

546
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,919
in a way that i've never considered

547
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,160
before so even you know even if nine

548
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,400
times out of ten you know it's uh maybe

549
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,080
not something i'll apply directly i can

550
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,000
still take that one and that becomes you

551
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,679
know wipes the slate and says 10 out of

552
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,679
10 great solution

553
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,280
thank you i think we have questions

554
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,480
maybe time for one more question

555
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,120
otherwise thank you oh question up front

556
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,200
um i specifically wanted to ask about

557
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,559
cybe's ecosystem and some advice on

558
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,679
how to move um you know the stakeholders

559
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,480
in the discussion how to get them to

560
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,880
to be get over that concern that if they

561
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,919
share

562
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,679
the you know the especially when they're

563
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,039
in chains if they share the

564
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,080
you know they hold back we've been

565
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,320
having we've been straw polling during

566
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,840
all the breaks and this is the biggest

567
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,679
barrier we're finding yeah just to

568
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,679
repeat for the audience the question was

569
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,760
um you know regarding sightings and you

570
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,520
know intel sharing how do you really

571
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,440
push people over that fear and that

572
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,120
anxiety of you know over being

573
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,320
vulnerable and kind of exposing

574
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,240
themselves versus you know i was

575
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,679
breached and i was compromised and i

576
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:32,799
don't really want to talk about it i

577
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,880
don't want others to know about it yeah

578
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,640
it's a big challenge right it requires

579
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,200
trust it requires building trust and our

580
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,520
team that works on sightings developed a

581
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,000
lot of anonymization tools and contracts

582
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,440
all the like legal stuff that we can

583
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,840
sign off on to get your data but also

584
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,679
have that trusted conversation about

585
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,280
here's what we're going to take here's

586
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,039
what we're going to scrap out of it

587
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,559
here's we're going to attribute or not

588
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,400
attribute so that you have that

589
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,919
understanding and comfort to be able to

590
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,760
give you data i always like to make a

591
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,280
comparison to weather reporting in

592
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,520
kenya for some farmers that

593
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,360
weather reporting isn't universally

594
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,200
covered like it is for like new york

595
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,600
city and for something like farming you

596
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,440
need that data and satellite feeds and

597
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,440
understanding along with your individual

598
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,240
context to be able to do your work so if

599
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,080
we don't have my comparison there as the

600
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,440
sightings ecosystem if we don't have

601
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,360
that real world data then we're just

602
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,880
kind of fumbling and our crops are all

603
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,480
going to fail so this is a tragedy of

604
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,480
the common thing of we need to get to

605
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,880
that trust in the community to be able

606
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,280
to all act on that data and use it to

607
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,120
inform our defenses

608
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,000
perfect thank you

609
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,800
[Applause]

610
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,360
you
