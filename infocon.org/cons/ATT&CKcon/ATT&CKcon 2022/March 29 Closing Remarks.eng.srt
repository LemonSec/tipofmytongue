1
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,020
- We're coming towards the end of the day.

2
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,800
I tried to memorize this,
but I took some notes.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,520
In closing, just kind of recapping

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,930
some of the big themes today.

5
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,009
I think Selena's keynote
really captured it.

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,070
It all starts with telling a story.

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,560
And absolutely, that is one

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,060
of my favorite things about ATT&CK

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:32,110
is I think a couple talks
actually mentioned this,

10
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,269
Gert-Jan I think did it best,

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,100
but ATT&CK isn't going
to be a silver bullet.

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,320
It's not going to solve your problems.

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,320
It's not going to be something

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,470
you can just throw at an issue

15
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:42,220
or kind of just adopt
it and you're solved.

16
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,490
It really is going to be something

17
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,250
that makes you better at
whatever you're doing,

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,360
whether you're hunting,

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,000
whether you're a blue team
or a red team or procurement

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,309
or just a security-minded user.

21
00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:56,649
Really ATT&CK is going to be that story,

22
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:59,450
that context of why does this matter?

23
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,530
What could potentially
happen that connects us,

24
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,579
exactly as this last
presentation captured,

25
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:07,600
connects us to detections,
mitigations, ideas,

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,949
configurations automation opportunities.

27
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,120
All of that really is gonna
be something from you,

28
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,820
not necessarily something that ATT&CK

29
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,479
is just going to solve for you.

30
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,950
So it really is something
that this community,

31
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,751
I know we really rally around each other

32
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,250
and start building out,

33
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,120
but a second big theme of the
day was telling that story.

34
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,350
It only goes so far if you
don't know who's listening.

35
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,579
And I think that's something

36
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:36,469
that from my own perspective,
being on the ATT&CK team

37
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:38,559
for almost four and a half years now,

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,549
that was one of my biggest lessons was,

39
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:44,450
think about who's listening,
think about who's reading.

40
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,299
Do I need to go really far in the weeds

41
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:51,650
or do I really need to
provide high level summaries?

42
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,770
Biggest thing is, you
don't want to overwhelm

43
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,160
but you also don't want to underwhelm

44
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,920
and really finding that balance

45
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,000
in terms of, who am I talking to?

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,091
What are they going to do about it?

47
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:02,219
And how do I really connect the bridge

48
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:05,169
and connect the gap in terms
of actionability for them.

49
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,520
So knowing that audience is going

50
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,340
to be advantageous and so powerful.

51
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,340
Third thing I picked up

52
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,640
and I thought was really cool was,

53
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,220
when the spirit of ATT&CK, as we know,

54
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,500
these techniques aren't things

55
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,430
that we're just making up,
these aren't hypothetical ideas,

56
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,030
these aren't pretend threats,

57
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,640
these aren't potential malware.

58
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,670
This is all data driven.

59
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,959
So what that theme of, it's not
just building the framework,

60
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,440
but everything else we do in this space.

61
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,930
Let's think about, how can we prioritize?

62
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,740
How can we inform rather than,

63
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,071
the second to last talk
really touched on it,

64
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:44,230
and during the Q&A was,
let's not do random things.

65
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,160
Let's let our data lead
us towards victory.

66
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,810
And there's so many different metrics

67
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,790
that we can capture from that perspective,

68
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:53,350
but it only starts with,

69
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,600
fourth lesson was knowing yourself.

70
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,600
What are you capable of?

71
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,600
What data are you collecting?

72
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,010
What are your prioritizations?

73
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,630
What are your biggest risk

74
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,549
and biggest things you're worried about?

75
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,010
And how do you integrate that
with knowing your audience,

76
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,000
telling this story and
really understanding,

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,380
what do we need to measure
and how do we go about that

78
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,650
and at what level of granularity.

79
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,260
And final thing of,

80
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,320
I love whoever designed the
stream of talks, amazing job.

81
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,180
I don't think this was an accident.

82
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,760
But the latter half of
the day really touched on,

83
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,970
I think this almost circles back

84
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,350
to the keynote from the
very first ATT&CKcon,

85
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,430
was now that we have solutions

86
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,190
and we have these great ideas,

87
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,210
let's build tools around
them, let's talk about them,

88
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,770
let's share that with the community.

89
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,360
Not only to share those resources

90
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,310
and making sure we're really
compiling on each other

91
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,880
and really learning from
each other's lessons,

92
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,560
but also taking feedback

93
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,790
and saying, "This is an idea,
this is a problem I had."

94
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,230
You might share that exact same problem.

95
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,760
Exactly as the last question addressed,

96
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,940
there might be additional problems

97
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,570
that this solution can already address,

98
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,180
or within our arms reach.

99
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,980
So rather than just starting from scratch

100
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,590
and we all are solving all these problems

101
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,900
and dealing with things on our own.

102
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,240
Why don't we learn from each other?

103
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,430
We're absolutely a community

104
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,660
that shares many if not
all the same problems.

105
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,180
So there really is absolutely no reason

106
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,800
that we can't come together like this

107
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,340
and start to really be a community

108
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,570
with the shared problem set
and shared adversary space.

109
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,540
So with that, I know definitely
don't want to just sit here

110
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,710
and brain vomit for the next 10 minutes,

111
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,909
especially with alcohol on
the other side of this wall.

112
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,090
So just wanted to thank you again

113
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,539
for showing up, being
as amazing as you are,

114
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:34,000
contributing and most especially today,

115
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,729
it's really been a couple years

116
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:36,889
since we were able to do this.

117
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:39,110
A lot of us forgot, or we haven't,

118
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,410
especially how much the
ATT&CK team has grown.

119
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,490
We haven't had an opportunity to be here

120
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,110
and actually feel what it feels like

121
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,590
to see all you and all the online,

122
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,310
Slack, Twitter, all that stuff.

123
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,310
It's been great.

124
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,710
So really kind of seeing everyone here.

125
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,989
So definitely take a second

126
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,949
to give yourselves a round of applause.

127
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:57,780
And truly, thank you.

128
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,859
(audience claps)
