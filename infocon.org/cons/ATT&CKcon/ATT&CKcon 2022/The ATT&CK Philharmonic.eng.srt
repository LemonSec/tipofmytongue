1
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,610
- So our next speakers
in our afternoon session

2
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,169
are Ivan Ninichuck and Andy
Shepherd from Siemplify.

3
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,920
So this proposal intrigued
us with its musical metaphor,

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,810
and the idea of turning
numerous data sources

5
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,160
into an orchestra.

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,380
Ivan's been our dedicated question asker,

7
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,339
and lightning talk speaker
at ATT&CK in the past.

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,500
So great to see you here
for a Main Track Talk.

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,470
So please give it up for Ivan and Andy.

10
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,570
(audience applauds)

11
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,239
- Okay. So first I do
have to give a disclaimer.

12
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,849
All opinions and ideals are solely our own

13
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,180
and our particular small little team.

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,920
They don't exactly,
they're not official views

15
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,370
or any timelines or anything for either

16
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,929
Siemplify or Google Cloud.

17
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,390
Andy, I'll let you introduce yourself.

18
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,229
- Yep. Hi guys, Andy
Shepherd. Been in software

19
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:12,789
for a few years, which is why
we're doing the talk today.

20
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:16,150
But like many of you, been
in IT cyber for much longer.

21
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,240
There's not much more to say, really.

22
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,759
- Ivan Ninichuck, totally
forgot to put my social media

23
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:25,229
out there, but I made
it easy for everyone.

24
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:26,759
It's just my name everywhere.

25
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,649
So, just google my name you'll find it.

26
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:33,869
Freelancer, Tech Writer
got hired by Siemplify

27
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:35,320
doing SOAR now.

28
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,229
So good times!

29
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,080
Now, one thing, no one works in a vacuum.

30
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,229
We basically came at Siemplify
and we wanted to find out

31
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,780
what were the great ways
of applying automation

32
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,509
to MITRE ATT&CK, how
to get this done and so

33
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:54,899
what I did once I met this
wonderful gentleman was

34
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,450
we put together a small team
and I just wanna make sure that

35
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,660
they're all recognized
in their contributions.

36
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:09,878
Okay. I started out almost
at least a year ago or so.

37
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:12,269
And the first place that
we started our discussion

38
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,640
was how do you see your data sets?

39
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,209
And I wanna share how I see the data sets

40
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,400
and how we see them.

41
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,599
We see them as an
orchestra, all playing those

42
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,268
very well known symphonies

43
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:31,819
imagine something from
Mozart or Beethoven playing

44
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:37,030
or Sikorski depending on
what your favorites are,

45
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,439
but this is how security feels

46
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,439
when you don't have ATT&CK, right?

47
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,459
We all got that down.

48
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:49,489
ATT&CK brings the clarity, the order

49
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:51,930
and everything that the music does,

50
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,969
it gives us our notes and our
language that we're speaking.

51
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:56,140
We'll get to that a little more.

52
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,149
But the problem is that
when you have an orchestra,

53
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,240
even if you're all trying
to play the same notes,

54
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,700
you're not necessarily gonna
play 'em all at the same time.

55
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,958
If you get an orchestra,
without a conductor,

56
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:10,329
then guess what happens?

57
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:12,319
Everyone plays a different
part, at a different tempo

58
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,510
and a different key, and it's just noise.

59
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,018
And that's what we see
data sets when they're not

60
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:20,120
being correlated properly when they're not

61
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,730
using ATT&CK to guide the
investigations, things like that.

62
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,780
We see it as just noise happening.

63
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,930
And so SOAR really stands in the industry

64
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,249
in an interesting spot.

65
00:03:32,249 --> 00:03:36,310
Obviously, it's been one
of the kind of buzzwords,

66
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,279
maybe in the past, you heard,"
Hey, SOAR this SOAR that."

67
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:43,090
And we really wanted to
address that and just put

68
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,409
the position of where
it stands in our mind

69
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:48,529
with all the other tools
that we work with and

70
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:50,720
how we see it really.

71
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,239
And so I actually did take
a diagram of an orchestra

72
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,799
and then put all the tools out there,

73
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,680
'cause this is seriously how I see things,

74
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,999
when I've been listening to
music and I literally see

75
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:04,540
the pianos are my fishing data, right?

76
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:07,730
Giving me my initial access.

77
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,790
The violins are my network and endpoint

78
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,190
and they're playing a certain tune

79
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,230
and now, I can see how the two

80
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,769
are interjecting each other and playing.

81
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,358
So now the question is, we got
this idea of the orchestra.

82
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:22,388
We got this idea that ATT&CK a good thing

83
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:24,800
and provides this ability to orchestrate

84
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,090
but how do we automate this thing?

85
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,919
How do we actually make
it usable on a day to day?

86
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,200
And this is where I
have been ecstatic more

87
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,150
than ever by any ATT&CK thing

88
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,859
which was the data sources
and data components.

89
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,430
- Yes.

90
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:50,720
- And what I began to
realize was we really did

91
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,430
create literally the Rosetta
Stone of security languages.

92
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,460
And I know I've heard this several times

93
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,219
in other presentations, this
idea that it's a language

94
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,150
and we've been creating
it and now we can use it.

95
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,349
Well, one thing is that
I was investigating

96
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,890
the Rosetta Stone, for this presentation.

97
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,390
And one of the interesting things

98
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,469
about it was how it brought out biases

99
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,750
in the way that different scholars

100
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,420
approached ancient civilizations
and how that brought out

101
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,120
different uses of the Rosetta Stone

102
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,670
and different conclusions.

103
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,150
I really began to see
this correlation between

104
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,070
what we do with the
ATT&CK, and how this works.

105
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,980
Now, how do I automate this thing?

106
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,370
Well, the cool thing is that because

107
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,700
I have these data components
and because they're

108
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,320
in this language that's
tied to these techniques

109
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,880
and the detections have these
same techniques in them.

110
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,240
Now, I can start automating,

111
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,010
where am I going to take
this investigation next?

112
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,690
Where do you need when
you have a data component,

113
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,770
say about a Registry Key being created,

114
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,880
where else do I need to start looking?

115
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,580
Maybe I need to start
following Olaf's suggestions

116
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,969
and start looking at user creation.

117
00:05:57,970 --> 00:05:59,340
Maybe I need to start looking

118
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,849
say if an active directory
data component comes up,

119
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,520
look at similar logs.

120
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,520
And these are the kind of things

121
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,650
that now we can start doing,

122
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,190
because I wanna present an ideal.

123
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:13,670
And the ideal is that time,
is your utility in Secops.

124
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:19,230
And it has different cost
based on when you're using it.

125
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,460
If you're using it, say during
Detection Engineering Periods

126
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,090
or Threat Hunting Periods, time costs less

127
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,140
you have more time to do your job.

128
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,140
If you're that stock
analyst on the day to day

129
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:33,720
and the incidents happening
now, your time costs more.

130
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,570
It takes more resources it's
burning people out more.

131
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,349
So we need to make sure that
we're getting the results

132
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,850
when time costs less
but during the periods,

133
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,890
when time costs more.

134
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,960
Now some of the tools that
we started using to do this

135
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,789
and I really wanna give
a shout out to CTID

136
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,800
I've been amazed at how much
I've seen this grow over

137
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,680
the last couple years
from when Richard came up

138
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,860
and announced it to where it is today,

139
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,280
just the amount of projects.

140
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,130
So, one thing we did was we needed a place

141
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,219
where we could start
putting this information

142
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,840
and where we could start
tweaking the framework.

143
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,090
And I hope you've all taken
a look and if you haven't,

144
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,489
you can do so after this,

145
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,110
at the ATT&CK Workbench,
because basically,

146
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:23,390
it allows you to work in
naturally with the sticks objects

147
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,770
and be able to customize things,
create your own relations.

148
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,880
It has an area for notes where
you expand, it's very useful

149
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,469
and it has a REST API that comes with it.

150
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,630
So they literally did
all the hard work for us.

151
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,710
(Ivan laughs)

152
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,669
And so we were able to use that REST API

153
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,370
to automate a lot of this interaction

154
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:48,030
and to automate the, keeping
the collection sorted.

155
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,380
So now I'm gonna turn it over to Andy.

156
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,860
- Thank you very much.

157
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,540
Which one's the non laser?

158
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,830
Oh, top one.

159
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,830
- Yes.
- Okay.

160
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,450
Okay. So just 30 second overview of SOAR.

161
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,490
I know it's a kind of new technology

162
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,100
that everyone's come across it yet.

163
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,180
Just one slide.

164
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,690
The point of SOAR and the
kind of area I work in

165
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,380
is I can empathize quite well

166
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,030
'cause come from a stock
background is we ingest alerts

167
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,750
whether that's through
Seam Technology directly

168
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,050
whether it's via case management

169
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,240
whether phone, call,
email, that kind of thing

170
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,280
we bring it in and we
basically normalize it.

171
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,330
We pass it through a playbook.

172
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,140
The playbook can be
anything, it can do anything.

173
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,780
It will talk to the rest of your kit

174
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,919
and it will do asset
lookups, threat lookups,

175
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,550
historical data lookups, et cetera.

176
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,800
And then finally, on the right hand side,

177
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,860
we present you a case view.

178
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,940
So the idea is instead
of logging in and seeing

179
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,828
a Log Line and this is what I'm gonna do

180
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:38,968
for the next 40 seconds
of copy paste Tab on Tab.

181
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:43,770
Here is a colorful
populated executive report

182
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:44,790
for an analyst to say, right?

183
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,810
I understand the case.

184
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:46,899
I understand all the relations,

185
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:50,140
all the context, let's go
straight to the decision making.

186
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,370
So with a even quicker
than an elevator pitch on

187
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,060
what SOAR is, how do we start using MITRE?

188
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,050
So really, I suppose for me,

189
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,969
my five or six minutes of
fame today here on the stage

190
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,730
is to say, thanks to MITRE team.

191
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,829
I love ATT&CK.

192
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:04,888
I love what it does,

193
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:07,350
but also a bit of a
thank you to all vendors

194
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,699
that actually put the ATT&CK codes in

195
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:10,930
because that's what I
want to look at today

196
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,729
is how are we consuming alerts

197
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,300
and turning that into
something useful, really?

198
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,420
So the first thing we do,
quite standard really,

199
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,540
is a simple case Level Enrichment.

200
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,829
So on the left, our alert
had the MITRE code in

201
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:23,579
and on the right let's give the analyst

202
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:26,060
a nice, pretty version of the mitigations,

203
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,500
the explanation, here's a Hard link

204
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,890
so you can start pivoting and searching.

205
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,990
So for me, this is quite simple.

206
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,029
I come through this a whoop
Question Mark, it's kind of cool

207
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:36,699
but I think where it gets a
little bit more exciting is

208
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:39,349
where we look at the way

209
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,129
that different technologies
do Case Grouping.

210
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:44,160
And for us, that's basically
many ways if we do it

211
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,459
but one of those ways is
looking at the entities.

212
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:47,459
So in this case, on the left,

213
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:51,219
we actually have the Explorer
View of a particular case.

214
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,189
And in this case, without going
too much into the details,

215
00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:55,899
we had three alerts on the right.

216
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:57,850
The first one is an Out of Hours Log On

217
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,399
for one of the users.

218
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,930
So logging in at a suspicious time.

219
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,998
The second one was actually
a Network Protocol Violation.

220
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:09,220
So someone's trying to use
IRC or someone is using IRC.

221
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,300
The third one was a Malware Alert.

222
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,439
So something, but like
an AV, it could be a DLP.

223
00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:14,439
It could be IPS, it could be a phone call.

224
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:15,439
It could be absolutely anything.

225
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:18,500
But as those alerts
come to a SOAR platform

226
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,189
what we can start to look
at those and say, well,

227
00:10:20,189 --> 00:10:21,740
actually they've all got a bit in common.

228
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,550
Maybe this is a story, a case.

229
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,859
So, and on the round side,

230
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,029
we can see that each one of those alerts

231
00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:29,649
has an ATT&CK ID, which is fantastic.

232
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:32,059
But even if we have to add
that by hand, it still works.

233
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:34,589
If we then go and do
enrichments and add it later on,

234
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:35,589
it still works.

235
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:36,589
But like I said, in the ideal world,

236
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:39,180
I'd like to see every
alert with an ATT&CK ID

237
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,219
and that really helps
with what we do next.

238
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,309
So the first thing we basically
put in at the POC level

239
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:49,459
a while ago was mapping
that to the Framework,

240
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:51,930
because if we are now automatically
grouping all the alerts

241
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,258
and when analyst comes in grabs coffee

242
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:55,509
it's like, "Good morning," sits down

243
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:57,360
they open the first case straight away.

244
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,389
They can see that, that
kind of dynamic alignment to

245
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:02,060
the Framework.

246
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:05,089
So straight off, what have we detected?

247
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:07,029
If the detections come to us,

248
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:09,330
then actually that's not that
bad because we spotted it.

249
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,160
So we'll rate that as an Amber.

250
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,480
If in this case, we
don't have the detection,

251
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,870
that's gonna be a red.

252
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,190
And if it's after the latest detection

253
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,389
then it may not have happened.

254
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:20,180
So we'll leave that as an undetected.

255
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,680
So this was the first thing we put in.

256
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,769
So the first thing you do,
you open a case," Ah, okay.

257
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:26,180
I can understand where we
are, where we are blind

258
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,309
maybe where I want to go
practically hunting next."

259
00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:32,719
What we then started to do
was take that a bit stronger

260
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,540
by actually starting to put,

261
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,540
where do you think your
environment is strong?

262
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,199
Where do you think your mitigations are?

263
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,370
Obviously no, mitigation is always a 100%,

264
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,550
we have to play it safe.

265
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,990
So in this case, we could
configure an environment to say,

266
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,010
this is where we think we're mitigated.

267
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,249
And then the next thing
was to take the last image

268
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:50,589
that the kind of very high level

269
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:53,449
and start actually making look
a little bit more like a tax,

270
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:54,878
so people are a bit more familiar with it,

271
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:55,879
filling out the columns

272
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,749
probably needs a little bit more CSS,

273
00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:01,670
needs to be a little bit
shinier, but there, you can see

274
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,519
that in this particular case,
we had all the different IDs.

275
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:05,519
And so we're mapping that in.

276
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,059
So again, as the analyst comes in,

277
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,740
I can see not only where
we've found the visibility,

278
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,759
but where we've had the visibility

279
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,779
and we think we've got
mitigations in play.

280
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:15,240
So that was one of the next things we did.

281
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,470
Now at this point, I started to think,

282
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,279
wouldn't it be really
good if we could start to

283
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:23,319
not predict where those spots are

284
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:25,510
where we've not had the
visibility, but maybe there's a

285
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,369
a machine learning way to look at

286
00:12:27,369 --> 00:12:29,160
the most likely place to start searching.

287
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,149
And I had started having a chat with Ivan.

288
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:32,709
He said, "Have you not
heard of MITRE Sightings?"

289
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:34,319
I was like, "No, I have not."

290
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,670
So we started looking into that

291
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,761
and it is absolutely a perfect fit.

292
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:40,639
So what we're doing there,
and this is, as Ivan said,

293
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,639
"This is not a roadmap."

294
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:43,310
This is just a concept we're
kind of playing with now.

295
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,459
So big shout out to MITRE

296
00:12:45,459 --> 00:12:47,160
for all the new things we're doing.

297
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,500
But here's a way to
basically say right here

298
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,730
are all the different campaigns.

299
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,110
Here's all the sightings
of ATT&CK IDs together.

300
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,490
So here we can see we've
got two campaigns listed

301
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,249
and then comparing what we
have found against that.

302
00:12:57,249 --> 00:13:00,199
So in this case, just using
the sample data we found on

303
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:01,910
I think is the GitHub page.

304
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,380
We can see that the ABC 9,
8, 7 had one out of two hits

305
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,980
and we can start to see that.

306
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,290
And then maybe the DT 1, 2, 3,
4 had none outta three hits.

307
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,490
So as that data set gets bigger,

308
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,990
as we're dynamically pulling
that in, we can start to

309
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,329
as you hover over them,
coloring all the red spots

310
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,020
of maybe where you want to go hunting.

311
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,819
So I think that'd be a great one.

312
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,059
Obviously as the data set gets bigger

313
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:24,009
we can start to make
more value out of that.

314
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:25,420
And then really to close
that off and again,

315
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,550
this is just something we're playing with

316
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,660
is the, basically the Feedback Loop.

317
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,240
So we consume the data, we
apply it to all the cases

318
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,240
as they come in, as they're grouped,

319
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,399
as we present it to the analyst.

320
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,009
But then when we go to close the case,

321
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:38,009
we are gonna assume that

322
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:40,040
that is the maximum visibility you've got.

323
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,699
So maybe there's a level of sanitization.

324
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:42,849
Maybe we can push it back

325
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,990
and then maybe that feeds
back into the circle.

326
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,619
So hopefully one day in the future

327
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:48,910
we could be here showing
you that working in action

328
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:52,040
if we can get that into the Devs

329
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,360
and get the company in with that.

330
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,619
So that's something we're
playing with, but yeah

331
00:13:54,619 --> 00:13:56,889
just like to show you
where we're going with it

332
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:00,420
and how I think it can be really useful.

333
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,139
Thank you very much.

334
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:04,509
(audience clapping)

335
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:08,290
- I gotta say this was one
of our favorite submissions

336
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,290
just 'cause the creativity

337
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,480
and how much went into the theme of this.

338
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,509
So thank you so much.

339
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:13,399
I think we have time for one question,

340
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,880
and I'm really, I had it
on the tip of my tongue,

341
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,290
the entire talk and you
addressed it towards the end

342
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,290
- Yeah.

343
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,969
- but one of the things we've
seen is really important

344
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,439
with exactly, as you said with enrichments

345
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:24,368
and kind of exactly what
you were highlighting

346
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:27,829
the problem of keeping all the
instruments in the orchestra

347
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:30,790
in tune and aligned how, you know,

348
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,649
like closing that feedback loop,

349
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:35,139
what any advice there in terms of

350
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:37,610
other particular questions,
is it side sidling

351
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,209
your analyst to see how
they respond to things,

352
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:42,248
or how does one really make sure that

353
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:43,750
we were pushing something
and this is kind of

354
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,660
the visualization and we expect that

355
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,098
we really are tuning that over time.

356
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:49,300
- I'll take that.

357
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,139
I really think it comes down to

358
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:53,440
what's been brought up before
which is you wanna start

359
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,300
thinking about things, risk
based to your environment.

360
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,699
One thing I'm really big about

361
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,279
is looking at what you're detecting,

362
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,059
what you might not be detecting,

363
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:09,149
compared to say what
vulnerabilities you might have

364
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:10,259
in your environment,

365
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:12,660
making sure you have
your asset of inventories

366
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,339
and then being able to make those risk

367
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:18,240
or suggestions when
you're trying to triage

368
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,029
and when you're trying to do those things.

369
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:22,970
So that's my biggest, is
know your environment,

370
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,529
know what tools you have
and then find the gaps

371
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:29,079
where you may not have the coverage

372
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:30,359
but make sure that you're looking

373
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,519
at that vulnerability,
that asset inventory.

374
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,589
Because if in the end,

375
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:37,550
if you're not making
decisions based on your risk,

376
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,800
then you're not making
decisions for your own company

377
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,660
or whoever you're servicing,

378
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,189
you're just making random decisions

379
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,239
and that's a bad thing.

380
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:45,239
(all laughs)

381
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:46,619
- Yeah. Random can go very wrong.

382
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:47,319
Thank you.
