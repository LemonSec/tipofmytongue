1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,700
- For our spinal speakers

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,760
can I have Jamie switch roles

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,900
and become those speakers
where he now be joined

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,740
by Mike Hartley, both from
the MITRE ATTACK team.

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,750
So take it away guys.

6
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:11,980
- Thanks Adam.

7
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,320
And like I said, this
is Jamie Williams here.

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,920
I'm here with my friend Mike Hartley,

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,110
and we're giving you an update

10
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,960
from the ATTACK team on what's
happening with PRE-ATTACK.

11
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,670
So it has been a truly
crazy 2020 in many ways.

12
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,770
And even just for the ATTACK team

13
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,960
you know, we started the
year doing sub techniques.

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,000
We released beta,

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,960
we released the final and
I believe it was July.

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,590
We've been growing cloud.

17
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,520
And then recently we
released the network platform

18
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,423
as well as ICS as in sticks.

19
00:00:39,316 --> 00:00:42,290
So if you been like anyone
in the ATTACK consumer

20
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,410
you might've noticed in
the most recent release

21
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,379
that, you know, an ATTACK
normally grows vertically

22
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,640
you know, we see new techniques,
you set techniques, but

23
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,693
in this release ATTACK for
Enterprise got a little wider.

24
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,730
And this is because we merged
the previous PRE-ATTACK matrix

25
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,562
into Enterprise.

26
00:00:57,563 --> 00:00:59,910
So Mike and I are gonna give
you a little more detail

27
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,029
on what happened there

28
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,680
as well as some transparency and insight

29
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,330
into the decision-making
that went into this process.

30
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,870
So first off, you know, this
didn't happen overnight.

31
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,140
This wasn't something that we just

32
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,220
you know, decided this year

33
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,179
and implemented you might've
seen this graphic previously.

34
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,760
This is actually, this was included.

35
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,880
This entire idea

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,880
for this merger was
included in our 2020 roadmap

37
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,130
as well as if you followed
ATTACK on last year

38
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,310
Adam actually presented an introduction

39
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,250
for what we were thinking here.

40
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,090
So, you know

41
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,710
big picture, you know, this
is something that's been kinda

42
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,009
on our minds for a while.

43
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,200
And, you know, it just
just has been implemented

44
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,283
as a version eight, this most
recent release of ATTACK.

45
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,390
So a little background about PRE-ATTACK.

46
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,440
It was initially released

47
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,970
in 2017 as a separate
matrix from Enterprise.

48
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,510
So it had its own 17 tactics.

49
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,000
Long story short is when you
think about a kill chain.

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,410
Enterprise typically focuses

51
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,899
on what we call post compromise

52
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,490
or right of boom, where
PRE-ATTACK was kinda thinking

53
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,360
left of boom, you know

54
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,429
the behaviors that an
adversary would execute leading

55
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,330
up to compromise.

56
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,810
So thinking of things like,

57
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,030
you know, deciding on
targeting, deciding on,

58
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,440
you know, what are the
priorities are, you know

59
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,009
gathering information about
their victim, you know

60
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,220
staging and developing
resources, things like that.

61
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,060
And Pre-ATTACK really opened up

62
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,180
some really interesting use cases.

63
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,770
You know, most importantly, you know

64
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,070
how do you get ahead of a
breach, you know, as a defender

65
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,519
how can I see artifacts

66
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,400
of an adversary getting ready to target me

67
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,250
whether it be, you know

68
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,710
setting up domains, you know,
tracking bottleneck activity.

69
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,350
These are really important considerations

70
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,370
especially when we start thinking

71
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,340
about open source,
intelligent requirements

72
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,290
like, you know, where
do we need to look for?

73
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,410
And, you know, in the public space

74
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,980
to actually start seeing, you know

75
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,929
adversary activity before it's
actually in our environment.

76
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,450
And, you know, and like I said before

77
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,929
this wasn't something
that happened overnight

78
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,960
you know, dating all the way
back to version two of ATTACK

79
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,650
in 2018, we actually started to pull bits

80
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,610
and pieces of PRE-ATTACK
over into Enterprise.

81
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,000
You know, particularly in this case

82
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,320
the initial access tactic
was actually populated

83
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,150
from two tactics that were previously

84
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,110
in pre, you know, launch and compromise.

85
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,430
So like I said, this is
something that's, you know

86
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,120
we've kind of wanted the

87
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,440
I had the desire to kinda bring these two

88
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,770
you know, pre and post compromise

89
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,970
major sees and thoughts together, you know

90
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,920
and finally in version eight,
we've actually achieved that.

91
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,630
So like I said, this
most recent release of

92
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,120
ATTACK version eight

93
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,720
we've officially deprecated
the PRE-ATTACK matrix.

94
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,270
It is still available, you know, via

95
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,080
VR versioning, but, you
know, going version eight

96
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,240
and forward PRE-ATTACK is
deprecated and has been replaced

97
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,210
by the PRE platform and Enterprise.

98
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,910
So, you know, PRE will sit next to,

99
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,660
you know, windows, Mac,
iOS, Linux, network cloud

100
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,859
all those other platforms
within Enterprise.

101
00:03:34,197 --> 00:03:36,331
As you can see in the
graphic on the bottom right

102
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:39,670
is a perfect example

103
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,480
of highlighting this, you
know, PRE-ATTACK was huge.

104
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,030
You know, we did quite, we had to do a lot

105
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,660
of re-scoping, a lot of
downs to like to get it

106
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,930
into the two tactics that
are now in Enterprise.

107
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,010
And just kinda giving
you some transparency

108
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,160
into the thought process
that went into that

109
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,820
to kinda match everything
currently in Enterprise,

110
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,290
we had three main criteria

111
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,730
for, you know, translating
these techniques.

112
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,970
First of which was the
behavior had to be technical.

113
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,480
It had to be something
that an adversary is doing

114
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,239
with a host or a system or something

115
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,600
you know, it just kinda
leads something technical

116
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,650
which leads to our second point.

117
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,460
You know, it had to be
something that was visible

118
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,310
to a defender, you know, as
you know, it's great to think

119
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,579
about, you know, adversaries,
you know, making decisions

120
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:17,919
and kinda having their own board meetings

121
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,760
and kinda, you know,
defining the priorities

122
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,329
but, you know, to match
the rest Enterprise

123
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,378
that's not something we're gonna see.

124
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:24,380
It's not something we can
actually defend against.

125
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,700
So it really,

126
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,190
unfortunately didn't have
a place in Enterprise.

127
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,750
And finally, in the spirit of ATTACK

128
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,010
everything is based on, you
know, open source in the wild

129
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,900
it had to be something that
we actually had evidence

130
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,560
of, you know, seeing adversaries do this.

131
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,140
So it kinda, as you can see

132
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,560
you know, the technical
aspect being visible

133
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,880
all that cascades into that
in the wild documentation

134
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,870
public reporting criteria

135
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,870
that we use to build the rest of ATTACK.

136
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,520
So, like I said, finally,
the final merger, you know

137
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,430
we've pulled initial access before

138
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,810
and then the final merger
included the creation

139
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,580
of two new tactics, as you
can see in the bottom right.

140
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,580
Reconnaissance and resource development.

141
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,480
So kinda just diving into the first tactic

142
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,333
reconnaissance, you can kinda think

143
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,670
of this as, you know, pre
compromised discovery.

144
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,310
This is an adversary, you know, actively

145
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,370
or passively gathering
information that they're gonna use

146
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,750
during targeting, you know, in terms

147
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,330
of just stats, you know,
reconnaissance is 10 techniques

148
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,510
31 sub techniques, and really
interesting nuance about it

149
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,909
is it split into two
categories more or less.

150
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,727
There's the, you know, what, you know

151
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:26,280
what information is the
adversary, you know gathering,

152
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,239
whether it's about your
host, your infrastructure

153
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,580
your personnel, you kinda
think of those as well as how.

154
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,479
You know, how has an
adversary actually gathering

155
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,440
gathering this information?

156
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,580
Are they scanning forward?

157
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,310
Are they sending you fishing probes?

158
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,010
Or are they, you know, kinda triaging

159
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,560
and combing through publicly
available information.

160
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,349
- Thanks, the resource
development tactic is focused

161
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,343
on an adversary trying
to establish resources

162
00:05:52,343 --> 00:05:55,690
they can use to support operations.

163
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,410
So that includes techniques that all

164
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,070
the adversaries creating,
purchasing, or compromising

165
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,030
and stealing resources that can be used

166
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,020
to support targeting.

167
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,780
Resources here include
infrastructure such as

168
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,799
buying or compromising servers or domains,

169
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,750
accounts such as creating or
compromising email accounts

170
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,250
or creating and developing
a social media persona

171
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,250
and capabilities such as developing

172
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,960
or downloading malware exploits.

173
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,620
While there are six new techniques

174
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,040
and 26 sub techniques here,

175
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,110
please don't let that scare you.

176
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,560
There's a parallelism among
and within techniques that

177
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,733
helps make use of these more manageable.

178
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,969
As part of this release,

179
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,460
we've also added a new pre-platform tag

180
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,989
as these behaviors taught
fit easily into windows, Mac

181
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:45,772
iOS, Linux, cloud network, or
any other existing platform.

182
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,570
We've also added a new
pre-compromised mitigation.

183
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,300
As often these behaviors are

184
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,530
outside the scope of preventative measures

185
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,912
and Enterprise defender
can typically take.

186
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,237
For detections and data sources,

187
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:01,360
as Jamie said,

188
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,930
everything going in here is
as opposed to some defenders

189
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:09,340
but many are not observable
to most Enterprise defenders.

190
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,900
We've highlighted some
data sources and detections

191
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,950
in cases where there are
detections applicable

192
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,120
to a broad set of defenders

193
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,820
such as using domain registration

194
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,190
information to detect
adversaries purchasing domains

195
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,050
including things like
monitoring for domains

196
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,210
registered that are similar to your own

197
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:28,250
that might be used for something like

198
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,463
credential harvesting.

199
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,560
In some cases we also have pointers

200
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,910
to related post-compromised

201
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,823
behaviors where detection
efforts may be more fruitful.

202
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,740
So why do this?

203
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,900
We hope to promote community adoption

204
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,349
and contributions around
tracking adversary

205
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:47,550
reconnaissance and resource
development efforts,

206
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,970
and to have more integration

207
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,673
across the wider spectrum
of adversary behaviors.

208
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,830
As Jamie mentioned for
the version eight release

209
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,340
we have deprecated PRE-ATTACK.

210
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,289
However, previous versions

211
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,610
of ATTACK will retain
the PRE-ATTACK matrix

212
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,620
in case you aren't ready to
make the switch quite yet.

213
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,380
So you can still use PRE-ATTACK
in version 7.2 and earlier

214
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,193
on our website in the sticks
and in the ATTACK navigator.

215
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,080
So how can you help?

216
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,820
As we said, ATTACK is very
focused on the community.

217
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,630
So feedback and contributions
would be greatly appreciated.

218
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,420
Looking through things like new techniques

219
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,000
or scoping of existing techniques,

220
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,280
documentation of potential
detections and mitigations,

221
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,199
and of course reported instances of

222
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,033
in the wild adversary procedure examples.

223
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,920
Lastly, we wanna give a special thanks

224
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,469
to a few people,

225
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,340
including MITRE's Ingrid Parker

226
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,700
for working with the ATTACK
team to develop the criteria

227
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,430
for determining what PRE-ATTACK
behaviors could assimilate

228
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,489
into Enterprised ATTACK.

229
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,080
We also want to give special thanks

230
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,460
to former ATTACK team
member, Katie Nichols

231
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,840
along with current head
of ATTACK, Adam Pennington

232
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,540
for white boarding sessions
to determine the techniques

233
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,140
and sub techniques that
fit those criteria.

234
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,640
And lastly, thank you to Kristen Asbeck

235
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,040
for leading the creation of PRE-ATTACK

236
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,620
which much of this work was based on.

237
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,870
And that folks is how we
helped put the PRE into ATTACK.

238
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,840
Thank you and back over to you Jamie.

239
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,130
- And I'm just gonna thank everyone again

240
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,170
for joining ATTACKcon as
well as I know in advance

241
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,430
for all the contributions
to the pre-effort.

242
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,449
And with that, I'll turn it over

243
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,850
back to Adam for a sign off.

244
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,910
- And thank you guys

245
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,470
Mike and Jamie will be available
for questions in the Slack.

246
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,530
Jamie's not gonna ask
himself questions today.

247
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,180
Thank you again to all today's speakers

248
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,540
and for everyone for joining us.

249
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,520
There's been some great
discussions in the Slack

250
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,030
which hopefully will keep
going after we're done here.

251
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,600
Links to videos and slides
from today will be emailed

252
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,480
to everyone who registered
once their ready

253
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,900
to be put online.

254
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,523
And we'll be getting those
out to everybody as well.

255
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,580
Please join us for the next ATTACKcon

256
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,710
power hour on December 11th.

257
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,480
Registration is open today

258
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,373
and thank you again for joining us.
