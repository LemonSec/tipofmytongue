00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:03,610
- Hello everyone and welcome
to Attack Con Power Hour.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:04,859
My name is Brandon Levene,

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,980
and I'm with Google Clouds

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,300
threat Intelligence Team, uppercase.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,100
Today we'll be discussing a
threat group known as TA505.

6
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:14,550
Thanks for point, exploring their big game

7
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,850
hunting operations in the
context of their TTPs.

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,040
Targeted ransomware deployments,

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,180
are the new scourge of
enterprises across the globe.

10
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,880
The shift of ransomware as a
primary monetization scheme,

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,020
provides tremendous
benefit to threat actors,

12
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,040
who no longer have to write up off,

13
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,172
upwards of 70% of their
profits via a complex network,

14
00:00:31,172 --> 00:00:34,750
of money mules and laundry.

15
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,730
In order to maximize return on investment,

16
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,029
threat actors now
accurately orient themselves

17
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,880
to their targets.

18
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,920
In order to identify those
that are capable of paying.

19
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,560
This speeds businesses, governments,

20
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,560
government's municipalities,
schools and hospitals.

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,980
This talk will be broken into four parts,

22
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,739
there'll be context and background,

23
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,360
thread actor processes,

24
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,533
operational details, and
lessons learned and takeaways.

25
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,853
Let's begin with some
context and background.

26
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,020
They are a customer of Dridex
banking Trojan and users

27
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,759
of broadly targeted ransomware
families such as Locky

28
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,440
between 2014 and 2017.

29
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,850
They're not the developers of these tools.

30
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,110
That would be EvilCorp,

31
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,830
thanks until four 71 per point

32
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,003
and NCC for that disambiguation,

33
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,580
TA505 moved on from
bespoke banking Trojans

34
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,740
and non-targeted ransomware in 2018.

35
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,190
They begin to favor more
traditional backdoors

36
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,200
for achieving access into
targets of opportunity.

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,600
Through our doctors iterated rapidly

38
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,660
in both its initial loaders
and secondary payloads.

39
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,600
By late 2019, they settled
on solely in house tooling.

40
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,610
They've been using the
clop ransomware families

41
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,429
since February, 2019

42
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,360
and there don't appear
to be any other users.

43
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,820
So it's suspected that this
is an in house ransomware

44
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,913
family as well.

45
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,523
since 2018, TA505 activity has led to,

46
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,049
multiple high profile victims

47
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,120
in the Netherlands,
Germany, Korea and more.

48
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,050
Unfortunately headlines
really do tell the tale here.

49
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,630
Ransomware plus data leak
is a very strong threat

50
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,603
and it is a natural pair.

51
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,440
With some background out of the way

52
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,303
let's move into what TA505 looks like now.

53
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,170
So credit to the French National
Cyber Security Agency ANTSY

54
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,390
for creating a great visual representation

55
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,519
of the initial intrusion TTPs for TA505.

56
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,240
So TA505 generally follows
a well established pattern

57
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,400
in their initial intrusion process.

58
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,000
This is composed of
roughly five or six steps.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,780
Efficient email, social
engineering no exploits,

60
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,640
a user intervention is required here.

61
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,179
That attachment or Lincoln
said phishing email,

62
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,300
Which then redirects

63
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,100
to a legit what compromised
domain typically WordPress,

64
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,420
that compromised domain redirects usually

65
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,640
with some embedded
victim verification logic

66
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,820
AKA gate, much like an exploit
kit to a malicious domain.

67
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,900
And finally that malicious
domain drops an office document,

68
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,250
with embedded macros
and binary is actually.

69
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,140
Again, user intervention as required,

70
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,559
just to reiterate this
diagram is only covering,

71
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,430
the initial efforts of TA505 goes through,

72
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,973
just to land on target.

73
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,399
So now that we have a good understanding,

74
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,040
of the multiple intricate steps,

75
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,679
TA505 goes through to land on target,

76
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,770
let's take a deeper look

77
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,563
at how this activity actually looks.

78
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,530
Here's the first thing
that target we'll see

79
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,440
from TA505, starting from the left.

80
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,160
On the left we have some German
language spearfishing email.

81
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,890
This is fairly recent
with an HTML attachment.

82
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,940
If anybody wants to
translate what this says,

83
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,850
I don't speak German, so feel free.

84
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,410
On the right hand side, we
actually have the contents

85
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,320
of the HTML fishing attachment

86
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,940
that was that show an embedded link

87
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,950
with a fig error and various
nonessential padding.

88
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,899
The only part of this HTML file,

89
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,220
that matters is that
embedded source equals sign.

90
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,890
And that was pointing to a compromised

91
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,453
but legitimate WordPress site.

92
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:33,683
Apologies for the delay.

93
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,950
After user interacts with
the spear fishing attachment

94
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,140
and goes through the
entire redirection chain

95
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,229
in the browser.

96
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,730
And we'll just document typically,

97
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,110
a Microsoft Excel file
is forced downloaded,

98
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,600
to the user's machine.

99
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,593
The user must then click
on this very enticing file,

100
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:57,150
a very interesting file
and enable content macros.

101
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,609
Which required two clicks in
modern versions of office.

102
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,810
I believe starting in 20, 2016,

103
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,330
but I'm not sure when
that actually started.

104
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,590
The Lore documents have
undergone various degrees

105
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,729
of iteration to try and trick
users into allowing macros.

106
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,220
on the left you see one
of their earlier examples,

107
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,700
on the right end in the middle

108
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,830
you see a more sophisticated
social engineering lore

109
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,229
but the point is the same.

110
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,480
The user must click at least twice

111
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,283
at this point in order
to get code executing.

112
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,330
Thanks to hatching triage

113
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,500
for the lovely sandbox report here.

114
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,080
When a user allows the macros

115
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,719
and the XLS document to execute
to DLL files are written

116
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,430
to a folder in the app data directory.

117
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,930
These are a 32 bit

118
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:47,320
and 64 bit version of the same
tool known as get two loader.

119
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,440
This iS TA505 downloader

120
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,753
of choice that appears to
have been developed in house.

121
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,110
Once the DLLs embedded

122
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,500
in the malicious XLS document are written,

123
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,040
internal logic of the macro,

124
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,360
determines whether to execute the 32 bit

125
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,170
or 64 bit version based
on the operating system.

126
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,730
The selected DLL is injected

127
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,640
into the already running Excel process.

128
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,479
So in order to be traditional detections,

129
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,270
that rely on parent-child oddities,

130
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,539
we can see in the top
photo Excel connecting

131
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,620
to an external IP as a result
of the get to loader DLL,

132
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,170
being executed and injected.

133
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,620
The bottom image shows the HTP post body

134
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,610
which has been SSL decrepted

135
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,960
that is sent back to the
attackers command controls.

136
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,049
So we see things like
computer name, username,

137
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,970
OS, It believes the architecture here.

138
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,543
So it's x86 and a process list.

139
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,900
So not everyone will get the step,

140
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,370
depending on what is sent
back in the HTP post body,

141
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,310
of the get to loader callback.

142
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,160
The threat actors can decide
to push an additional payload,

143
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,560
which is their full
backdoor known as SDB bot.

144
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,380
In this image, we see STB
bot establishing persistence,

145
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,570
by writing code to the windows registry,

146
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,820
and adding an image file execution option

147
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,659
to winlogon.exe.

148
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,423
This ensures that the malware
executes on every start.

149
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,420
Well SDP bot is the main
backdoor tool used by TA505.

150
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,460
At this point in time, the threat actors,

151
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,229
when opting to interact
with the victim manually,

152
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,560
we'll typically use a
more interactive implant,

153
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,740
such as tiny met or beacon.

154
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,630
And this image, we see a tiny side,

155
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,870
tiny mid-stage or stub,

156
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,650
which is used for pivoting
inside a victim network

157
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:42,630
and for various reconstitute activities

158
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,650
including mapping permissions
groups and privileged users.

159
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,950
Many organizations assume

160
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,610
that a signed binary is
an indication of trust.

161
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,700
That is false.

162
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,770
A signed file simply means it
is cryptographically intact.

163
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,440
So you could have
cryptographically intact malware

164
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,790
which is what you see here.

165
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,460
And finally, when it
comes to the end game,

166
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,210
when a victim is considered viable,

167
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,820
and the manual recon
and staging is complete,

168
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,610
a ransomware payload is
deployed most typically clop.

169
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,310
Here we see an example ransom note,

170
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,200
written as a simple TXT file

171
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,900
which pops up all the hosts
after encryption has finished.

172
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,580
This is a pretty typical ransomnote

173
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,090
that requests the victim's contact

174
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,599
the threat actor for
payment and negotiations.

175
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,760
Interestingly, they do not appear to set

176
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,030
up accounts per victim.

177
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,520
I don't know if that's still the case.

178
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,299
I believe it still is but
this is can actually be noted

179
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:36,650
in one of the later points
in this ransom note.

180
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:43,689
As a small bonus TA505 is one
of the many big game hunters,

181
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,920
actors that uses the
threat of data leakage

182
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,500
as a strong arm tactic to
entice victims, to pay a ransom

183
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,210
they threatened to publish
files on a dedicated leak site.

184
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,640
In the event a customer does not pay.

185
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,750
This tactic has been adopted
by many, ransomware families,

186
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,863
and has been devastatingly effective.

187
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,979
This has not been mapped to my talk yet,

188
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,010
but I'm gonna work on actually
getting this particular

189
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,423
technique might map to the impact section.

190
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,400
Now that we've seen a high level example

191
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,660
of the way various TTPs fit together

192
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,990
let's discuss what can be learned

193
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,743
by studying this redactor.

194
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,610
Complimenting defense in depth,

195
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,200
with detection of depth
is crucial to protecting,

196
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,360
a modern enterprise.

197
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,860
Studying TTPs with an eye toward
interdiction opportunities.

198
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,220
Where should I see X?

199
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,140
How could I stop Y?

200
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,830
Why should it be your organization's

201
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,520
plan when considering how best to

202
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,620
use miter attack?

203
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,210
Detecting the ransomware is too late.

204
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,180
A long chain of activity proceeded

205
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,000
the ransomware deployment.

206
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,450
And finally a talker she was a
blend of tools and techniques

207
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,080
open source or red team tools
on GitHub are no less capable

208
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,380
of getting the job done.

209
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,420
And are arguably a higher ROI,

210
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,810
and significantly more
acceptable, accessible.

211
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,642
Thank you.

212
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,760
And I'll hand it back to Jamie.

213
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,260
- Awesome thank you
Brandon that was fantastic.

214
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,240
I think one of the unintended unplanned

215
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,620
like themes of the day was the human

216
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,220
behind the keyboard
and how much that plays

217
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,380
into these attacks

218
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,460
And make your presentation
here really kind of highlighted

219
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,470
that with the optimistic nature of it.

220
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,730
It's like, the initial
access that you went through

221
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,480
was all based on users,
clicking things they shouldn't,

222
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,250
enabling things that, otherwise,

223
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,090
defenses otherwise would protect,

224
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,560
what are your thoughts on, as a community,

225
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,500
what can we do in terms
of, minimizing that?

226
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,930
So like you said, the
full chain of behaviors,

227
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,479
that kind of spun from
that one bad decision,

228
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,670
what can we do with the community,

229
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,870
to kind of minimize the impact

230
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,420
or the, the likelihood of that?

231
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,920
- So I think really one
of the, main takeaways

232
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,479
for me is that studying the
way the TTPs fit together

233
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,724
is of paramount importance.

234
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:55,540
And, and we've sort of espoused this idea

235
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,150
of defense in depth, but
that hasn't really kept pace

236
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,040
with the concept of detection of depth.

237
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,630
We're in you need to
consider, how can I see this?

238
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,060
Where can I stop that?

239
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,160
And how could I stop why?

240
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,630
And those are really critical questions,

241
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,430
to consider when creating
a detection program,

242
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:12,489
and wider talk is a great
guideline to help inform,

243
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,990
those sorts of sorts of decisions.

244
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:17,170
As Brian mentioned earlier was talking,

245
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,270
there was a lot of art behind the science

246
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,170
and a little bit of science to the art

247
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,880
but I think it is really important

248
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,189
to understand how the big
picture really fits together.

249
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:31,040
Because, when you start to try
to detect us that ransomware

250
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,250
you have missed, five or six,

251
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,588
different introduction opportunities

252
00:11:35,588 --> 00:11:36,420
- It's a great point,

253
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:39,450
It's like you said, plan for
the best, but assume the worst

254
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,700
and kind of like, I've know
all the steps along the path,

255
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,790
that you could possibly interject,

256
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,730
and have a detection opportunity.

257
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,840
That's a, It's really great advice.

258
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,673
Thank you.
