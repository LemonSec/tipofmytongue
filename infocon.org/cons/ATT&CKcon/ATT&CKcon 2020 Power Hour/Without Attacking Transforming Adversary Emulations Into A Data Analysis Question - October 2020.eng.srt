1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:04,610
- Next speaker is gonna be
Matan Hart with Cymptom.

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,160
- Thank you, Adam and
the entire ATT&CK team

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,920
for giving me the opportunity to present,

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,222
you're doing amazing job.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,623
Huge fan here.

6
00:00:16,312 --> 00:00:20,810
I'm going to talk about today
is how you can transform

7
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,849
Adversary Emulation into
Data Analysis Question

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,840
using the MITRE ATT&CK Framework

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,913
and specifically to mitigation
in the ATT&CK Framework.

10
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,320
About myself, usually I
look like in the picture

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,830
on the left side, but doing COVID,

12
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,120
I might look like this.

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,660
I'm the co founder and CEO
at Cymptom Security Startup

14
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,650
specializing in security testing,

15
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:50,239
I've been a security researcher
in the Israeli Defense Force

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,173
and as well as in the private sector,

17
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,340
some of my research I've been presented in

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,840
several security cons such as a Black Hat

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,350
and actually the
inspiration for the content

20
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,410
that I'm talking today is
based on my existing work,

21
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,220
building solutions

22
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,590
and conducting security
assessments for large organizations

23
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:15,863
And click.

24
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,443
Right, so let's start
with Adversary Emulation,

25
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:34,550
So Adversary Emulation, for
those of you who need recap

26
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,090
is the way that has been used popularly

27
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,380
one of the most useful use
cases for the ATT&CK Framework,

28
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,810
which is basically allowed organization

29
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,200
to test their defenses
against specific threats,

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,480
the ATT&CK Framework can be
very beneficial to measure test,

31
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,080
and then also make
improvements to defenses

32
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,410
based on the different
adversary tactics, techniques

33
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,963
and procedures.

34
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,370
But the problem with
Adversary Emulation is that

35
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:10,090
it doesn't scale nor it
wasn't intended to basically

36
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,180
the main focus of Adversary Emulation

37
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,330
is to test specific controls
in a controlled manner

38
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,970
that is very targeted specific network

39
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,133
and isolating specific threat.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The issue with it is that some
organization are looking up

41
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,370
still early on during their
work with the ATT&CK Framework

42
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,970
and they basically want to get an initial

43
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,510
state of whereas our
standing with our defenses

44
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,283
and against the metrics.

45
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,130
And what I've seen that
basically some organization

46
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,433
are trying to emulate all attacks,

47
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:52,360
all in the network.

48
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,730
I've seen one time that
there was organization

49
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:59,730
with 50,000 endpoints where
as they needed to emulate

50
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,680
lateral movement technique used by an APT,

51
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,570
and they figured out only after they use

52
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,959
some kind of automation

53
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,400
that they literally emulated
two and a half billion

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,120
emulation because they
tested it from each computer

55
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,460
to all the other computers in the network.

56
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,510
So, it was a big number

57
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,429
and it's actually made a huge
disruption to their network.

58
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,450
So what I'm suggesting
is different approach

59
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,690
using the MITRE ATT&CK Metrics Framework

60
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,210
that basically instead of
checking detection capabilities

61
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,240
that are the most commonly
used with Adversary Emulation

62
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,240
is to basically look at the
aspect of the mitigation

63
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,028
of the attack framework.

64
00:03:51,028 --> 00:03:56,028
And testing each technique and
the associated mitigations,

65
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,850
if you're really have the
the right capabilities

66
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,850
to prevent the technique
before going on to detection.

67
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,660
So the mythology is I have four steps,

68
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,103
first of all choose an ATT&CK technique,

69
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,230
you should preferably choose
the technique that you feel

70
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,900
that you feel comfortable
that you want to test first,

71
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:24,580
if you're already have a mapped techniques

72
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,789
to detection capabilities,

73
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,730
so you should probably start
with something that you feel

74
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,930
that you don't have enough data sources

75
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,930
or detective capabilities in place,

76
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,969
then for the technique that you choose

77
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:43,400
you should test for each
mitigation how much it effective

78
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,140
because not all of the mitigation

79
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,650
that are in the ATT&CK Framework

80
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,650
are you using the same attack vector

81
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,540
or some of them are just reducing some

82
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,230
of the attack surface over
explorability of that technique

83
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,393
and some of them are truly
mitigated the technique entirely,

84
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,340
after you grasp those techniques
that you want to focus on,

85
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,120
you should map the data sources

86
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,380
that you can really
collect information needed

87
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,760
in order to validate the
applicability of that mitigation.

88
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,450
preferably you should do
it for all the mitigation

89
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,190
for that technique in order to make sure

90
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:28,480
that you're not missing any information,

91
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,480
but in generally as mentioned
also by previous speakers

92
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,289
before me it's not science,

93
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,380
yeah, the ATT&CK Framework

94
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,310
and you're gonna have
to be 100% all the time

95
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,140
and it's okay that even if you feel that

96
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,479
it's not 100% accurate

97
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,680
or don't have access
to all the information,

98
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,930
you can still be able to
have the initial states

99
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,390
to conclude if a specific
technique you are able

100
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,960
to prevent in your...

101
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,190
What is your current situation
during that technique

102
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,280
and how much he's
exploitable in your network,

103
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,559
not on specific endpoint rather
on the entire attack surface

104
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,633
inside a network.

105
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,890
Let's take a test case the
Pass The Hash scenario.

106
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,357
Basically Pass The Hash
is a Literal Movement

107
00:06:17,357 --> 00:06:21,590
and defense evasion technique
that allows an adversary

108
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,890
to move laterally between
endpoints based on a credential

109
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,200
that they can reuse

110
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,940
because they both have
the same credentials.

111
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,120
It's very common between endpoints

112
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,610
that are used by the same image

113
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,610
and the default Middleton users,
there password not changed

114
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,870
after they've been deployed

115
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,020
and something that is still very common

116
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,430
to see in organization

117
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,470
and it's something that
very hard to really know

118
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,820
what's been changed or not.

119
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,810
when we looking at the mitigation's
in the ATT&CK Framework

120
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,600
about the specific technique,

121
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,100
there are basically four
different mitigation

122
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,460
that offer different...

123
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,790
They have different ways
to mitigate this technique,

124
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,880
however, not all of them
are actually doing the same,

125
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,830
and also as their
exposure that how reducing

126
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,120
or eliminating is not the same.

127
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,450
So when you drill down
with the small letters,

128
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,539
first of all, you can understand

129
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,980
what is really need to be checked,

130
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,780
what data should be collected

131
00:07:28,938 --> 00:07:32,289
and then you can move on
to do a bit of research.

132
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,880
It's not something that it's very easy,

133
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,240
but we took here a case
that is more harder

134
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,430
as I've summed that up that mitigation

135
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,840
are more straightforward,

136
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,719
but when you check each
mitigation and specifically

137
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,280
you can see that their
effectiveness is always the same.

138
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,919
So of course, if you have
the capability to check,

139
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,530
if there's any type of credential overlap,

140
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,359
the first mitigation, which is
Privileged Account Management

141
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,820
if you use lapse or you
have access to endpoints

142
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,650
and check the registry

143
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,690
or whether you have a PAM solution

144
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,690
that you can use to assess
this is the best mitigation

145
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,080
that you could check and
you could also enforce,

146
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,050
but of course life are not perfect

147
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,260
and if you're looking
for other mitigation's

148
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,539
that could potentially
reduce the attack surface

149
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,470
you should consider checking
for your patch management,

150
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,010
if you installed a the right patches

151
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,830
that the matter mitigation suggest

152
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:37,640
as well as which will
mitigate the exposure

153
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,173
only to administrative local accounts,

154
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,280
you could go with the User
Account Control mitigation,

155
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,010
which is aimed more for domain users,

156
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:52,150
but it could be easily checked
by a checking doctor director

157
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:56,819
in the GPO to see if
multiple systems that have

158
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,300
administrative access

159
00:09:02,715 --> 00:09:05,570
that the same user have
administer access to both of them

160
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,880
and maybe you should consider focusing

161
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,230
on that mitigation as well.

162
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,480
Other effective mitigation
that has been used

163
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:17,510
in the frame that is commonly
seen in an organization

164
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,689
that is easy to implement

165
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,120
is User Account Management

166
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,120
is basically enforced some UAC
restrictions using the GPO,

167
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,520
if you don't trust your
GPO, you could also...

168
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,680
If you have the capability to
query each endpoint registry

169
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,719
and look for the right keys,

170
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,480
which are also mentioned
in the ATT&CK Mitigation

171
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,880
and basically if you don't have...

172
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,570
If your built-in Administrator
account is disabled,

173
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,140
this is a very effective
mitigation to eliminate

174
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,300
local account variation
of the Pass The Hash

175
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,843
ATT&CK Technique.

176
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:59,300
And of course you can do talk
about the ATT&CK Framework

177
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,660
and MITRE fancy heat map.

178
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,443
So here is my heat map,
what we focus here,

179
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,910
the important difference is that

180
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:15,610
we are not mapping the detective controls,

181
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,870
We are checking only if
the existing mitigations

182
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,790
are applied.

183
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,910
So if you already built a heat map

184
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,730
that shows your detection capabilities,

185
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,710
this heat map could look very different.

186
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,260
And I suggest to use it as a complimentary

187
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:34,810
to the techniques that you feel

188
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,619
that you don't have enough
depiction of controls,

189
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,680
if you don't have already
and you want to focus

190
00:10:41,702 --> 00:10:43,190
and we start from square zero.

191
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,900
I think it's better, I feel it's better

192
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,189
to start actually we've DCF map.

193
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,570
And then if you feel comfortable

194
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:52,990
with preventing some of
the ATT&CK Techniques,

195
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,360
you should focus your Detective Controls

196
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,960
for other techniques in
in the MITRE Framework.

197
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,220
So those you can build even interesting

198
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,220
a heat map that contains
how many of the techniques

199
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,720
you are able to prevent
using preventing patrols,

200
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,830
using new mitigations
in the ATT&CK Framework

201
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:15,420
and how many of those are
you only able to detect?

202
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:20,420
So it's interesting a use case
to make Defense Gap Analysis

203
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,992
first with mitigation and
then also with detection.

204
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,160
So it's important to mention
you need to pick the right tool

205
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,479
for the right job.

206
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,620
Adversary Emulation is great,

207
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,423
I've been doing it also for years,

208
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:45,390
it helps organization
really to know really

209
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,980
where they stand and they'll also check

210
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,790
how you're also people and
processes are performing.

211
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:57,620
The that makes Adversary
Emulation not to scale

212
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,240
is the potential business disruption

213
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,655
that it might create and
also the experienced team

214
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,520
that should do it in a safe manner.

215
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,020
That analytics on the other hand

216
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,790
could be a good complementary

217
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:15,780
to first get the right coverage
in the ATT&CK Framework,

218
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,949
as well as the network
coverage in a safe manner

219
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,130
that could scale better.

220
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,240
I suggest to start with...

221
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,073
We've done analytics

222
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:29,199
if you don't perform
Adversary Emulation yet

223
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,840
and then based on the
results that you can map

224
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,380
from the ATT&CK Metrics

225
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,939
in order to check your detective controls

226
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,640
or to see how you can really check

227
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,610
that the mitigation that
you have implemented

228
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,450
are performing as intended,

229
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,650
Adversary Emulation
could be a good use case

230
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,650
to check this.

231
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,150
The issue is we have that
analytics is that first of all,

232
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,770
it doesn't check detective controls,

233
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,079
which is of course, one
of the main use cases

234
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,113
that people use the ATT&CK Matrics

235
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:00,330
and the ATT&CK Framework,

236
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:04,603
and it doesn't really check
any type of processes.

237
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,470
To conclude the presentation,

238
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,210
First of all, Adversary Emulation are

239
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,620
grades that are important

240
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,090
and it's something that I
suggest everybody to practice,

241
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,340
even if you're not in the red team,

242
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,420
also blue teams can use
the atomic red team,

243
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,329
which Verena talked about

244
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,650
but as well, it's something
that you should use cautiously,

245
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,939
it's something that you
don't really want to run it

246
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,930
in all your network,

247
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,670
rather you want to do it specifically

248
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:35,699
to check specific controls and
in a controlled environment.

249
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,700
Data Analytics in the other
hand could be a better approach

250
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,709
to get the initial state of
what is your defense coverage

251
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,950
and to know where you stand
and then you could operate

252
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,910
and implement new capabilities

253
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,329
whether preventive or detective.

254
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:01,330
And I found the mitigation
attack very beneficial

255
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,850
to understand what the defense coverage,

256
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,030
because first of all,

257
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,350
most of the of the techniques
in the MITRE Framework,

258
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:13,290
and basically most of the controls

259
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,199
that most organization have,

260
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,860
these organization are
first of all, preventive

261
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,543
and of course should be preferred.

262
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,550
So sometimes I found yet
mitigation and attack

263
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:28,349
something that should be used more often

264
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:32,760
during any type of usage
for the ATT&CK Framework.

265
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,610
- Great talk Matana,

266
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,420
Well, that was fantastic,
I really loved it.

267
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,709
Someone dropped a comment Slack

268
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,170
that you're effectively emulating
the adversary emulators,

269
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,002
but like you said,

270
00:14:41,003 --> 00:14:42,000
"Getting ahead of them
and saying you know what."

271
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,510
Before we even...

272
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,010
Even if you don't have that resources

273
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,569
to do an emulation or before we do it,

274
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,430
let's go ahead and figure out like,

275
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:49,709
what are we doing in terms
of the mitigation aspect?

276
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,157
I think a lot of people really it,

277
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:53,090
and that resonates with them.

278
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:53,923
Biggest question though

279
00:14:53,923 --> 00:14:56,320
people are already asking this in Slack is

280
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,630
what advice do you have for
the community in terms of

281
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,050
the process that you shared
of looking at attack,

282
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,770
seeing the mitigations for technique,

283
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:05,160
and actually translating
that to what can we do

284
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,992
in our environment?

285
00:15:05,993 --> 00:15:07,758
How does that line up with our technology?

286
00:15:07,758 --> 00:15:09,547
any words you can share with the community

287
00:15:09,547 --> 00:15:12,709
and any wisdom you can
kind of work with there.

288
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:13,541
- Right.

289
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:15,800
So first of all, I think as also discussed

290
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,689
in the previous talks and
I guess it's something that

291
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,170
we learn with ATT&CK on a daily basis

292
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,760
that it's the human aspect,

293
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,350
we kind really automate everything

294
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,700
and say there is a magic,

295
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,590
of course you should...

296
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,490
It's required research in prize award,

297
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,950
I took an example of the Pass The Hash

298
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,520
because it's an interesting case,

299
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,810
and it's a bit complicated.

300
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,439
Of course, some of them are
much easier to start with,

301
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,100
but yes, the process is
to research is to learn

302
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,860
and to be familiar with
the different tactics

303
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,860
and techniques and to be
able to really understand

304
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,510
and research what are
the current capabilities

305
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,750
that people have in this organization

306
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:55,750
that they can really check
of course, good cyber posture

307
00:15:55,797 --> 00:15:58,140
and hygiene helps,

308
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,160
and if you have the right
tools and the rights controls

309
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,060
or use vendors that help you
automate some of this stuff,

310
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:09,060
it could be easier but for most techniques

311
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,660
I found that it's pretty trivial,

312
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:14,589
I do think that is part
of our work as a community

313
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:18,500
to also invest in the mitigations
in the ATT&CK even more.

314
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,580
I know that those are
also now the also shield

315
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,930
and of course, going forward
how we can all as a community

316
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:26,890
be able to share more

317
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,870
and make that processes essay.

318
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,340
- Yap love that answer like you said,

319
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,890
cybersecurity is hard but I'm
loving to contribute plugs

320
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,560
to get accepted by all means,

321
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,540
keeping everything back to us, we love it,
