1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,520
we have matt snyder joining us from

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,439
vmware

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,120
hey everybody um i really appreciate

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,320
everybody making time out of their busy

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,440
days and schedules

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,160
to to hang out with us and and listen to

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,639
me kind of

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,039
rant and rave about a topic that's very

9
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,080
near and dear to my heart

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,720
so a little bit about me i've been in

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,400
this industry for about 15 years

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,799
one of the kind of highlights out of my

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,119
career when i was very junior i was

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,320
back in 2013 i was on the incident

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,558
response team

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,200
at neiman marcus during one of the first

17
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,280
major credit card breaches

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,760
and with that experience i feel like

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,520
i've been in a great position to see how

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,879
our industry has changed

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,920
since a those major events have really

22
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,079
brought security to the forefront of

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,160
just about every organization out there

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,960
and then also being able to relate

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,440
and explain that you know having that

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,199
post

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,519
breach budget surplus doesn't solve

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,879
all of all of your problems being able

29
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,199
to pick out all the tools that you want

30
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,798
to

31
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,039
there's still more work that has to be

32
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,040
done

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,840
and with that just you know setting the

34
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,080
agenda really quickly

35
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,320
in this talk i'm going to talk about how

36
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,039
we at vmware are integrating

37
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,080
miter attack framework into our security

38
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,479
operations

39
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,240
from a holistic standpoint we're not

40
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,200
just talking about hunting or finding

41
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,039
specific things

42
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,439
we're really ingraining this into

43
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,000
everything that we do here

44
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,880
on that point this does not cover any

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,200
vmware specific products or services

46
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,679
there's no i'm not discussing any future

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,600
plans about those products or services

48
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,920
what they can and can't do with minor

49
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,798
attack this is a vendor neutral

50
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,280
presentation

51
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,920
so anything that you can take away from

52
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,399
this

53
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,399
talk should be able to use anywhere and

54
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,399
everywhere

55
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,159
and with that i want to set kind of the

56
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,360
the problem statement i've kind of

57
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,680
alluded it to

58
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,439
earlier in my introduction is you know

59
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,000
why are we even bothering with mitre

60
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,880
attack

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,720
there's a ton of stuff to be done in in

62
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,038
our day-to-day lives you know why

63
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,400
why take on another challenge another

64
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,599
project

65
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,879
to to add on to existing really

66
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,359
heavy workloads and

67
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,319
you know what i've i've seen in my time

68
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,760
is that

69
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,119
you know there's a flaw that we've kind

70
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,440
of latched on to

71
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,440
there's this cycle that we go through

72
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,800
and we haven't really broken out of it

73
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,959
in the last seven years

74
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,000
and that goes a little like this there's

75
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,319
some sort of hole

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,920
or gap it gets exploited there's some

77
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,359
sort of security incident

78
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,679
then we patch that with tools or

79
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,519
actual patches and then we wait for that

80
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,440
cycle to repeat again

81
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,040
and we see that it happens over and over

82
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,720
and over again and even over the last

83
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,359
seven years as our tools

84
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,480
and the technologies and our our people

85
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,200
have gotten better

86
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,319
we still see these types of attacks and

87
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,839
i think this

88
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,000
ties in perfectly with an example about

89
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,360
survivorship bias

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,959
in an example from world war ii when

91
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,480
they were looking at planes returning

92
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,480
from combat missions and they were

93
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,599
trying to figure out what they can do

94
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,799
to to harden their structure so

95
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,640
they lost fewer planes and

96
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,239
one of the you know engineers or

97
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,440
scientists on that project

98
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,879
abraham wald noted that the planes that

99
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,200
they were looking at in

100
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,959
the analysis that they were doing were

101
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,958
on planes that had returned

102
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,239
so as you can see here in this picture

103
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,959
the little red dots

104
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,840
that's all indications of damage of

105
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,959
planes that had

106
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,760
survived the areas where there

107
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,080
wasn't any recorded damage meant that it

108
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,920
was

109
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,440
less likely that those planes were going

110
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,280
to return back

111
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,640
from their missions and those were the

112
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,680
areas that needed

113
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,399
more armor and reinforcing and not these

114
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,439
areas where we've seen the plane survive

115
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,360
and i think that

116
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,879
ties in really well with the challenges

117
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,840
that we're facing today

118
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,959
and how do we harden our infrastructure

119
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,360
but what we've

120
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,519
kind of relied on doing is patching up

121
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,959
the areas that we already knew about

122
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,798
and still you know in a sense you know

123
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,160
flying blind to these areas that we

124
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,758
don't know about

125
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,680
and you know what i'm going to talk

126
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,080
about is how we can use mitre

127
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,840
to be our guide to help us to understand

128
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,680
where those critical areas are

129
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,119
in our environment and what we need to

130
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,120
do to harden those areas

131
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,360
you know and with that getting into it

132
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,280
is you know first off is

133
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,880
is logging you have to have the logs to

134
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,198
be able to to detect

135
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,280
the activity without it you're blind to

136
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,680
it um and one of the most

137
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,479
common questions i get is you know what

138
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,199
do you need

139
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,719
and that has led to a lot of heated

140
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,440
debates because everybody's got an

141
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,560
opinion

142
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,440
on what the the right thing to log is

143
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,000
what the right level is

144
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,639
and so you know solution one is we'll

145
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,479
just log

146
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,560
everything we'll collect everything

147
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,039
problem solved nobody's feelings get

148
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,479
hurts

149
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,479
and we have everything we want

150
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,199
the problem with that solution is

151
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,560
collecting everything costs money

152
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,479
and it costs a lot of money if you're

153
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,960
going to collect everything collecting

154
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,520
just enough is still very expensive so

155
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,039
we need to be intelligent about this

156
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,758
because there's costs that we need to

157
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,000
consider we need to consider

158
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,280
uh other things like performance impacts

159
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,039
on the endpoints

160
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,559
generating all this data especially if

161
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,680
we're talking about an application

162
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,800
server

163
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,000
there might not be enough you know

164
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,639
storage on that device

165
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,320
or it might be running at max cpu

166
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,919
utilization and we can't

167
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,440
add additional load to that so we need

168
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,120
to be cautious of that

169
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,039
the other thing we need to to be

170
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,800
concerned about or think about is

171
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,320
we need to move that data to a central

172
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,000
location most of the times

173
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,639
in most companies you know

174
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,520
it's not uncommon to have facilities

175
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,199
throughout the world

176
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,880
so we've got to move that data all

177
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,120
around the world and that can be

178
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,560
very expensive as well and and the last

179
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,000
thing is

180
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,160
once you've collected this and you've

181
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,680
aggregated it together these logging

182
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,600
tools these sim products

183
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,360
they're not cheap and then you need to

184
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,800
store all of that data and if you're

185
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,199
talking about terabytes

186
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,080
of data that can get really expensive

187
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,560
really quickly

188
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,080
because you also have retention periods

189
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,199
that you have to meet for various

190
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,599
compliance reasons

191
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,479
so you it storing that data is not

192
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,199
negotiable

193
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,719
so we we need to to find a way to be

194
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,160
able to make everybody happy and get

195
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,160
what we need

196
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,000
with that you know we need to be

197
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,160
intelligent about what we're logging

198
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,600
we don't want to just log everything and

199
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,639
we have a lot of you know

200
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,360
digital ways to lying around we can't be

201
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,000
so specific and narrow in our focus that

202
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,120
we're leaving

203
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,240
a bunch of you know logged events back

204
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,319
on a server that is going to um right

205
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,960
over that data really quickly and it's

206
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,080
gone for

207
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,239
forever so with mitre attack

208
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,159
we can take a lot of those opinions out

209
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,160
of the conversation

210
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,000
about what needs to be logged and we can

211
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,919
look at real world attacks

212
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and we can we can see what it takes to

213
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,359
detect them and we can focus on those

214
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,880
things first

215
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,560
we can see um you know the different

216
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,880
platforms that those attacks are

217
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,080
available on so for example if you only

218
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,000
have linux

219
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,120
servers in an environment you don't need

220
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,240
to worry about

221
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,720
all of the microsoft

222
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,919
techniques that are just applied to two

223
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,039
windows so you can start

224
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,880
to narrow down

225
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,880
your and get to the heart of what's

226
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,319
really important to

227
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,440
to you and you know as i mentioned

228
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,160
earlier you know one of the really

229
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,199
common questions

230
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,800
that i hear um not only you know what

231
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,680
logs do you need it's you know what what

232
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,440
do you care about

233
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,120
and that's that can be a very tricky

234
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,879
question is you know how do you answer

235
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,400
you know what does security care about

236
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,240
in a way that is

237
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,440
short and concise that can hold that

238
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,919
person's attention

239
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,479
and not you know respond back to them

240
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,919
and say hey

241
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,758
you know clear off your schedule for the

242
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,479
next three months and i'll give you a

243
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,720
crash

244
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,758
course and in security and we can tell

245
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,440
you about all the things

246
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,960
because that's not going to work either

247
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,440
so we need to

248
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,878
um be very specific and we found that

249
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,360
you know being able to

250
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,120
relate back to mitre attack is a great

251
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,280
way of taking something that's

252
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,879
it's independent it's not you know what

253
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,599
are the things that matt snyder cares

254
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,280
about or

255
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,840
what are the things that joe smith cares

256
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,399
about and it's hey this is a

257
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,598
it's a vendor neutral it's a you know

258
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,159
it's a collaboration

259
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,440
across various industries and these are

260
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,319
the things that we found

261
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,519
to be most important so it takes a

262
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,480
little bit of that

263
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,040
you know maybe that tension or maybe you

264
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,480
know if

265
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,800
if you've got you know these political

266
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,600
battles between departments going on

267
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,000
it it really helps to step outside and

268
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,000
look at

269
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,240
something you know from a third party to

270
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,920
say hey this is what we've got going on

271
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,839
and these are the things we care about

272
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,120
and it helps facilitate those

273
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,040
conversations and

274
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,120
and i find i found doing that has

275
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,199
has helped ease some of the tensions

276
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,440
that i've seen before and it makes the

277
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,160
process go a lot smoother

278
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,040
i mean it's also really great tool to be

279
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,199
able to

280
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,800
to provide to those business units or

281
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,240
those system admins to say hey

282
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,319
these are the things that we do care

283
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,399
about you know you can specify

284
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,640
the specific apt groups that are

285
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,279
relevant to your industry or to your

286
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,480
company

287
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,080
where you feel aligned with you know the

288
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,200
the type of attacks that you're most

289
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,200
likely to sustain you can guide these

290
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,720
you know groups to mitre attack you can

291
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,600
say hey this is what we care about look

292
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,839
about it

293
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,880
you know look at these different ttps

294
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,320
and inside of there

295
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,920
there's all kinds of great you know

296
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,360
links to white papers

297
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,240
uh articles about actual attacks that

298
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,160
have happened

299
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,399
and what people have learned from them

300
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,360
and that's a really good resource to

301
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,040
to focus their attention on these areas

302
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,279
that you and your security team

303
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,719
care about as opposed to just setting

304
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,240
them free on the internet

305
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,320
where they're going to come across all

306
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,519
kinds of wild

307
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,720
um no proof of concept attacks and

308
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,160
various things

309
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,800
that may not be relevant to you and your

310
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,480
your industry

311
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,319
and so now that you've you've got that

312
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,760
this is a quick example of of

313
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,360
how we've integrated that into our

314
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,800
logging standards we can give this to

315
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,480
the business units and we can say

316
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,000
this is what we care about this is

317
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,240
what's most important to us

318
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,160
and they'll also be able to understand

319
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,120
why it's important to us and that really

320
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,120
takes away the

321
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,880
you know well why is security asking us

322
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,360
for this this is exactly why we're

323
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,399
asking

324
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:47,519
because threat actors are actively

325
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:49,200
engaging in this type of activity

326
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,040
and as we move along now that we know

327
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,360
what we want to log we can get into

328
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,480
our our security monitoring and building

329
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,800
alerts with meaning

330
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,720
and and this is you know a pretty good

331
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,760
example of what i found most security

332
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,480
monitoring looks like

333
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,880
you kind of hit a few key areas you're

334
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,600
not

335
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,000
doing you know really a good enough job

336
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,040
but

337
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,320
hey it passes you you've got security

338
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,880
and we need to change that as an

339
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,079
industry and as we tie back

340
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,600
into building a balanced portfolio

341
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,760
and looking at uh the example i gave

342
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,519
earlier with the airplane

343
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,040
you know on the left you know in the

344
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,480
blue heat map you can see

345
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,839
kind of what we're building alerts

346
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,600
around and then when we look at the

347
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,320
airplane you can see the damage it's

348
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,320
sustaining

349
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,519
and this is a really good illustration

350
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,320
of

351
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,760
using survivor bias to kind of solve a

352
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,600
problem and look at the

353
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,079
what we're seeing in an is as an

354
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,320
industry in a different way

355
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,680
and these are really kind of close and i

356
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,320
find it kind of striking

357
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,760
when you compare and contrast these two

358
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,600
two pictures is you want to make sure

359
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,040
that you're focusing on building a

360
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,360
broad even security uh portfolio and not

361
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,560
just

362
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,519
stacking up your your armor so to speak

363
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,518
in certain areas

364
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,000
so now that we're aligning our alerts

365
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,880
and our detections with miter attack

366
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,880
let me jump back

367
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,560
the delay got me our alerts start to

368
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,160
have a little bit more meaning there's

369
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,079
more context behind them because now

370
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,560
we're mapping to these ttps

371
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,760
and our analysts can see okay i've got

372
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,800
an alert

373
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,800
that is now you know we're

374
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,839
implementing risk-based alerting and so

375
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,760
you can tie

376
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,440
the activity that might be very low

377
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,120
fidelity alerts into

378
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,560
these chained events and now when an

379
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,760
analyst review something they can see

380
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,160
that you've got something that maybe

381
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,920
it's

382
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,519
it's hitting across you know initial

383
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,519
access and then you see something in

384
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,880
execution and then maybe something

385
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,279
across lateral movement

386
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,000
and all of those individually might be

387
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,680
too low

388
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,519
to actually trigger an alert but

389
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,719
together our analysts can see that hey

390
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,959
we've got something here

391
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,560
it's we've got this chained together of

392
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,319
events and it looks like an

393
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,479
actual attack so it helps us to reduce

394
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,040
false positives build better fidelity

395
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,079
alerts

396
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,680
and really get to you know the

397
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,839
the data that we're carrying about and

398
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,359
then also we're using miter attack to

399
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,720
track our maturity and growth

400
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,480
we need to be able to see where we're

401
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,920
starting out with so you can look at

402
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,600
your

403
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,319
portfolio and say okay i can detect

404
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,000
these things and as time goes on

405
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,680
you can see how you're growing i mean

406
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,360
this is a really great tool

407
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,079
to work with your leadership teams to be

408
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,920
able to say hey given our current status

409
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,519
in our current workload we can build

410
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,160
towards these detections in this amount

411
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,320
of time

412
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,000
and then after that times past you go

413
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,560
back and you look and you can reevaluate

414
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,320
and say hey

415
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,160
we got this far but we didn't get as far

416
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,120
as we needed we need more people or we

417
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,439
need better tools

418
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,639
in order to to really close that gap

419
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,560
where we need to be

420
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,240
and the last thing i want to talk about

421
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,959
is using miter attack

422
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,800
to to evaluate security tools and this

423
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,239
can be new tools this can be existing

424
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,920
tools you know with attack

425
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,320
it really helps us if you think back to

426
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,079
that heat map we can overlay all of our

427
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,399
tools and we can see what matters most

428
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:07,199
to us and what we can detect we overlay

429
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,800
that again on top of what the attackers

430
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,719
that we're most concerned about what

431
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,839
they can do and then we can identify

432
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,000
those areas

433
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,120
that maybe we have gaps in coverage and

434
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,440
then we can use that

435
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,560
to review our tools to make sure that

436
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,480
they're able to do

437
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,319
the things that we want to do because a

438
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,519
lot of the times we see these tools kind

439
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,920
of boxed and sold

440
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,639
as those as seen on tv products you know

441
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,360
you see these

442
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,000
over dramatic sales pitches and then you

443
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,040
end up with the

444
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,240
solution that just really doesn't work

445
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,360
and i'm running up against time but you

446
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,279
know the last thing i would

447
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,120
i would like to mention about this is

448
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,760
you know just because a

449
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,800
tool or a vendor says that they align

450
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,399
with mitre

451
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,560
that doesn't mean that they went through

452
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,880
some accreditation process

453
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,560
and they've been blessed by mitre to to

454
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,680
detect all of these things

455
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,479
it's really up to you to put them

456
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,638
through the test

457
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,000
and make sure that they can find those

458
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,440
things before

459
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,519
you you go ahead and purchase and

460
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,839
implement that you know with that you

461
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,399
know

462
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,160
i know we're up that time so happy to to

463
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,639
answer any questions in the in the slack

464
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,040
channel

465
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,920
thank you everybody thanks matt that was

466
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,439
amazing and links

467
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,120
you'll see some some big fans in the

468
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,199
slack channel for your meme game

469
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,320
we definitely appreciate the gifts um

470
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,839
one of the interesting things

471
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,680
yeah absolutely one of the interesting

472
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,279
things that you said was

473
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,638
you know all kind of you kind of

474
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,279
explored all the hidden costs of a

475
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,560
detection like

476
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,320
it's not just a blue team seeing

477
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,319
something right detection for it there's

478
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,199
cost with you know logging and licensing

479
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,440
and all these other um

480
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,639
elements and it really does take all the

481
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,360
you know kind of all the involved

482
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,560
stakeholder

483
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,399
stakeholders to kind of buy in um but

484
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,399
one of the questions i had was like

485
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,920
as you know what advice would you give

486
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,680
in terms of you know keeping all the

487
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,880
stakeholders involved with this entire

488
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,439
detection pipeline because like you said

489
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,519
it's not just

490
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,199
writing analytics there's so much more

491
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,000
cost and so much more decisions involved

492
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,319
here

493
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,240
right and i think that's where where the

494
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,759
uh attack matrix really helps out

495
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,800
because we can visualize

496
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,560
what we can do as a security department

497
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,920
with our stakeholders and say hey with

498
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,758
what we have right now

499
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,439
we can detect these things and you

500
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,839
really take away that

501
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,880
um well why didn't security catch this

502
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,399
after an incident

503
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,480
you know i've heard that so many times

504
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,560
throughout my career and i've got

505
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,000
i can count the gray hairs on my head

506
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,479
every time that's happened because it

507
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,199
just

508
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,600
it makes your head want to explode using

509
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,519
this

510
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,040
this is a way to before that even

511
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,600
happens being able to go to your

512
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,279
leadership

513
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,959
team and say hey we can do this with the

514
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,680
tools that we have with the people we

515
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,839
have

516
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,758
and then this is where our attackers are

517
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,199
coming from and then we can overlay that

518
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,199
with what we're actually seeing

519
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,800
in our day-to-day alerts and we can let

520
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,199
them know say this this is where we're

521
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,040
going

522
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,479
we can't do anything about this if you

523
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,199
want to be able to stop this kind of

524
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,279
technique

525
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,319
we need engagement from our

526
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,120
infrastructure team

527
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,880
to be able to come up with policies and

528
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,680
in technologies in place to stop this

529
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,759
from happening

530
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,719
in the first place because prevention is

531
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,240
really where

532
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,079
you know the goal of everybody in

533
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,440
security is trying to get out

534
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,959
you know how do we stop this from even

535
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,959
happening and that's where you work with

536
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,198
your infrastructure team your it ops

537
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,599
team getting everybody on that same page

538
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,559
so that they can see these things as a

539
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,719
team

540
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,918
and understand that hey we're right now

541
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,240
we can't detect this

542
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,600
you know you took away this tool from us

543
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,520
we're blind to these areas

544
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,198
so if you're not going to give that tool

545
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,918
back we need you to go and you need to

546
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,760
do something

547
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,880
on our policy side to stop this activity

548
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,280
from being able to

549
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,400
you know get a foothold great insights

550
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,160
thank you so much

551
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,160
thank you very much
