1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:02,510
- [Man] I'm gonna turn it over

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,609
to our first speaker of
November Attackcon PowerHour,

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,490
Allie Mellen from Cybereason.

4
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,450
- Hi everyone, it's a pleasure
to be here with you today.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,940
I'm especially honored
to be your first speaker,

6
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,439
even if that's just because
they went alphabetically

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,080
and my name starts with A.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,392
I've lucked out because of that before.

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,340
Today, I'm gonna be talking
about Mapping the EventBot

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,333
Mobile Banking Trojan with
MITRE Attack for Mobile.

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,890
A little background on
me before we dive in.

12
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,903
I've been in tech for about a decade.

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,730
I spent five of those years

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,750
actually as a mobile app developer.

15
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,780
So I have a real appreciation for mobile

16
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,520
as its own industry and its own space

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,640
and I actually got into
security shortly after that

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,430
from completing some internet

19
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,870
of things device, security research.

20
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,169
And from there, I started
working at Cybereason.

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,410
I'm now a security strategist
in our security team.

22
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:03,870
I work on our infrastructure
security and product security.

23
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,950
So I'm very excited to talk to you guys

24
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,840
about what MITRE Attack is,

25
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,470
why we at Cybereason
really think it's important

26
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,920
to align to it.

27
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,180
I want to give this really cool example

28
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,120
of mobile malware research
that our research team saw,

29
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,500
and then talk about why it's important

30
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,250
to align to MITRE Attack for Mobile

31
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,030
and why it's really
important for the future too

32
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,290
because it's not just about
what we're doing right now,

33
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,860
it's about laying that foundation

34
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,210
and I think that's one of
the reasons why MITRE Attack

35
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,292
is so important.

36
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,600
So as an organization, we
think about MITRE Attack a lot,

37
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,070
our research team aligns
every piece of research

38
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,940
that we put out to MITRE Attack

39
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,940
and whether it's mobile
malware or just typical attacks

40
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,330
on the endpoint and there
are a couple of reasons why,

41
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,100
and they really do come
down to knowledge sharing.

42
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,009
Whether that's purple teaming,

43
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,250
whether that's having a red team

44
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,700
be actually able to
communicate with the blue team

45
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,780
of what they're doing and why.

46
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,360
It's really important to
have a common language

47
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,770
by which to communicate that

48
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,019
and that's what MITRE Attack
really provides to us.

49
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,570
So it's really about not just classifying

50
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,450
the tactics, techniques and
procedures that we're seeing,

51
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,260
but also about being able to
share that in a common language

52
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,920
with the community,
whether it's internally,

53
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,890
with partners, with customers

54
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,750
or just with the business

55
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,713
in order to really communicate value.

56
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,040
Taking that a step further,

57
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,810
why we actually map to
MITRE Attack for Mobile

58
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,380
is one, because it's really cool.

59
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,230
They offer a really innovative
approach to this problem

60
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,340
that at the end of the
day, not a decent number,

61
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,040
but not as many as we want to be seeing

62
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,019
over the next few years are
really working to approach

63
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,010
this mobile security problem.

64
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,380
The second is that mobile

65
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,400
is actually a really important target

66
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,900
that enterprises need to take seriously.

67
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,430
60% of corporate data is
accessed through mobile devices

68
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,010
and that's a huge amount.

69
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,090
And we don't even really think about it

70
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,320
in classical traditional defense

71
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,220
and security within enterprises,

72
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,203
so it's really important to address.

73
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,430
And the last thing that's really important

74
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,940
is communicating value in a clear way.

75
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,810
What I really love about MITRE Attack

76
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,640
and MITRE Attack for Mobile
is that we're actually

77
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,700
able to use it to abstract the problem

78
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,910
in such a way that it's
now easy to understand

79
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,070
and communicate to others.

80
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,959
We can take this really
complicated piece of research

81
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,620
that's really technical.

82
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,800
Our blogs are like 40
pages long on this stuff,

83
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,600
and we can condense it into something

84
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,942
that anyone can understand
and that's really powerful.

85
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,560
So let's talk about this
piece of mobile malware.

86
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,140
This is a threat that our
Cybereason nocturnists team,

87
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,149
which is our threat research
team, found called EventBot.

88
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,090
It is a mobile banking Trojan,

89
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,270
targeting financial services applications.

90
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,090
It's looking to collect user data

91
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,683
and it was specifically
targeting the U.S. and Europe.

92
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,910
What's so fascinating about this attack

93
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,130
besides it being pretty cool

94
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,860
and it's just with this information

95
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,030
is that it actually targets

96
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,210
over 200 different financial applications

97
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,799
on Android devices.

98
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,800
And these are not just some
financial applications,

99
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,830
these are really well-known applications,

100
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,500
things like Capital One UK,

101
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,180
we're talking about PayPal business.

102
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,180
We've got Revolut in here,
there's Santander UK.

103
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,900
There's TransferWise, which
I personally have on my phone

104
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,900
and love to use for getting
money from overseas.

105
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,930
There's also Coinbase, we've
got ING Direct and UniCredit.

106
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,609
So what's important to note about this

107
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,820
is I assume that a lot of people

108
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,740
that are actually on the Zoom right now

109
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,970
have one of these apps on their
devices, but more than that,

110
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,980
they're not all just
targeted at the consumer.

111
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,890
Some of these are also
targeted at the enterprise,

112
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,610
things like, as we
mentioned, PayPal business.

113
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,750
They're looking to gather
information and credentials

114
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,280
from business applications

115
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,729
as well as individual user applications.

116
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,260
And that's super important
when we're thinking about

117
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,770
how things like mobile malware

118
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,969
are actually going to
affect the enterprise.

119
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,740
So what our team did for
this piece of research

120
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,680
and what our team does for
every piece of research

121
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,750
is align to MITRE Attack.

122
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,700
What was really exciting
about this is MITRE Attack

123
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,690
actually has MITRE Attack for Mobile

124
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,580
so we can align mobile
malware we're seeing

125
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,580
to each tactic that MITRE
Attack has for mobile,

126
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,289
and you can see them here

127
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,260
and for anyone who's really
familiar with MITRE Attack,

128
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,820
you can see how they're organized

129
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,843
from tactics to techniques.

130
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,570
And this gives us a really easy way

131
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,750
to understand these different attacks

132
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,720
and understand exactly what's
going on and take a step back

133
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,020
from the really technical details

134
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,479
so we can get a better
perspective for those people

135
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,990
who may not want to dig into the research

136
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,540
or may not want to be doing the research

137
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,080
or may have other priorities.

138
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,080
So, this is really what
I see as the best part

139
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,880
of MITRE Attack for Mobile

140
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,730
is that you can really
abstract the problem

141
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,250
in such a way that it's
really easy to understand

142
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,550
and communicate to other people.

143
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,870
And as a computer engineer,
I love extraction,

144
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,683
so this takes the cake.

145
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,780
But what's really cool
about it, at least to me,

146
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,690
is what it allows us to do

147
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,330
when we're talking
about communicating this

148
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,550
because we have that table,

149
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,820
which is already useful on its face,

150
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,159
but it's very useful for people

151
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,490
who are in the security industry.

152
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,820
But what's awesome is
that gives us the basis

153
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,520
to actually communicate this threat

154
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,390
in a way that someone

155
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,750
who's not even technical can understand.

156
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,300
I'm gonna show you that
here with this timeline.

157
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,540
So we took that same
piece of mobile malware,

158
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,400
and we broke it down

159
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,500
into a timeline starting
with initial access.

160
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,980
What's happening in this
research is an unsuspecting user

161
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,980
is downloading EventBot,

162
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,550
which is masquerading as
a legitimate application.

163
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,940
And what's so cool about this
is we saw this so early on

164
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,160
that we were actually able
to see this application,

165
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,670
this malware iteratively improving itself

166
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,920
in order to appear legitimate,

167
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,180
ultimately with the goal

168
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,890
of getting on the Google Play Store.

169
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,090
Although we didn't see it
on the Google Play Store

170
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,890
because it was so early in the process,

171
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,133
that was its end goal.

172
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,550
Next it looks to get control
of accessibility features

173
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,470
just by asking for them.

174
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,880
And it starts to run in the
background because again,

175
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,940
it's convinced people
that it's legitimate,

176
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,610
that it's an application they should trust

177
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,950
because they want to access the calculator

178
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,240
or whatever they're pretending

179
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,940
that this application is gonna do.

180
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,470
Next comes discovery

181
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,500
where since they have control
of the accessibility features,

182
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,420
which gives them such a wide control

183
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,150
of the different ways that
the device is choosing

184
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,239
to collect information,

185
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,360
that they can actually really dig into

186
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,210
some important reconnaissance information

187
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,230
like the device info and the
names of Android packages.

188
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,360
And that's how they
know which applications,

189
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,300
if the applications that
they're trying to target

190
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,423
are on the device.

191
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,350
They go further than that

192
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,760
and they start actually
tracking the device pin

193
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,680
and collecting financial information,

194
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,750
personal data, keystrokes,
and even passwords.

195
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,960
So for anyone here and I'm
sure no one here has done it

196
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,930
because they are all good
security professionals,

197
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,959
but for anyone here who
has actually copy pasted

198
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,380
from their notes application,

199
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,800
their password into one of
their banking applications,

200
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,603
this malware has that info now.

201
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,690
Of course, we see them exfiltrate that

202
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,070
to the attacker C2 server,

203
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,160
but this is where things get interesting

204
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,490
because of course, as
security professionals,

205
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,250
we have two factor authentication enabled.

206
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,190
And so when the attacker goes
to log into these accounts

207
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,253
with the credentials that it just stole,

208
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,230
perhaps we think I'm such a
good security professional,

209
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,360
I have two factor
authentication so I will know

210
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,750
and be able to stop this person

211
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,670
from getting into my account.

212
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,790
But here's the problem.

213
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,969
The attacker has access to the place

214
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,050
where most two factor authentication goes.

215
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,959
In many forms of two
factor authentication,

216
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,280
you get a text sent to your device

217
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,839
and this malware immediately
steals that message,

218
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,950
sends any necessary information
back to the attacker

219
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,750
and then deletes it.

220
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,800
So not only do they have
control of your device,

221
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,310
they're tracking everything
that you're typing,

222
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,699
but then they're able to
delete messages at will

223
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,640
so that they can prevent you from knowing

224
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,490
when they're accessing your accounts.

225
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,520
So I, first of all, find
this attack fascinating,

226
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,240
but what I find really fascinating

227
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,300
is how we're actually
able to communicate this

228
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,400
in a way where

229
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,620
when I talk about this
to non-technical people,

230
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,620
it clicks for them why mobile
malware is really scary

231
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,720
and that's because of
the mapping that we have

232
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,357
to MITRE Attack for Mobile.

233
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,080
So what's really important

234
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,670
and what I really want to think about

235
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,829
and what you guys think about

236
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,140
when you're thinking about this problem

237
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,760
is how is this a step
in the right direction

238
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,120
to actually being able to map
these attacks more completely,

239
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,670
and to be able to communicate
which as an industry

240
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,780
we know is one of the
biggest problems that we have

241
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,449
is just communication and being
able to communicate problems

242
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,990
to other people.

243
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,990
How can MITRE Attack really
help us to get out of the weeds

244
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,280
and then actually communicate
these issues to other people?

245
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,140
And I think that I hope that this example

246
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,439
really illustrates that
and gives us an idea

247
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,520
of what could possibly come next.

248
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,020
Because I think that not
only do we have MITRE Attack

249
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,160
for enterprise, we have
MITRE Attack for Mobile

250
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,770
and I can see a world where
those two need to combine

251
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,300
because attacks don't
stop at mobile devices,

252
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,449
they don't stop at traditional end points,

253
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,720
they can go across both.

254
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,230
That's one of the main goals
of mobile malware attacks

255
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,520
is to get to other devices,
to get to other end points.

256
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,870
And so I imagine there will be a future

257
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,210
where we actually consider
these to be all one in the same

258
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:50,490
and my hope is that we can
use MITRE Attack for Mobile

259
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,890
as the basis as we think
about other types of attacks

260
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,670
like attacks on IOT devices

261
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,433
or other devices down
the line that we see.

262
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,490
So I want to thank you guys
so much for attending my talk.

263
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,420
I also want to give a big thank you

264
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,920
to the MITRE Attack team.

265
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,000
They really made this so easy and so fun,

266
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,460
and I really appreciate it

267
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,460
and I'm happy to take any questions.

268
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,620
You can feel free to email
me if you have questions too,

269
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,640
check out our blog and feel
free to contact me on Twitter

270
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,423
or follow me @hackerxbella.

271
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,329
- Excellent talk, Allie

272
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,000
and thanks again for all the reporting

273
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,840
and all the contributions
we've gotten from your team.

274
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,930
It's been excellent
collaborating with you.

275
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,810
We had a couple of questions
building up in the Slack,

276
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:36,810
so definitely hop over there,

277
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,209
but I just kinda wanted to ask one.

278
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,540
I think a lot of the community
might resonate with your talk

279
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,810
because like I said, we all have phones,

280
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,130
mine's five feet away
from me at any point.

281
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,420
And like you said, a really
interesting statistic you shared

282
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,209
was that 60% of our corporate data

283
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,780
is accessible from these devices,

284
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,230
so it's something we really
need to take seriously.

285
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,870
But what is your advice
to like a security team,

286
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,090
maybe a smaller unit that's
just getting started,

287
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,660
maybe they have an enterprise setup,

288
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,300
but they do recognize, like you said,

289
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,130
the importance of mobile.

290
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,500
What are your suggestions for first steps

291
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,700
and how to start taking this seriously?

292
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,260
- Totally, I think that as we all know,

293
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,560
small security teams have
much bigger priorities.

294
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,550
So of course it is always a juggling act

295
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,483
with what you're going to prioritize.

296
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,030
One of the reasons why I think
that mobile is so important

297
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:24,329
and so interesting is because
we do use it all the time

298
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,800
and especially now that
we're working from home,

299
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,790
it becomes so important to stay connected,

300
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:31,310
even when we're doing
household activities.

301
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,040
Like if you have to take
your kids for a walk

302
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,890
because they've been stuck inside all day,

303
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,060
you're probably gonna take your phone

304
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,510
and you're probably gonna have
Slack or Teams on your phone

305
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,710
and want to be accessing that
in case something bad happens.

306
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:44,660
So I think that the best
first step that you can take

307
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:48,160
is first working with IT very
closely because of course,

308
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,270
for most teams, IT controls
mobile device management or EMM

309
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,420
and it's really important to make sure

310
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,010
that any policies are up to date

311
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:59,880
and all of the basics
IT hygiene is covered.

312
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,950
And then really try to start
doing some awareness training

313
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,570
because not only can you
access a lot of corporate data

314
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,680
on the phones,

315
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,660
but you're also three
times more likely to fall

316
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,170
for a phishing attack on a
small screen, which is crazy.

317
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,250
So it's really important to
just get people in that mindset

318
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,510
where not to distrust
their mobile devices,

319
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,150
but to think about what
they're doing with them more

320
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,420
and not trust them immediately.

321
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,410
Like I think a lot of
advertising really convinces us

322
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,850
that they're safe.

323
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,690
- That makes sense.

324
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,540
I think we had an interesting question

325
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,142
from one of our speakers
from our last session,

326
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,160
you mentioned the EventBot and
kind of the banking element,

327
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,360
do you see any other like major trends

328
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,500
in the mobile malware space?

329
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,420
Like I know typically I
think one of the themes

330
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,360
from our last Attackcon

331
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,550
was attacking the human
behind the keyboard.

332
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:47,410
I think in this case,

333
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,043
it applies perfectly to
mobile because like you said,

334
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,150
the phones is the gateway
into the mind of the human

335
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,959
and there's so many vulnerabilities

336
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,440
that we can't patch.

337
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,730
As techies and engineers,
it goes through training,

338
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,850
but I guess long story short,

339
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,030
what are your kind of
your forecast for trends,

340
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,010
things that you're seeing now

341
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,689
as well as where do you think the future

342
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,350
of this mobile malware is going?

343
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,740
- It's really fascinating.

344
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,960
There are a couple of things
that come to mind immediately.

345
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,200
Of course, phishing, we
all think of phishing.

346
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,850
We think of security and
like a huge security issue,

347
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,930
but what's fascinating about
mobile phishing attacks

348
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,939
is that they're not
really coming from email,

349
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,790
they're coming from things like WhatsApp,

350
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,459
they're coming from SMS messages,

351
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,900
they're coming from social media websites.

352
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,780
So I think that having to
kind of shift our brains

353
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,230
to thinking about a
different type of phishing

354
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,510
than we're typically used
to is really important.

355
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,630
As far as trends go to,
we've seen, unfortunately,

356
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,410
a lot of people pretending

357
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,680
or masquerading their applications

358
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,050
as things like CDC applications

359
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,370
or World Health Organization applications

360
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,570
and as we really get into
what will hopefully be

361
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,890
a vaccine season,

362
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,510
I think we'll probably see
a lot more applications

363
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,010
like that that are trying to trick people,

364
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:04,210
especially when it comes
to Android devices.

365
00:16:05,357 --> 00:16:06,910
- And it goes back to
trust, like you said,

366
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,120
it kind of seems like
a central theme here.

367
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,800
I think one final question
come up, a really good one.

368
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,632
Do you have any...

369
00:16:13,633 --> 00:16:14,890
Obviously don't have the
statistics off your hand,

370
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,600
but what are kinda your thoughts or themes

371
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,580
regarding the hybrid attacks
where people are using mobile

372
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,730
as kind of a gateway to get
to enterprise resources?

373
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:25,040
Do you think that's kind
of a very common occurrence

374
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,459
or do you think actors
are more kind of content

375
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,650
with just getting device data directly

376
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,310
from like iOS or Android?

377
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,142
- It's funny you say that

378
00:16:33,143 --> 00:16:35,490
cause I actually do have
a statistic about this.

379
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,319
90% of mobile malware is trying to access

380
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,080
other connected ports
and different devices

381
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,470
that it can get access to, so
it really is trying to move.

382
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,640
I think that there are really
two ways that mobile malware

383
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,840
or two risks that come
with mobile malware.

384
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,610
One, whatever's on the device

385
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,210
and two, accessing the enterprise network

386
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:58,760
and getting to other devices,
we can see this like...

387
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,150
If you don't think much
to connect your phone

388
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,540
to a Starbucks wifi,

389
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,940
but what if it's not an
actual Starbucks wifi,

390
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,150
and then you go to connect your phone

391
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,270
to the enterprise network,

392
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,550
you can run into all sorts of problems.

393
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:11,889
And so I think it's
really, really important

394
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,830
and that's one of the things
that I talk about a lot

395
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,139
when I'm talking about mobile malware

396
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,100
is not just what's
happening on the device.

397
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,300
What's really interesting

398
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,930
is when we see it actually
going from the device

399
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:24,810
into the enterprise network
and targeting other devices,

400
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,203
so I think that's critical.

401
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,349
- That's an amazing statistic.

402
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,969
So thank you for sharing and
thanks again for your talk.

403
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,550
Like I said, it's been fantastic.

404
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,750
I think this resonates with all of us,

405
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,575
really some great knowledge to share.

406
00:17:35,575 --> 00:17:36,578
- [Allie] Thank you so much.

407
00:17:36,578 --> 00:17:37,783
- [Man] Thank you, Jamie and Allie.
