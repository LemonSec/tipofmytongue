1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:02,550
- So without further ado,

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,619
Brian Donahue from Red Canary.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,440
- First off, like thank you Adam,

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,100
thank you to the ATT&CK team
for organizing this conference

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,240
and for allowing me to
come and speak at it.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,240
Apologies in advance if my
talk gets interrupted by

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,119
any dogs barking or the pitter patter of

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,870
toddlers running flat
footed above my head,

9
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,070
but such as the reality of life in 2020.

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,800
So without wasting any more time,

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,320
my talk is starting over with
sub-techniques and it's about

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,650
the lessons that we learned at Red Canary.

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,949
When we remapped from like
the old precept techniques

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,740
version of Miter ATT&CK to the
new sub techniques version of

15
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,260
ATT&CK.

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,260
So, before I go any further,
a few things about myself,

17
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,339
I work at Red Canary.

18
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,340
I primarily either like support
publication of content or

19
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,209
work on it myself, importantly,
in the context of this talk,

20
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,940
I am one of the lead writers
of our threat detection report,

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,179
which is like an effort to
gather all of the threats

22
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,780
we detect that our customer's
environments and sort of rank

23
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,880
and stack the Mitre attack
techniques associated with them

24
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,240
for the purposes of sort of
like determining which ATT&CK

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,393
techniques are most prevalent
in like creating sort of a,

26
00:01:21,393 --> 00:01:23,460
a ranking order to them.

27
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,110
Prior to joining Red Canary,

28
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,330
I've worked as a journalist
and as a CTI analyst,

29
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:33,470
about 10 years ago now I was interviewing

30
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,720
for a job

31
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,250
as a social media editor at Threatpost.

32
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,180
It would have been my first
job, It was my first job.

33
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,540
The editors there asked me
how I had any experience with

34
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,370
social media, I lied.

35
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,690
I told them I did.

36
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,230
When in fact I did not,

37
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,440
they either believed me or
didn't care, but they hired me.

38
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,030
And that's how my career started here.

39
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,470
So if you dislike me or my talk,

40
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,220
you can send your hate
mail to Paul Roberts and or

41
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,053
Dennis Fisher.

42
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,370
Now that I've got that out of the way.

43
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,170
So we've already gone through who I am.

44
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,150
I'm gonna give you guys

45
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,690
just an absolute bare minimum background

46
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,669
on what red Canary does,
so that you can sort of

47
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,549
understand the context
around our remapping effort.

48
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,210
Then we'll run through the
seven lessons we learned,

49
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,820
and then we'll close with a minute or two

50
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,113
question and answers.

51
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,560
So like one of the primary
things Red Canary does

52
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,720
is manage, detection and response.

53
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,150
So we gathered telemetry from
our customers and points.

54
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,000
We parsed that telemetry
against like some thousand of

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,500
detection analytics to
surface potential threats.

56
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,120
Then those potential threats
are reviewed by a human

57
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,660
on our detection engineering team,

58
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,240
that detection engineer can

59
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,700
either suppress or hide that event,

60
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,140
or they can confirm that it's a threat

61
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,619
in which case they ship what we call

62
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,120
a confirmed threat detection to a customer

63
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,390
for the purposes of this talk,

64
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,250
that's effectively a
customer notification.

65
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,410
It's more than that, but
like for our purposes

66
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,920
just to understand that it includes

67
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,829
among many other things.

68
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,290
The Mitre ATT&CK techniques that

69
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,523
that threat is corresponded with.

70
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,049
So given the way our system operates,

71
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,500
we have a few different
options for how we can handle

72
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,810
ATTA&CK mapping.

73
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,660
We can do it at the behavioral analytic

74
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,380
or the detector level.

75
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,930
The benefit of doing it at that level

76
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,110
is that it's highly scalable.

77
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,250
You get to make your mapping decisions

78
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,460
when you write your detection analytic.

79
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,020
So you make that decision once

80
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,060
and it's automated from there on out.

81
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,790
The problem with that is
that it's bad at nuance.

82
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,359
So you might have a theory
about what your detection

83
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,610
analytic is gonna catch.

84
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,510
And then in practice,

85
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,950
it might catch something
altogether different.

86
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,929
A second option would be to do
this at the detection level.

87
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,860
So if we go back that last slide,

88
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,053
the detection level would be
at this human analysis level.

89
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,080
The benefits of doing it
at the human analysis level

90
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,280
is that it is good at nuance, right.

91
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,880
You've got all of the context.

92
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,560
You need to make a determination
about what you are,

93
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,010
what Mitre ATT&CK technique
is associated with it.

94
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,480
However, it's difficult to scale

95
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,470
because it slows down
your detection pipeline

96
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,030
because you have to make a
decision and choose from 200,

97
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,070
cell mode techniques.

98
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,060
Every time you detect the threat,

99
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,079
the third potential option is
like the why not both option.

100
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,519
And I'm actually gonna get into that

101
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,019
later on in this presentation.

102
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,510
So we actually map at the analytic level.

103
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,190
So we make the determinations
about what our analytics,

104
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,410
what technique they should map

105
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,010
to like when we're developing them.

106
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,690
And the reason we do this is because

107
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,330
primarily Red Canary's
exists to detect threats.

108
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,440
So when we adopted Mitre
ATT&CK a few years ago,

109
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,870
we made the decision to
optimize for threat detection

110
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,060
and speed since like, you often
times we're detecting things

111
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,660
of high priority rather than like being

112
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,113
a 100% accurate in our
mapping all the time.

113
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,500
So what this looks like in practice,

114
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,490
the red text at the top here
is a detection analytic.

115
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,400
It basically is looking for
a process that is an ltest

116
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:04,220
And to that also includes a
command line with domain trusts.

117
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,400
They're all trust this maps
to domain trust discovery.

118
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,669
And it's basically a
technique that adversary used

119
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,560
to make determinations about domain trusts

120
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,930
within an environment.

121
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,010
This is irrelevant for
the purposes of this talk,

122
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,700
but historically this detector
has helped us catch a whole

123
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,873
lot of trick bot activity.

124
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,880
So, now that you understand sort of this

125
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,010
high level background,

126
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:29,700
the first lesson that I'd
like to impart on you is like,

127
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,380
if you're going to map things,

128
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,550
or if you're gonna transition

129
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,400
from old Mitre to sub techniques,

130
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,120
like the first thing
you need to figure out

131
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,770
is all of the things that you were mapping

132
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,180
to Mitre ATT&CK in the first place.

133
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,640
So for our purposes,

134
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,120
that would include behavioral
detection analytics,

135
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,790
which I already sort of explained.

136
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,600
It would also include
Atomic Red Team tests.

137
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,000
So Atomic Red Team is an open source

138
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,120
adversary simulation, platform that,

139
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,350
that we manage and maintain
in all of the tests in it

140
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,060
are designed to simulate ATT&CK techniques

141
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,010
and they're map to ATT&CK techniques

142
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,270
for the purposes of this talk.

143
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,979
You can kind of think of these two things,

144
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,115
the behavioral analytics
and the atomic tests

145
00:06:07,115 --> 00:06:09,050
sort of interchangeably,

146
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,370
'cause like the atomic tests are

147
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:15,370
isolated scripts that map to
ATT&CK and simulated behaviors.

148
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,330
The analytics are
isolated bits of Ruby code

149
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,380
also mapped to attack,
designed to catch techniques.

150
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,270
We also map a lot of our
research and educational content

151
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,210
to Mitre ATT&CK,

152
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,400
but like a lot of it is
derivative of our detection

153
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:32,400
and we didn't go back and
retroactively map any of it.

154
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,289
So that didn't really
involve any upfront work,

155
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,610
for your purposes you might be mapping

156
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,810
threat intelligence
reporting to Mitre ATT&CK.

157
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,290
You might have like charts
and tables that you're using

158
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,740
to determine things
like detection coverage,

159
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,790
or like any variety of security
controls, alerts, IFCs,

160
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,623
and the like.

161
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,823
So.

162
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,783
Sorry.

163
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,830
Having some issues here.

164
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,263
So, once you,

165
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,890
figure out what you need

166
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,723
to map to ATT&CK, it's time
to do the actual mapping.

167
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,820
Sorry, I'm having a little
bit of trouble controlling

168
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,243
the screen right now.

169
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,200
Alright, there we go.

170
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,750
So first things first, well I
guess it's the second thing.

171
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,280
So let the code do the work for you, okay.

172
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,280
So, luckily a Miter ATT&CK
created a useful little JSON

173
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,620
crosswalk script and effectively
what that'll tell you is

174
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,230
like a tech, it'll tell you
what a technique remaps through.

175
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,170
So maybe a technique
becomes a para-technique

176
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,700
and it'll tell you the
sub-techniques under it.

177
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,710
Maybe a technique becomes a sub-technique

178
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:43,500
and it'll tell you the
para-technique above it

179
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,670
or possibly the technique
if it's like scripting

180
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,863
has just deprecated.

181
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,740
So we took,

182
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,410
that JSON crosswalk script,

183
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,820
we built a little power shell script

184
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,469
that sort of helped it work specifically

185
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,460
with our environment and
like for atomic Red Team,

186
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,159
we kind of naively thought that the code

187
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,920
would do all the work for us.

188
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,310
We were quickly disabused of that notion

189
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,660
for the behavioral analytics
as I'll get to in a minute,

190
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,290
we sort of knew that we
were gonna have to do

191
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,320
a good deal of manual review there.

192
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,870
So, once you get to the
point where you realized

193
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,810
that you're gonna to have to do

194
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,280
a human review at some level,

195
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,030
you have to make a choice of
whether or not you want to

196
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,690
divide and conquer or do it
as a small team or individual.

197
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:26,980
So the benefits of doing
it as a team obviously

198
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,660
are that it will get done faster,

199
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,040
although it might get done faster

200
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,620
at the cost of it being less consistent.

201
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,460
The benefit of assigning
it to an individual

202
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,320
or a very small team, is that
it might be more consistent.

203
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,310
And then the cost of that
might be that it takes longer.

204
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:43,280
So if you have a
reasonable number of things

205
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,069
you need to remap, then by all means,

206
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,140
keep it to a small team or an individual.

207
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,000
However, for our purposes,

208
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,650
we've got thousands of
active detection analytics.

209
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,347
We've got 500 plus from
atomic Red Team tests.

210
00:08:55,347 --> 00:08:57,040
And like, I don't even know how many,

211
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,390
but there's some like
200 plus ATT&CK technique

212
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,370
and sub-technique combos.

213
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,940
So that was just too much
work for any individual to do.

214
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,960
So we assembled a team consisting
of our intelligence team,

215
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,110
our threat research team, our
detection, engineering team.

216
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,460
And most importantly, not me.

217
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,650
So all credit goes to those three teams.

218
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,880
I stood back and watched
and asked a lot of questions

219
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,730
and wrote a blog about it eventually.

220
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,070
So I stole this quote from
my colleague, Katie Nickles,

221
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,150
but ATT&CK mapping is an
art; It's not a science.

222
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:33,740
So particularly if
you're gonna have a team

223
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,260
that's doing this work,

224
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,080
you should create a style guide,

225
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,760
because people interpret
techniques in different ways

226
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,939
in a style guide.

227
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,140
Like the other thing to remember is that

228
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,819
we're kind of learning
this on the fly, right.

229
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,110
Like these, these sub-techniques are new.

230
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,280
So a style guide will help us
learn like how to map things.

231
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,930
It will keep some guardrails
on how we map and it will help

232
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,890
enforce consistency, equally important

233
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,110
is to assign a review team.

234
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,830
So we assigned a team of
senior detection, engineers,

235
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,560
and intelligence analysts to
review every single mapping

236
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,040
decision that was made by
the broader remapping team.

237
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,150
This also helped to enforce consistency

238
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,370
and it helped us catch
errors that we may have made

239
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,793
in the mapping process.

240
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,930
Lesson five, fix, find them,
fix your legacy mapping issues.

241
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,239
So I'm gonna tell a little story.

242
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,400
So when we were working on
the threat detection report,

243
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,910
like the first thing we do is
we pull the data and we see,

244
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,350
and we make a pivot table and we see like,

245
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,130
what are the top 10 Mitre ATT&CK
techniques from last year?

246
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:38,560
The initial data poll
revealed that masquerading

247
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,762
was the top technique.

248
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,640
So we then went and we made a sub list

249
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,610
of the detectors that
converted to a threat

250
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,290
that was mapped to
masquerading most often.

251
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,660
And these two detectors showed up.

252
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,150
The first one looks for
untrusted binary, spawning,

253
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,050
suspicious windows service hosts.

254
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,939
The second one identifies SPC host

255
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,920
executing with a
suspicious pair of process.

256
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,610
All told these two detectors on their own

257
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,950
or in conjunction with one another

258
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,680
triggered on more than
4,000 confirmed threats.

259
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,910
However, when my colleague and our

260
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,290
principal intelligence analyst,

261
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,180
Jeff Felling went and reviewed
all the individual detections

262
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,329
associated with those to
a behavioral analytics,

263
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,370
he made a startling discovery.

264
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,270
He discovered that those
two analytics actually

265
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,939
were representative of Process Injection

266
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,860
and not of masquerading.

267
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,660
So we manually remapped them,
we run in the numbers again.

268
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,010
We also manually remapped
a few other analytics,

269
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:42,110
but they weren't nearly
as dramatic as these ones,

270
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,470
and process injection felt to number one

271
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,150
and then masquerading became number six.

272
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,050
So this is a great lesson.

273
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,609
Like this is the perfect time to review

274
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,880
your behavioral analytics.

275
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,170
Also probably good to be reviewing
them on a continual basis

276
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,620
just to make sure that
nothing changes over time.

277
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,650
Lesson number six,
considering the alternatives.

278
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,060
So I promised you that there
was a third sort of why not

279
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,579
both option for where we
could do our attack mapping

280
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,280
and here's why I'm gonna talk about that.

281
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,699
So again, mapping at the detection level

282
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,530
is the most accurate,

283
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,130
mapping at the analytic
level is the fastest.

284
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,620
However, we're developing an idea called

285
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,690
conditional mapping.

286
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,210
We haven't really operationalized it yet,

287
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,520
but the idea is that we're
gonna try and identify

288
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,550
ambiguous analytics.

289
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,430
Maybe they're just broad.

290
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,300
Maybe there's some sort
of other problem going on,

291
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,120
but the idea is,

292
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,290
like you pick out the ones
that don't always alert

293
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,469
on the thing you hypothesized,
they would alert on,

294
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,850
and then you require a
human review of those.

295
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:44,870
So you're still able

296
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:49,010
to keep the main benefit of
mapping at the analytic level,

297
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,400
because most of the mapping
is gonna get done there.

298
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,810
So you still have the speed.

299
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:56,349
And then you just
identify that small subset

300
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,710
of problematic detectors and you require

301
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,053
a human review of them.

302
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,880
Now the seventh and final lesson is

303
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,910
just to have fun with it guys.

304
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,560
Just kidding, that's not
the seventh lesson at all.

305
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,522
The seventh lesson is actually a lag back.

306
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,230
To give back to the
Mitre ATT&CK community.

307
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,230
So the ATT&CK team is
constantly looking for feedback.

308
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,650
They probably get less
of it than they need.

309
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:27,840
Whoops,

310
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,763
so,

311
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,190
ways you can give back.

312
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,890
Obviously the most obvious way
to give back is probably to

313
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,350
contribute techniques
back to the Mitre ATT&CK.

314
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,420
But I think also like they
want feedback on what's working

315
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,349
and what's not working.

316
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,110
And by all means you
should reach out to them

317
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,610
and let them know, suggest improvements

318
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,360
and whatever else you can think of.

319
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,450
Finally, like if you learn something

320
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,880
while using a tech that might
be useful to the rest of us,

321
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,980
write a blog about it,
or give a talk about it.

322
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,243
And then while we're
on the topic of blogs,

323
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,080
I know that I only had 14
minutes here and I'm talking

324
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,180
incredibly fast, like a mad man.

325
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,270
So if you wanna take
more time with this talk,

326
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,140
we wrote a blog version, Matt
Graeber and Katie Nickels.

327
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,720
And I wrote a blog version of this talk

328
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,530
maybe a couple of weeks ago.

329
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,790
The link is right there.

330
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,750
I'll try to remember to
tweet it after this talk,

331
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,442
if any of you follow me on Twitter.

332
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,440
And I guess without further ado,

333
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,573
we can sort of jump into the Q and A.

334
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,520
- That was fantastic Brian, thank you.

335
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,420
That was, that was really great.

336
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,069
Like I said, i really appreciate

337
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,260
from coming from the ATT&CK side,

338
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,810
we did so much work to kind of produce

339
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,489
and publish these sub-techniques.

340
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,530
So we are really excited
to see like an organization

341
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,110
as large as Red Canary adopt it

342
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,000
and actually make it their own.

343
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,210
Like you said, I love the
quotes coming off that blog,

344
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,420
the art of this, as well
as all of the nuance.

345
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,209
So definitely I've seen a
lot of traction and kind of

346
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,060
activity going around about your talks.

347
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,060
So definitely stay queued
up for some questions.

348
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,189
One thing I just wanted to ask you was,

349
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:56,660
you kinda mentioned how
kind of artistic and free

350
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,329
kind of free spirited this mapping is.

351
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,680
And one of the things I was wondering is,

352
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,930
do you think that as advice
to other organizations,

353
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,400
this is an all or not
effort, or can you map, like,

354
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,819
can you map certain portions
to sub techniques and then

355
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,710
maybe stay behind and other areas,

356
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,880
you mentioned how like nuanced
Red Canary is with the,

357
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,030
you know, Atomic Red
team and the detections

358
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,610
as well as looking at the matrix itself.

359
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,420
Like, do you think there's
areas to carve that up,

360
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,400
or do you think it's the,

361
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,670
a binary yes or no kind of question.

362
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,502
- Yeah.

363
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,970
So I think that I'm
interested in talking to other

364
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:24,900
organizations about this.

365
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,770
'Cause I actually think
that like in a weird way,

366
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,439
Red Canary is like designed
to be mapped to Miter ATT&CK.

367
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,470
And I think that there's a lot
of people that would have a

368
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,990
lot of a harder time with that.

369
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:37,750
Like specifically if you're
doing like a lot of IOC

370
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,860
in signature based stuff,

371
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,540
I can see how it would be difficult to,

372
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,930
to map things through ATT&CK.

373
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,900
And also if like you're
dealing with a lot of alerts

374
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,410
that maybe are false positives,

375
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,500
that I could also understand
how that could be a problem,

376
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,910
but yeah,

377
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,640
for us like the Atomic Red team stuff

378
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,420
and the detection analytics
really, really teed us up

379
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,579
to have like a relatively easy
job of, of mapping to ATT&CK.

380
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,580
- Yep, tracking.

381
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,490
Thank you and thanks again.

382
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,950
Excellent talk, like I said,
I think the experienced wisdom

383
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,780
that you guys have got
kind of leading the way

384
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,189
and doing that mapping is
really greatly appreciated

385
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,140
and you know, big
benefits of the community.

386
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,110
So thank you.

387
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,470
But with that, I think we're right on time

388
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,940
to turn it over back to Adam for

389
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,620
our introduction of our next speaker.

390
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,440
- Great, thanks so much.

391
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,380
- Yeah, thank you.

392
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,783
Both Jamie and Brian.
