1
00:00:02,723 --> 00:00:04,160
- Be switching to Jen Burns,

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,310
who is the Lead for Att&ck for Cloud.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:08,950
Take it away, Jen.

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:09,950
- Sure thanks, Adam.

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,090
And hey everybody,

6
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,379
I'm Jen Burns, a Lead of Att&ck for Cloud,

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,950
like Adam mentioned,

8
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,070
and really excited to talk to you all

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,190
about what's new

10
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,253
and upcoming in this area of attack.

11
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,280
So to, give a bit of a
background on Att&ck for Cloud,

12
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,460
it was actually at the first attack on

13
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,040
where Dave Herrald and Ryan Kovar,

14
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,530
presented this slide

15
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,330
that I graciously stole from them

16
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,199
and can't take credit for.

17
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,053
In their talk,

18
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:40,760
they express a need for
expanding attack into the cloud.

19
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,920
This also ended up you
know, being a fairly

20
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,880
common request from the community.

21
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,400
So about a year ago or what now,

22
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,390
I guess seems like about 10
years ago in COVID years.

23
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:54,030
The attack team was able
to turn that cloud frown

24
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,163
upside down and add cloud
techniques into attack.

25
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,199
So Att&ck for Cloud was added as a part

26
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,600
of enterprise attack.

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,400
It really was and continues
to be a community effort.

28
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,747
Almost 100% of the initial release of

29
00:01:09,747 --> 00:01:13,030
Att&ck for Cloud was
contributed by the community

30
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,950
that initial and also the current release

31
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:20,950
cover AWS, Azure and GCP,
as well as Office 365,

32
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,839
Azure Active Directory,

33
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,943
and also kind of a
generalized SaaS platform.

34
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,580
With the release of
sub-techniques in July,

35
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,620
came a refactor of
Att&ck for Cloud to also

36
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,880
add sub-techniques.

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,199
And with that update,

38
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,210
we also added some new infrastructure

39
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,270
as a service techniques
and sub-techniques like

40
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,399
modify cloud compute infrastructure within

41
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,660
defensive Asian.

42
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,300
We made some improvements to

43
00:01:47,255 --> 00:01:49,100
ensure that every
technique in cloud had some

44
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,863
sort of a description on
how it fits into cloud.

45
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,390
And as always I hope you see gaps,

46
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,950
in the cloud matrices,

47
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,300
please feel free to
send us a new technique

48
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,170
and sub-techniques submissions.

49
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,750
We love contributions.

50
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,730
We, you know,

51
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,330
definitely hope to just continue

52
00:02:06,216 --> 00:02:07,048
to work with you to make Att&ck for Cloud

53
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,103
as usable as possible for the community.

54
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,710
So with making things as
usable as possible in mind,

55
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,530
just wanted to take a
moment to kind of explain

56
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,747
what we consider to be the scope of

57
00:02:19,747 --> 00:02:21,590
the Att&ck for Cloud, as an attack team.

58
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,210
Really, you can use attack

59
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,730
including cloud in
whatever way works for you.

60
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,440
But this is how we view
like adding techniques

61
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,250
into a cloud platform with an attack.

62
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,650
One thing that we determined

63
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,150
is if the technique is generally visible

64
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,120
via cloud data sources.

65
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,584
If you're familiar with, you know,

66
00:02:39,584 --> 00:02:40,417
the shared responsibilities model

67
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:41,990
of cloud service providers.

68
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,770
These are data sources that you,

69
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,040
as a customer have visibility into

70
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,239
and are generally responsible for.

71
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,100
To think of it in kind
of the opposite way,

72
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,859
the cloud matrices generally don't contain

73
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,460
techniques that only the
cloud service providers

74
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,510
would have visibility into.

75
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,959
We might find that, you know,

76
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,010
there are exceptions to this over time,

77
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,410
especially when it
comes to SaaS providers,

78
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,510
but for the most part,

79
00:03:06,677 --> 00:03:07,510
this is what we're scoping for.

80
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,609
And then additionally,

81
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:10,859
when we scope cloud techniques,

82
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,520
the team works to
minimize that duplication

83
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,890
of techniques in cloud,

84
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,359
across those found in like the Windows,

85
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,893
Linux and Mac iOS matrices.

86
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,980
Att&ck for Cloud is really meant

87
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,049
to provide a separate layer of coverage

88
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,320
of adversary behavior that's focused

89
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,959
specifically on cloud.

90
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,360
So for example,

91
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,630
consider like an adversary
creating a Cron job

92
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,870
on Linux EC2 instance, or an Azure VM.

93
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,040
Even though that technique

94
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,609
was carried out in the cloud environment,

95
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,720
that's covered by the Linux matrix.

96
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,430
So we generally wouldn't
add that technique to cloud,

97
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,875
unless there's something that makes it

98
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:48,325
specifically unique to cloud.

99
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,290
So to kind of start digging in a bit

100
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,850
into the future of Att&ck for Cloud,

101
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,081
first thing I want to talk about

102
00:03:57,081 --> 00:03:58,070
is the future of Cloud platforms.

103
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:59,390
And as a heads up,

104
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,079
none of these proposed changes

105
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,780
are going to be added
to attack until 2021.

106
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,008
We want to make sure to give you time

107
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:08,260
to give us your feedback on this,

108
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,810
and plan for any of these updates.

109
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,370
So right now on the left to these are

110
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,490
the current platforms
in the Att&ck for Cloud.

111
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,400
After doing some research,

112
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,370
talking with folks in the community.

113
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,240
We're planning in a future release,

114
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,930
to consolidate Azure, AWS and GCP

115
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,150
into a single infrastructure
as a service platform,

116
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,840
and then continue to add additional

117
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,750
SaaS platforms to attack.

118
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,080
There are a few SaaS platforms we've been

119
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,260
considering for potential future

120
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,760
inclusion into attack.

121
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,539
We'd also be really curious on

122
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,130
your feedback here,

123
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,760
and you're in the world experience

124
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,010
with adversaries here.

125
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,080
So we can kind of continue to increase

126
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,462
coverage in this space.

127
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,760
So some of you are probably wondering

128
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,170
why that generalization into
infrastructure as a service.

129
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,040
Well, the first reason is that,

130
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,340
the current infrastructure
as a service platforms

131
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,890
already share most
techniques across attack.

132
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,550
We realized there are some exceptions here

133
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,230
and there will be in the future.

134
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,340
So those exceptions,

135
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,090
we plan to document in the descriptions

136
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,500
and other fields of the individual

137
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,000
techniques for transparency.

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,810
Another reason for this change,

139
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:19,640
is it helps to broaden the scope of attack

140
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,950
across other cloud service providers,

141
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:25,659
in addition to Azure, AWS and GCP.

142
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,493
And then,

143
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,260
finally probably most importantly,

144
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,360
the community feedback
we've received here,

145
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,270
favors a single infrastructure
as a service platform.

146
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,950
A survey at the EU att&ck conference

147
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:36,783
earlier in the year

148
00:05:36,783 --> 00:05:39,360
showed that many supported this.

149
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,010
And pretty much the first question

150
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,520
I usually get from people

151
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,270
when I talk about Att&ck for Cloud,

152
00:05:45,194 --> 00:05:46,910
is why the infrastructure
as a service platforms

153
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:47,763
are split out?

154
00:05:48,784 --> 00:05:49,617
So we're definitely interested

155
00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:50,950
in your feedback here though.

156
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,550
Please feel free to reach out,

157
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,050
once again with any thoughts
you may have on this.

158
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,710
Next thing I want to talk about is

159
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,450
plans for Cloud Data
Sources moving forward.

160
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,283
So right now,

161
00:06:02,283 --> 00:06:04,630
almost every cloud data source,

162
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,360
especially in infrastructure as a service

163
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,550
is just logs.

164
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,840
We realized that these may not be

165
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,330
the most helpful data sources

166
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,159
as they're you know, pretty general

167
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,840
and can be really vast.

168
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,813
So we planned for some
future updates here as well.

169
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,114
I'm not sure how many of you

170
00:06:23,114 --> 00:06:24,659
have seen Jose Rodriguez' post,

171
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,030
blog post about the future of data sources

172
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,440
for enterprise attack?

173
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,210
But we're also moving in that direction

174
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,090
with our cloud data sources.

175
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,159
So the idea here

176
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,800
is that you have a single data source.

177
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,570
It has one or more of these things

178
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,219
called data components.

179
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,640
And then as contributed

180
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,700
from the attack team or the community,

181
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,800
there can be mappings to relevant events

182
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,950
and APIs from the various
cloud service providers

183
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,260
and SaaS providers.

184
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,380
We really hope to move away from

185
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,969
that general logs approach

186
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:56,494
and start moving towards something

187
00:06:56,494 --> 00:06:58,265
that's a more meaningful set of

188
00:06:58,265 --> 00:06:59,363
data sources for our users.

189
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,710
So here's an example of what the instance

190
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,370
data source may look like.

191
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,230
Shout out to Matt Peshek,

192
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,550
on the attack team who
did a lot of this work.

193
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,940
So we have the data source on the left,

194
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,240
which is instance in this case.

195
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,490
Then we have multiple data components

196
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,320
that basically consists of like operations

197
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,260
on that data source.

198
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,670
And then you can map one
or more relevant events

199
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,750
to each data component based on

200
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,960
the Cloud service provider

201
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,739
or SaaS providers offerings.

202
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,540
Obviously we still have
a lot of work to do

203
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,010
in this area as a team,

204
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,659
but we really wanted to get you all

205
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,180
kind of a sneak peak.

206
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,023
So you know what our plans are here.

207
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,810
And just to recap what we're planning

208
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,520
on updating cloud data sources.

209
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,469
First off we want to ensure
that we're consistent

210
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,010
with the rest of enterprise.

211
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,659
I do recommend checking
out that blog by Jose,

212
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,990
to see what our plans are in that area.

213
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,070
We also just want to
make sure data sources

214
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,159
are more meaningful.

215
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,100
Feedback suggests that, you know,

216
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,580
that everything is logs approach,

217
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,570
isn't super helpful

218
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,460
for building things like detections.

219
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,460
So we want to refactor to, you know,

220
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,299
align to events and API calls instead.

221
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,700
And also we want to ensure
that our data sources

222
00:08:14,654 --> 00:08:16,654
approach is consistent with that plan

223
00:08:16,654 --> 00:08:18,403
for consolidating AWS, Azure and GCP

224
00:08:18,403 --> 00:08:21,990
and the infrastructure as
a service, as a platform.

225
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:24,780
We're hoping to make the data sources

226
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,880
and data components general enough

227
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,510
across the cloud service providers

228
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,253
that they're usable across all.

229
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,429
And finally, I just want to put out a call

230
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:37,250
to the community to help
us make Att&ck for Cloud

231
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,490
as useful as possible.

232
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,960
First, please let us know if you have any

233
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,350
thoughts on how we can
improve Att&ck for Cloud.

234
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,980
You're the ones with boots
on the ground using it.

235
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,970
We want to make sure
that it works for you.

236
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,710
Also we need your help

237
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,110
to continue to add to

238
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,790
and improve Att&ck for Cloud.

239
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,577
Please reach out if you have

240
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:57,150
"in the wild" visibility
into what adversaries

241
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,150
are doing in this space

242
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,578
and send us your contributions.

243
00:08:59,578 --> 00:09:03,610
Also if you have opinions
on the future platforms

244
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,430
or data sources updates
that we're planning,

245
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,900
please let us know.

246
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,770
Nothing is set in stone yet.

247
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,331
We want to make sure that these changes

248
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:13,123
are what's going to work the best for you.

249
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,959
And as always, you can reach out to us

250
