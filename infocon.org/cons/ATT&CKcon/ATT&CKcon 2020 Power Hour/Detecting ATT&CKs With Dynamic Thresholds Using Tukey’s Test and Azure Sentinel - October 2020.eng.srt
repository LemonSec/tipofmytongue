1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,920
- Let me introduce first myself, I'm Jair.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,957
Actually the full name is
Jose Jair Cardoso De Santanna,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,920
but let's keep short, Jair.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,520
I'm a Cloud Security lead

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,250
at Northwave Security,

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,650
a security company in the Netherlands.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,830
And I'm also assistant professor
at University of Twente.

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,860
And you understand the
why I emphasize that.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,080
So, I need to talk first

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,280
about the problem of static threshold.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,340
Yeah, so let me give one example

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,880
and I need your help, okay?

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,880
So, how much milk should
I give to my daughter?

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,040
Yeah, so, I have a one and
a half years old daughter.

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,770
She usually drinks,

16
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,770
or we usually give to her 180ml
three times a day, 30 days.

17
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:00,630
So, per month we spend like,
we buy 17 liters of milk.

18
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,700
But then I noticed that
sometimes she drinks everything,

19
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,429
and seems that are still thirsty.

20
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,203
And sometimes she doesn't
finish her bottle, obviously.

21
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,107
And my wife used to say,

22
00:01:17,107 --> 00:01:20,830
"well, better to put more
milk than let her thirsty."

23
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,940
Do you agree?

24
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,450
Well, to me, it's not like that.

25
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,750
I'm a data-driven guy,

26
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:31,470
so I just ask her to give 200mls of milk,

27
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,410
and then we count how much
milk she drink every day

28
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:37,482
during the month of August.

29
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,669
On average, she drank 172ml per time,

30
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,880
the minimal that she drank was 97,

31
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,119
and the maximum was 200.

32
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,933
Wait, we gave 200, she drank 200.

33
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,479
That mean I could say something, nothing.

34
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,520
That she just drink these on average.

35
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,100
The 97, if I look to the graph,

36
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,549
looks a pretty clear abnormal point, yeah?

37
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,320
And if it's 200,

38
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,623
well, possibly she was thirsty.

39
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,070
Then my question comes to you.

40
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,739
How much more should I put on her bottle?

41
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,513
Yeah, and then I said,

42
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,070
first I need to explain something

43
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,410
that is what I explained to my students.

44
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,410
That is the quantiles,
percentiles, quartiles, median,

45
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,940
so I'll bring you back
to the school, okay?

46
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,579
So, here's the graph and here
are all the points, okay?

47
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,160
So, all the amount of milk that she drink,

48
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,150
I just sort all the values, okay?

49
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,040
Now, if I divide these in the middle,

50
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,480
let me ask you which element,

51
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,010
so, which number is at the
middle of the second list?

52
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,090
And then you look to the list and say

53
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,040
looks like that is the 188.

54
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,040
These guys also called as
075 quantile, 75% percentile

55
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,820
or three-thirds quartile,
but the value is 188.

56
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:19,320
So, if you look to the
sec or to the first part

57
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,560
and I ask you, what is
element at the middle?

58
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,470
You would say 156, and indeed.

59
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,379
And this is called 025 quantile,

60
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:31,972
25 percentile or first quartile.

61
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,390
And then if I ask you which
element is at the middle

62
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,200
of this list of values?

63
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,320
You would say, Jair,

64
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,130
that is not one single element there

65
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:48,030
but it's somewhere between
the 176 and the 177.

66
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,473
So, why not to have this as the median?

67
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:58,427
And these middle element is called median.

68
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,720
Ah hah, okay.

69
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,723
So far, so good, I hope.

70
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,180
So, there is another concept
that is really important

71
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,330
for me to explain the rest

72
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,660
that is called interquartile range.

73
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:16,659
That is basically the difference
between Q3 and Q1, okay?

74
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,113
It means, basically,
what is the difference?

75
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,030
Which range of values are

76
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,363
between this quartile and the top one?

77
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,513
And then came to this
guy called John Tukey.

78
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,770
Tukey not Turkey.

79
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,637
And then he said,

80
00:04:33,637 --> 00:04:38,297
"well, let's define the range
to see how much this value

81
00:04:38,297 --> 00:04:40,630
"would variate, okay?"

82
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,463
And then he said,

83
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:44,717
"well, if I would like to
analyze the lowest point,

84
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,587
"I will take the key one,

85
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,847
"and then I'll take the
interquartile range,

86
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:50,727
"multiply by one dot five

87
00:04:50,727 --> 00:04:53,046
"and subtract these two, take you one."

88
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,010
He also proposed the
definition of the higher value.

89
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,840
That is take three,

90
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,840
take these interquartile
range, this difference,

91
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,063
and then multiply it
by one dot five, okay?

92
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,590
This, what's called honest
significance difference

93
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:17,169
or Tukey's test to define
this app and our value.

94
00:05:18,643 --> 00:05:20,669
And then came this visualization.

95
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,580
Who of you knows what is visualization?

96
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,859
Yes, it's a block box plot.

97
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,710
What you may not know is that

98
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,890
the third quartile, this value,

99
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,070
the second quartile's veto,

100
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,180
the first quartile's this.

101
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,620
The difference in the box
is interquartile range.

102
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,590
This is the lowest value,

103
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,022
and this is the upper value.

104
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,880
This is the moment that
usually my students says

105
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,380
ah, this is what the block box plot means.

106
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,200
Yes, it is values below

107
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,652
are actually the abnormal points, okay?

108
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,560
And I put suffix at the corner.

109
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,970
This is not a normal distribution.

110
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,263
For this reason, the
values may be different.

111
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,359
So, if you remember, I ask and
measure everything in August.

112
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,160
And then I saw that I gave 200mls,

113
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,980
but she reached near 200ml.

114
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,173
So, thirsty, possibly.

115
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,050
But after I did this Tukey test,

116
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,260
I just took that value, the upper value,

117
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,893
and then I asked my wife,
please let's give only 236.

118
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,193
And then this is the graph of September.

119
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,050
So, the maximum that my daughter drank

120
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,383
in all this month was 217.

121
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,830
Question, is she thirsty?

122
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,663
Was she?

123
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,010
No.

124
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,053
Is it clear so far?

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,590
So, it means that instead
of that 17 liters,

126
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:04,359
I actually is better to buy 20 liters

127
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,023
and guarantee that she
will not be thirsty.

128
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,450
And I could do this

129
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:14,789
for the calculation of
the Tukey test per month

130
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,080
or I could do per day,

131
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,010
or I could do per feeding,
compare it to some past data.

132
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,973
Is that clear?

133
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,230
I hope so.

134
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,750
Now, applying to attacks.

135
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,540
So, if you just now take this graph,

136
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,310
I remove, and I tell you

137
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,380
that this graph had the
peak, you right now.

138
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,070
And I say that this graph represents

139
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:44,070
the number of signings of a user per day.

140
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,140
And then you look to the
graph, looked the peak and say

141
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:53,140
well, if this is the
amount of signings per day,

142
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,550
what we have here, it's
a huge peak of signings.

143
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,480
Well, I know this guy.

144
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,170
This may be a brute force

145
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,870
because this have been normal point there

146
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,840
is clearly a brute force,

147
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,659
or I just need to further investigate.

148
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,970
If I tell you

149
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,580
that instead of this graph
being assignee frequency,

150
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,990
is a network traffic.

151
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,640
Yeah, from one IP,

152
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,979
sending traffic outside the company.

153
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:22,260
And see the speaker say

154
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:27,260
hmm, this could be some
type of exfiltration.

155
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,920
And if I tell you that this
graph is the DNS traffic,

156
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,723
is the DNS request
towards one domain name,

157
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,120
you could say, well,

158
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,470
this got to be a command
control communication.

159
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,240
Did you get the point here?

160
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,770
Is that, you just need
to use the Tukey test

161
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:54,770
to compare that point to previous points

162
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:59,020
or to a previous number of points.

163
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,883
Is that clear?

164
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:01,940
I hope so.

165
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,023
Now, I need to introduce Sentinel.

166
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:06,773
Who of you have no clue what is Sentinel?

167
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,060
Maybe men that has no clue.

168
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,930
Sentinel is the SIEM.

169
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,229
The security information

170
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,660
and event management from Microsoft.

171
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,660
Cloud-born offers whoever
that is the behavior analytics

172
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:27,219
and automatic response with SOAR.

173
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,990
This is how it looks like.

174
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,660
And Sentinel is for free.

175
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,790
You just need to pay for the data

176
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,839
that you need to in just there.

177
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,990
Okay jokers.

178
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,300
So, why I like Sentinel,

179
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,439
first of all is that

180
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,010
you can integrate all
the Microsoft stuffs.

181
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,550
The, well, if it's Microsoft think

182
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,733
it's supposed to
integrate Microsoft think.

183
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,060
But I don't want to go there.

184
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,469
It goes beyond, yeah?

185
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,070
I discovered work with Sentinel

186
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,280
and my team of engineers

187
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,540
that we can actually
onboard any type of data

188
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:05,849
from any type of security
or no security box, okay?

189
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,850
So, let's say now that I
can put inside Sentinel

190
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,340
the identity management
with the signings logs.

191
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:19,340
Remember, or the firewall
logs or the DNS server.

192
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:27,090
So, what I like the most
about Sentinel is that,

193
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,280
is the flexibility,

194
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,390
because I play with a lot of SIEMs

195
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,449
and we cannot write everything

196
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:38,160
that are predefined
templates that, well, no.

197
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,140
So, I'm a data driven person,

198
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,120
so I want to use the data as I want,

199
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,630
and not as someone says for me to do.

200
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,510
So, this is where we can use

201
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,943
the language defined by
Microsoft, that this a KQL.

202
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,540
And then when I start learning a Sentinel

203
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,550
and teaching to my team,
I signed the documentation

204
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,670
that was a function,

205
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:06,120
that implements exactly the Tukey's test.

206
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,990
Nice, so, remember these attacks?

207
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,910
This is what the KQL
looks more or less like.

208
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,530
So, this is in production KQL.

209
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:24,523
So, basically, I receive
firewall log data using Syslog.

210
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,083
I make a series, okay?

211
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,180
And then I just get that series and ask

212
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:39,180
use the function to calculate
what is the test of Tukey?

213
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,980
And then I can see which
values are are higher

214
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,770
than one dot five, okay?

215
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,023
That one dot five times the EQR.

216
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,310
So, basically, here I just used

217
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,300
one internal IP address

218
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,599
communicating to a external IP address

219
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,250
of some abnormal amounts of bytes sent

220
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,623
in relation to the past.

221
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,380
But I need to tell you
what are the problems.

222
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,710
Well, how should you fine tune, yeah?

223
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,270
And how can you bring this life?

224
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,840
Because I usually
recommend for you to first

225
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,440
before bringing it alive
to test over the data.

226
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,160
If you do tests with
the data that you have

227
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,350
you will notice that these
type of graphs will appear.

228
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,510
So, something that was,

229
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,520
imagine that these are outgoing data

230
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,520
from one single IP to
external IP addresses, okay?

231
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,073
And then this IP address
was almost no activity.

232
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:46,380
And suddenly there is a peak, yeah?

233
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,160
When I asked the analysts in the SOC,

234
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,579
if they should trigger an alarm,
they say, of course, yeah.

235
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,813
I see clearly in the graph,
there is a clear peak.

236
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,439
But then to consider these exfiltration,

237
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,380
I need to know how many IPs

238
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,420
these internal IP are communicating.

239
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,579
If is one, two, many.

240
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,580
If there are many,

241
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,150
I don't know if I would
consider exfiltration.

242
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,810
So, then the other question is that

243
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,069
if I run this over and over my best time,

244
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,880
I don't know, yesterday, the day before,

245
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,283
or one hour before, and so on and so far,

246
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,893
do I notice this behavior again?

247
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,640
And in one of the case,
one of the customers,

248
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,380
we noticed that over time,

249
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,590
some IPs start having this peak, yeah?

250
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,660
And then I asked them,

251
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,370
well, I send a list of IPs and said,

252
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,000
well, these IPs have abnormal behavior.

253
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,470
And we noticed at this time,
this time, at this time,

254
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,145
and then they said, Jair,

255
00:13:51,145 --> 00:13:53,699
this list of IPs are behind that.

256
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,140
So, every time away from the DHCP,

257
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,110
someone receives a new IP,

258
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:04,110
and then a new IP starts exchanging data.

259
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,270
Ah hah, Okay.

260
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,990
Another customer, we see this behavior

261
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,340
and were some peaks.

262
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,890
And then we asked

263
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,850
well, with the tests sent to the customer.

264
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,830
And then he said, ah,
Jair, this specific IP

265
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:23,143
is over and over every Monday
doing some backups, okay?

266
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,499
And if these are the DNS analysis,

267
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:32,560
or the DNS square is to a specific domain.

268
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,650
This is normal.

269
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,400
It's like I tell you now,

270
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,420
I tell you in the chat,
what is my webpage?

271
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,733
And everyone would access that URL.

272
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,560
It means that the number of DNS squares

273
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,670
generated within the company would be big.

274
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,500
The question is, is this the normal

275
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,130
or the abnormal behavior?

276
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,939
Well, in this case it may be normal

277
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:58,500
and not a command control communication.

278
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,110
So, all these nuances

279
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,993
you need to fine tune and
fine tune with the customer.

280
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:09,400
So, before you bring live tests,

281
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,020
using as much data as you can,

282
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:16,640
I tell my engineers to run
10,000 times this same algorithm.

283
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,699
Just create a loop,

284
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,480
go back in time and live
the algorithm running

285
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,630
for the entire night.

286
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,550
Give me the data, and
let's contact the customer

287
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,540
to clarify, to fine tune your algorithm,

288
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:34,540
to add which IP should be
removed, or which IP should be.

289
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,580
We cannot use black list,
white list, anymore, but okay.

290
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,010
But yeah, remove or include, yeah.

291
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,433
To be more, whatever.

292
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,550
And then after you create this list,

293
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:52,303
you can bring your algorithm live.

294
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,210
Look into the future.

295
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,803
And checking my time here,

296
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:58,963
I'm almost there.

297
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,220
Basically, what I'm
doing with the Academia,

298
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,550
with my students,

299
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,142
is taking the entire list, of my tree.

300
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,310
And then we are going one by one there

301
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:15,800
and try to create a
signature-based rule using KQL.

302
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,670
And then in the second stage,

303
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,479
we do this same thing
using statistical methods

304
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,343
like the Tukey's test.

305
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,370
But we also use some
machine learning algorithms.

306
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,780
And then the KQL,

307
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,650
you cannot write a machine
learning algorithms,

308
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:38,053
but Sentinel allow us
to use Jupiter notebook.

309
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,700
My life is saved.

310
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,890
Now, we can bring all our crazy
machine learning algorithms

311
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,113
to use the data within Sentinel.

312
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:50,380
Now, guys, let me go.

313
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:55,370
My little one wants the
217 of milk or less.

314
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,423
Thank you very much.
