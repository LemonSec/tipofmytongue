1
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,040
This is a wonderful community to be a
part of. It's open, its innovative.

2
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,240
I've been consistently impressed with
the quality of presentations I've seen

3
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,450
not just you know here at events like
MITRE ATT&CKcon, but really at

4
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,810
conferences all throughout the year and
sometimes that's coming from the ATT&CK

5
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,380
team itself, but a lot of times it's
coming from the community.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,120
This is our second annual ATT&CKcon, and
I think it's just always you know

7
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:08,560
exciting to see the companies that come
to the table and are willing to roll up

8
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,850
their sleeves, collaborate, learn share
and we hope that we're going to have

9
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,589
many more years and continue to grow.

10
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,550
Absolutely thrilling to see everyone
that's been involved in this in

11
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,330
different ways. A lot of people are
simply using the MITRE

12
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,080
framework. Doesn't really matter in terms
of how you contribute to a community, but

13
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,800
being part of the community and sharing
your lessons, being able to help kind of drive

14
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,240
it forward is huge.

15
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,820
I think this is a fantastic production.
I'm excited for next year's I'm sure it

16
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,280
will be even bigger and even better, and
you guys should all be incredibly proud

17
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,670
of what you've accomplished here.
