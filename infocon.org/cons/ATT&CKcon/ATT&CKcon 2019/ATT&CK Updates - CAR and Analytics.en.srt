1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,615
- [Katie] Please join me
in welcoming Ivan Kirillov.

2
00:00:03,616 --> 00:00:06,866
(audience applauding)

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,240
- All right, thanks, Katie.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,240
So I don't have any
spreadsheets, but I do have memes

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,259
and I do have a heat map,
so, drink a beer, something.

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,180
All right, so, first quick show of hands,

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,650
who's familiar with CAR, like at all?

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:25,220
Have you guys, have you heard of it?

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,099
Oh wow, all right, awesome.

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,760
That's more than I thought.

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,430
No, that's great, that's
great, that's not a problem.

12
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,460
Yeah, so for those of you
that aren't familiar with it,

13
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,810
it's not a plane, it's not a real car.

14
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,870
What it is is it's an acronym
and a website, so (chuckles)

15
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,849
as you can imagine, yeah, so what it is,

16
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,480
it's really an ATT&CK-driven
analytics repository

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,819
that we have on GitHub, so,
it's actively maintained,

18
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:51,250
which is nice because
it wasn't for a while.

19
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,660
So CAR was kind of really
actively maintained

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,639
from 2013 to 2016,

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,810
and then it had kind of three-year hiatus,

22
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,860
but now it's back, and
it's back in a big way,

23
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,180
at least I hope so. (chuckles)

24
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,440
But yeah, besides analytics,

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,740
I think we have some interesting things

26
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,270
that a lot of people don't have,

27
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,330
with regards to analytic
repositories, right?

28
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:11,220
So we have a data model that allows you

29
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,880
to do vendor agnostic
mappings to our data model,

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,130
and then you can use those
inside of your analytics.

31
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,100
We also have mappings to sensors,
although there's a caveat

32
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,570
on that, which I'll mention.

33
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,410
Most of them are horribly
outdated. (chuckles)

34
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,369
And then we have an
exploration tool called Carrot,

35
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,450
so Carrot, I think, is
kind of an interesting tool

36
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,370
for showing kinda the
relationships between sensors,

37
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,050
data sources, and analytics.

38
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,630
It's really more of a proof of concept.

39
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,119
I don't think you'd do
much operationally with it,

40
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,950
but it is kind of a cool way of showing

41
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,960
that if you add a sensor,
you'll get a lot more coverage

42
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,792
in terms of your analytics,

43
00:01:39,793 --> 00:01:41,757
so there's some nice stuff there.

44
00:01:41,757 --> 00:01:44,700
Yeah, so, but recently, we've
been doing a lot of stuff

45
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,481
on just trying to kind
of increase the quality,

46
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:49,160
the good stuff we have in CAR,

47
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,300
just trying to make it better.

48
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,100
One obvious thing is just
adding new analytics,

49
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,270
so, again, we didn't have any since 2016.

50
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,020
We've added eight new ones this year,

51
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,470
so I think that's pretty awesome.

52
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,880
Another one is we've converted
all our analytics to YAML.

53
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,300
So, if you want to parse them
and adjust them into your sim,

54
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,730
into your Splunk instance,
whatever, you can do that now,

55
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,120
so I think that's pretty cool.

56
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,210
And then another one

57
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,820
is we've added multiple
implementations to each analytics,

58
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,120
so this is an example of one, right?

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,750
So, as you can see here, we
have pseudocode at the top.

60
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,900
So that's what CAR used to have.

61
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,820
CAR used to have only
pseudocode implementations.

62
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,102
Since then, we've started adding things

63
00:02:21,102 --> 00:02:23,876
like Splunk, Sigma, Equal.

64
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:25,340
We don't really care.

65
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,560
We're kind of agnostic to
all these implementations.

66
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,810
Our goal is really just trying
to increase the coverage

67
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,380
of these, both from a
user perspective, I mean,

68
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,400
I think if you're a new
analyst, just coming

69
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,150
and having a ready-made Splunk query

70
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,580
you can at least start with is nice,

71
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,800
but I think there's also some other things

72
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,720
you can gain from that.

73
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,599
You can see what different
languages support.

74
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,359
All of these syntaxes, these languages,

75
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,460
have different capabilities,

76
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:49,113
so I think it's kind of interesting
just seeing it that way.

77
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,061
Yeah, but wait, there's more.

78
00:02:53,062 --> 00:02:55,040
(gasp) We have high-tech metal alloys.

79
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,873
No, I'm kidding.

80
00:02:55,873 --> 00:02:57,209
We have something even better, though.

81
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,580
We have BZAR, or BZAR, I guess.

82
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,540
I'm always kinda confused
'cause there's no I in there,

83
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,900
but anyway, so BZAR is a
set of a Bro ATT&CK scripts

84
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,350
that we've written.

85
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,609
Help detect several
network-based analytics.

86
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,530
It's pretty cool work.

87
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,180
I think it's kind of,
more on the cutting edge

88
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,160
of what you can detect
with some of this stuff.

89
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,620
It uses the SumStats
framework in Zeek to do this,

90
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,500
and, from what I understand, it's pretty,

91
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,620
well, it's pretty popular.

92
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,500
We have already got a
couple of pull requests

93
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,550
against that code base, so, yeah,

94
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,100
I think that's something
else that's pretty neat.

95
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,019
Besides that, we've been
updating our data models.

96
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,000
So, I mentioned we have this
data model, it's agnostic.

97
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,250
We have a process object,
we have a file object,

98
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,670
we have all of that good
stuff, but we haven't updated

99
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,559
for three years, so
there's clearly some things

100
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,540
that we're missing from
analytics, EDR tools.

101
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,125
We've been slowly kind
of building that up,

102
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,130
and then otherwise,

103
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,600
we've been trying to just
increase our attack coverage,

104
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,609
so just make it more accurate, right?

105
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,403
So we had some mappings
that were just plain wrong.

106
00:03:54,403 --> 00:03:56,679
(chuckles) Part of that
was just, honestly,

107
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,040
I think just error, but there were also,

108
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,239
in those three years that
CAR wasn't really active,

109
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,720
we had new attack
techniques that came along,

110
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,190
so I think we've kind of fixed that.

111
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,620
So everything in CAR now,
it should be a lot cleaner,

112
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,487
a lot better mapped to ATT&CK.

113
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,400
So I think I'm kind of required
legally to have a heat map,

114
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,049
at least in terms of coverage,
(chuckles) so here it is,

115
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,970
but the main thing here is
we have pretty good coverage

116
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,520
of things like discovery, right?

117
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,030
That's kind of low-hanging
fruit, I think, for a lot of us,

118
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,229
so that's not really not surprising.

119
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,750
Where we do have I think
some gaps is pretty obvious,

120
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,741
command and control.

121
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:35,820
As you can see, we kind
of don't have a lot

122
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,430
of network things, so I mentioned BZAR,

123
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,640
that's kind of one of
the things we do have,

124
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,130
but most of our analytics
are, right now, unfortunately,

125
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:44,110
they're Windows-centric
and they're host-based,

126
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,180
which, again, is kind of not surprising

127
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,540
'cause that's kind of where
the state of these things are,

128
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,290
but we are working to improve that.

129
00:04:51,254 --> 00:04:55,250
So I have foreseen some new
things we could be doing.

130
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,778
Before I go into these,
I just want to mention,

131
00:04:57,778 --> 00:04:59,990
kind of the philosophy that I think

132
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,130
we should be taking with this stuff, so,

133
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,066
there's other analytical
repositories out there.

134
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:06,640
They're doing different things
and I think that's great.

135
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,339
I think our focus with
ATT&CK or, sorry, with CAR,

136
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:11,410
is that we want to kind of experiment,

137
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,605
so we want to try new things,

138
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:16,420
we want to implement new ideas.

139
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,770
I think we can be really agile there

140
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,950
because the state of analytics sharing,

141
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,430
I think it's still pretty nascent.

142
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,920
There's certainly good content out there,

143
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,490
but I think people
aren't really sharing it,

144
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,100
and I think there's some
issues that we've seen,

145
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,080
so hopefully we can kind
of prototype that in CAR.

146
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,750
If it doesn't work, that's
great, but hopefully,

147
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,080
we'll learn something
from that, so, anyway,

148
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,550
that's my hope going forward.

149
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,010
So, obviously, we want
new analytics, right?

150
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,400
So I mentioned we're kind
of lacking in certain areas.

151
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,390
I don't know if Tony's in the room,

152
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,430
but we would love to get
his Linux stuff in here.

153
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,029
So Linux is definitely
one of our priorities.

154
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:52,100
Besides that, we want to do
something like building blocks.

155
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,320
So building blocks is sort of this concept

156
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,310
where you kind of decompose
analytics into smaller pieces

157
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,741
that make them easier to manage.

158
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:04,003
So as an example, I wrote
an analytic about a year ago

159
00:06:04,003 --> 00:06:06,719
for UAC bypass, and I actually,

160
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,160
basically rolled in several different,

161
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,980
actually seven different
techniques of UAC bypass

162
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,490
into that analytic.

163
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,750
That's pretty, I don't
know, almost kind of cloogy,

164
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,750
it's difficult to maintain.

165
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,490
Let's say one of those techniques

166
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,377
suddenly becomes no longer
valuable, what do you do?

167
00:06:22,377 --> 00:06:23,720
Do you just throw that away?

168
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,170
Do you create a new analytics?

169
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,890
So I think there's a lot we can do

170
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,430
about kind of helping us think

171
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,160
about how you create
analytics and manage them,

172
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,130
and I think this sort of
notion of building blocks

173
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,940
could be interesting on top of that.

174
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,100
Besides that, data model
I mentioned already,

175
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,740
but I think there's a lot
more we could do to update it,

176
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,750
so, we could definitely do more work

177
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,923
on network-based modeling for layer seven.

178
00:06:45,923 --> 00:06:49,270
HTTP and DNS are I think
one of the few areas

179
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,740
that aren't really explored very well,

180
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,510
so I think we can do some work there.

181
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,000
And then, obviously,
I mentioned EDR tools,

182
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,700
so Sysmon is great, but
there's other tools out there,

183
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,659
and I think we want to make sure

184
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,510
that we can roll in
whatever those tools do well

185
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,603
into our data model.

186
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,780
Another idea we've had

187
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,030
is kind of what we call baseball cards.

188
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,890
So this is basically trying

189
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,710
to kind of give all the
critical information

190
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,440
about an analytic in a really
short, succinct fashion

191
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,370
because when you're looking at analytics,

192
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,281
it can be really difficult to understand.

193
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:21,338
Do they apply to your environment?

194
00:07:21,338 --> 00:07:23,130
Can you use it?

195
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,480
Do you have the right data sources?

196
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,530
Is it riddled with false positives?

197
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,229
So all that is kind of
really good information

198
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,730
that I think we could convey much better.

199
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,547
So I think there's something
we could do there as well.

200
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:38,060
So I mentioned our
sensor coverage earlier.

201
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,820
It's, (chuckles) unfortunately,
it's pretty outdated,

202
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,147
so right now, we only have Sysmon 3.2,

203
00:07:43,148 --> 00:07:45,530
and I think it's what, on
version nine or something?

204
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,352
So, (chuckles) yeah, we need to fix that.

205
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:52,030
And I think we definitely will
(chuckles) 'cause I think,

206
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,880
again, that's one of the really
kind of interesting pieces

207
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,180
that CAR does well right now
and no one else really has.

208
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,450
I mentioned Carrot a little
bit, so, Carrot works okay.

209
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,700
Like I said, it's fine.

210
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,580
You guys should check it out.

211
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,550
It's a cool visualization,

212
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,650
but I think there's
definitely work we can do

213
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,539
to make it more useful and
also just kind of work better

214
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,585
in the hood, maybe rewriting
some of that lovely JavaScript.

215
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:15,989
(chuckles) And then ATT&CK
coverage, so this one I think

216
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,780
is actually really important
and it kind of gets out

217
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,510
to maybe some of the sub-techniques work

218
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,960
that the core team is doing
as well, but so, in CAR,

219
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,849
we have not only the ATT&CK technique,

220
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,440
but we have the actual
kind of level of coverage

221
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,370
for each technique, which we, right now,

222
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,720
just we say low, medium, high,
so it's pretty arbitrary.

223
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,280
I think we're gonna need to think

224
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,530
about that more scientifically.

225
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,630
We need to do, I think, much better

226
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,586
about discussing how we
cover these techniques,

227
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:44,860
because if you say you have a,

228
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,100
let's say you have a medium
or high level of coverage,

229
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,350
but your technique is actually missing

230
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,630
in a lot of key procedures,
a lot of key implementations,

231
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,080
of that technique, then, obviously,

232
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,510
you're not really covering anything.

233
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,840
I mean, you're not doing
what you expect to do.

234
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,570
So I really want to
refactor some of that work,

235
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,210
and then ISO evasion, right?

236
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,490
So I think that one is
also pretty important.

237
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,400
A lot of analytics we have
in CAR are, unfortunately,

238
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,600
I would say, brittle, in the
sense that if an adversary

239
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,101
changes something simple,
like a file name or a hash,

240
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:16,670
then they can easily evade that analytic,

241
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,290
so I think we need to
capture that as well.

242
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,653
So as you can see, a
lot of these things are,

243
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,780
just like additional properties,

244
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,589
they're just helping us
define things about analytics,

245
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,080
but I think, as a community,

246
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,300
we need to think about this, right?

247
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,370
I think some of us have these ideas,

248
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,830
they're kind of all over.

249
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,840
I had great discussions
during our BoF earlier,

250
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,700
so I think there's obviously some things

251
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,520
we can take away from
that, but I really hope

252
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,850
we can kind of use CAR as a means

253
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,950
of just getting the ideas out there.

254
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,570
Again, if maybe they don't work,

255
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,233
they're not fully
fleshed out, that's fine.

256
00:09:45,233 --> 00:09:48,160
At least we'll have some
way to actually try it out

257
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,992
and test it out.

258
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,220
So I know you guys have analytics,

259
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,490
everybody's analytics, right?

260
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,100
So please share them. (chuckles)

261
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,260
You don't want to make
the kitty angry, do you?

262
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,150
'Cause he looks pretty mean,
I don't know. (chuckles)

263
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,670
No, but seriously,
thanks to everybody else

264
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,380
who's contributed, so, we
actually, it's pretty cool.

265
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,930
So we had four contributions, like I said,

266
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,479
in the past several months
of new analytics to CAR,

267
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,070
and they were all from
different countries.

268
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,187
So Meric Degirmenci, IBM,
he's from Turkey, I believe.

269
00:10:17,187 --> 00:10:20,760
Kaushal Parikh from Cyware
Labs, he's from India,

270
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,689
and then Tony Lambert,
Red Canary is from the US,

271
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,944
but yeah, it was really cool
just to see just random,

272
00:10:24,944 --> 00:10:27,530
it's like, hey, GitHub pull
request for new analytic

273
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,329
and it's pretty awesome, so anyway,

274
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,950
I definitely encourage you guys.

275
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,880
Maybe next year, I'll
bring a little matchbox car

276
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,530
and I'll paint it gold, and
whoever has the most submissions

277
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,130
over that year, they'll
win the golden car.

278
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,880
It's gonna be awesome. (chuckles)

279
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,780
All right, so that's pretty much it.

280
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,510
So these are the resources I mentioned.

281
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:48,819
So we have the main CAR website,

282
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,590
that's where all this stuff lives.

283
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,940
The YAML-ized analytics,
you can go there in GitHub

284
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,010
and basically, everything is on GitHub,

285
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,540
so if you just go to that
root URL, you'll find it all.

286
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,849
And then, yeah, just to end with a quote

287
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,633
from the great thespian, Vin Diesel,

288
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,829
maybe we can get a 10-second
car with your contributions,

289
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,100
so I'll leave you with that.

290
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,646
All right, thank you.

291
00:11:11,646 --> 00:11:14,896
(audience applauding)

292
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,200
- We have time for maybe one
quick question about CAR.

293
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,793
You have Ivan up here.

294
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,803
Any questions anyone has?

295
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,939
If not--

296
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:30,771
- [Man] Can I ask a question?

297
00:11:30,772 --> 00:11:34,163
- There we go, gentleman
down front. (chuckles)

298
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,823
- What inspired the CAR revival?

299
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,970
- That's a good question. (chuckles)

300
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,230
- [Katie] Did you and John
just have more time magically?

301
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,690
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
basically, what happened

302
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,650
was we realized we had this CAR thing,

303
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,470
it was still out there, and people were,

304
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,450
people do still use it,
even in the 2016 state,

305
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,283
and we were like,

306
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:57,280
hey, maybe we should
actually start active work

307
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,720
on this again, so it was just kind of one

308
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,020
of those spur of the moment
things, and I think it's led

309
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,160
to much bigger and better things,

310
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,360
but that's sometimes how it happens, yeah.

311
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,830
- I agree, I think from my perspective,

312
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,940
going out and briefing
like, oh, you can use ATT&CK

313
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,700
for analytics or at the
ATT&CK EU workshop last year

314
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,550
that just happened again
this year, around Hack.lu,

315
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,910
we heard from folks like,
we'd really like to see more,

316
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,510
so I'm really grateful to Ivan
and John for all their work

317
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,860
on CAR and more to come, it sounds like.

318
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,300
Give us your analytics.

319
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,132
- That's right.

320
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:25,300
- All right, thank you so much, Ivan.

321
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,132
- Thanks, guys.

322
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:29,277
