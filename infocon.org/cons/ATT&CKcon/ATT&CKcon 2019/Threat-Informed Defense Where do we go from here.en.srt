1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,613
- [Announcer] Please join me
in welcoming Richard Struse.

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,129
- Idea guy, yikes, yikes.

3
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,410
So thanks all, thanks
all for sticking with us.

4
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,620
Before I get into the meat of my talk,

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:26,530
I just wanna do three
shout outs for some folks

6
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,580
who have done an amazing job today.

7
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,409
First, our gracious host, Katie Nichols,

8
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:34,361
I think she's done a fabulous job.

9
00:00:34,362 --> 00:00:37,529
(audience applauding)

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,989
Second, our soon to be
on the Today show anchor,

11
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,593
Jamie Williams, wherever Jamie is.

12
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,569
And third, maybe a little less visible,

13
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:54,300
but definitely very
important and much loved

14
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,113
is Adam Pennington
manning the tweet station.

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,310
So I just wanna sort of reward
you for sticking through

16
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,300
with something that's really
gonna be easy to digest,

17
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,780
I unfortunately have no cat
memes, no magic unicorns,

18
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,665
no ninja cats, but I do really wanna talk,

19
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:19,910
step back a little and
think about what it is

20
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,300
when we start to think about
threat informed defense,

21
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,070
what does it really mean and really

22
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,080
what's our call to action.

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,600
So I really think if this is about action,

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,183
this is a community made
up of practitioners.

25
00:01:30,183 --> 00:01:32,689
This is a community made up of doers.

26
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:36,300
So I'm the idea guy, in
quotes, standing up here.

27
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,630
I'm exhorting you to
action and it's really

28
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,030
kind of an easy job because you all embody

29
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,120
such an amazing spirit of can-do.

30
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,360
And whether it's Olaf and
what he was talking about

31
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,929
or Alan Wischiff talking about, John

32
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,090
what he was talking about,
it's just an amazing

33
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,960
amount of energy and that's great,

34
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,720
but how do we focus and challenge that?

35
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,550
So about a year and a half ago I started

36
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,670
using this term, maybe
it was two years ago now,

37
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,010
of threat informed defense.

38
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,660
And it's not a new
idea, and maybe I wasn't

39
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,950
the first person to even
actually use this term.

40
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,090
But to me it was helpful,
you are all practitioners

41
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,510
of threat informed defense,
whether you call it that or not.

42
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,510
But I thought there was
some value in actually

43
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,548
putting a name to it, to actually help us

44
00:02:19,548 --> 00:02:23,570
as a discipline start to
understand and communicate

45
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,170
better with each other, and
also help people understand

46
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,440
the value and the extent
of what we're doing

47
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,800
because it really is a
different paradigm, right?

48
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,060
Gary in his remarks earlier
today did a nice job

49
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,360
of talking about the evolution
from sort of a vulnerability

50
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,610
centric model to the world we're in today,

51
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,930
at least in this room, and
there's a lot of people

52
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,430
who still need to catch
up and that's part of what

53
00:02:48,422 --> 00:02:49,859
my message is gonna be.

54
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,790
But you've seen that great
shift from vulnerability centric

55
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,130
and if you're fully
patched you're good to go

56
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,780
to an understanding
that that's not enough.

57
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,900
So threat informed defense
is that recognition

58
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,750
that just understanding
what your assets are,

59
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,980
just understanding that your
vulnerabilities are patched,

60
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,940
just understanding what
your configurations are

61
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,573
is critical, it's necessary,
but it's not sufficient.

62
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,630
One of the cautionary notes
when I go talk to groups

63
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,442
of people about ATT&CK and
threat informed defense,

64
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,840
I often try to be really, really clear.

65
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,660
And I'd ask each of you to
do this 'cause I see you all

66
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,140
as ambassadors of this
community, and that is

67
00:03:31,162 --> 00:03:33,160
ATT&CK and threat informed defense is not

68
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,990
some sort of Panacea, it's
not some magic pixie dust

69
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:41,030
you can sprinkle on an
otherwise insecure environment

70
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,960
and make it all the sudden better.

71
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,910
If your environment has
single factor domain

72
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,510
administrator passwords, you have a flat,

73
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,760
unsegmented network
architecture, you have any,

74
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,030
you don't understand what your assets are,

75
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:58,370
you don't need ATT&CK, you
need some basic cyber hygiene

76
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,930
and a lot of other things.

77
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,990
Once you're at that
level of sophistication,

78
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,780
once your tall enough to ride that ride,

79
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,740
then and only then are
you ready to actually

80
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,950
start to go to that next
level, to really start

81
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,989
to get inside the
adversaries decision loop

82
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,766
and figure out how to be
there waiting for them

83
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:18,720
before they get there.

84
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,690
So it's a critical message.

85
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,070
So when you're talking
to colleagues and friends

86
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,986
and coworkers and they
say, "Oh, I think I need

87
00:04:24,987 --> 00:04:26,680
"the ATT&CK thing," just make sure

88
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,870
that they're really ready.

89
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,670
Just make sure that they
really are tall enough

90
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,820
to ride the ride because
the last thing we wanna do

91
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,760
as a community is to
turn into a hype machine

92
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,030
and sort of a self-perpetuating
motion machine

93
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,130
where we just talk to each other

94
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,480
about how awesome ATT&CK is.

95
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,190
And I think it's awesome, but I think

96
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,800
we have to be really responsible.

97
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,090
So threat informed defense
is about taking the things

98
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,340
in ATT&CK and beyond
and using that knowledge

99
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,640
systematically, and that's
I think the key word

100
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,222
to understand and prioritize and define

101
00:04:58,222 --> 00:05:01,849
our defenses, one of
the interesting things

102
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,990
that if you ask me what are the primary,

103
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,450
what's the primary use case of ATT&CK,

104
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,372
you know, and we could talk
about coverage assessment,

105
00:05:11,372 --> 00:05:12,570
we could talk about adversary emulation,

106
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,390
we could actually number
one is communication.

107
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,640
I think ATT&CK fundamentally
is a communications tool.

108
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,849
It's a way of thinking
about and describing

109
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,360
and talking about what
adversaries are doing,

110
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,760
what you're doing in response
to those adversaries,

111
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,950
what a product can do,
what your red team did,

112
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:34,330
what your blue team found,
and it's such a simple idea,

113
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,159
but that's where the brilliance is, right?

114
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,660
It's a brilliantly simple
concept and I think,

115
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,280
you know, just the size of this community

116
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,570
and the acceleration of the
adoption of the ATT&CK framework

117
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,740
is testimony to the
brilliance of that simple idea

118
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,793
that we've created here
just a few years ago.

119
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,190
And so this is really the point.

120
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,633
The fact that I can color a square,

121
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,820
pick out a puzzle piece, and
I hope you all appreciated

122
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,219
the puzzle we had out there.

123
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:12,710
And have a unambiguous,
concrete, tangible conversation.

124
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,593
Again, simple idea, but really powerful.

125
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,270
So, in this world of
threat informed defense,

126
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,580
is coloring in those
squares to mean the things

127
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,599
that are meaningful to you
in whatever context it is.

128
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,240
And so that's the other
great thing about ATT&CK

129
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,720
is it can be used in so
many different context

130
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,290
and so many different ways.

131
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,960
And any time you have
a tool or an approach

132
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,719
that can be repurposed
and reused so many times,

133
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,740
all the sudden it becomes
worth the investment.

134
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,910
And I think that's the other
thing we're seeing here.

135
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:48,170
That ATT&CK has proven
to be a great investment

136
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,123
for individuals and for organizations.

137
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,491
So, is Shane Stiger here?

138
00:06:56,492 --> 00:07:01,492
So Shane did an amazing thing
some number of years ago.

139
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,650
He created a game, basically
modeled around ATT&CK.

140
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,810
And when I saw this game
board, so literal game

141
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,710
with like literal pieces and
I was so blown away by it

142
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,049
and that sort of inspired
me to start thinking about

143
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,180
ATT&CK as a game board, right.

144
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,200
And if I'm an adversary and
I'm looking at this game board,

145
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,510
and from my perspective as an adversary,

146
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:29,760
green means that I can land on that spot,

147
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,020
I can safely move from that
spot, I can do what I want

148
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,263
from that spot.

149
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,140
I wanna play this game, right?

150
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,200
I wanna play this game every day

151
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,940
because it's a low cost, low risk,

152
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,683
low uncertainty environment.

153
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,743
And the unfortunate reality is,

154
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,150
this is the game adversaries play.

155
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,549
I'm sure not in any of your
organizations, or here,

156
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:59,030
but in far too many places throughout

157
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,010
critical infrastructure
and our supply chains,

158
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:04,409
and certainly small and
medium size enterprises,

159
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,360
and even some larger enterprises,

160
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,483
this is the game board
that the adversary sees.

161
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,240
Don't you wanna play this
game if you're the adversary?

162
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,500
So, that's something
that must change, right?

163
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,219
If we wonder why we are
always playing catch up

164
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,460
as a community, I would argue

165
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,470
that that's one of the reasons.

166
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:32,900
Because the adversary
has so much room to move,

167
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,975
so much freedom.

168
00:08:34,975 --> 00:08:37,890
And they get to choose the time and place,

169
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,480
they get to move wherever they want.

170
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,750
So if we recognize that must change,

171
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,400
we should start thinking
about this as a game, right?

172
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,069
We all like to play games, games are fun.

173
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:48,943
It's not work.

174
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,260
So how do we start as a community,

175
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,500
and we're already doing this
today, but how do we really

176
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,540
provide focus to our
efforts to begin to change

177
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,599
the rules of this game, to
take those safe landing spots

178
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,840
off the game board for the adversary?

179
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,493
It's not something we're
gonna do overnight.

180
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,930
And if any of you think
you can do it overnight,

181
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,622
please come talk to me later.

182
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,230
But it's something that
we can and should do,

183
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,370
we must do, our imperative,
our call to action

184
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,430
is that we must begin
to remove these spots.

185
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,829
We have to do it every week.

186
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,510
We have to do it every month,

187
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,300
we have to do it every quarter,

188
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,310
we have to do it every year

189
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,122
and we have to continuously be working

190
00:09:36,122 --> 00:09:39,310
to get to the point where that's all red.

191
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,392
Now, are we ever gonna
get there, probably not.

192
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,819
But if you're an adversary,
do you wanna play this game?

193
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,439
Not nearly as much as that first one.

194
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,090
Can we go back to the first game?

195
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,920
'Cause this is, from an
adversary perspective,

196
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,390
a high cost, high risk,
high uncertainty environment

197
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,050
where most of the time the stuff you try

198
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,459
doesn't work, when it does
work, you're then beginning

199
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,830
to question, did this work because

200
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,890
my victim wanted it to work?

201
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,330
Am I in some sort of
deception environment?

202
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:18,680
You start to be able to
play with the adversary

203
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,920
and manage the adversary.

204
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,660
That's the world we need to be in,

205
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,050
that's the world I believe we can be in

206
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,170
if we continue the great
work that this community

207
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,280
has been doing, if we accelerate that work

208
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,930
and provide focus to that work.

209
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,739
So again, I wanna be clear,
we're not gonna get here

210
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,540
tomorrow, we're not
gonna get here next year.

211
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,449
But we can certainly all work to start

212
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,330
to move in this direction.

213
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:48,013
We must be as relentless as the adversary.

214
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,910
Adversaries, they don't
give up, they're advanced,

215
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,079
they're persistent, and
they represent a threat.

216
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,500
We have to be just as persistent.

217
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,263
We have to be advanced,
persistent defenders, I guess.

218
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,640
Guts, please don't turn
that into an acronym.

219
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,089
That's a meme.

220
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:13,370
But, as important as it is
for us to be relentless,

221
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,730
I think the more important
point is that we have to do this

222
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,910
together and again, the great news,

223
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,709
is that this is a testimony to the fact

224
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,740
that we are already doing
this as a community.

225
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,990
I just came back, as Katie mentioned,

226
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,820
I came back from Luxembourg
in the European ATT&CK

227
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,066
workshop last Friday, and
it was a really great,

228
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:39,390
sort of a similar idea,
group of community members,

229
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,260
all practitioners, talking
about how they're applying

230
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,069
ATT&CK in their environments.

231
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,310
How they're using it to actually improve

232
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:49,520
the state of their
defenses on a daily basis.

233
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,060
So we're already doing
this as a community,

234
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,719
we just need to do more
because the threat is real

235
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,293
and the adversaries aren't going away.

236
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,600
So, from my perspective,
we have an opportunity

237
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,400
to bring the best security
teams around the world,

238
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,620
and you folks I think are great examples

239
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,580
of those best security
teams from around the world.

240
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,360
Whether you're parts of
large financial institutions

241
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,400
or global manufacturers,
or health care concerns,

242
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,550
or IT security companies, or
professional services firms,

243
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,890
or ISACs and ISADs, whatever you are,

244
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:30,610
you represent sort of the
tippy top of the pyramid

245
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,010
of organizations and
individuals who have the skills

246
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:38,580
and the insights and the
resources and sophistication

247
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,480
to actually begin to make a difference.

248
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,930
And then it's no surprise or coincidence

249
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,410
that we're here at MITRE, which, you know,

250
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,699
for over 60 years has been
this trusted, objective,

251
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:54,000
independent, non for profit,
place where deep thoughts

252
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,510
are thunk and then good
things happen as a result.

253
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:01,860
And we believe that if we can bring these

254
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,710
best security teams from around the world

255
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,990
together with the kinds
of folks that you've been

256
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:09,250
hearing from from MITRE
over the last day and half,

257
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,180
that we can actually begin to execute

258
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,130
on research and
development that will begin

259
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,430
to deliver impact at scale
that's in the public interest.

260
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:23,250
So that's really what my
focus has been of late

261
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,890
is how do we take those community members

262
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,439
who have the ability and the resources

263
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,250
and the time and the
expertise and the commitment

264
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,700
to the public interest to
try to focus our efforts

265
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,303
so that we can deliver impact at scale.

266
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,609
So, threat informed defense,
where do we go from here?

267
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,340
What I can tell you today is stay tuned.

268
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,160
Some time in the next few
weeks you'll be hearing

269
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,050
some more announcements from us about

270
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,709
some of the really concrete
actions that we're taking

271
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,480
to move this community forward.

272
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,880
If you're interested in the meantime,

273
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,530
please come find me later on
or you can always reach me

274
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:03,543
via email, but I wanna leave
you just with this thought.

275
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,760
We can actually change
the game on the adversary.

276
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,330
We can actually, I can foresee a day,

277
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,700
maybe it's not tomorrow,
maybe it's not next year,

278
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,170
where we're actually
inside the adversaries

279
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:21,469
decision loop, where we're
actually beginning to win

280
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,800
the battles, if not the war.

281
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,490
So let's all keep doing what you're doing,

282
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,010
let's keep this community
going, and let's remember

283
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,000
to be as relentless as our adversaries.

284
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,200
Thank you.

285
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,450
(audience applauding)
