1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,472
- [Woman] Please join me
in welcoming John Wunder.

2
00:00:03,472 --> 00:00:06,455
(audience claps)

3
00:00:06,455 --> 00:00:08,038
- [John] Thank you.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,049
All right, thanks for
that introduction, Katie.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,810
I'm really excited to be talking
about ATT&CK Sightings here

6
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,510
at ATT&CK Con especially because,

7
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,740
it was, at ATT&CK Con last year,

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,470
where I actually had some of the first

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,919
conversations about Sightings

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,660
with some of you who are here today.

11
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,540
And a lot of that conversation inspired

12
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,500
what you're seeing up here.

13
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,430
We kinda took those notes.

14
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,180
And so when I talk about Sightings today,

15
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,547
just keep in mind that that's

16
00:00:31,547 --> 00:00:34,620
kinda as a result of you talking about it.

17
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,720
I think it also addresses

18
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,150
a lot of the things that we heard today.

19
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,740
A lot of the needs that we heard today.

20
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,880
The need to be able to
prioritize defenses,

21
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,770
and the need to be able

22
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,500
to really make our threat
intelligence actionable.

23
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,640
And so out of all that we
kinda collected together that

24
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,770
this idea for ATT&CK Sightings.

25
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,440
But before I talk about Sightings,

26
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,239
I really wanna talk about
threat intelligence reports.

27
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,130
Threat intelligence reports are great.

28
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,580
They can tell you about new
and interesting techniques.

29
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,250
They can tell you about tools.

30
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,950
They can tell you about what different

31
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,430
threat actors are up to.

32
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,040
Threat intelligence
reports are really great at

33
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,960
writing up, you know, kinda
finalized, really detailed

34
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,660
information about what actors are doing.

35
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,130
And what tools they're doing.

36
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,179
And what new techniques are out there.

37
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,820
That's said, threat intelligence reports

38
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,690
maybe are not that best way to answer

39
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,620
every single question we have, right?

40
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,910
Threat intelligence reports are one form

41
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:22,890
of threat intelligence.

42
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,870
But there's other forms of
threat intelligence as well.

43
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,680
So, threat intelligence
reports are for example,

44
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,520
they take a long time to write.

45
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,350
You have to have an analyst write them,

46
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,660
you have to have them
usually go through legal,

47
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,570
or marketing teams.

48
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,440
You have them go through
publications and be produced.

49
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,120
And then they have to get out
there and people to read them.

50
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,080
So we see a number of

51
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,410
threat intelligence reports, obviously.

52
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,460
There's a lot of them.

53
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,910
But scale-wise, there's not
as many threat intelligence

54
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,759
reports as there are incidents out there.

55
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,610
Or as there are events out there.

56
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,450
And so just this scale and scope of things

57
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,970
that are covered by finished
intelligence reporting,

58
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,830
is not as broad as what we see out there.

59
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,770
And second, threat intelligence reports

60
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,140
are really focused on
that in depth analysis

61
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,680
of things that are new and novel, right?

62
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,370
We're not going to be
writing intelligence reports

63
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,210
about, you know, the ways that adversary A

64
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,690
used PowerShell for the zillionth time.

65
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,550
And what that means is that

66
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,720
threat intelligence reports are great.

67
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,117
They help us inform ATT&CK.

68
00:02:14,117 --> 00:02:15,329
ATT&CK wouldn't be what it is

69
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,280
without threat intelligence reports.

70
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,750
But, there is also a need for other

71
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,150
types of threat intelligence.

72
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,160
And that's where sightings come in.

73
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,359
As we think about how to answer
these types of questions,

74
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,177
that's where we see these more

75
00:02:26,177 --> 00:02:27,530
"sightings type per use case".

76
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,000
And I'll talk about what
that means in a minute.

77
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,310
But just think about
how you were to answer

78
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,330
these types of questions today.

79
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,000
Which techniques are more-or-less common.

80
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,550
That can be tough to answer
threat intelligence reporting,

81
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,770
because are your threat
intelligence reports

82
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,640
talking about this technique because

83
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,829
it happens more often,

84
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,820
or because it's more novel
and more interesting,

85
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,863
and more unique?

86
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,140
Second, how do techniques tend to be used

87
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,269
together or in conjuntion with each other?

88
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,880
This is something that
having a great set of

89
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,440
raw data would really help us answer.

90
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,930
How do we actually see things

91
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,270
when they happen on a box?

92
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,290
Third, how has usage changed over time?

93
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,870
Threat intelligence reports are often

94
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,130
you know, encompassed data
from many, many years,

95
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,329
or many, many months.

96
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,650
And so it's hard to tell sometimes,

97
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,850
at more of an atomic level,

98
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,650
what does it look like
this year versus last year,

99
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,746
versus the year before.

100
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:16,270
That needs a more atomic
type of information as well.

101
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,470
And lastly, how does
prevalence differ by sector

102
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,359
or things like geographic area?

103
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,390
How do we more see, look
at kinda an in depth level

104
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,299
of exactly what we're seeing here?

105
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,720
Again, threat intelligence
reports talk about this,

106
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,120
they talk about geographic
area and sector a lot.

107
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,820
But just the breadth and depth of that,

108
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,590
the breadth of that reporting
is not as big as it could be,

109
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,380
if you look at the scope
of incidents and events

110
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,040
that happen out in the world.

111
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,530
So this is where we see
ATT&CK Sightings fitting in.

112
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,960
I've used that word a bunch of times now,

113
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,340
what do I actually mean by that?

114
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,740
So when I think about ATT&CK Sightings,

115
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,270
I think about observations
that provide evidence

116
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,520
that an ATT&CK technique is in use.

117
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,930
Wouldn't that be great to know,

118
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,870
to have evidence when an
ATT&CK technique is in use

119
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,810
without having to go read all
of these threat intelligence

120
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,973
reports necessarily?

121
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,970
We can think of couple different

122
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,060
types of threat intelligence
reports as well.

123
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,330
Or sorry, as sightings as well.

124
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,740
So, direct technique sightings,

125
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,550
so if you think about the different ways

126
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,710
you might have evidence of
a ATT&CK technique in use,

127
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,810
one way is you're looking at your logs

128
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,700
and you're digging in there

129
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,289
and you're seeing actions happen on your

130
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,790
systems and networks
that directly correspond

131
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,210
to an ATT&CK technique.

132
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,450
So for example, if I'm
looking at credential dumping

133
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,940
and I see for example, a
memory read of LSASS.exe.

134
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,540
That is direct evidence
credential dumping as occurred

135
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,610
on that machine. That's
really great evidence

136
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,510
that, that technique happened.

137
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,300
But there's other types of
evidence as well, right?

138
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,720
We might not have something
quite that conclusive.

139
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,430
For example, Mimikatz is
a tool that is capable

140
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,130
of doing credential dumping.

141
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,409
What if Mimikatz is blocked
blocked at the firewall?

142
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,120
We blocked it by download
because we have a known

143
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,840
hash for it or something like that.

144
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,880
That's not quite as good as the evidence,

145
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,900
as seeing the actual memory dump,

146
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,060
but it's a pretty good indication that our

147
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,320
adversaries are trying
to do credential dumping;

148
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,690
if you see Mimikatz being
blocked at your firewall.

149
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,100
So direct software settings
are kind of this idea that

150
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,710
we've seen a piece of software that

151
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,979
enables us to do a technique.

152
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,950
Indirect software sightings
are really getting at this

153
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,130
concept of tips and threat
intelligence reporting

154
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,830
that goes through kinda more automated

155
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,609
STIX/TAXII mechanisms.

156
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,160
So maybe I see an indicator
shared from Mimikatz.exe.

157
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,540
I didn't see it myself, I
don't know that it actually,

158
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,300
whether it was a successful attack

159
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,450
or whether it was not successful.

160
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,250
I don't know exactly where it happened.

161
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,170
But the fact that
somebody is sharing a hash

162
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,430
from Mimikatz tells me
that is probably in use,

163
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,380
and therefore, that the adversaries are

164
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,290
looking to do credential dumping.

165
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,070
So hopefully you can
see that while these are

166
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,340
different levels of evidence,

167
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,969
some of them are really
great direct evidence

168
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,330
of a technique occurring.

169
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,219
Others are more indirect evidence.

170
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,770
It's still evidence that
a technique is in use

171
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,840
in the real world.

172
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,320
And that's really what we wanna get at

173
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,250
with ATT&CK Sightings.

174
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,440
We at the ATT&CK team feel
like something that would

175
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,250
be really useful is more direct evidence

176
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,840
of ATT&CK techniques in
use in the real world.

177
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,729
And that's what is idea is about.

178
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,947
So, in order to help enable that,

179
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:05,200
and in order to make that happen,

180
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,219
we've kinda proposed this
idea of ATT&CK Sightings.

181
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,610
And I've talked to some of you about this,

182
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,490
and I'm happy to talk to
more of you about it today

183
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,360
if you come find me after.

184
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,210
But what we're proposing now is

185
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,049
MITRE collects sightings
from multiple organizations.

186
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,990
So we take in some of these sightings.

187
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,120
When you think about a sighting,

188
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,630
so I talked about those three types,

189
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,930
think about that type of sighting,

190
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,240
technique ID, maybe tactic
ID, time stamp maybe,

191
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,400
and maybe some other metadata.

192
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,739
And so that's what really
what we're talking about

193
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,140
when we talk about a sighting.

194
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,440
What is MITRE collected a bunch of those,

195
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,961
they were anonymized at some level,

196
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:38,260
either before or after they get to MITRE.

197
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,630
And then we can kind of aggregate them,

198
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,270
and make intelligent kind
of decisions and reports

199
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,229
based off of those things.

200
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,770
We could public insights,

201
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,669
and ideally, if we get
a good amount of data,

202
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,040
and we feel like it makes sense,

203
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,870
we could also publish data sets that help

204
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,100
researchers like yourselves,
figure out insights

205
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,510
that we at MITRE maybe
couldn't ever figure out.

206
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,230
So the idea here is to kind
of collect this sighting,

207
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,610
create this sighting's ecosystem.

208
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,270
Where we're constantly
collecting telemetry about

209
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,030
what ATT&CK techniques
are in usage in the wild.

210
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,750
And republishing that back out,

211
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,520
both in terms of insights,

212
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,462
as well as more in terms of raw data.

213
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,700
You can imagine it looking like this.

214
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,219
So along the left side you can see the

215
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,910
systems that are under attack basically.

216
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,560
So all of our individual laptops,

217
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,860
all of our servers, all
of our infrastructure.

218
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,010
And we're doing security
monitoring on those things.

219
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,210
And that security monitoring is hopefully

220
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,859
when we have an attack,
going to lead to detections.

221
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,860
At some level, those detections
will create reporting.

222
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,990
Right, so we can do reporting
of those detections.

223
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,680
That might happen for your ISACs or ISAOs.

224
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,430
Maybe you have an MSSP or a
security vendor or something,

225
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,840
that you're working with.

226
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,090
And that point right there,
I really wanna highlight

227
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,630
because if you're
working with those ISAOs,

228
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,680
your MSSPs, that's a great
way to anonymized the data

229
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,180
before it gets to MITRE.

230
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,480
One thing MITRE doesn't
necessarily want to do is

231
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,150
be responsible for collecting
a lot really sensitive data

232
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:57,219
about where techniques
are seen in the wild

233
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,180
at specific organizations.

234
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,224
We're happy to work with
you if you are one of those,

235
00:08:01,224 --> 00:08:03,420
a user organizations,

236
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,930
and you do wanna contribute what you find.

237
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,970
But we think it makes
a lot of sense really,

238
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,357
to look at the ISACs and the ISAOs.

239
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:10,440
And the people that are
collecting data from multiple

240
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,340
organizations at the same time.

241
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,419
So that they can do the
anonymization for us.

242
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,650
We'll continue to look at
it in an anonymized way,

243
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,000
we'll try to aggravate it.

244
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,690
We had some people that
are privacy experts

245
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,530
and can also look at how

246
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,510
to keep it from being de-anonymized.

247
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,830
And then the idea is that we
can publish those insights.

248
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,070
So, that's kinda the operating model

249
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,420
that we're hoping for here.

250
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,800
In this we have three
communities of interest

251
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,959
that we really wanna
help enable and protect.

252
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,670
So one is contributors.
They're probably the most

253
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,209
important part of this eco system.

254
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,043
They are the people that are

255
00:08:39,043 --> 00:08:40,929
providing information of value.

256
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:42,909
MITRE is not providing
information of value here.

257
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:43,939
So the contributors are really

258
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,590
the most important part of this community,

259
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,010
so we wanna make sure that

260
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,360
A. they're able to
really easily contribute.

261
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,910
B. They're protected from
disclosing too much information.

262
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,209
And C. That they're acknowledged for

263
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,370
providing something of value.

264
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,260
We wanna give people credit when they give

265
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,530
information that helps the community,

266
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,750
even if we do anonymize it.

267
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,940
Second, we wanna be
able to help defenders.

268
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,780
So that's most of us here are defenders,

269
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,270
whether we're threat intel analysts,

270
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,270
or whether we're operators,

271
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,930
or whether we're hunters.

272
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,599
We want to help us, we
want to be able to help

273
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,340
defenders kind of prioritize actions,

274
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,980
prioritize what threat
intelligence they do look at,

275
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,100
to see more information.

276
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,920
We wanna help them
understand and communicate

277
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,400
the value of their work.

278
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,730
It's really easy to communicate value here

279
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,560
if you can say, well I
now have a detection for

280
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,949
this thing that happened 10
thousand times last year,

281
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,510
or x number of times last year.

282
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,730
Moreso then here's this thing

283
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,760
that I saw in a couple reports.

284
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,770
And lastly, we wanna help
them change based on,

285
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,610
change their defenses
based on what we're seeing

286
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,363
changed in the adversary behavior.

287
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,100
Lastly, we wanna help researchers.

288
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,520
So there's a lot of great research

289
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,420
that's happening in
the cyber defense base,

290
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,900
and a lot of that
research needs good data.

291
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,069
And I think by publishing some

292
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,050
of these data sets out,

293
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,199
we can enable that research by

294
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,670
anonymizing and then making sure that

295
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,060
that the contributors are safe,

296
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,910
but also giving researches what they need

297
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,420
to do their jobs.

298
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,630
You know, helping them develop
new defensive approaches,

299
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,360
understand how adversary
usage may differ by sector.

300
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,800
I think we all kind of
internally think that,

301
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,709
and know that probably a finance sector

302
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,480
is attacked differently than
defense industrial base.

303
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,090
But it would be great to have
data that kind of proves that.

304
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:15,080
So we're not just relying
on our own intuition.

305
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,660
And lastly, to do things
that I can't even think of,

306
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,510
I needed three bullets
on each of these columns,

307
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,730
so I need some researchers to

308
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,001
come up with a third item here.

309
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:25,209
(audience laughs)

310
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,250
So, how can you contribute?

311
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,860
We wanted to make it as easy as possible.

312
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,850
First is email us at attack@mitre.org,

313
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,070
or find me after the break,

314
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,260
or find any MITRE team member.

315
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,490
We're happy to hook you up.

316
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,650
We wanna make this as easy
as possible to contribute.

317
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,920
You'll need to generate some data.

318
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,000
We have a data format that we define,

319
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,120
it's kind of a pretty
straight forward JSON format.

320
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,370
You can create that yourself.

321
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,350
MISP was great enough.

322
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,650
If you tell the MISP developers,

323
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,810
you tell them an idea and they have it

324
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,699
developed within the next day or two.

325
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,640
And that was the case here.

326
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,699
We talked to them about sightings,

327
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,800
as as of now you can MISP
to export sightings out,

328
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,810
and then contribute that back to MITRE.

329
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,119
Or if you have something
else you're using,

330
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,128
if you're using STIX, or
if you're using CSV files,

331
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:05,390
send us whatever you
have and we'll take it.

332
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,569
We're basically willing
to, we care about the data.

333
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,300
We don't care necessarily what format

334
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,500
you give us the data in.

335
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,740
And then send it to us.

336
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,430
I did want to call out
some related work here,

337
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,040
first of all, Red Canary released

338
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,170
a threat detection report last year.

339
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,680
And if Twitter can be

340
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,010
trusted. I guess they're
releasing another one soon.

341
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,800
That talked about the top 10 techniques

342
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,650
that they found in the wild.

343
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,910
And they also gave great tips

344
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,550
on how to find those
techniques when you see them.

345
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,890
Second, Carl mentioned

346
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,010
the CrowdStrike OverWatch
reporting before.

347
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,380
They've released two reports
with two different formats.

348
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,270
One thing I thought they really did

349
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,280
that made a lot of sense
in their second report,

350
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,150
the mid-year report that
they just released recently,

351
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,880
was they talked about changes

352
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,080
from the 2018 report to
the 2019 mid-year report.

353
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,940
And also, where you maybe should not

354
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,620
take some of those changes as seriously

355
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,500
because there might be issues

356
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,230
in some of the data they thought.

357
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,730
We're pretty thoughtful about
what changes actually mean.

358
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,730
And maybe some of the changes

359
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,480
aren't as significant as they seem.

360
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,449
And lastly, VERIS. So VERIS does a lot of

361
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,820
like incident metadata type of work.

362
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,780
The demographics of incidents we think

363
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,350
this is complementary to that.

364
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,700
So current statuses we're
collecting sightings under NDA.

365
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,900
You don't necessarily have to

366
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,579
sign an NDA to contribute sightings.

367
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,270
We find that many organizations want to

368
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,939
just to help themselves.

369
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,890
With the goal of having more
contributions over this year,

370
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:26,180
and eventually move towards
having those insights

371
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,530
being able to be published.

372
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,030
All right, that's what I got, thank you.

373
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,839
Here's a URL you can go to get involved,

374
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,720
emails us, come find me after.

375
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,320
And I'm happy to take questions.

376
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:37,960
- [Woman] So what we might do is

377
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,160
we're right on time actually.

378
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,689
You finished right on the
dot, thank you for that, John.

379
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,570
So John will be hanging
out at the reception,

380
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,040
and will leave tonight as well.

381
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,490
And tomorrow, so please come talk to him.

382
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,610
We want your data

383
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,900
and will anonymize it, So.
(audience laughs)

384
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,483
Thank you so much, John.

385
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:55,815
(applause)
