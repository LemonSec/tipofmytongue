>> [ APPLAUSE ]

180
00:40:37,807 --> 00:40:42,399
>> THANK YOU, KATIE, FOR THAT 
INTRODUCTION AND THANK YOU TO 

181
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:46,569
THE MITRE TEAM FOR INVITING ME 
HERE TODAY.  I DIDN'T REALIZE 

182
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,907
HOW BIG THE MITRE TEAM HAD GROWN
WHEN WE WERE DOING 

183
00:40:50,098 --> 00:40:54,154
INTRODUCTIONS. IT IS REALLY A 
TESTAMENT TO THE WORK THE ATTACK

184
00:40:54,695 --> 00:40:57,747
TEAM HAS DONE AND HOW CENTRAL IT
HAS BECOME TO THIS COMMUNITY 

185
00:40:57,933 --> 00:40:59,933
OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS.

186
00:41:03,147 --> 00:41:05,147
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF

187
00:41:08,308 --> 00:41:10,411
, I STARTED AS AN ALL SOURCE 
INTELLIGENCE ANALYST WORKING AT 

188
00:41:10,616 --> 00:41:12,847
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE FROM A
16 YEARS. I LEFT GOVERNMENT 

189
00:41:13,055 --> 00:41:18,051
SERVICE WHERE I WAS THE DIRECTOR
OF RESEARCH NOT ONLY DID I GET 

190
00:41:18,237 --> 00:41:21,932
TO WORK WITH SOME AMAZING 
RESEARCHERS, A BIG PART OF MY 

191
00:41:22,121 --> 00:41:24,247
JOB THERE WAS WORKING WITH 
THREAT INTELLIGENCE TEAMS ACROSS

192
00:41:24,446 --> 00:41:30,692
INDUSTRY. IT IS PRETTY MUCH A 
QUICK PLUG, IF YOU ARE 

193
00:41:30,884 --> 00:41:33,153
INTERESTED IN TEACHING THERE IS 
A HUGE DEMAND FOR ADJUNCT 

194
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,390
FACULTY MEMBERS WHO HAVE 
PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE IN THIS 

195
00:41:37,588 --> 00:41:42,171
SPACE. IT'S AN AGGRESSIVE SIDE 
HUSTLE ON TOP OF YOUR DAY JOB. I

196
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,676
WILL WARN YOU THAT. IT IS A 
REALLY COMPELLING WAY TO GET 

197
00:41:45,871 --> 00:41:48,598
BACK TO THE COMMUNITY AND IT 
REALLY HELPS YOU LEVEL UP. YOU 

198
00:41:48,786 --> 00:41:53,165
THINK A LOT ABOUT HOW AND WHY WE
DO THE WORK THAT WE DO WHEN YOU 

199
00:41:53,351 --> 00:41:59,244
TEACH IT TO OTHERS. AND THEN 
THIS SUMMER I PICKED UP SOME IDC

200
00:41:59,446 --> 00:42:01,694
ROOTS AND MOVED ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY TO CALIFORNIA TO JOIN 

201
00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:04,882
THE GOOGLE THREAT ANALYSIS 
GROUP, WHICH IS GOOGLE IN HOUSE 

202
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:09,464
THREAT INTELLIGENCE TEAM. VERY 
IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER, THIS TALK 

203
00:42:09,664 --> 00:42:12,880
EVER SINCE MY PERSONAL VIEWS AND
NOT THE VIEWS OF GOOGLE OR 

204
00:42:13,088 --> 00:42:15,874
ALPHABET. KEEP THAT IN MIND AS 
WE PROGRESS THROUGH ALL THESE 

205
00:42:16,558 --> 00:42:22,638
MEETINGS. ALL RIGHT. OVER THE 
NEXT TWO DAYS WE ARE GOING TO 

206
00:42:22,843 --> 00:42:25,356
SEE A WHOLE SERIES OF TALKS FROM
PRACTITIONERS THAT ARE ACTUALLY 

207
00:42:25,548 --> 00:42:29,595
USING ATT&CK TO IMPROVE 
SECURITY. AND THINKING ABOUT  

208
00:42:29,597 --> 00:42:34,465
GRADING THIS TALK AND I REALIZED
THAT WE ARE GOING TO GET REALLY 

209
00:42:34,661 --> 00:42:39,137
DETAILED VIEW, LOTS OF HANDS ON 
EXPERIENCE AND BEST PRACTICES 

210
00:42:39,353 --> 00:42:42,592
OVER THESE NEXT FEW DAYS. WHAT I
WANTED TO DO WAS START THE 

211
00:42:42,774 --> 00:42:46,027
CONFERENCE BY TAKING A STEP 
BACK. AND THINKING A LITTLE BIT 

212
00:42:46,232 --> 00:42:49,731
MORE ABOUT WHY WE ARE HERE FOR 
THE PROBLEMS THAT IT ATT&CK  

213
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:55,166
ENABLE TEAMS TO SOLVE AND SOME 
OF THE CHALLENGES I HAVE SEEN 

214
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:58,620
FROM TEAMS WORKING TO IMPLEMENT 
ATT&CK IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT.  

215
00:42:59,094 --> 00:43:01,094
WHAT BRINGS US TOGETHER TODAY?

216
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:08,114
MATRICES ARE WHAT BRINGS US 
TOGETHER TODAY. A QUICK SHOW OF 

217
00:43:08,304 --> 00:43:13,303
HANDS, HOW HAVE YOU HERE IN THE 
AUDIENCE OUR WORK, WORK IN 

218
00:43:13,494 --> 00:43:19,443
THREAT INTELLIGENCE? HOW MANY OF
YOU WORK IN OPPS? THAT'S A 

219
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,256
PRETTY GOOD SPLIT. FOR THOSE OF 
YOU WATCHING AT HOME, THE 

220
00:43:22,452 --> 00:43:25,336
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT KATIE 
HAS TOLD ME ARE TUNING IN, 

221
00:43:25,679 --> 00:43:28,058
THAT'S ABOUT A 50-50 SPLIT HERE 
IN THE AUDIENCE, WHICH IN AND OF

222
00:43:28,252 --> 00:43:30,837
ITSELF, I THINK, IS A REALLY 
COMPELLING REASON FOR WHY 

223
00:43:31,027 --> 00:43:40,027
TEMPERATURE ATT&CK HAS BEEN SO 
SUCCESSFUL.  THERE WE GO. THIS 

224
00:43:40,227 --> 00:43:42,667
LEADS TO A LOT OF QUESTIONS. I 
HAVE WORKED IN INTEL MY ENTIRE 

225
00:43:42,883 --> 00:43:44,883
CAREER PICK I'VE ALWAYS SEEN 
THIS A STRUGGLE TO MAKE INTEL 

226
00:43:45,033 --> 00:43:47,250
AND OPPS MORE EFFECTIVE 
TOGETHER. THAT LEADS TO A LOT OF

227
00:43:47,455 --> 00:43:50,758
QUESTIONS LIKE WHY DO I NEED 
INTEL. HOW TO MAKE THIS WORK? 

228
00:43:50,969 --> 00:43:55,999
HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH. I WANT TO 
MAKE AN INTEL DRIVEN DEFENSE. 

229
00:43:56,191 --> 00:43:59,888
HOW DO I ACTUALLY DO THAT? THIS 
IS MY ANSWER TO THE Y TO THREAT 

230
00:44:00,088 --> 00:44:03,164
INTELLIGENCE. THE PURPOSE OF 
INTELLIGENCE IS TO DRIVE A 

231
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:07,556
DECISION. I THOUGHT ABOUT 
PUTTING OUT DEFINITIONS HEAR 

232
00:44:07,762 --> 00:44:15,498
FROM FORSTER OR THE JOINT CLUB 
FOR TO BE HONEST, I GET LOST IN 

233
00:44:15,702 --> 00:44:17,933
ALL THE CLAUSES WHEN I LOOK AT 
THOSE LONGER DEFINITIONS OF WHAT

234
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:21,899
INTEL IS. FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS
A BAIT AND SWITCH TO PRINCESS 

235
00:44:22,372 --> 00:44:25,933
BRIDE ME TO DOCTRINE. YOU'RE 
WELCOME. LET'S ATTACK THAT A 

236
00:44:26,128 --> 00:44:30,616
LITTLE BIT. WHAT DOES DECISION 
ADVANTAGE ACTUALLY NEED? THIS IS

237
00:44:30,811 --> 00:44:33,625
FROM EB USE CYBER SECURITY 
AGENCY THERE'S A LOT GOING ON 

238
00:44:33,824 --> 00:44:37,806
HERE. I LIKE IT BECAUSE I THINK 
IT HELPS US MAP OUT WHAT 

239
00:44:38,153 --> 00:44:41,904
DECISION ADVANTAGE MIGHT LOOK 
LIKE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS. A 

240
00:44:42,105 --> 00:44:47,722
COUPLE OF THINGS COME TO MIND 
HERE. FIRST, IT'S POSSIBLE AS A 

241
00:44:47,915 --> 00:44:51,488
THREAT INTEL TEAM YOU SERVE THIS
WHOLE RANGE OF CUSTOMERS. THREAT

242
00:44:52,054 --> 00:44:54,629
INTELLIGENCE RADIATING OUT FROM 
THE CENTER OF THE COMPANY TO ALL

243
00:44:54,819 --> 00:44:58,250
OF THESE WONDERFUL PLACES. 
WHAT'S MUCH MORE LIKELY AS A 

244
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,781
TEAM IS THAT THIS IS MORE OF A 
CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE WHERE 

245
00:45:01,986 --> 00:45:06,386
YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF THESE 
DIFFERENT PATHWAYS THAT ARE THE 

246
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:09,285
DEFINITIONS OF WHO YOU ARE 
SUPPORTING AND WHAT DEFINES YOUR

247
00:45:09,505 --> 00:45:11,505
DELIVERABLES.

248
00:45:13,307 --> 00:45:15,111
IT'S A PROCESS OVER TIME TO 
ESTABLISH NEW PATHWAYS 

249
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:17,250
THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION AS 
YOUR INTEL TEAM GROWS AND 

250
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:22,337
MATURES. THE SECOND POINT I 
WOULD LIKE TO DRY OUT IS THAT 

251
00:45:22,577 --> 00:45:26,747
DECISION ADVANTAGE CAN COME IN A
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WAYS. OUR 

252
00:45:26,948 --> 00:45:29,058
DECISIONS CAN BE MADE BY PEOPLE 
AND/OR BY SYSTEM. IT'S REALLY 

253
00:45:29,697 --> 00:45:32,528
IMPORTANT FOR US AS 
PRACTITIONERS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

254
00:45:32,725 --> 00:45:36,792
THE REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR BOTH. 
MY TIME IN THE DEPARTMENT OF 

255
00:45:36,987 --> 00:45:44,298
DEFENSE I WAS AND INTELLIGENCE L
ANALYST PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON 

256
00:45:44,504 --> 00:45:48,663
AFGHANISTAN AND WORKING IN THE 
PENTAGON. MY WORLD WAS THE TOP 

257
00:45:48,868 --> 00:45:52,219
LEFT CORNER OF THE SLIDE LABELED
STRATEGIC. MY DECISION-MAKERS 

258
00:45:52,557 --> 00:45:54,872
WERE PEOPLE. THEY NEEDED 
INTELLIGENCE THAT HAD TO BE 

259
00:45:55,334 --> 00:46:00,835
DELIVERED IN WRITING OR ON THE 
SPOT IN PERSON. THE WAY THAT YOU

260
00:46:01,023 --> 00:46:05,809
WORK AS A TEAM, WHEN THOSE ARE 
THE TYPES OF DECISIONS MAKERS 

261
00:46:06,272 --> 00:46:08,272
YOU HAVE TO DO SUPPORT AND 
THAT'S THE DELIVERABLE THEY NEED

262
00:46:08,462 --> 00:46:12,209
IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM A 
DIFFERENT TYPE OF PROBLEM. WHEN 

263
00:46:12,413 --> 00:46:14,468
I CAME TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND
STARTED WORKING WITH INNER 

264
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,670
SUPPORT THE PRICE ATOR

265
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,388
SECURITY TEAMS WAS VERY 
DIFFERENT. YOUR ENABLING SYSTEMS

266
00:46:20,389 --> 00:46:23,219
TO BE MORE ACTIONABLE WITH A KEY
DELIVERABLE WHICH MAKES A LOT OF

267
00:46:23,424 --> 00:46:25,659
SENSE. HOWEVER, ONE OF THE 
THINGS I REALLY STRUGGLED WITH, 

268
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:28,108
ESPECIALLY ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO 
WHEN I MADE THIS TRANSITION WAS 

269
00:46:28,308 --> 00:46:32,292
THAT OVERWHELMINGLY THIS WAS 
IMPLEMENT DID AS INDICATORS OF 

270
00:46:32,492 --> 00:46:37,893
COMPROMISE BEING PUMPED INTO A 
DEVICE. I WILL BE HONEST, I 

271
00:46:38,097 --> 00:46:45,340
DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND IT. SO,
I FOUND THAT TO BE VERY 

272
00:46:45,812 --> 00:46:48,915
TACTICAL. THAT INFORMATION IS 
VERY PERISHABLE. IT EVEN HAS A 

273
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:52,819
VERY SHORT SHELF LIFE BUT IT'S 
SUCH A HIGH VOLUME THAT A SMALL 

274
00:46:53,096 --> 00:46:56,711
TEAM COULD SPEND THEIR ENTIRE 
TIME AND EFFORT MANAGING AND 

275
00:46:56,907 --> 00:47:04,323
CURATING THESE SCREENS OF DATA 
WITH RELATIVELY LITTLE DECISION 

276
00:47:04,513 --> 00:47:06,711
ADVANTAGE BUT ONE OF THE THINGS 
I REALLY LIKE ABOUT MITRE ATT&CK

277
00:47:06,904 --> 00:47:10,165
CON  IS THAT ALLOWS US TO BETTER
SUPPORT THOSE TYPES OF DECISIONS

278
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,899
MADE BY PEOPLE AND MADE BY 
SYSTEMS AND THAT REALLY HELPS 

279
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:17,197
PULL US UP FROM AN OVERLY 
TACTICAL VIEW OF WHAT 

280
00:47:17,406 --> 00:47:25,181
INTELLIGENCE IS. THAT IS A PLUS.
THE SIDE THE LEARNS THE FASTEST 

281
00:47:25,654 --> 00:47:30,183
WINS. A QUICK SHOW OF HANDS, HOW
HAVE YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH, 

282
00:47:30,388 --> 00:47:34,823
ALMOST EVERYBODY. I'M SO 
EXCITED. BUDDHA LOOP, THIS IS A 

283
00:47:35,479 --> 00:47:39,212
THEORY DEVELOPED BY JOHN BOYD 
WHO IS AN AIR FORCE OFFICER IN 

284
00:47:39,407 --> 00:47:43,340
THE 1970S THINKING ABOUT AERIAL 
COMBAT WHAT HIS THEORY IS IS 

285
00:47:43,933 --> 00:47:47,542
THAT DECISION-MAKING HAPPENS IN 
THE ITERATIVE LOOP WHERE YOU 

286
00:47:47,743 --> 00:47:55,182
OBSERVE, ORIENT, DECIDE, AND ACT
. BASICALLY, BOTH YOU AND YOUR 

287
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:57,981
ADVERSARY HAVE THESE LOOPS BUT 
THE ONE WHO LEARNS THE FASTEST 

288
00:47:58,187 --> 00:48:02,558
AND CLOSES THE LOOP THE FASTEST 
HAS THE ADVANTAGE AND IS MORE 

289
00:48:02,761 --> 00:48:05,008
LIKELY TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THINK 
ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE. 

290
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:08,602
THE FIRST LETTER OF, OBSERVE, IS
COLLECTING THE INFORMATION 

291
00:48:08,793 --> 00:48:10,793
AROUND YOU AND GETTING YOUR 
BEARINGS.

292
00:48:15,342 --> 00:48:17,610
THE O FOR ORIENT, THIS IS 
SOMETHING THAT TOOK ME A WHILE 

293
00:48:17,816 --> 00:48:20,980
AND I HAD TO THINK ABOUT A 
LITTLE BIT MORE. THIS IS HOW YOU

294
00:48:21,229 --> 00:48:23,364
ANALYZE AND PROCESS THAT 
INFORMATION FOR DRAWING ON YOUR 

295
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,181
PAST EXPERIENCES, VALUES, 
CULTURAL BIASES, THINGS LIKE 

296
00:48:25,182 --> 00:48:29,750
THAT. HE IS TAKING ABOUT AN 
INDIVIDUAL FIGHTER PILOT IN A 

297
00:48:29,959 --> 00:48:34,819
DOGFIGHT. IF WE ZOOM OUT A 
LITTLE BIT WE CAN SEE HOW THIS 

298
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:40,765
WILL ALSO APPLY TO ORGANIZATIONS
. HOW MANY OF US HAVE BEEN IN A 

299
00:48:40,955 --> 00:48:43,203
PLACE WHERE WE HAVE TAKEN THE 
SAME EXTERNAL SET OF DATA AND 

300
00:48:43,394 --> 00:48:47,211
SEEN TWO TEAMS RUN WITH IT IN 
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS?

301
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:49,681
THE WAY THEY INTERPRET AND 
ORIENT IS VERY MUCH SHAPED BY 

302
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:53,239
THE THERE ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE
, AND THE WAY THAT THEY ORIENT 

303
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,919
IS GOING TO HAVE A HUGE IMPACT 
ON HOW THEY DECIDE AND HOW THEY 

304
00:48:57,136 --> 00:48:59,136
ACT.

305
00:49:02,823 --> 00:49:10,225
. THINKING. THINKING. THERE YOU 
GO. OKAY. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT 

306
00:49:10,417 --> 00:49:15,119
HOW TO THINK ABOUT THE LOOPS TO 
MEASURE THE DECISION ADVANTAGE 

307
00:49:15,318 --> 00:49:18,307
BUT HOW DO WE KNOW IF IT'S 
WORKING? THIS IS THE PERFECT 

308
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:23,102
PURPOSE OF WHY WE HAVE 
INTELLIGENCE , MAKES US BETTER, 

309
00:49:23,289 --> 00:49:25,709
TO A FASTER, HOW DO WE KNOW IT'S
WORKING? WHAT METRICS DO YOU 

310
00:49:25,903 --> 00:49:30,149
STILL THINK ABOUT THIS? I HAVE A
FEW CATEGORIES OF METRICS HERE. 

311
00:49:30,347 --> 00:49:32,752
FULL DISCLOSURE IS AN AREA I 
HAVE DONE IT FULL AMOUNT OF WORK

312
00:49:32,947 --> 00:49:37,798
ON. THIS MORE PRESENTATIONS ON 
THIS UNDER THE COVERS BUT 

313
00:49:37,994 --> 00:49:39,987
BASICALLY, THOSE METRICS FALL 
INTO TWO CATEGORIES OF THINGS 

314
00:49:39,988 --> 00:49:41,988
MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE, WHICH 
IS WHAT MOST OF US THINK ABOUT 

315
00:49:42,158 --> 00:49:44,718
WHEN WE THINK OF METRICS BUT 
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT ANSWER

316
00:49:44,921 --> 00:49:48,035
THE QUESTIONS AM I DOING THINGS 
RIGHT? THEY TEND TO BE WITHIN 

317
00:49:48,233 --> 00:49:51,644
THE CONTROL OF THE TEAM. THEY 
MEASURE THINGS LIKE HOW MANY 

318
00:49:51,859 --> 00:49:56,804
REPORTS THAT I WRITE THIS MONTH?
HOW WELL ARE MY SYSTEMS WORKING?

319
00:49:56,995 --> 00:50:01,118
HOW DO I MAKE EX MORE EFFICIENT?
WHAT ARE WE ANALYZING? WHAT ARE 

320
00:50:01,309 --> 00:50:06,069
WE DREAMING? THESE METRICS HAVE 
THEIR PLACE THEY TENDED TO BE 

321
00:50:06,266 --> 00:50:08,959
OVERWEIGHTED IN HOW WE THINK 
ABOUT THE EFFECT OF IN THIS OF 

322
00:50:09,155 --> 00:50:12,822
INTELLIGENCE. THIS IS ALSO WHERE
WHEN A LOT OF US GET CLINICAL 

323
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:15,492
ABOUT METRICS WE ARE SPENDING 
TOO MUCH TIME WORKING TOWARDS 

324
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,576
THE METRIC AND IT DOESN'T REALLY
GET TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER 

325
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:23,185
OF HOW EFFECTIVE WE ARE BEING. 
PRETTY MUCH ALL OF US HAVE SOME 

326
00:50:23,397 --> 00:50:27,096
SORT OF HORROR STORY OR ISSUE 
ABOUT A PLACE THAT WE WORKED OR 

327
00:50:27,289 --> 00:50:30,809
A PERSON THAT WE KNOW WHERE 
THERE WAS A METRIC OF TO BE 

328
00:50:31,012 --> 00:50:36,662
SUCCESSFUL YOU WILL WRITE FIVE 
REPORTS A MONTH. I KNOW IF I SET

329
00:50:36,851 --> 00:50:39,485
THAT AS A CRITERIA MY ANALYST 
ARE GOING TO WRITE FIVE REPORTS 

330
00:50:39,768 --> 00:50:42,368
A ONCE A MONTH. WHETHER OR NOT 
THEY ARE GOOD OR WHETHER WRITING

331
00:50:42,618 --> 00:50:45,848
FIVE REPORTS A MONTH IS THE 
RIGHT THING I WANT THEM TO DO IS

332
00:50:46,104 --> 00:50:49,250
A SEPARATE AUSTIN. WE HAVE TO BE
CAREFUL, BECAUSE WHILE THESE 

333
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:53,031
TYPES OF METRICS ARE IMPORTANT 
FOR KEEPING THE TEAM MOVING 

334
00:50:53,758 --> 00:50:55,758
FORWARD AND IMPROVING YOUR 
PROCESSES IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL 

335
00:50:55,932 --> 00:50:59,991
YOU COULD EASILY MISS 
INCENTIVIZE THE TYPE OF BEHAVIOR

336
00:51:00,255 --> 00:51:04,551
YOU WANT YOUR TEAM TAKING. WHERE
I REALLY WANT TO BE IS ON THE 

337
00:51:04,748 --> 00:51:07,843
RIGHT SIDE FOR TALKING ABOUT 
MEASURES EFFECTIVENESS. THESE 

338
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:14,906
TYPES OF METRICS CAPTURE IN MY 
DOING THIS RIGHT? HERE IS WHAT 

339
00:51:15,104 --> 00:51:21,105
WE ARE REALLY TALKING ABOUT, THE
F ABOUT INTEL TEAM IS CREATING 

340
00:51:21,305 --> 00:51:24,944
IS CHANGING THE ORGANIZATIONS 
DECISIONS OF BEHAVIOR. RIGHT? 

341
00:51:25,145 --> 00:51:27,606
THIS IS WHERE WE ARE REALLY 
TRYING TO FOCUS ON THAT IMPACT 

342
00:51:27,811 --> 00:51:32,608
THESE MAYBE THINGS LIKE 
COUNTERMEASURES OR NEW CASES 

343
00:51:32,806 --> 00:51:36,744
THAT HAVE BEEN GENERATED FROM 
THREAT. THAT OUTPUT IS 

344
00:51:36,964 --> 00:51:39,090
PRACTICALLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE 
IN THE WAY THE SECURITY TEAM 

345
00:51:39,288 --> 00:51:44,850
WORKS. GUESS WHAT? THESE TYPES 
OF METRICS REQUIRE A REALLY 

346
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:50,944
STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH TEAMS WE
ARE ENABLING. WHOEVER OUR KEY 

347
00:51:51,139 --> 00:51:55,166
STAKEHOLDERS ARE FROM OUR CHOOSE
YOUR OWN ADVENTURE CASE

348
00:51:58,775 --> 00:52:00,327
BUT THE MEASURES OF 
EFFECTIVENESS WILL REALLY SPEAK 

349
00:52:00,328 --> 00:52:03,131
TO HOW WELL WE ARE WORKING 
TOGETHER. AND THAT MAKES US 

350
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:07,375
REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE. RIGHT? WE 
KNOW THIS IN OUR BONES. THE 

351
00:52:07,575 --> 00:52:12,377
NUMBER OF THREAT INTEL 
ORGANIZATIONS, THEY FELT THEIR 

352
00:52:12,573 --> 00:52:17,375
WORK WASN'T PART OF THE CHANGE. 
TOO MANY TO COUNT. THAT MAKES US

353
00:52:17,574 --> 00:52:21,004
REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE TO THINK 
THAT THE TRUE MEASURE OF OUR 

354
00:52:21,217 --> 00:52:25,092
EFFECTIVENESS IS HOW WELL WE ARE
ENABLING OTHERS

355
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:36,933
. THERE'S A CULTURAL MISMATCH A 
LOT OF TIMES BETWEEN 

356
00:52:37,127 --> 00:52:41,121
INTELLIGENCE AND OPS I DON'T 
WANT TO OVERDO THIS POINT, 

357
00:52:41,303 --> 00:52:45,183
BECAUSE SOMETIMES I THINK IT 
COMES ACROSS AS A CARICATURE. IS

358
00:52:45,387 --> 00:52:49,406
NOT A THRILL INTELLIGENCE FROM 
MARS AND THE OTHERS FROM VENUS, 

359
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,900
IS NOT LIKE THAT. WE HAVE 
DIFFERENT FRAMES TO THE WAY THAT

360
00:52:53,111 --> 00:52:55,111
WE

361
00:52:58,465 --> 00:53:00,023
NEED INFORMATION AND THE 
TIMELINE WE NEED THAT 

362
00:53:00,024 --> 00:53:01,825
INFORMATION TO BE VALID. BY 
ABSOLUTELY NO MALICE OR 

363
00:53:01,826 --> 00:53:05,105
DELIBERATE FLIGHT IT'S EASY FOR 
BOTH OF US TRYING TO DO OUR BEST

364
00:53:05,656 --> 00:53:11,277
AND NOT MAKE THE OTHER SIDE 
EFFECTIVE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? 

365
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:16,157
INTEL IS DRAWN TO THE NOVEL, THE
UNIQUE, THE NEXT. RIGHT? WHAT IS

366
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:20,670
THE NEXT BIG ATT&CK? WHAT 
HAPPENED HERE? WHAT IS THE 

367
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:25,415
ATT&CK ESCAPE MOVING FORWARD? WE
LIVE IN THE DETAILS. BECAUSE THE

368
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,509
DETAILS OF THOSE ATTACKS ARE 
GOING TO VERY USUALLY PRETTY 

369
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:32,100
SUBSTANTIALLY BASED OFF OF THE 
ENVIRONMENT THE EXECUTED WE HAVE

370
00:53:32,806 --> 00:53:37,978
TO BE THERE. BUT, IF WE ARE NOT 
CAREFUL IT CAN'T US OF PUTS US 

371
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:43,696
IN THE POSITION OF BEING THE, 
WELL, ACTUALLY PEOPLE. I HAVE 

372
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,887
BEEN THERE. WE HAVE ALL BEEN 
THERE. YOU PROVIDE THIS 

373
00:53:45,925 --> 00:53:47,901
INFORMATION AND WHAT COMES BACK 
IS SOMETHING THAT IS SO 

374
00:53:47,902 --> 00:53:51,000
GENERALIZED YOU FEEL COMPELLED 
TO SAY, WELL, ACTUALLY AND 

375
00:53:51,243 --> 00:53:53,775
PROVIDE LIKE FIVE CAVEATS BUT 
IT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT AS 

376
00:53:54,247 --> 00:53:58,623
PRACTITIONERS THAT OUR CUSTOMERS
DON'T THINK THE RUNWAY AND 

377
00:53:58,831 --> 00:54:01,428
CHARGE OFF IN THE WRONG 
DIRECTION. IF WE OVERDO IT WE 

378
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:04,179
BASICALLY END UP NEVER GETTING A
CLEAR..

379
00:54:07,836 --> 00:54:10,267
I MENTIONED THAT WE ARE LIVING 
IN THE DETAILS. MOST OF THE WORK

380
00:54:10,555 --> 00:54:14,270
THAT WE ARE DOING ON THESE, WHAT
WE ARE PUBLISHING IS 

381
00:54:14,458 --> 00:54:16,368
RETROSPECTIVE IN NATURE FOR OUR 
WORK IS HIGHLY DESCRIPTIVE AND 

382
00:54:16,369 --> 00:54:18,586
HIGHLY EXPLANATORY BUT NOT 
NECESSARILY SUPER PREDICTIVE 

383
00:54:18,828 --> 00:54:23,461
GOING FORWARD. SO THERE IS 
ACTUALLY, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, A 

384
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:27,836
THEORY ABOUT THEORIES. WHAT I 
WANT TO POINT OUT HERE IS WHEN 

385
00:54:28,026 --> 00:54:31,729
YOU THINK OF A THEORY BETWEEN 
THE DIES NOT TO DRINK AND 

386
00:54:31,918 --> 00:54:36,402
PROGNOSTIC STRENGTH. DIAGNOSTIC 
THEORIES HAVE A HIGH AMOUNT OF 

387
00:54:36,591 --> 00:54:42,455
EXPLANATORY POWER. REALLY GOOD 
APPLY TO A SPECIFIC CASE LOOKING

388
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:44,953
BACKWARDS. BECAUSE THEY ARE SO 
DETAILED THEY ARE LESS 

389
00:54:45,179 --> 00:54:48,746
GENERALIZE GOING FORWARD AND 
HAVE LESS PREDICTIVE STRENGTH. I

390
00:54:48,948 --> 00:54:50,948
WOULD PUT FORTH FOR THE MOST 
PART

391
00:54:54,402 --> 00:54:57,993
LIVE ON THE DIAGNOSTIC SPECTRUM 
IN THE WORK THAT WE DO. THAT 

392
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:01,634
CONTRAST, I THINK, IS PRETTY 
SIGNIFICANTLY WITH WHAT 

393
00:55:01,835 --> 00:55:05,653
OPERATIONS NEED TO BE MORE 
EFFECTIVE. OPS NEEDS STABILITY 

394
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:08,958
OF SIGNAL IN ORDER TO DO THEIR 
WORK. SPEAKING WITH A NUMBER OF 

395
00:55:09,159 --> 00:55:11,159
TEAMS THAT HAVE WORKED TO 
IMPLEMENT MITRE ONE OF THE 

396
00:55:11,569 --> 00:55:16,932
THINGS  THAT STUCK OUT TO ME 
QUITE VIVIDLY IS HOW LONG IT 

397
00:55:17,122 --> 00:55:21,257
TAKES THE OPS TEAM TO BUILD A 
FIELD DETECTION. IDENTIFYING 

398
00:55:21,454 --> 00:55:26,101
THESE TECHNIQUES, RESEARCHING 
THE DETECTION, BUILDING IT, 

399
00:55:26,383 --> 00:55:32,573
TESTING IT, THE AVERAGE HERE IS 
CLOSER TO ONE PER QUARTER FOR 

400
00:55:32,781 --> 00:55:36,516
ANALYST. THAT'S A COMPLETELY 
DIFFERENT TIME FRAME THAN INTEL 

401
00:55:37,041 --> 00:55:43,620
PEOPLE LIVE ON. RIGHT? WHEN WE 
THINK ABOUT THIS, WHAT WE ARE 

402
00:55:43,818 --> 00:55:49,571
REPORTING, WE ARE OVER HERE 
LOOKING AT THAT NEW NOVEL AND 

403
00:55:49,766 --> 00:55:52,125
OPS IS OVER HERE TRYING TO 
FIGURE OUT, YOU JUST GAVE ME 16 

404
00:55:52,314 --> 00:55:55,676
NEW NOVEL ENACT, WHAT IS STABLE 
HERE AND WHAT IS GOING TO BE 

405
00:55:55,885 --> 00:56:00,965
WORTH THE INVESTMENT IN.FOR ME 
TO BUILD THESE DETECTIONS? 

406
00:56:01,436 --> 00:56:03,850
BASICALLY, IN A NUTSHELL, THEY 
NEED INTEL TO BE MORE PROGNOSTIC

407
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:06,496
WHEREAS OUR STRENGTH IS REALLY 
BEING MORE DIAGNOSTIC.

408
00:56:12,389 --> 00:56:15,336
I HAVE HIGHLIGHTED A COUPLE OF 
AREAS WHERE WE WANT TO GET 

409
00:56:15,546 --> 00:56:18,957
BETTER AT INTELLIGENCE 
PRACTITIONERS. WHAT

410
00:56:23,014 --> 00:56:24,789
IS HELPING US CREATE THAT 
DECISION ADVANTAGE AND WORKING 

411
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:30,327
MORE EFFECTIVE AS A TEAM? PEOPLE
THINK WE ARE ONTO SOMETHING 

412
00:56:30,536 --> 00:56:34,716
RIGHT? THIS IS A GOOGLE TRANCE 
CHART FOR AN ATTACKER GOING BACK

413
00:56:35,179 --> 00:56:37,179
TO WHEN THE

414
00:56:39,266 --> 00:56:41,271
FRAMEWORK WAS FIRST INTRODUCED 
IN MAY 2015 UNTIL, NOT TOO PROUD

415
00:56:41,489 --> 00:56:46,131
TO SAY IT, I MADE THIS SLIDE 
LAST NIGHT. SO. WHAT YOU CAN SEE

416
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:50,804
HERE IS THAT IN 2018 WE REALLY 
START TO SEE VELOCITY TAKE OFF 

417
00:56:50,998 --> 00:56:57,321
FOR ATT&CK AND JUST KEEP GOING 
UP. IN MY DEFENSE, I MADE THE 

418
00:56:57,546 --> 00:57:01,236
SLIDE EARLIER IN THE MONTH AND 
AT THAT .100, WHICH IS OUR 

419
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:05,180
Y-AXIS YEAR AND REPRESENTS THE 
PEAK POPULARITY ATT&CK AND 

420
00:57:05,391 --> 00:57:09,727
SEARCH FROM, THE 100.WAS HIT 
THIS YEAR IN AUGUST BASICALLY 

421
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:17,509
COINCIDING WITH THE TIME KATIE 
AND RYAN GAVE A TALK. AND THEN I

422
00:57:17,707 --> 00:57:21,527
REALIZED LET ME GO CHECK THAT 
DATA AGAIN. AND FOUND THAT IT 

423
00:57:21,714 --> 00:57:24,208
LOOKS LIKE WE ARE ON TRACK TO 
SPEAK WITH THE CONFERENCE TO 

424
00:57:24,396 --> 00:57:31,450
CREATE A NEW HIGH. WELL DONE, 
EVERYBODY. YES. YOU CAN CLAP FOR

425
00:57:31,642 --> 00:57:34,544
YOURSELF. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY 
ACCEPTABLE. BUT THIS TREND TELLS

426
00:57:34,737 --> 00:57:40,736
US SOMETHING THAT WILL KNOW 
INTUITIVELY. WHEN WE GO TO 

427
00:57:40,981 --> 00:57:42,981
SECURITY CONFERENCES NOW WE ARE 
PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEED TO GET AT

428
00:57:43,137 --> 00:57:47,664
LEAST ONE TALK ON ATTACKS BUT IT
MAY BE FROM THE MITRE TEAM 

429
00:57:47,862 --> 00:57:51,135
ITSELF.  OFTEN TIMES IT'S FROM 
OTHER PRACTITIONERS WHICH IS 

430
00:57:51,349 --> 00:57:59,086
REALLY EXCITING AND COMPELLING. 
I HAVE TO SAY, I THINK THE 

431
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:02,698
ATT&CK FRAMEWORK IS NOW 
OFFICIALLY EVERYWHERE. THIS 

432
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:08,877
EPISODE WAS ABOUT ATT&CK IQ AND 
ADVERSARY EMULATIONS BUT IT'S 

433
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:12,548
PRETTY INTERESTING IF YOU HAVE A
CHANCE TO CHECK IT OUT. OKAY. 

434
00:58:13,009 --> 00:58:19,483
SO. THE VALUE HERE, POINT NUMBER
ONE, MOVING UP FOR MORE TACTICAL

435
00:58:19,664 --> 00:58:22,053
THREAT INTELLIGENCE. FOR THOSE 
OF YOU WHO HAD FIRST TIME PERMIT

436
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:25,982
TEAM REFERENCE ABOUT 16 MINUTES 
INTO THE CONFERENCE YOU WHEN THE

437
00:58:26,183 --> 00:58:28,183
POOL.

438
00:58:30,358 --> 00:58:32,637
AND WE WILL PROBABLY SEE THIS 
SLIDE A COUPLE MORE TIMES OVER 

439
00:58:32,838 --> 00:58:35,193
THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THAT'S NOT A 
BAD THING. THE PYRAMID OF PAIN 

440
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:38,819
WAS DEVELOPED BY DAVE BIANCO WHO
IS AT TARGET. BASICALLY TO THINK

441
00:58:39,005 --> 00:58:42,572
ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF PAIN CAUSED 
THROUGH THE ADVERSARY OF WHEN 

442
00:58:43,135 --> 00:58:46,886
THESE VARIOUS CATEGORIES ARE 
DENIED TO THEM. EARLIER WHEN I 

443
00:58:47,085 --> 00:58:53,772
SAID THAT THREAT INTELLIGENCE 
TENDS TO BE LIMITED LARGELY IN 

444
00:58:53,969 --> 00:58:55,969
THE MARKET

445
00:58:58,948 --> 00:59:01,461
WE ARE SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME 
HERE AT THE BOTTOM LEVELS OF THE

446
00:59:01,654 --> 00:59:05,995
PYRAMID ON ACTIVITY THAT IS 
TRIVIAL TO THE ADVERSARY TO 

447
00:59:06,184 --> 00:59:09,553
CHANGE. WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS 
MOVE UP TO

448
00:59:14,414 --> 00:59:19,084
TTT. THESE ARE MUCH MORE STABLE.
A STABLE SIGNAL THAT OUR 

449
00:59:19,332 --> 00:59:22,669
OPERATORS NEED IT GIVES US THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO REFRAME THE 

450
00:59:22,875 --> 00:59:27,891
DISCUSSION. BY WORKING AT THIS 
LEVEL WE HELP INTEL COME OUT OF 

451
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:33,770
THAT TACTICAL DIAGNOSTIC FOCUS 
AND GIVE OFF DISABILITY SIGNAL 

452
00:59:33,974 --> 00:59:39,003
THEY NEED TO DO THE WORK THAT 
THEY NEED TO DO TO BUILD ATT&CK.

453
00:59:40,665 --> 00:59:44,612
WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY LOOK 
LIKE? ALSO, FIRST REPRESENTATION

454
00:59:44,888 --> 00:59:50,355
OF A MATRIX TODAY. OPENED UP THE
ATT&CK NAVIGATOR AND PULLED THE 

455
00:59:51,258 --> 00:59:56,366
ACC 28. JUST A SPECIAL THOUGHT 
OF WHAT THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN 

456
00:59:56,553 --> 01:00:00,183
ABLE TO BRING TOGETHER IN THE 
BODY OF REPORTING. WHICH IS 

457
01:00:00,369 --> 01:00:03,294
PRETTY COOL. WE CAN HAVE A VERY 
DISC GET DIFFERENT DISCUSSION AS

458
01:00:03,482 --> 01:00:06,974
A TEAM WHAT WE ARE STARTING FROM
HERE OR A HANDFUL OF INDICATORS.

459
01:00:08,164 --> 01:00:10,213
I THINK THAT'S A REALLY 
IMPORTANT POINT FOR THESE TYPES 

460
01:00:10,396 --> 01:00:16,098
OF MAJOR SIX ARE IMPORTANT WAY 
TO START BUILDING CONSENSUS ON 

461
01:00:16,304 --> 01:00:18,308
WHAT IS HAPPENING AND HOW THAT 
TRANSLATES TO OUR OWN 

462
01:00:18,506 --> 01:00:20,506
OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. A POINT
OF CAUTION,

463
01:00:23,946 --> 01:00:25,946
IT HAS EASILY BECOME TOO 
OVERRELIANCE ON THINGS LIKE A 

464
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:32,031
MATRIX IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL WE 
INTRODUCE BIAS. THIS CAN BE A 

465
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,031
VERY POWERFUL TOOL FOR 
DECREASING CERTAIN TYPES OF 

466
01:00:34,032 --> 01:00:40,633
BUYS, AND ANECDOTAL VIRUS IS 
VERY COOL FOR US TO PULL UP THIS

467
01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:43,875
INFORMATION AND LOOK AT IT OVER 
TIME WE ARE GOING TO BE 

468
01:00:44,261 --> 01:00:51,117
OVERWHELMINGLY WAITED TOWARD THE
MOST RECENT THING. THE HIGHEST A

469
01:00:51,312 --> 01:00:55,040
PERSONS OPINION, THE WAY THEY 
DEFINE THE PROBLEM BECOMES THE 

470
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:59,572
WAY WE FRAME AND TALK ABOUT IT. 
THIS CAN BE A VERY POWERFUL 

471
01:01:00,045 --> 01:01:02,045
DIRECTIVE TO THOSE GROUP 
TENDENCIES.

472
01:01:05,195 --> 01:01:07,990
IF WE COME TO RELY ON THIS WE 
INTRODUCE OTHER SOURCES OF BIAS,

473
01:01:08,204 --> 01:01:10,204
MAINLY COLLECTION.

474
01:01:12,547 --> 01:01:14,510
IF YOUR COLLECTION IS SKEWED 
TOWARD ONLY SEEING SOMETHING YOU

475
01:01:14,511 --> 01:01:16,511
HAVE DARKER RED ON THIS CHART 
THAN OTHERS. THE MATRIX 

476
01:01:16,576 --> 01:01:20,575
REPRESENTS WHAT YOU KNOW BUT THE
BIGGER THE DIVERGENCE BETWEEN 

477
01:01:20,779 --> 01:01:22,779
WHAT YOU KNOW AND REALITY IS 
WILL ALSO

478
01:01:26,445 --> 01:01:28,923
BE HOW EFFECTIVE THE TOOL IS 
GOING TO BE. IF WE THINK ABOUT 

479
01:01:29,114 --> 01:01:31,497
IT IN THAT WAY AND WE ARE 
CAREFUL TO THAT IS A REALLY 

480
01:01:31,692 --> 01:01:33,481
POWERFUL WAY TO BRING DIFFERENT 
TEAMS OF PERSPECTIVES TOGETHER 

481
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:38,050
AND HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. THAT
POINT MIGHT BE REALLY OBVIOUS TO

482
01:01:38,249 --> 01:01:43,716
ME BUT THE CORE OF THIS IS A 
COMMON NOMENCLATURE YEAH. WHY IS

483
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:46,683
IT TAKING US SO LONG TO GET TO 
THIS POINT WHERE WE CAN DO THAT?

484
01:01:46,875 --> 01:01:51,038
I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS AT DIRECT 
CONNECT AND WE WERE THINKING 

485
01:01:51,235 --> 01:01:56,503
ABOUT HOW TO GET INCENTIVIZE A 
TEAM TO DO MORE ANALYSIS BUT 

486
01:01:56,715 --> 01:01:59,136
THIS WAS ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO. 
WITH THE STANDARDIZATION 

487
01:01:59,329 --> 01:02:04,265
PROBLEM. RIGHT? WHEN WE TALKED 
ABOUT TTT IT WAS TWO, TWO 

488
01:02:04,469 --> 01:02:09,258
QUALITATIVE AND TWO SUBJECT TO 
INTERPRETATION BY DIFFERENT 

489
01:02:09,462 --> 01:02:11,462
ANALYSTS FOR US TO BUILD A 
STRUCTURED FEATURE THAT WOULD 

490
01:02:11,587 --> 01:02:15,825
INVOLVE BOTH HUMANS AND SYSTEMS 
TO CONSUME AT INTELLIGENCE. THIS

491
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:19,575
IS A PROBLEM I THINK MITRE HAS 
SOLVED  AND A LOT A WAY FOR US. 

492
01:02:20,037 --> 01:02:22,486
IN LAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE SEEN 
THIS CRITICAL MASS, I WOULD SAY 

493
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:28,975
ACROSS THE COMMUNITY TO TALK 
ABOUT TTT. NOW, IF WE CONTRAST 

494
01:02:29,171 --> 01:02:31,984
THAT AND THINK ABOUT HOW UNIQUE 
AND SPECIAL THAT IS LESS THING 

495
01:02:32,178 --> 01:02:34,667
ABOUT ANOTHER PART OF OUR WORLD 
AND THAT'S ADVERSARY NAMING. 

496
01:02:35,013 --> 01:02:38,930
RIGHT? ADVERSARY NAMING BY 
CONTRAST IS NOT STANDARDIZED BUT

497
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:42,893
EACH MAN OR PRODUCER COMES UP 
WITH THEIR OWN CODE NAME OR CODE

498
01:02:43,115 --> 01:02:48,229
WORD AND SOMEONE IS GOING TO SAY
THERE'S GOOD REASONS FOR THAT 

499
01:02:48,436 --> 01:02:53,479
LIKE HAVE DIFFERENT VISIBILITY 
AND THAT IT MAY BE TRUE. BUT, 

500
01:02:53,667 --> 01:02:57,679
ONE, THE CONVERSATIONS WE DON'T 
HAVE ARE ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT A 

501
01:02:57,884 --> 01:03:03,573
PT 28 PHYSICAL IS VERSUS FANCY 
BEER. THOSE ARE THE 

502
01:03:03,774 --> 01:03:05,746
CONVERSATIONS WE REALLY HAVE IN 
THE THREAT INTEL COMMUNITY. WE 

503
01:03:05,747 --> 01:03:09,816
HAVE THEM ALTOGETHER. IT CAUSES 
A LOT OF PAIN AND FRICTION FOR 

504
01:03:10,009 --> 01:03:13,464
EVERYBODY. TO THE THREAT INTEL 
ANALYST THEMSELVES ANYBODY WHO 

505
01:03:13,654 --> 01:03:16,970
HAS TO KEEP THE INFORMATION. 
JUST

506
01:03:21,295 --> 01:03:23,814
JOINED A NEW TEAM AT GOOGLE I 
NOW HAVE ANOTHER SET OF ACRONYMS

507
01:03:24,004 --> 01:03:26,167
AND CODEWORDS I HAD TO LATER ON 
TO THESE OTHER ONES. SUPERFUND, 

508
01:03:26,355 --> 01:03:30,123
GUYS. SO MUCH FUN. HERE I THINK

509
01:03:35,038 --> 01:03:37,052
THE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN HOW WE SEE
TTT EVOLVE AND ADVERSARY NAMING 

510
01:03:37,241 --> 01:03:39,645
IS REALLY A TESTAMENT TO THE 
WORK THAT MITRE DOES. RIGHT? 

511
01:03:39,828 --> 01:03:41,917
IT'S ALSO A TESTAMENT TO THE 
COMMUNITY WHICH  IS INVESTED 

512
01:03:42,103 --> 01:03:45,649
INTO THE FRAMEWORK TO MAKE IT 
MORE USABLE OVER THE LAST FEW 

513
01:03:45,857 --> 01:03:47,857
YEARS.

514
01:03:50,478 --> 01:03:54,623
THERE YOU GO. THAT'S JUST A 
HANDFUL OF ALIASES FOR THE SAME 

515
01:03:54,842 --> 01:04:02,757
GROUP. CONSTRUCTING YOUR SEARCH 
QUERIES AROUND THAT. ALL RIGHT, 

516
01:04:02,977 --> 01:04:07,227
COMMON NOMENCLATURE HERE IS SO 
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS ON AN 

517
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:11,220
OPERATIONAL FIXER. I MENTIONED 
EARLIER IF WE THINK ABOUT THE 

518
01:04:11,408 --> 01:04:14,868
LOOP AGAIN IN THAT FRAME ONE OF 
THE REASONS ATT&CK IS SO HELPFUL

519
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:20,094
IS IT RISES UP FROM THE TACTICAL
OBSERVATIONS ARE IN MUCH HIGHER 

520
01:04:20,297 --> 01:04:22,697
LEVEL AND AT A BETTER STARTING 
POINT FOR THE NEXT STEP, WHICH 

521
01:04:22,913 --> 01:04:26,945
IS ORIENT. THESE MATRICES ARE A 
REALLY IMPORTANT WAY TO BRING 

522
01:04:27,149 --> 01:04:30,779
INTEL AND OPPS TOGETHER, BECAUSE
IT ALLOWS US TO MAP ADVERSARY 

523
01:04:30,978 --> 01:04:35,169
ACTIVITY AND THEN TRANSLATE THAT
AS HOW WE SEE THIS PLAY OUT ON 

524
01:04:35,516 --> 01:04:40,351
OUR OWN NETWORK. AGAIN, SOUNDS 
SO SIMPLE. IT SUCH A COMPELLING 

525
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,543
STEP FORWARD FOR BRINGING BOTH 
SIDES OF THIS TOGETHER THE WAY 

526
01:04:43,133 --> 01:04:47,077
WE ORIENT TOGETHER IS WHAT 
DRIVES HOW WE DECIDE AND ACT. 

527
01:04:47,539 --> 01:04:51,539
ONE OF THE THINGS I HAVE NOTICED
IN LOOKING AT TEAMS THAT HAVE 

528
01:04:51,759 --> 01:04:54,578
HAD SOME FALSE STARTS OR 
STRUGGLED TO GET THERE ATT&CK 

529
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:59,853
OFF THE GROUND IS THAT ORIENT 
PHASE REALLY REQUIRES BOTH INTEL

530
01:05:00,043 --> 01:05:03,177
AND OPPS. IF JUST ONE OF THEM IS
TRYING TO DRIVE THAT IS NOT 

531
01:05:03,368 --> 01:05:07,125
GOING TO BE SUCCESS AND IS GOING
TO STRUGGLE IN THE ORGANIZATION.

532
01:05:11,572 --> 01:05:19,731
WEIGHT. THERE IS EVEN MORE. EMMA
WE TALKED ABOUT LITTLE OF QUITE 

533
01:05:20,495 --> 01:05:25,996
A BIT. ATT&CK IS THAT A 
FRAMEWORK IS ABOUT ADVERSARY 

534
01:05:26,192 --> 01:05:29,762
BEHAVIOR AND THAT ALLOWS YOU TO 
KNOW YOURSELF. THIS IS SOMETHING

535
01:05:30,989 --> 01:05:33,232
I KEEP RUNNING INTO OVER AND 
OVER AGAIN EVERY TIME I WORK 

536
01:05:33,427 --> 01:05:38,304
WITH A TEAM THAT IS STARTING TO 
IMPLEMENT ATT&CK. WHAT DOES THAT

537
01:05:38,524 --> 01:05:45,508
ACTUALLY MEAN? ONE OF THE FIRST 
FEW SPACES IS IMPROVING 

538
01:05:45,981 --> 01:05:48,012
DETECTION AND VISIBILITY. WHEN 
WE THINK ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING 

539
01:05:48,212 --> 01:05:51,288
TO USE MITRE ATT&CK IT'S ABOUT  
IMPROVING OPERATIONAL DEFENSE. 

540
01:05:51,479 --> 01:05:57,156
AND HELPING GET YOURSELF OUT OF 
A BREACH THE TUITION WHERE YOU 

541
01:05:57,341 --> 01:05:59,341
ARE BOTH BREACHED AND NOT 
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEE IT. RIGHT?

542
01:05:59,487 --> 01:06:02,150
IMPROVING VISIBILITY IS USUALLY 
ONE OF THE FIRST USE CASES WHERE

543
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:05,194
YOU WILL SEE VALUE FROM 
UNDERTAKING THIS ACTIVITY THIS 

544
01:06:05,392 --> 01:06:08,189
IS WHAT WE TEND TO THINK OF WHEN
WE START THINKING ABOUT ATT&CK.

545
01:06:12,694 --> 01:06:14,839
ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING 
TALKS I HAVE SEEN THIS YEAR WAS 

546
01:06:15,054 --> 01:06:18,615
FROM AN ANALYST AT IMG THAT WAS 
PRESENTED EARLIER. THIS WAS 

547
01:06:18,832 --> 01:06:22,211
ABOUT USING THE MITER FRAMEWORK 
TO MAP UNTIL REQUIREMENTS FOR 

548
01:06:22,404 --> 01:06:26,209
THIS IS SOMETHING I NEVER EVEN 
THOUGHT OF DOING. THIS ANALYST 

549
01:06:26,603 --> 01:06:28,666
TOOK HIGH-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS 
FROM THEIR EXECUTIVES AND BROKEN

550
01:06:28,846 --> 01:06:33,092
DOWN INTO THE TYPES OF THE 
ATT&CK THAT WERE MOST LIKELY TO 

551
01:06:33,296 --> 01:06:35,296
CREATE THAT AND I GOT INTO A 
MATRIX.

552
01:06:38,947 --> 01:06:40,947
THAT GAVE THIS ANALYST ANOTHER 
LAYER WHEN THEY WERE HAVING 

553
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,677
THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT 
ADVERSARY BEHAVIOR IS, WHAT OUR 

554
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:45,917
STAKEHOLDERS ONE, AND WHAT WE 
SEE ON THE NETWORK TO MAKE 

555
01:06:46,112 --> 01:06:49,413
BETTER DECISIONS. I KNOW THIS 
CAN BE A LITTLE HARD TO SEE 

556
01:06:49,886 --> 01:06:53,796
BECAUSE THESE LITTLE TRIBES ARE 
STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT, TRACK 

557
01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:59,538
AND IMPROVE MATURITY, SOURCES 
MANAGEMENT. WE GOT ANOTHER BONUS

558
01:06:59,738 --> 01:07:02,431
OUT OF IT, WHICH IS ALL THE WORK
THEY WERE DOING TO CREATE 

559
01:07:02,673 --> 01:07:04,745
INTELLIGENCE REPORTS AND 
ANALYSIS AND THE WORK THAT THE 

560
01:07:05,026 --> 01:07:07,417
OPS TEAM WAS DOING TO BUILD 
THESE DETECTIONS AND IMPROVE 

561
01:07:07,615 --> 01:07:11,584
COVERAGE ON THE MAP , THEY WERE 
ABLE TO CLEANLY MAP THAT BACK TO

562
01:07:11,781 --> 01:07:14,211
PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS WHICH IS 
SOMETHING ELSE WE TEND TO 

563
01:07:14,399 --> 01:07:18,173
STRUGGLE WITH A LOT THIS CASE. I
THOUGHT THAT WAS A PRETTY COOL 

564
01:07:18,372 --> 01:07:21,933
USE OF THE ATT&CK WORK THAT I 
HAD NEVER REALLY THOUGHT OF 

565
01:07:22,128 --> 01:07:26,141
BEFORE. HERE IS ANOTHER ONE. 
SUPPORTING YOUR PRODUCT EVAL. 

566
01:07:26,585 --> 01:07:30,245
SO, THIS IS A TALK THAT WAS 
PRESENTED HERE AT ATT&CK CON 

567
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:36,015
LAST YEAR BY TWO ANALYST FROM 
GENERAL ELECTRIC A GREAT TALK 

568
01:07:36,209 --> 01:07:39,049
WHERE THEY FOCUSED ON HOW THE 
OPERATIONALIZE ATT&CK IN THEIR 

569
01:07:39,286 --> 01:07:43,321
ORGANIZATION. A LOT OF THIS 
EARLY USE CASES WHERE THE MEAT 

570
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:45,957
OF IT. THEY ALSO TALKED ABOUT 
HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO USE THAT 

571
01:07:46,245 --> 01:07:48,245
KNOWLEDGE OF WHERE THEIR GAPS 
WERE TO MEANINGFULLY CHANGE THE 

572
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:50,990
WAY THE ATT&CK THE BELL. NOW 
THAT I'M LOOKING AT WHERE I 

573
01:07:51,203 --> 01:07:54,592
DIRECT MY BUDGET WHERE ARE MY 
GAPS AND NOW I HAVE ANOTHER 

574
01:07:54,784 --> 01:07:57,451
BASIS FOR ASSESSING DOES THIS 
TOOL THAT THE VENDOR IS TELLING 

575
01:07:57,644 --> 01:08:03,066
ME DO THE THINGS IT SAYS I IT 
DOES AND I NEEDED TO DO? WHAT AN

576
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:09,461
IDEA. BUT YOU'RE PROBABLY 
THINKING, YOU KNOW, HOW DO WE 

577
01:08:09,657 --> 01:08:14,185
GET HERE? YOU ARE JUST SHOWING 
ME SOME MATRICES. WHAT IS THE 

578
01:08:14,648 --> 01:08:18,190
MAGICAL ALCHEMY THAT ALLOWS IT 
TO GET FROM THAT DEPTH CHART TO 

579
01:08:18,849 --> 01:08:22,473
THESE AMAZING OUTCOMES? TO ME 
WHAT COMES TO MIND IS HIS QUOTE 

580
01:08:22,666 --> 01:08:25,723
ATTRIBUTED TO PRESIDENT DWIGHT D
EISENHOWER, PLANS ARE WORTHLESS 

581
01:08:25,917 --> 01:08:30,480
BUT PLANNING IS EVERYTHING. I 
SAY MAYBE, BECAUSE EISENHOWER 

582
01:08:30,953 --> 01:08:34,239
SPOKE TO SOMETHING HE HEARD IN 
THE ARMY. AM NOT REALLY SURE, 

583
01:08:34,423 --> 01:08:37,089
IT'S URBAN LEGEND, WHO THE REAL 
OWNER OF THIS IS. LET'S BE 

584
01:08:37,292 --> 01:08:40,156
HONEST, THE GUY THAT PLANNED THE
D-DAY INVASION GETS TO BE A 

585
01:08:40,648 --> 01:08:44,110
LITTLE BIT MORE SOMETHING ABOUT 
PLANS AND THE REST OF US DO. 

586
01:08:44,584 --> 01:08:48,929
THERE IS SOME REAL TRUTH HERE. 
AND THAT IS IN SOME WAYS IT'S 

587
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:51,473
ABOUT THE PROCESS AND THE 
JOURNEY. RIGHT? WHEN YOU SIT 

588
01:08:51,662 --> 01:08:55,481
DOWN TO DO PLANNING YOU ARE 
IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM, YOU ARE

589
01:08:56,167 --> 01:08:59,317
IDENTIFYING YOUR ASSUMPTION. YOU
ARE SPEAKING ABOUT DIFFERENT 

590
01:09:00,084 --> 01:09:03,215
COURSES OF ACTION. THAT WORKS, 
BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO DO 

591
01:09:03,424 --> 01:09:07,017
THAT WORKS. IT'S REALLY THE 
FRIENDS WE MADE ALONG THE WAY. 

592
01:09:07,212 --> 01:09:11,229
RIGHT? THIS IS THE POINT WHERE 
WHAT YOU END UP FACING IS 

593
01:09:11,423 --> 01:09:15,615
PROBABLY GOING TO LOOK PRETTY 
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU PLANNED 

594
01:09:16,537 --> 01:09:21,592
THE ADVERSARY GETS A VOTE, BUT 
THIS WORK LEADS EVERYBODY 

595
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:24,260
MORBIDLY AND BETTER ABLE TO 
RESPOND TO WHAT ACTUALLY 

596
01:09:24,457 --> 01:09:30,429
MANIFEST, EVEN IF IT DOESN'T END
UP IN THE PLAN. I THINK A 

597
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,640
SIMILAR THING CAN BE SAID FOR

598
01:09:39,598 --> 01:09:41,644
ATT&CK. WE HAVE THESE MATRICES 
AND IT'S COOL, BUT IT'S A 

599
01:09:41,854 --> 01:09:43,924
DISCUSSION AND PROCESS WE ARE 
BUILDING WITHIN THE TEAM, HOW WE

600
01:09:44,124 --> 01:09:46,124
COMMUNICATE, AND DEFINE THE 
PROBLEM  THAT BECOMES SUCH A 

601
01:09:46,131 --> 01:09:48,131
POWERFUL DRIVER GOING FORWARD. 
ONE OF THE THINGS I'M SEEING 

602
01:09:48,287 --> 01:09:50,788
FROM ALL OF THESE TALKS ABOUT 
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT TEAMS ARE 

603
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:54,281
USING AND APPLYING ATT&CK  IS BY
PUTTING IN THIS INVESTMENT IN 

604
01:09:54,472 --> 01:09:58,099
DOING THESE WORK NOT ONLY ARE WE
GETTING IMPROVEMENT IN THAT CORE

605
01:09:58,291 --> 01:10:01,888
PROPOSITION OF DEFENDING OUR 
ENTERPRISE, WE ARE ACTUALLY ABLE

606
01:10:02,091 --> 01:10:05,946
TO DRIVE CHANGE ACROSS THE 
SECURITY TEAM AND HOW IT 

607
01:10:06,149 --> 01:10:08,149
OPERATES. THAT IS PRETTY COOL.

608
01:10:11,873 --> 01:10:14,443
SIGN ME UP. RIGHT? I WANT TO DO 
ALL OF THESE AMAZING THINGS WITH

609
01:10:14,647 --> 01:10:21,121
ATT&CK . FULL STEAM AHEAD AGAIN,
I PUT THIS GRAPHIC IN FOR KATIE 

610
01:10:21,595 --> 01:10:25,061
BECAUSE SHE IS SUCH A HUGE 
LEGALLY BLONDE FANFIC WHAT DID 

611
01:10:25,255 --> 01:10:33,326
WE HEAR FROM L WOODS ABOUT 
GETTING INTO HARVARD LAW? WHAT, 

612
01:10:33,518 --> 01:10:37,847
LIKE IT'S HARD? FIRST AND 
FOREMOST IS THE COMPLEXITY. WE 

613
01:10:38,058 --> 01:10:42,246
ARE UP TO 266 TECHNIQUES IN 
ENTERPRISE ATT&CK ALONE. DIDN'T 

614
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:47,447
GO THROUGH AND LOOK AT MOBILE. 
AND MANY TEAMS FIND THEMSELVES 

615
01:10:47,921 --> 01:10:50,882
EXTENDING THAT FRAMEWORK EVEN 
FURTHER TO MORE PROPERLY FIT 

616
01:10:51,102 --> 01:10:58,456
THEIR ENVIRONMENTS AND THEIR USE
CASES, WHICH IS COOL. I HAVE 

617
01:10:58,673 --> 01:11:00,688
SEEN KATIE TEAR THROUGH A REPORT
AND PULLOUT TECHNIQUE. FOR MOST 

618
01:11:00,884 --> 01:11:03,341
OF US MERE MORTALS THIS TAKES A 
WHILE. RIGHT? THE LEARNING CURVE

619
01:11:03,753 --> 01:11:06,268
IS PRETTY STEEP. I'M EXTREMELY 
EXCITED FOR JACKIE AND SEARS 

620
01:11:06,463 --> 01:11:11,706
CLASS WHERE, WITH WHAT MITRE HAS
BEEN  COOKING UP TO HELP REDUCE 

621
01:11:11,903 --> 01:11:15,522
THE COMPLEXITY AND TO IMPROVE 
ADOPTION FOR NEW USERS AND MORE 

622
01:11:15,974 --> 01:11:17,974
EXPERIENCED ONES OF ATT&CK. 

623
01:11:21,934 --> 01:11:25,385
DONE RIGHT UP LAMENTING ATT&CK 
IS GOING TO CHANGE YOUR INPUT  

624
01:11:25,659 --> 01:11:27,659
ON THE PROCESS, AND OUTPUT.

625
01:11:30,545 --> 01:11:33,014
PLAN ON THIS TAKING AT LEAST SIX
MONTHS TO A YEAR OF SUSTAINED 

626
01:11:33,209 --> 01:11:35,300
INVESTMENT BEFORE YOU FEEL LIKE 
YOU ARE REALLY STARTING TO GET 

627
01:11:35,494 --> 01:11:39,571
THE HANG OF IT. IF YOU GO AWAY 
THINKING IN A MONTH YOU'RE GOING

628
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:41,876
TO HAVE THE SLICK IT'S PROBABLY 
NOT SETTING YOURSELF UP FOR 

629
01:11:42,086 --> 01:11:48,873
SUCCESS. A BIG PART OF THIS IS 
THE WEIGHT OF CLASSIFYING A 

630
01:11:49,063 --> 01:11:51,373
WHOLE BUNCH OF DATA TO MAKE 
THOSE MATRICES MEANINGFUL. 

631
01:11:51,623 --> 01:11:55,566
RIGHT? THE ATT&CK TEAM HAS DONE 
A LOT OF WORK WITH THE KNOWLEDGE

632
01:11:55,770 --> 01:12:00,965
BASE TO GIVE YOU A HEAD START 
FOR MOST TEENS ARE GOING TO NEED

633
01:12:01,162 --> 01:12:03,619
TO BUILD OFF OF THIS AND LATER 
ON THEIR OWN INTERNAL DATA LIKE 

634
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:05,923
YOUR PREMIUM SOURCES, YOU ARE 
ACTUALLY IN TURNLEY PRODUCING 

635
01:12:06,403 --> 01:12:08,403
INTELLIGENCE,

636
01:12:10,196 --> 01:12:12,173
AND UNDERSTAND HOW YOUR SYSTEMS 
MAP TO THESE TECHNIQUES. THAT'S 

637
01:12:12,174 --> 01:12:14,816
A LOT OF LEG WORK. ONE OF THE 
THINGS THAT I THINK IS GETTING 

638
01:12:15,006 --> 01:12:19,290
VERY INTERESTING IN THE LAST TWO
YEARS, WE AS A COMMUNITY HAVE 

639
01:12:19,481 --> 01:12:24,742
DECIDED THAT THE ATT&CK  
FRAMEWORK IS HOW WE ARE GOING TO

640
01:12:24,952 --> 01:12:27,230
TALK ABOUT TTT. WE HAVE SEEN 
GREATER PICKUP IN THE VENDOR 

641
01:12:27,436 --> 01:12:30,452
SPACE. THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. 
BOTH ENABLES US TO AUTO CLASSIFY

642
01:12:31,165 --> 01:12:35,119
DATA MORE QUICKLY AND AT SCALE 
AND CONSUME THAT DATA MORE 

643
01:12:35,312 --> 01:12:39,038
EFFECTIVELY. I'M VERY CURIOUS TO
SEE OVER THIS NEXT YEAR AS THAT 

644
01:12:39,501 --> 01:12:45,431
START TO GAIN MORE SPEED IF THIS
VALUE HERE CAN BE REDUCED. THE 

645
01:12:45,622 --> 01:12:51,388
THIRD BIT IS BY IN. I REALLY 
ENJOYED THE BLACK CAT BOX, THE 

646
01:12:51,843 --> 01:12:55,539
PLATE HOME EDITION WHERE KATIE 
AND RYAN KOVAR USED THE 

647
01:12:55,733 --> 01:12:58,617
FRAMEWORK OF A VERY SMALL TEAM, 
ONE IN EACH ROLE, AND HOW THEY 

648
01:12:58,821 --> 01:13:02,265
COULD GET VALUE OUT OF ATT&CK. 
MOST OF US  WORKING IN AN 

649
01:13:02,476 --> 01:13:07,719
ORGANIZATION WHERE MORE THAN TWO
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO 

650
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:10,624
AGREE THAT WE WANT TO DO THIS. 
HOW DO WE BUILD THAT BY IN AND 

651
01:13:10,816 --> 01:13:14,824
MAKE IT SUSTAINABLE? STOP ME IF 
YOU HAVE HEARD THIS ONE BEFORE. 

652
01:13:15,297 --> 01:13:19,117
SENIOR IN THREAT INTELLIGENCE 
DON'T WANT TO USE IT ATT&CK 

653
01:13:19,323 --> 01:13:22,832
BECAUSE IT  FEELS LIKE WALKING 
ON HUGE OTHER LAYER OF WORK AND 

654
01:13:23,036 --> 01:13:26,141
IT SLOWS THEM DOWN. THE OBSOLETE
LOSES INTEREST AFTER THE FIRST 

655
01:13:26,351 --> 01:13:31,295
TIME THEY STEP TO THE EXERCISE I
DID ALL OF THIS WORK JUST TO GET

656
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:33,882
TO THE SAME DECISION THEY KNEW 
THEY WERE GOING TO MAKE OFF OF 

657
01:13:34,103 --> 01:13:36,714
INTUITION. THIS IS A LOT OF WORK
TO GET TO THE SAME POINT I 

658
01:13:36,926 --> 01:13:43,837
THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO GET TO. 
SO, BOTH ARE VALID. WHAT WE ARE 

659
01:13:44,057 --> 01:13:49,217
TRYING TO DO HERE, WHY DO WE PUT
IN ALL OF THIS WORK TO GET TO 

660
01:13:49,415 --> 01:13:51,415
VISUALLY THE SAME OUTCOME I 
COULD'VE GOT TOO MUCH FASTER BY 

661
01:13:51,592 --> 01:13:55,040
PUTTING THESE TWO PEOPLE IN A 
ROOM TOGETHER? THE ANSWER IS A 

662
01:13:55,239 --> 01:13:59,965
SKILL. THAT SENIOR THREAT 
ANALYST AND OBSOLETE DON'T 

663
01:14:00,172 --> 01:14:04,384
SCALE. THERE'S A FINITE AMOUNT 
OF DECISIONS THE TWO OF THEM CAN

664
01:14:04,579 --> 01:14:10,057
MAKE AND THEY DON'T SCALE ACROSS
THE TECHNIQUE. IF IT WORKED THAT

665
01:14:10,252 --> 01:14:12,721
WAY WE WOULDN'T NEED THEM. YOU 
GET TO THE SPACE WHERE LET'S SAY

666
01:14:12,912 --> 01:14:17,037
YOUR INITIAL OODLE LOOP 
PRE-ATTACK IS LIKE THIS YOU 

667
01:14:17,260 --> 01:14:19,421
START GOING THROUGH AND DOING 
ALL OF THIS WORK AND AS YOU'RE 

668
01:14:19,614 --> 01:14:22,583
LEARNING YOUR LITTLE LOOP IS 
LIKE THIS. RIGHT? IT'S GOING TO 

669
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,047
SLOW YOU DOWN THE FIRST TIME YOU
DO THIS. SOMETIMES PAINFULLY SO.

670
01:14:26,565 --> 01:14:30,593
BUT, WHAT WE WANT TO GET TO 
EVENTUALLY IS THIS, THOSE TWO 

671
01:14:30,789 --> 01:14:35,402
PEOPLE CAN'T SAY YES OR, YOU 
NEED THE WHOLE TEAM 

672
01:14:35,608 --> 01:14:37,608
PARTICIPATING TO GET THAT MUCH 
SMALLER ENTIRE LITTLE LOOP THAT 

673
01:14:37,613 --> 01:14:41,793
MEANS BREAKING DOWN THIS PROBLEM
AND HAVING A PROCESS THAT ALLOWS

674
01:14:42,482 --> 01:14:47,013
THE WHOLE TEAM AND NOT JUST THE 
TWO SENIORS WHO HAVE ENOUGH 

675
01:14:47,230 --> 01:14:50,312
INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE TO KNOW 
WHERE THE BODIES ARE BURIED AND 

676
01:14:50,556 --> 01:14:54,126
WHAT APPROACHES WE HAVE TRIED 
BEFORE HASN'T WORKED. RIGHT? 

677
01:14:54,325 --> 01:14:56,633
THIS IS A WAY TO LEVERAGE THE 
ENTIRE TEAM AND BRING THEM 

678
01:14:56,821 --> 01:15:00,427
TOGETHER TO MAKE THOSE 
DECISIONS. THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD 

679
01:15:00,623 --> 01:15:03,723
SELL. I THINK IT'S A PRETTY 
COMPELLING VALUE PROPOSITION AND

680
01:15:03,915 --> 01:15:07,834
A WAY TO BUILD BUY-IN. AS WE 
FOCUS ON THE WHY AND HOW AND THE

681
01:15:08,032 --> 01:15:10,667
WHAT THAT BECOMES A LOT EASIER.

682
01:15:14,685 --> 01:15:16,072
ESSENTIAL TO THAT IS MANAGING 
THOSE EXPECTATIONS. 

683
01:15:16,073 --> 01:15:18,605
UNDERSTANDING HOW LONG IS WHAT 
IT TAKE FOR US TO DO THIS AND 

684
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,264
WHERE THOSE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
ARE ALONG THE WAY. I THINK 

685
01:15:21,701 --> 01:15:23,979
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO 
PREVENTING US THOSE FALSE STARTS

686
01:15:24,811 --> 01:15:28,918
AND SIZZLING, FIZZLING OUT OF 
INTEREST WITH THE DIFFERENT 

687
01:15:29,117 --> 01:15:36,621
TEAMS. ONE WAY TO DO THIS IS TO 
USE A COMMUNITY. THIS IS A VERY 

688
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:41,250
VIBRANT COMMITTEE FULL OF 
PRACTITIONERS DOING VERY 

689
01:15:41,723 --> 01:15:43,689
INTERESTING THINGS. A LOT OF 
THIS CONTENT IS ASSESSABLE. THE 

690
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:46,187
TALKS I SHOWED EARLIER IN THE 
DECK, I SENT THOSE TO DOZENS OF 

691
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:49,933
PEOPLE WHO WERE STRUGGLING WITH 
HOW TO GET STARTED OR WE ARE 

692
01:15:50,309 --> 01:15:53,158
THINKING ABOUT A MORE 
INTERESTING USE CASE FOR ATT&CK.

693
01:15:53,888 --> 01:15:58,152
THESE NEXT TWO DAYS MEET EACH 
OTHER, BECAUSE THIS IS PART OF 

694
01:15:58,366 --> 01:16:02,497
HOW YOU HELP SOLIDIFY THAT BY 
IN. HAVING A COMPELLING VIGNETTE

695
01:16:02,689 --> 01:16:05,429
FROM A PEER TEAM AT ANOTHER 
COMPANY CAN BE WORTH EVERYTHING 

696
01:16:05,618 --> 01:16:11,077
WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING BY IN.
THIS IS A WONDERFUL FORUM TO GET

697
01:16:11,271 --> 01:16:13,271
THOSE STORIES TO THE PEOPLE.

698
01:16:16,879 --> 01:16:20,762
A FEW CLOSING THOUGHTS AS WE 
HEAD OUT ONTO THIS TWO DAY 

699
01:16:20,964 --> 01:16:24,033
WONDERFUL JOURNEY FULL OF 
WONDERFUL TALKS. WE TALKED A 

700
01:16:24,225 --> 01:16:28,078
LITTLE BIT, I TALKED, ABOUT WHY 
WE ARE HERE, THE PURPOSE OF 

701
01:16:28,575 --> 01:16:33,764
INTEL IS A DECISION ADVANTAGE 
BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING INTEL 

702
01:16:33,958 --> 01:16:38,230
COULD DO ALONE. IT REQUIRES A 
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN INTELLIGENCE

703
01:16:38,419 --> 01:16:40,501
AND OPERATIONS. ALL OF YOUR 
DEFENDERS WORKING TOGETHER. AS 

704
01:16:40,723 --> 01:16:43,284
WE HAVE SEEN, SOMETIMES WE GET 
THERE ON HER OWN INDIVIDUALLY, 

705
01:16:43,747 --> 01:16:48,989
BUT NOT NECESSARILY. THERE'S 
REASONS FOR THAT. ATT&CK IS A 

706
01:16:49,184 --> 01:16:51,184
REALLY POWERFUL TOOL IN OUR 
ARSENAL TO HELP DRIVE THAT TYPE 

707
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:53,800
OF  CHANGE ACROSS SECURITY BY 
MAKING US FOCUS ON THE SAME 

708
01:16:54,499 --> 01:16:58,063
LEVEL OF INTELLIGENCE THAT 
OFFICE NEEDS TO DO HIS WORK BY 

709
01:16:58,296 --> 01:17:00,692
THINKING ABOUT HOW WE CAN USE 
THAT TO DRIVE OTHER PARTS AND 

710
01:17:00,885 --> 01:17:05,006
PROCESSES ACROSS THE SECURITY 
TEAM AND THINKING THROUGH SOME 

711
01:17:05,202 --> 01:17:07,769
OF THE PITFALLS AND CHALLENGES 
THAT WE HAVE IS A FAIR QUESTION 

712
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:11,404
TO ASK THESE OTHER PRESENTERS AS
WE GO THROUGH. WHAT WAS YOUR 

713
01:17:11,614 --> 01:17:14,693
PAIN HERE? HOW LONG DID THIS 
TAKE? ALL OF THOSE THINGS, 

714
01:17:14,897 --> 01:17:17,623
MANAGER EXPECTATIONS, AND BUILD 
THAT BUY-IN SO THE INVESTMENT WE

715
01:17:17,827 --> 01:17:21,827
ARE MAKING IS STABLE AND PAYS 
OFF OVER TIME. THAT'S ALL I HAVE

716
01:17:22,502 --> 01:17:25,940
FOR YOU TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH
I WILL TAKE ANY QUESTIONS.

717
01:17:25,941 --> 01:17:27,941
>> [ APPLAUSE ]

718
01:17:40,473 --> 01:17:46,799

SOME MICROPHONES COMING. WE HAVE

719
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:48,996
A LOT OF PEOPLE WATCHING AT 
HOME.

720
01:17:58,282 --> 01:18:02,110
WE HAVE A CALMING NOISE OF 
WAVES. [ LAUGHTER ]

721
01:18:16,872 --> 01:18:19,684
I CAN ONLY GIVE A PARTIAL ANSWER
TO THAT QUESTION, MOBILE MOSTLY 

722
01:18:19,878 --> 01:18:22,342
BECAUSE I'VE ONLY BEEN IN GOOGLE
FOR 90 DAYS. GOOGLE IS A VERY 

723
01:18:22,557 --> 01:18:26,123
BOTTOM-UP KIND OF PICTURE. I 
CERTAINLY CAN'T PRETEND TO GIVE 

724
01:18:26,325 --> 01:18:29,563
A DEFINITIVE ANSWER HERE. I WILL
SAY THAT WE ARE INCORPORATING 

725
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:32,754
ATTACK AND WE WERE VERY HEAVILY 
AT THAT TTT LEVEL BUT THAT 

726
01:18:32,943 --> 01:18:37,402
EFFORT HAS BEEN SEVERAL YEARS IN
THE MAKING. YOU KNOW, THERE HAS 

727
01:18:37,604 --> 01:18:44,062
BEEN A LOT OF BORING ALONG THE 
WAY THAT PREDATES MY ARRIVAL. I 

728
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,253
THINK THERE WILL BE MORE 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISCUSSIONS 

729
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:48,254
ABOUT

730
01:18:50,624 --> 01:18:53,150
SOME OF THOSE TRADE-OFFS. A BIG 
PART OF WHAT I HAVE BEEN TALKING

731
01:18:53,358 --> 01:18:55,411
ABOUT HERE ABOUT THE DISCONNECT 
BETWEEN INTEL AND OPSIN HOW TO 

732
01:18:55,607 --> 01:18:57,639
IMPROVE THAT AND GET THE TWO 
TEAMS WORKING TOGETHER APPLIES A

733
01:18:57,835 --> 01:18:59,835
LARGE ORGANIZATION LIKE GOOGLE 
AND A SMALLER ONES I HAVE WORKED

734
01:19:00,005 --> 01:19:03,022
WITH AS WELL. ANOTHER QUESTION 
OVER HERE?

735
01:19:11,391 --> 01:19:14,154
>> [ INDISCERNIBLE - QUESTION 
CANNOT BE HEARD ]

736
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:23,731
OPPS MEMBERS WHO DO HAVE AN IDEA
OF MY INTUITION CAN GET A 

737
01:19:23,932 --> 01:19:26,994
QUICKER DECISION THAN THIS NEW 
ATTACK FRAMEWORK. A LOT OF 

738
01:19:27,192 --> 01:19:31,993
TIMES, LIKE ALL MY DISCUSSION ON
TWITTER ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT 

739
01:19:32,779 --> 01:19:36,581
INTEL EVEN IMPACTS OPPS ON A 
DAY-TO-DAY BASIS VERSUS THE 

740
01:19:36,778 --> 01:19:39,690
LONG-TERM.
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. 

741
01:19:40,152 --> 01:19:42,930
QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU BRING 
THOSE SENIOR OPPS TYPES ON BOARD

742
01:19:43,215 --> 01:19:45,676
WHO THINK THEIR INTUITION AND 
GET THEM THE SAME PLACE? WHAT 

743
01:19:45,872 --> 01:19:49,842
DOES THAT MEAN FOR INCORPORATING
INTEL ON A DAILY BASIS? THE 

744
01:19:50,046 --> 01:19:52,401
FIRST POINT IS I THINK YOU 
ACTUALLY HAVE TO LEAN INTO THAT.

745
01:19:56,561 --> 01:19:58,851
A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
THAT OPINION ARE WELL REGARDED 

746
01:19:59,050 --> 01:20:01,112
WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION AND 
ACTUALLY DO KNOW A LOT ABOUT HOW

747
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:05,033
THINGS WORK THERE AND HOW THINGS
HAVEN'T WORKED IN THE PAST. 

748
01:20:05,228 --> 01:20:08,128
TRYING TO FREE THEM OUT OF THAT 
DISCUSSION I HAVE FOUND, 

749
01:20:08,333 --> 01:20:10,360
GENERALLY, TO BE NOT SUCCESSFUL.
WHAT I HAVE FOUND TO BE 

750
01:20:10,574 --> 01:20:13,603
SUCCESSFUL IS LEVERAGING THAT 
INSIGHT. THOSE ARE A REALLY GOOD

751
01:20:13,797 --> 01:20:16,089
THING THAT YOUR INTUITION 
MATCHES THIS PROCESS. CLEARLY, 

752
01:20:16,305 --> 01:20:21,717
YOU HAVE GOTTEN HERE FROM ALL 
THE KNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE A 

753
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:23,910
CHELATED FROM ALL OF THE 
DIFFERENT CRISES OVER THE YEARS.

754
01:20:24,498 --> 01:20:28,324
IF THIS WAS CREATING WILDLY 
DIFFERENT OUTCOMES MAYBE WE 

755
01:20:28,603 --> 01:20:31,422
SHOULD USING IT. USING THAT 
FRAME TO VALIDATE THE RESULTS OF

756
01:20:31,618 --> 01:20:35,572
THE PROCESS I THINK CAN BE VERY 
HELPFUL. ALSO, APPEALING TO THE 

757
01:20:35,763 --> 01:20:38,311
FACT THAT ONCE WE GET IT UP AND 
RUNNING IT PROBABLY MEANS YOU 

758
01:20:38,528 --> 01:20:43,711
CAN WORK, THAT LEVEL OF 
SELF-INTEREST I FIND COMPELLING 

759
01:20:43,918 --> 01:20:47,431
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. I THINK 
IT'S ALSO PART OF THE DISCUSSION

760
01:20:47,952 --> 01:20:51,386
ABOUT MENTORING OTHERS. AND SO 
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF 

761
01:20:51,856 --> 01:20:53,856
US STRUGGLE WITH WE HAVE THESE 
RELATIVELY

762
01:20:59,215 --> 01:21:01,215
SENIOR POSITIONS BECAUSE WE WERE
STRONG AS WHAT WE DID AS 

763
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:03,380
INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTORS. NOW 
THAT WE ARE BRINGING ON ALL OF 

764
01:21:03,409 --> 01:21:05,409
THESE NEW TEAM MEMBERS GROWING 
THEM AND ADAPTING THE PROCESS TO

765
01:21:05,593 --> 01:21:07,885
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE PEOPLE 
IS ACTUALLY A DIFFERENT SET OF 

766
01:21:08,073 --> 01:21:11,092
SKILLS. USING SOMETHING LIKE 
ATT&CK IS A WAY TO HELP THAT  IT

767
01:21:11,290 --> 01:21:15,981
MAY HELP IN THAT SITUATION. YOUR
QUESTION ON THE DAY TODAY AT HOW

768
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:20,863
INTEL AFFECTS OPPS LARGELY 
DEPENDS ON THAT FIRST CHOOSE 

769
01:21:21,067 --> 01:21:23,777
YOUR OWN ADVENTURE AND HOW YOU 
ARE SET UP FOR THAT 

770
01:21:23,971 --> 01:21:30,750
INTELLIGENCE. A LOT OF THAT IS 
STILL THE INDICATOR IN A MORE 

771
01:21:31,066 --> 01:21:33,262
MATURE ORGANIZATION, YOU ARE 
BUILDING A LOT OF THESE 

772
01:21:33,465 --> 01:21:37,553
SIGNATURE SPACE OFF OF WHAT IS 
COMING IN FROM INTEL AND THAT 

773
01:21:37,748 --> 01:21:40,661
ENABLES MUCH MORE OF THAT 
REAL-TIME DAILY IMPACT. A LOT OF

774
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:43,226
WORK WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERE 
IS MORE STRATEGIC IN NATURE. AT 

775
01:21:43,429 --> 01:21:48,285
LEAST NOT NECESSARILY IN THAT 
KNEE-JERK REACTION, BUT WE ARE 

776
01:21:48,490 --> 01:21:50,380
TRYING TO MAKE DELIBERATE 
DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT WORK IS 

777
01:21:50,381 --> 01:21:55,550
IMPORTANT AND HOW WE PRIORITIZE 
IT. ANOTHER HAND OVER HERE.

778
01:22:04,971 --> 01:22:12,532
>> ONE OF THE ORIGINAL SLIDES, 
THE WAY THAT WE ARE DESCRIBING 

779
01:22:13,423 --> 01:22:22,655
MITRE  MENTIONED HOW INTEL, 
COULD WE BE ACTUALLY USING THE 

780
01:22:23,419 --> 01:22:25,419
WRONG WORDS HERE?

781
01:22:28,419 --> 01:22:37,781
INTEL OR FORENSIC ANALYST, ARE 
WE USING THE WRONG LANGUAGE? IN 

782
01:22:38,099 --> 01:22:42,243
THE END THEY ARE DIAGNOSTIC 
GROUP. [ INDISCERNIBLE ]

783
01:22:46,255 --> 01:22:49,786
CALLING THEM AND UNTIL PERSON 
WITH CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES 

784
01:22:50,452 --> 01:22:55,830
AND CERTAIN ROLES ANYWAY, COULD 
WE BE ACTUALLY CALLING IT RUN?

785
01:22:59,064 --> 01:23:01,450
>> YEAH. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
IN SOME CASES, YES. I THINK 

786
01:23:01,656 --> 01:23:03,656
THERE IS A LOT OF OVERLAP 
BETWEEN INVESTIGATIVE WORK AND 

787
01:23:03,695 --> 01:23:07,014
INTEL. THAT'S A GOOD THING. THE 
QUESTION I THINK WHERE WE START 

788
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:12,201
TO GET POTENTIALLY TANGLED UP IS
HOW GENERALIZABLE AND 

789
01:23:12,427 --> 01:23:15,692
FORWARD-LOOKING THOSE FINDINGS 
CAN BE. THE GOOD INTEL TEAMS

790
01:23:19,841 --> 01:23:22,099
PUT A LOT OF EFFORT IN MAKING 
SURE THEY ARE CROSSING INTO 

791
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:24,161
PROVIDING SOMETHING THAT IS MORE
FORWARD-LOOKING. WHAT MAY BE 

792
01:23:24,162 --> 01:23:26,934
FORWARD LOOKING TO ME AS AND 
UNTIL PERSON MAY NOT BE 

793
01:23:27,155 --> 01:23:30,929
SUFFICIENTLY STABLE FOR MY OPPS 
TEAM. THAT'S A GOOD POINT. I 

794
01:23:31,133 --> 01:23:34,385
THINK IT'S SOMETHING TO THINK 
ABOUT AS WE LOOK AT HOW AND 

795
01:23:34,584 --> 01:23:39,357
INTEL TEAM PRODUCES AND HOW THEY
INTERACT ARE THE ACTING TOO MUCH

796
01:23:39,553 --> 01:23:44,102
LIKE INVESTIGATORS AND NOT BEING
FORWARD ENOUGH THINKING? A HAND 

797
01:23:44,825 --> 01:23:46,825
IN THE BACK?

798
01:23:49,371 --> 01:23:51,725
>> GETTING TO THE POINT OF 
OPERATIONS PERSONNEL THAT 

799
01:23:51,949 --> 01:23:56,061
TYPICALLY MOVE FROM INTEGRATION 
HAVE YOU SEEN THINGS LIKE THE 

800
01:23:56,252 --> 01:23:58,906
ATTACK FRAMEWORK ENABLING 
DEFENDERS TO TAKE A MORE 

801
01:23:59,116 --> 01:24:03,319
SCIENTIFIC SYSTEMATIC APPROACH 
TO DOING DEFENSE WHERE THEY DID 

802
01:24:04,031 --> 01:24:07,654
HAVE SOMETHING FORMALLY?
>> ABSOLUTELY. I THINK THAT IS A

803
01:24:07,874 --> 01:24:11,175
BIG PART OF WHY THIS HAS BEEN 
SUCCESSFUL. THAT'S WHY YOU ALSO 

804
01:24:11,445 --> 01:24:13,492
SEE THE PRESSURE MORE COMING 
FROM THOSE SENIOR AWFULLY BOSSES

805
01:24:14,044 --> 01:24:17,521
. RIGHT? TOO MUCH OF MY 
ORGANIZATIONAL KNOWLEDGE IS 

806
01:24:17,715 --> 01:24:21,271
LOCKED IN AHEAD OF THIS ONE 
PERSON AND I HAVE TO EXTERNALIZE

807
01:24:21,554 --> 01:24:23,592
THAT AND MAKE THAT PROCESS 
REPEATABLE. THAT IS A CHALLENGE.

808
01:24:23,776 --> 01:24:25,776
RIGHT?

809
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:29,660
AGAIN, THAT'S THE EGO AND THE 
EXPERIENCE AND THE SCAR TISSUE 

810
01:24:29,809 --> 01:24:32,710
WE HAVE ACQUIRED BY WORKING THIS
WAY WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO 

811
01:24:32,894 --> 01:24:35,660
BRING THE WHOLE TEAM TOGETHER. 
THAT IS DIFFICULT TO DO

812
01:24:40,628 --> 01:24:42,259
IF TOO MUCH OF THAT 
INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE IS 

813
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:44,260
LOCKED INSIDE ONE PERSONS HEAD 
BUT ALSO LEAVE THE ORGANIZATION 

814
01:24:44,269 --> 01:24:46,269
EXTREMELY FRAGILE WHEN THAT 
PERSON DECIDES TO LEAVE. THIS IS

815
01:24:46,276 --> 01:24:49,941
ONE BIG CHALLENGES WE SAW A LOT 
ON INTEL TEAM, TOO MUCH OF THE 

816
01:24:50,450 --> 01:24:52,968
INSTITUTIONAL COLLEGE EXPERTISE 
LOCKED IN THE PERSONS HEAD AND 

817
01:24:53,173 --> 01:24:55,666
IN AN INDUSTRY WITH A HUGE 
AMOUNT OF TURNOVER YOU CAN 

818
01:24:55,856 --> 01:24:58,611
ACTUALLY SEE THE ENTIRE PROGRAM 
TAKE LIKE THREE STEPS BACK WHEN 

819
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:02,684
THAT ONE PERSON LEFT BUT THAT'S 
A BIG PART OF WHY ATT&CK IS SO 

820
01:25:02,925 --> 01:25:07,755
COMPELLING,  IT GETS THAT OUT OF
THE PERSONS HEAD AND EMBEDS IT 

821
01:25:07,950 --> 01:25:09,950
MORE IN THE ORGANIZATION.

ANOTHER THING WE PULLED OUT FROM

THAT MITRE TECH TO POINT OUT

01:26:34,842 --> 01:26:39,459
TEAMMATE LIKE FROM, WHO ALMOST 
NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION, BUT I'LL 

839
01:26:39,641 --> 01:26:41,946
INTRODUCE HIM ANYWAY. HE IS THE 
ATT&CK  LEAD, ONE OF THE 

840
01:26:42,146 --> 01:26:45,477
ORIGINAL CO-CREATORS OF ATT&CK 
MANY YEARS AGO  AND HAS BEEN THE

841
01:26:45,674 --> 01:26:51,226
LEADING EFFORT EVER SINCE. HE IS
ALSO OUR CAPABILITY ADVERSARY 

842
01:26:51,416 --> 01:26:55,496
LEAD FOR IMMOLATION. HE HAS BEEN
CORE ON THE ATTACK EVALUATIONS 

843
01:26:55,694 --> 01:26:58,365
EFFORT. SOMETIMES IN HIS SPARE 
TIME, MOMENTS HE GETS,

844
01:27:03,122 --> 01:27:09,105
HE DOES THINGS WITH HIS TWITTER 
HANDLE, STRONG COFFEE. HOW FAR 

845
01:27:09,298 --> 01:27:11,727
WE HAVE COME AND REALLY WHERE WE
ARE GOING. PLEASE JOIN ME IN 

846
01:27:11,907 --> 01:27:13,907
WELCOMING BLAKE STROM.

847
01:27:20,941 --> 01:27:24,879
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, KATIE. 
ATT&CK CON IS A SPECIAL TIME FOR

848
01:27:25,069 --> 01:27:28,180
US. EVEN THOUGH WE GO OUT TO 
CONFERENCES TALKING TO PEOPLE

849
01:27:35,941 --> 01:27:39,129
. 
>> AS KATIE MENTIONED. IT'S HARD

850
01:27:39,364 --> 01:27:41,681
TO UNDERSTAND HOW FAR WE HAVE 
COME. WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING 

851
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:47,939
WHERE WE STARTED. THIS IS THE 
VERY FIRST VERSION OF ATT&CK. 

852
01:28:19,739 --> 01:28:22,784
>> This came out internally, 
this hasn't seen the light of 

853
01:28:22,984 --> 01:28:27,253
day before, early on in 2013, 
the project had been going on 

854
01:28:27,454 --> 01:28:29,690
for about six months at the 
time, we were using it 

855
01:28:29,891 --> 01:28:34,974
internally to figure out, okay, 
these are the techniques, these 

856
01:28:35,176 --> 01:28:38,625
are the coverages against it, 
there are a lot of things that 

857
01:28:39,388 --> 01:28:45,327
pop out in this, there's only 
eight tactics, there's no 

858
01:28:45,527 --> 01:28:49,958
execution tactic, there is no 
collection, there is only four 

859
01:28:50,110 --> 01:28:55,375
techniques in credential access,
and if I remember correctly,

860
01:29:00,970 --> 01:29:02,970
the weakness was the first 
version of the technique. There 

861
01:29:03,003 --> 01:29:06,452
is a lot of benefits, you can 
say, we only need to cover 64 

862
01:29:06,654 --> 01:29:11,335
techniques, I can get this done 
in a couple months. You can fit 

863
01:29:11,536 --> 01:29:14,066
the matrix on one slide and 
still read the technique named

864
01:29:17,823 --> 01:29:20,473
. It is a lot easier to believe 
vendors when they come and say 

865
01:29:20,672 --> 01:29:23,108
to you, we've got 100% coverage 
of the attack. As we know, the 

866
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:26,360
space isn't quite this simple 
and the attack had to evolve 

867
01:29:27,121 --> 01:29:33,261
over time. Here is where we are 
today, we have 266 techniques in

868
01:29:33,474 --> 01:29:37,326
the enterprise matrix but we 
didn't stop there, enterprise 

869
01:29:38,076 --> 01:29:42,693
now covers Mac and in addition 
to Windows

870
01:29:45,865 --> 01:29:47,865
. We also have pre-

871
01:29:53,935 --> 01:29:59,014
tran01 and we also extended to 
mobile ATT&CK, we have about  93

872
01:29:59,170 --> 01:30:09,016
groups, and 1971 technical 
references that span 

873
01:30:09,217 --> 01:30:11,606
technical best practices, 
information about how technique 

874
01:30:11,742 --> 01:30:17,339
works which has been an 
incredible corpus of 

875
01:30:17,553 --> 01:30:22,421
information, but it extends 
beyond this, too. It is not just

876
01:30:22,622 --> 01:30:26,888
a knowledge base, there is a 
sister project, cyber analytics 

877
01:30:27,089 --> 01:30:28,721
repository that I'm sure 
everybody is familiar with. 

878
01:30:28,722 --> 01:30:30,722
There is ATT&CK  based's

879
01:30:34,409 --> 01:30:44,366
SOC assessments , there is 
ATT&CK  for ICS, there is ATT&CK

880
01:30:44,568 --> 01:30:46,568
evaluations where we are 
providing  protective insights 

881
01:30:47,152 --> 01:30:51,769
to help insiders on doing good 
start behavior, and there is the

882
01:30:55,738 --> 01:30:57,975
ATT&CK ecosystem that we started
this year, so we can get better 

883
01:30:58,173 --> 01:31:00,965
statistics  to provide better 
trending data.

884
01:31:05,896 --> 01:31:08,933
It has come a long way, not only
as a knowledge base but an idea 

885
01:31:09,148 --> 01:31:14,222
for defense in multiple ways. We
didn't get here by accident, 

886
01:31:14,622 --> 01:31:20,106
ATT&CK was a deliberate effort  
to track and maintain the 

887
01:31:20,319 --> 01:31:24,575
knowledgebase, and there are a 
lot of things that contributed 

888
01:31:24,990 --> 01:31:27,425
to this over the last 6 years, 
there has been a lot of 

889
01:31:27,626 --> 01:31:31,077
innovation and sensing endpoint 
systems, sensing network 

890
01:31:31,278 --> 01:31:33,812
activity to better identify 
these threats, there is a lot of

891
01:31:44,231 --> 01:31:54,027
activity, and I think the 
realization that the IC 

892
01:31:54,443 --> 01:31:58,389
wasn't enough, should help more 
robustly

893
01:32:01,546 --> 01:32:03,546
, and because of this 
visibility,

894
01:32:06,830 --> 01:32:09,065
people are seeing a lot more 
activity, there are a lot more 

895
01:32:09,266 --> 01:32:11,299
reporting out there and it is 
coupled with the lower barrier 

896
01:32:12,061 --> 01:32:14,835
of entry for adversaries to get 
because there are more tools

897
01:32:18,403 --> 01:32:20,637
to get available, there's a lot 
more activity to see, there's a 

898
01:32:20,851 --> 01:32:23,284
lot more reports than we can 
even handle but this is a very 

899
01:32:23,485 --> 01:32:25,918
good problem to have because 
people are willing to report out

900
01:32:26,686 --> 01:32:31,201
this information. And the next 
point is, we can't see 

901
01:32:31,402 --> 01:32:36,684
everything, we don't see 
everything as the ATT&CK team so

902
01:32:36,899 --> 01:32:38,899
we rely on the community 

903
01:32:47,045 --> 01:32:49,279
to tell us what adversaries are 
doing today and this reminds me 

904
01:32:49,493 --> 01:32:52,466
of a conversation I had about a 
month and a half ago when 

905
01:32:52,616 --> 01:32:55,582
somebody leads a team or 
healthcare organization, he was 

906
01:32:55,782 --> 01:33:01,670
able to get by in his leadership
to share information with us 

907
01:33:01,871 --> 01:33:03,906
because the vendor space in our 
community looks at ATT&CK and 

908
01:33:04,117 --> 01:33:06,550
builds their products  around it
because it helps them get the 

909
01:33:06,751 --> 01:33:11,220
tools they need in order to 
respond to threats better, many 

910
01:33:11,621 --> 01:33:15,637
even beyond that, he says it 
helps other peers in his 

911
01:33:15,798 --> 01:33:22,192
industry because they are paying
attention so they are better 

912
01:33:22,393 --> 01:33:25,029
able to respond to incidents 
which is awesome, this is why we

913
01:33:25,243 --> 01:33:33,361
are doing ATT&CK . So, to dive 
in some of the numbers for 

914
01:33:33,599 --> 01:33:39,048
updates this year, we have one 
new tactic, we have 43 new 

915
01:33:39,248 --> 01:33:42,500
techniques for enterprise, 13 
for mobile, 16 new groups and 87

916
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,700
new software entries

917
01:33:46,768 --> 01:33:49,201
. We got 41 new medications for 
enterprise, 87 updated 

918
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:58,140
techniques, 16 updated 
techniques and 92 updated 

919
01:33:58,341 --> 01:34:01,393
software entries, you saw the 
team that was appear today. It 

920
01:34:01,593 --> 01:34:06,473
is a lot of work to maintain 
ATT&CK and all the other 

921
01:34:06,675 --> 01:34:12,161
projects that have been built  
around ATT&CK and MITRE, I'm 

922
01:34:12,361 --> 01:34:14,796
just amazed at the level of 
effort and work  that we are 

923
01:34:14,997 --> 01:34:20,289
able to do on this to improve it
over time. And you heard Katie, 

924
01:34:20,484 --> 01:34:22,726
we all work on different jobs, I
don't think there's any single 

925
01:34:22,924 --> 01:34:25,356
person that works on ATT&CK full
time, we are looking at  reports

926
01:34:25,571 --> 01:34:31,255
for other projects, we are doing
threat analysis and this helps 

927
01:34:31,657 --> 01:34:34,508
to keep our skills sharp so we 
can maintain ATT&CK in the right

928
01:34:34,708 --> 01:34:36,708
way for the community. 

929
01:34:40,759 --> 01:34:50,750
So, if you saw Dave Harold and 
Ryan Kovar's talk, they 

930
01:34:50,951 --> 01:34:54,403
get a very good talk to help 
test your analytics but towards 

931
01:34:54,618 --> 01:35:00,505
the end of the presentation, 
they were talking about the lack

932
01:35:00,706 --> 01:35:06,194
of cloud coverage in ATT&CK, it 
really wasn't that much, it was 

933
01:35:06,395 --> 01:35:13,500
just to answer questions about  
what we were doing, how we might

934
01:35:13,701 --> 01:35:15,701
approach it, so basically

935
01:35:19,187 --> 01:35:21,187
the very early planning phases, 
we were able to redirect 

936
01:35:21,222 --> 01:35:23,255
resources to this effort because
there was such a high demand. 

937
01:35:23,462 --> 01:35:28,480
And I'm happy to say, if this 
clicker will work, as of last 

938
01:35:28,629 --> 01:35:31,934
week we released the first 
version of ATT&CK  cloud.

939
01:35:39,301 --> 01:35:43,772
And, we realized this was just a
drop in the bucket, there's 36 

940
01:35:43,972 --> 01:35:46,005
techniques that we have, this 
problem is a lot bigger than 

941
01:35:46,764 --> 01:35:50,471
just maybe six techniques, we 
know this, we talked to a lot of

942
01:35:50,672 --> 01:35:53,521
organizations to help build this
and to make sure we are defining

943
01:35:53,722 --> 01:35:56,561
it in the right way. A lot of 
them have said that a lot of 

944
01:35:56,975 --> 01:35:59,506
people think cloud is just an 
extension of the enterprise 

945
01:36:00,172 --> 01:36:05,700
matrix, so that is how we built 
it. And of the organizations 

946
01:36:05,915 --> 01:36:09,314
that we talked to, we have 
received well over 100 different

947
01:36:09,491 --> 01:36:11,491
technique

948
01:36:13,219 --> 01:36:17,085
contribution ideas, so we had to
prioritize those based on 

949
01:36:17,285 --> 01:36:21,351
similarities, based on what we 
could find throughout the 

950
01:36:21,552 --> 01:36:23,552
reporting that says that these 
are use

951
01:36:29,272 --> 01:36:31,506
and some organizations were able
to say, yes, we have seen this 

952
01:36:31,707 --> 01:36:35,976
even though it was reported. 
That is huge, I'm happy to say 

953
01:36:36,176 --> 01:36:39,827
that this is the first extension
of ATT&CK  where we have had 

954
01:36:40,028 --> 01:36:42,475
almost 100% community 
contributions and this is how it

955
01:36:42,679 --> 01:36:47,545
is going to grow longer-term, 
this is amazing. So, as far as 

956
01:36:48,295 --> 01:36:52,626
coverage goes, ATT&CK for cloud 
cover's  infrastructure as a 

957
01:36:52,827 --> 01:36:58,727
service, we've got the providers
there, azure, AWS, Google cloud,

958
01:36:59,129 --> 01:37:04,153
we have a platform tack for 
software techniques and we have 

959
01:37:04,303 --> 01:37:09,488
specific platforms for office 
365 and azure active directory 

960
01:37:09,685 --> 01:37:13,297
to cover specific techniques for
the software platforms.

961
01:37:18,019 --> 01:37:21,669
So, the biggest challenge in 
building ATT&CK for cloud and 

962
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:26,049
seem  some of the other

963
01:37:30,608 --> 01:37:32,642
efforts, there isn't a lot of 
reporting out there, we know 

964
01:37:32,844 --> 01:37:34,844
things are happening but they 
just aren't reported quite yet. 

965
01:37:34,877 --> 01:37:37,672
There are some notable incidents
for cloud like the DNC hack, we 

966
01:37:37,818 --> 01:37:43,208
were discovering DOJ indictments
for information on this, Sully 

967
01:37:43,968 --> 01:37:45,968
consider this

968
01:37:49,295 --> 01:37:51,295
to help us bolster the community
knowledge about what adversaries

969
01:37:51,327 --> 01:37:54,330
are doing in this space. We 
really needed to build this out 

970
01:37:54,489 --> 01:37:56,489
further

971
01:38:01,081 --> 01:38:04,132
. So if you are in a position to
share with us what is going on 

972
01:38:04,333 --> 01:38:06,366
or influence reporting to what 
gets out to the public, please 

973
01:38:07,122 --> 01:38:15,507
do so. Another big change this 
year, in April we released the 

974
01:38:15,908 --> 01:38:21,395
informed tactic, before April, 
it was concentrated on data 

975
01:38:21,596 --> 01:38:24,446
infiltration, so theft 
infiltration, and renew 

976
01:38:25,406 --> 01:38:29,517
destructive attacks were big, we
did a lot of work utilizing 

977
01:38:30,279 --> 01:38:32,279
incidents of

978
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:38,580
pictures

979
01:38:43,333 --> 01:38:45,568
in ransomware, this was a big 
problem for people and we wanted

980
01:38:45,770 --> 01:38:48,003
to make sure we covered it in 
ATT&CK, there were 14 techniques

981
01:38:48,405 --> 01:38:53,487
published and we added to last 
week for system shutdown reboot 

982
01:38:53,689 --> 01:38:59,375
and account access removal. 
Another big change this year was

983
01:38:59,576 --> 01:39:04,045
more of a structural change, so 
we did a revamp of medications 

984
01:39:04,246 --> 01:39:11,165
and enterprise, so it acts very 
similar to how medications are 

985
01:39:11,366 --> 01:39:13,490
described in mobile, they are 
treated as objects similar

986
01:39:17,859 --> 01:39:19,859
to software, we can have a 
definition for the mitigation 

987
01:39:19,896 --> 01:39:21,896
idea and we can describe how 
that medication applies to 

988
01:39:21,927 --> 01:39:23,927
individual techniques through 
the relationships between them.

989
01:39:28,218 --> 01:39:30,251
How we built this, we basically 
went through the existing text 

990
01:39:30,451 --> 01:39:32,840
field entries and scoured them 
pretty much to create these 

991
01:39:32,988 --> 01:39:36,685
categories. And it is really 
helpful for doing what if 

992
01:39:36,828 --> 01:39:40,819
analysis, so what is the 
coverage of a potential 

993
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:45,488
medication you wanted to play 
against the techniques, which is

994
01:39:45,688 --> 01:39:48,676
a very powerful thing to do that
you couldn't do before the prior

995
01:39:48,981 --> 01:39:53,137
text field entries because 
attack grew quite a bit over 

996
01:39:53,301 --> 01:39:57,070
time, different things are 
described in different ways by 

997
01:39:57,271 --> 01:40:01,441
different people, so this was 
our way of describing

998
01:40:04,991 --> 01:40:08,445
the medications. Let's talk 
about some issues with ATT&CK.  

999
01:40:08,846 --> 01:40:13,928
Anybody who has used ATT&CK  for
a little bit knows that the 

1000
01:40:14,130 --> 01:40:16,166
techniques are a little bit 
uneven, this was a common theme 

1001
01:40:16,929 --> 01:40:18,929
last year

1002
01:40:20,835 --> 01:40:22,868
because some techniques are very
broad, some are even broader but

1003
01:40:23,069 --> 01:40:26,721
these have some definition in 
them so there's multiple ways to

1004
01:40:26,922 --> 01:40:30,106
do techniques that aren't really
defined well. Some are very 

1005
01:40:30,259 --> 01:40:34,643
narrow, so specifically, to 
execute something or bypass a 

1006
01:40:35,404 --> 01:40:41,961
certain mechanism, they may be 
too narrow to be a technique. 

1007
01:40:42,362 --> 01:40:46,630
You saw the first version 
earlier in the presentation, we 

1008
01:40:46,830 --> 01:40:51,913
were just trying to describe 
activity in a way that people 

1009
01:40:52,114 --> 01:40:54,950
would pay attention to and we 
weren't really worried about 

1010
01:40:55,366 --> 01:40:58,618
obstruction at the time, so this
only magnified the problem as 

1011
01:40:59,019 --> 01:41:01,253
ATT&CK has grown and it is 
really hard to strike the right 

1012
01:41:01,453 --> 01:41:06,534
balance  for where to put a 
specific Peter piece of activity

1013
01:41:06,734 --> 01:41:11,965
or analytic or some Intel, or 
even where to put a new 

1014
01:41:12,113 --> 01:41:14,113
technique

1015
01:41:18,926 --> 01:41:21,164
or new information somebody 
sends us and it is kind of hard,

1016
01:41:21,365 --> 01:41:23,398
if anyone has seen this horrible
gradient puzzles where all the 

1017
01:41:23,599 --> 01:41:25,832
pieces are almost identical and 
the same color, trying to group 

1018
01:41:26,033 --> 01:41:27,865
them all together by 
similarities, it becomes a real 

1019
01:41:27,866 --> 01:41:32,535
challenge to build this puzzle 
and one really good example is 

1020
01:41:32,937 --> 01:41:35,327
when we were building cloud, we 
had several contributions for 

1021
01:41:35,473 --> 01:41:40,052
spearfishing, nobody disagrees 
that this should be in attack, 

1022
01:41:40,252 --> 01:41:44,654
it should be an activity because
it has been reported by several 

1023
01:41:44,793 --> 01:41:46,793
groups.

1024
01:41:48,788 --> 01:41:51,501
But, this was spearfishing so it
should be put in initial access,

1025
01:41:56,707 --> 01:41:58,707
and the writeups we got were 
very detailed, there were 

1026
01:41:58,742 --> 01:42:00,778
activities and when we start 
peeling away the layers, it was 

1027
01:42:00,976 --> 01:42:03,210
very clear there were multiple 
different steps so yes, the 

1028
01:42:03,411 --> 01:42:05,411
spearfishing is coming in, we 
could cover that by spearfishing

1029
01:42:05,446 --> 01:42:07,879
with the link. So the user 
clicks on it, they were 

1030
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:10,832
presented with the malicious 
application,

1031
01:42:16,203 --> 01:42:18,437
so the user has to click on 
that, that is credential access 

1032
01:42:18,638 --> 01:42:20,671
and there is another step beyond
that where the adversary is 

1033
01:42:20,872 --> 01:42:25,342
using the authorization token to
access the resource and pull the

1034
01:42:25,555 --> 01:42:27,778
email or information from the 
users account which is use of 

1035
01:42:27,992 --> 01:42:31,244
that token, so even though 
attack how it is is hard to 

1036
01:42:31,445 --> 01:42:33,465
figure out exactly where 
something should go, there's a 

1037
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:38,750
lot of power and flexibility to 
pull apart activity and make 

1038
01:42:39,366 --> 01:42:41,889
sure you fit the right pieces in
the right places.

1039
01:42:46,073 --> 01:42:51,552
So, our fix to this is sub 
techniques. It is important to 

1040
01:42:52,312 --> 01:42:57,131
note that they are just 
behaviors. You can consider them

1041
01:43:00,077 --> 01:43:02,077
groups of behaviors, some 
techniques are still just 

1042
01:43:02,208 --> 01:43:04,208
behaviors.

1043
01:43:07,184 --> 01:43:09,633
It is also important that we are
basically using what we have, we

1044
01:43:09,833 --> 01:43:12,067
are not adding a lot of new 
information to this, it is 

1045
01:43:12,269 --> 01:43:14,423
basically a factoring of what is
already in there.

1046
01:43:18,571 --> 01:43:20,571
Credential dimming is a good 
example, those medium to high 

1047
01:43:20,593 --> 01:43:22,626
level techniques that have a lot
of definition in them already 

1048
01:43:22,827 --> 01:43:25,622
that we are turning into sub 
techniques so this isn't a huge 

1049
01:43:25,777 --> 01:43:28,117
change, it is structurally but 
the information is going to be 

1050
01:43:28,315 --> 01:43:30,315
the chained same

1051
01:43:36,852 --> 01:43:39,085
in ATT&CK. And because it is 
used for a lot of defensive 

1052
01:43:39,288 --> 01:43:44,356
purposes, it is natural to think
about how sub techniques are  

1053
01:43:44,772 --> 01:43:46,772
defender focused in mind, to 
group techniques based on the 

1054
01:43:46,804 --> 01:43:48,804
data sources you can use to 
collect activity or the 

1055
01:43:48,826 --> 01:43:50,859
medications you can use to 
prevent them. And we tried that 

1056
01:43:51,059 --> 01:43:54,726
and it didn't work, 
unfortunately. We decided to 

1057
01:43:54,927 --> 01:43:57,697
maintain the adversary mindset. 
Because

1058
01:44:01,628 --> 01:44:04,066
it is a more logical grouping of
what the adversary is trying to 

1059
01:44:04,267 --> 01:44:09,952
accomplish and why and how it is
also good to think about sub 

1060
01:44:10,154 --> 01:44:12,543
techniques as platforms for 
specific techniques, so we can 

1061
01:44:12,682 --> 01:44:17,268
describe activity at a high 
level and get into the details 

1062
01:44:17,469 --> 01:44:19,504
about how that activity applies 
to a specific platform at the 

1063
01:44:20,262 --> 01:44:22,262
sub technique

1064
01:44:23,969 --> 01:44:26,559
level. Unfortunately this isn't 
a universal thing we can apply a

1065
01:44:26,714 --> 01:44:31,490
process across the board, we are
going to have to find different 

1066
01:44:31,692 --> 01:44:36,976
mechanisms of broken breaking 
those out. After different 

1067
01:44:37,176 --> 01:44:38,995
goals, they require different 
actions that are done different 

1068
01:44:38,996 --> 01:44:42,246
ways and there is no one 
universal way to break out of a 

1069
01:44:42,997 --> 01:44:44,997
sub technique.

1070
01:44:47,128 --> 01:44:51,197
We have done a ton of work this 
year to figure out the right way

1071
01:44:51,398 --> 01:44:55,612
to either break out sub 
techniques from existing 

1072
01:44:55,759 --> 01:45:00,277
techniques, very narrow 
techniques under technique 

1073
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:07,644
groupings. So far we are going 
to likely be dropping the number

1074
01:45:08,407 --> 01:45:17,801
of techniques down to 166 from 
266. Which is a pretty 

1075
01:45:18,561 --> 01:45:25,924
big reduction. We have 
identified 280 sub techniques. 

1076
01:45:26,327 --> 01:45:28,561
And we are implementing this 
right now, we had to wait until 

1077
01:45:28,762 --> 01:45:31,410
the October update to do a clean
break and we are going to be 

1078
01:45:31,611 --> 01:45:35,264
pausing technique updates for 
right now. You are free to send 

1079
01:45:35,465 --> 01:45:38,831
us your information, we will 
keep tracking it in the internal

1080
01:45:42,383 --> 01:45:44,403
tracking system but for right 
now, don't send us groups in 

1081
01:45:45,155 --> 01:45:47,155
software because

1082
01:45:48,878 --> 01:45:51,107
it is going to change and we 
have to wait until sub 

1083
01:45:51,322 --> 01:45:53,757
techniques is done in order to 
do that. To talk a little bit 

1084
01:45:53,957 --> 01:45:55,957
about how we are going to 
implement this, when sub 

1085
01:45:55,992 --> 01:45:59,244
techniques rules out, it won't 
be the de facto production of 

1086
01:45:59,444 --> 01:46:02,171
attack, we are going to be 
cloning the attack site

1087
01:46:05,744 --> 01:46:07,977
and putting it in some other 
location as a preview to give 

1088
01:46:08,177 --> 01:46:10,177
people enough time to digest

1089
01:46:13,249 --> 01:46:15,280
the information and plan how 
they are going to implement this

1090
01:46:15,482 --> 01:46:18,132
because it is a big change and 
we want to be sensitive to that 

1091
01:46:18,332 --> 01:46:20,970
and how much effort it is going 
to be to redo the tools and 

1092
01:46:21,171 --> 01:46:23,618
mappings and things like that. 
So in case nobody has tried the 

1093
01:46:23,818 --> 01:46:25,818
sub techniques before or hasn't

1094
01:46:28,889 --> 01:46:31,940
read the blog post before, this 
is one example of credential 

1095
01:46:32,141 --> 01:46:36,813
access, you can see the old view
on the left, just the credential

1096
01:46:37,015 --> 01:46:39,665
access tactic with the 
individual techniques after that

1097
01:46:39,866 --> 01:46:43,719
and on the right is the 
potential breakout of that, if 

1098
01:46:43,919 --> 01:46:46,153
you look at the dumping 
technique, there is a lot that 

1099
01:46:46,368 --> 01:46:52,457
is already defined in ways to do
that in the description. We will

1100
01:46:52,658 --> 01:46:56,111
be breaking that out and ways to
do credential dumping for 

1101
01:46:56,311 --> 01:47:02,612
Windows against the security 
accounts manager or the security

1102
01:47:02,814 --> 01:47:11,753
dumping or things like that. So 
it'll be .001 or .002 for these,

1103
01:47:11,953 --> 01:47:14,389
they will be directly tied to 
that technique. Talking about a 

1104
01:47:15,139 --> 01:47:17,139
blog post that we put out the

1105
01:47:21,293 --> 01:47:23,540
main reason we do that was to 
get some feedback from the 

1106
01:47:23,742 --> 01:47:25,742
community and make sure we are 
on the right track. 

1107
01:47:25,773 --> 01:47:29,426
Overwhelmingly, people feel this
is very necessary for attack and

1108
01:47:29,627 --> 01:47:32,063
even given the amount of work 
that is going to be to implement

1109
01:47:32,263 --> 01:47:36,947
it, it'll be worth it 
longer-term, so that was great 

1110
01:47:37,148 --> 01:47:39,170
to hear. People also took the 
opportunity to provide some more

1111
01:47:39,384 --> 01:47:43,794
feedback, so one of the biggest 
questions we can't are these 

1112
01:47:43,938 --> 01:47:45,938
procedures.

1113
01:47:51,154 --> 01:47:52,787
Procedures have very specific 
definition in ATT&CK, especially

1114
01:47:52,788 --> 01:47:55,021
when you go and look at the 
technique pages, there is that 

1115
01:47:55,222 --> 01:47:57,253
box  that has the groups and 
software examples that are 

1116
01:47:57,453 --> 01:48:01,319
tagged and that is where we 
consider the procedures, we took

1117
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:04,153
that feedback and updated the 
name of the box to help that, 

1118
01:48:04,368 --> 01:48:07,618
but even broader than that, 
procedures relate to how 

1119
01:48:07,819 --> 01:48:11,067
specific adversaries are going 
about their operations, so it is

1120
01:48:11,268 --> 01:48:13,268
hard to capture that in

1121
01:48:16,149 --> 01:48:17,766
ATT&CK without describing how 
the adversaries are moving 

1122
01:48:17,767 --> 01:48:21,219
between techniques or how they 
piece things together . A few 

1123
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:23,420
people noted that there are 
still going to be visualization 

1124
01:48:23,452 --> 01:48:26,916
challenges with sub techniques 
and even though we are shrinking

1125
01:48:27,116 --> 01:48:30,768
the matrix of the technical 
level quite a bit, we are going 

1126
01:48:30,969 --> 01:48:35,850
to make that the default view, 
we want to have some 

1127
01:48:36,052 --> 01:48:37,882
functionality so people can 
expand the techniques to show 

1128
01:48:37,883 --> 01:48:40,518
those sub techniques and the 
version that we posted in the 

1129
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:47,489
blog post shows the horizontal 
breakout, if you click on too 

1130
01:48:47,638 --> 01:48:50,269
many things it is going to 
expand out but we also have a 

1131
01:48:50,470 --> 01:48:53,119
vertical breakout example. I 
will likely put out more 

1132
01:48:53,319 --> 01:48:55,319
information to have some 
community

1133
01:49:01,237 --> 01:49:03,269
input and have both versions 
available so they can use what 

1134
01:49:03,468 --> 01:49:05,505
they like best. A few people 
noted that there is the 

1135
01:49:05,702 --> 01:49:07,853
potential for issues from having
an individual sub technique

1136
01:49:12,619 --> 01:49:14,637
mapping to multiple techniques. 
We are trying to avoid this at 

1137
01:49:14,851 --> 01:49:17,486
all costs. So don't worry, we 
got this. And then, another big 

1138
01:49:17,687 --> 01:49:23,586
challenge, people identified, 
having the tools available to 

1139
01:49:23,787 --> 01:49:28,858
map from the old version of 
ATT&CK  to new. We have the 

1140
01:49:29,059 --> 01:49:33,328
spreadsheets, we are looking 
into ways of doing a 

1141
01:49:33,528 --> 01:49:35,528
machine-readable version and we 
are going to be taking advantage

1142
01:49:35,563 --> 01:49:37,563
of the sticks

1143
01:49:42,262 --> 01:49:44,262
functionality, where we can have
it revoked by its placement 

1144
01:49:44,295 --> 01:49:48,975
which can be a sub technique, so
there will be that pointer in 

1145
01:49:49,176 --> 01:49:51,411
the data. A few people noted 
that this is a good opportunity 

1146
01:49:51,611 --> 01:49:55,675
to do data source refinement, 
and that is 5 years old so we 

1147
01:49:55,877 --> 01:50:00,143
know this is a problem so we 
can't get it done during sub 

1148
01:50:00,344 --> 01:50:02,577
techniques, so we are going to 
be doing that after this gets 

1149
01:50:02,791 --> 01:50:10,454
released. People noted that it 
should be OS agnostic, and we 

1150
01:50:10,603 --> 01:50:14,359
agreed, there is different 
criteria for breaking down sub 

1151
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:19,442
techniques per tactic. People 
noted that techniques should 

1152
01:50:19,643 --> 01:50:24,112
always have sub techniques 
again, sort of, this something 

1153
01:50:24,313 --> 01:50:29,798
to shoot for we are not going to
force decomposition or grilling 

1154
01:50:29,998 --> 01:50:34,477
something into a sub technique 
if it doesn't make sense. Part 

1155
01:50:34,678 --> 01:50:39,144
of the awesomeness of ATT&CK is 
the flexibility so we want to 

1156
01:50:39,903 --> 01:50:41,903
maintain that.

1157
01:50:45,030 --> 01:50:46,862
And sub techniques should be 
specific, I already covered 

1158
01:50:46,863 --> 01:50:50,317
that, so yes, I definitely 
agree. A few people noted that 

1159
01:50:50,517 --> 01:50:53,110
sub techniques will help people 
who have a false sense of 

1160
01:50:53,265 --> 01:50:55,265
security.

1161
01:50:57,622 --> 01:51:00,270
So it was really good to hear 
that, that is one of the reasons

1162
01:51:00,472 --> 01:51:03,519
we are doing sub techniques. 
Katie and Tony already talked 

1163
01:51:03,721 --> 01:51:10,224
about the growth of the 
community so I'm going to as 

1164
01:51:10,426 --> 01:51:12,661
well because this is awesome, we
had 132 different contributors 

1165
01:51:12,862 --> 01:51:16,726
right now which is incredible. 
ATT&CK  is built by the 

1166
01:51:16,927 --> 01:51:19,977
community and maintained the 
community, we had explosive 

1167
01:51:20,177 --> 01:51:25,404
growth in twitter followers a 
year ago, about 12,000, or over 

1168
01:51:25,551 --> 01:51:32,514
28,000 at the start of the 
conference. And 99 open source 

1169
01:51:32,669 --> 01:51:40,888
repositories that use ATT&CK , 
it is blowing up all over the 

1170
01:51:41,638 --> 01:51:43,638
world. People

1171
01:51:47,395 --> 01:51:49,395
are using it in conferences and 
professional groups and things 

1172
01:51:49,427 --> 01:51:53,440
like that, it is great to see. 
There is still a lot of work to 

1173
01:51:53,589 --> 01:51:56,735
do, we will be continuing to 
roll the efforts of ATT&CK under

1174
01:51:57,496 --> 01:52:05,017
the  ATT&CK umbrella , we are 
going to be continuing it with 

1175
01:52:05,170 --> 01:52:13,601
the revamp, and the ICS team has
been hard at work getting this 

1176
01:52:13,801 --> 01:52:16,034
ready to go, and we will be 
publishing this as a separate 

1177
01:52:16,235 --> 01:52:19,900
website in a couple of months. 
To give it some flexibility to 

1178
01:52:20,105 --> 01:52:22,334
grow to better match that domain
and we will be looking at 

1179
01:52:22,535 --> 01:52:25,586
rolling it under ATT&CK later on
and a lot of people are creating

1180
01:52:25,787 --> 01:52:32,286
their own  control mapping, so 
we hope to be building the 

1181
01:52:32,487 --> 01:52:35,425
community around us. If I didn't
cover your favorite topic

1182
01:52:43,045 --> 01:52:45,045
related to ATT&CK, we've got 
more updates planned that are 

1183
01:52:45,078 --> 01:52:47,112
sprinkled throughout the next 
couple days, we are going to be 

1184
01:52:47,322 --> 01:52:49,548
talking about  the front report,
ATT&CK  mapping automation tool,

1185
01:52:49,749 --> 01:52:51,920
and we will be covering ICS

1186
01:52:57,270 --> 01:52:58,888
ATT&CK the controlled mapping 
effort, car analytics and 

1187
01:52:58,889 --> 01:53:00,889
integration with 

1188
01:53:04,750 --> 01:53:06,750
pre-ATT&CK

1189
01:53:08,242 --> 01:53:11,845
later on tomorrow. Thank you 
very much.

1190
01:53:12,017 --> 01:53:14,837
>> All right, questions?

1191
01:53:28,292 --> 01:53:34,027
>> Just curious if navigator is 
going to be mapped to the new 

1192
01:53:34,242 --> 01:53:38,098
techniques as well? 
>> Yes, once we roll them out, 

1193
01:53:38,294 --> 01:53:44,193
we will have a version that can 
support that as well, as well as

1194
01:53:44,394 --> 01:53:46,394
the visual representations.

1195
01:53:49,415 --> 01:53:54,552
>> What is your thinking on 
mitigation versus course of 

1196
01:53:54,953 --> 01:53:56,692
action, or are they the same 
thing? 

1197
01:53:56,693 --> 01:54:00,642
>> It really comes down to the 
definition, we are treating them

1198
01:54:00,843 --> 01:54:05,726
like courses of action right 
now, so yes, they can be very 

1199
01:54:05,927 --> 01:54:07,927
much courses of action.

1200
01:54:15,012 --> 01:54:19,643
>> No one else?
>>

1201
01:54:23,392 --> 01:54:27,459
You can always rely on me to ask
you a question. I just want to 

1202
01:54:27,660 --> 01:54:30,710
thank you for putting yourself 
in this position, I know that 

1203
01:54:31,112 --> 01:54:34,764
trying to steer the ship with 
10,000 or 23,000 followers is 

1204
01:54:35,527 --> 01:54:37,527
not easy

1205
01:54:40,051 --> 01:54:42,686
and so I feel your pain and keep
up the good work, I really 

1206
01:54:43,436 --> 01:54:45,436
appreciate it.

1207
01:54:46,753 --> 01:54:48,786
>> Thank you, it is really the 
community that makes this 

1208
01:54:48,988 --> 01:54:51,425
worthwhile for us, I should be 
thanking you guys.

1209
01:54:51,580 --> 01:54:54,622
>> I'm going to throw one at 
you, and we didn't pre-stage 

1210
01:54:54,775 --> 01:54:59,545
this, Carl asked me last night, 
where do you see ATT&CK in 5 

1211
01:55:00,309 --> 01:55:03,153
years? 
>> I hate this question. 

1212
01:55:03,321 --> 01:55:05,321
[Laughter]

1213
01:55:12,748 --> 01:55:14,982
I see it being maintained more 
by the community, we want more 

1214
01:55:15,196 --> 01:55:17,418
transparency in the process and 
we have some ideas on tools and 

1215
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:19,866
processes that can help with 
that, so MITRE  is always going 

1216
01:55:20,068 --> 01:55:22,903
to be on the role where we are 
curating it but we want to 

1217
01:55:23,117 --> 01:55:25,753
foster more contributions from 
the community. That is where I 

1218
01:55:25,953 --> 01:55:32,054
think it will be.
>> Any other questions? If not, 

1219
01:55:32,455 --> 01:55:38,095
please join me in thanking Blake
Strom 

1220
01:55:44,641 --> 01:55:47,076
. I think in summary, the state 
of the attack is strong, we 

1221
01:55:47,277 --> 01:55:49,725
would be remiss if we didn't 
give a shout out to Nick and 

1222
01:55:49,926 --> 01:55:55,764
Chris who have a podcast, but 
Nick, we see you, we appreciate 

1223
01:55:55,922 --> 01:56:01,303
you, Blake is not going to start
a podcast by the same name, so 

1224
01:56:01,505 --> 01:56:05,975
no lawsuits, thank you. I wanted
to call out a few things online,

1225
01:56:06,176 --> 01:56:08,413
people from around the world, 
Sarah noted that we have viewers

1226
01:56:09,173 --> 01:56:12,668
from India who are watching 
online, that is pretty awesome, 

1227
01:56:12,882 --> 01:56:18,165
we have a tweet who said five 
minutes into ATT&CK  talk 

1228
01:56:18,366 --> 01:56:20,800
online, and already learned 
something that I was completely 

1229
01:56:21,001 --> 01:56:25,670
unaware of before. Which is 
pretty exciting. We also have a 

1230
01:56:26,434 --> 01:56:33,243
very great pun thread, those 
little hats that you've got, 

1231
01:56:34,153 --> 01:56:39,087
MITRE  ATT&CK has been working 
on all kinds of coverage, very 

1232
01:56:39,288 --> 01:56:41,288
good , Dave.

1233
01:56:43,891 --> 01:56:53,710
hatters got to hat, Pretty good 
dad joke, not to beret you 

1234
01:56:54,112 --> 01:57:02,645
all, but please pick one pun  
and stick to it. There are some 

1235
01:57:02,846 --> 01:57:08,329
good ones, so keep piling on. A 
lot of great things going on, on

1236
01:57:08,529 --> 01:57:12,395
Twitter and online as well. 
Thank you so much to Blake for 

1237
01:57:12,596 --> 01:57:14,596
his awesome state of the attack

1238
01:57:17,669 --> 01:57:19,904
keynote, and we are going to 
send you into break, a couple 

1239
01:57:20,105 --> 01:57:22,955
notes before we do that, we 
would like to say thank you to 

1240
01:57:23,157 --> 01:57:26,810
our sponsor, they are providing 
coffee, all of the stuff you 

1241
01:57:27,025 --> 01:57:31,077
will see out there for that. I'm
going to throw it over to the 

1242
01:57:31,279 --> 01:57:35,091
online program in just a moment 
so Jamie Williams, my awesome 

1243
01:57:35,242 --> 01:57:37,242
teammate

1244
01:57:41,649 --> 01:57:43,882
and engineer here at MITRE is 
going to be chatting with some 

1245
01:57:44,083 --> 01:57:46,116
speakers and special guests as 
well, talking them  on the 

1246
01:57:46,317 --> 01:57:48,317
ATT&CK  cloud couch.

1247
01:57:57,088 --> 01:57:59,088
Folks online, stick around, 
Jamie is going to be chatting 

1248
01:57:59,118 --> 01:58:01,352
with some folks on that couch, 
so online folks, see you over 

1249
01:58:01,553 --> 01:58:03,988
there, and folks online, we will
see you back here at 11:00. Over

1250
01:58:04,189 --> 01:58:06,189
to you, Jamie.

from all over the world, we love

1253
02:00:25,966 --> 02:00:28,411
the tweets, don't forget to 
download your watch party selfie

1254
02:00:28,617 --> 02:00:31,051
poster, we want to see pictures 
of you and where you are, how 

1255
02:00:31,249 --> 02:00:34,501
you are getting together in your
community, we want this to be a 

1256
02:00:35,266 --> 02:00:37,266
worldwide effort. One note,

1257
02:00:41,609 --> 02:00:44,250
I'm not just talking to you, I 
want to hear back, if you have 

1258
02:00:44,461 --> 02:00:48,317
any questions you want me to 
project as well as other things 

1259
02:00:48,518 --> 02:00:51,153
you want me to talk about in 
this forum, feel free to use the

1260
02:00:51,367 --> 02:00:54,403
hashtag to send messages our 
way, with that I'm going to 

1261
02:00:54,617 --> 02:01:01,322
introduce a keynote aficionado 
and former Georgetown employee 

1262
02:01:02,285 --> 02:01:04,285
keynote speaker

1263
02:01:15,281 --> 02:01:17,281
, Tony.

1264
02:01:22,851 --> 02:01:24,419
How are you liking the 
conference so far? 

1265
02:01:24,420 --> 02:01:27,016
>> It is great, just the keynote
kicking off

1266
02:01:38,078 --> 02:01:41,129
, it is a great crowd, I see a 
lot of familiar faces but also a

1267
02:01:41,329 --> 02:01:43,965
lot of new ones and the range in
terms of how many people are 

1268
02:01:44,178 --> 02:01:46,200
tuning in from all over the 
world I think is really 

1269
02:01:46,415 --> 02:01:48,447
impressive and a testament to 
how much ATT&CK is growing and 

1270
02:01:48,648 --> 02:01:50,266
taking off. 
>> Excellent, I love your talk, 

1271
02:01:50,267 --> 02:01:53,518
one of the biggest things, 
bringing new people in, and you 

1272
02:01:53,719 --> 02:01:55,719
highlighted that and

1273
02:01:59,617 --> 02:02:01,436
also later in your career, 
you're never really done 

1274
02:02:01,437 --> 02:02:06,521
learning and I really appreciate
you injecting that and just 

1275
02:02:06,722 --> 02:02:09,156
reminding us as a community that
we are all in this together, it 

1276
02:02:09,356 --> 02:02:11,356
is never done. So, thank you.

1277
02:02:18,910 --> 02:02:21,345
So, correct me if I'm wrong, the
biggest take way from your talk 

1278
02:02:21,546 --> 02:02:23,578
is that connection between Intel
and operations, you want to go 

1279
02:02:23,778 --> 02:02:25,159
into a little more detail about 
that? 

1280
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:27,933
>> Absolutely, first of all, as 
a career until person, that is 

1281
02:02:28,248 --> 02:02:31,499
the worldview that I've always 
had, that is a very fascinating 

1282
02:02:31,699 --> 02:02:34,549
place to be but it can also be 
very frustrating because it's 

1283
02:02:34,750 --> 02:02:37,399
one of those things, we are all 
on the same team and again, not 

1284
02:02:38,158 --> 02:02:42,872
because any malice or people 
trying to deliberately disrupt 

1285
02:02:43,086 --> 02:02:47,553
things, we have a hard time 
getting on the same page and I 

1286
02:02:47,754 --> 02:02:50,193
think when we take a step back 
and understand that, it gives us

1287
02:02:50,393 --> 02:02:53,444
a moment to catch our breath and
think through, what should we be

1288
02:02:53,645 --> 02:02:55,879
doing a little bit differently? 
I think that is one of the 

1289
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:58,640
reasons why ATT&CK is so 
powerful because it brings us 

1290
02:02:58,716 --> 02:03:02,012
together  around a common 
nomenclature and a common 

1291
02:03:02,718 --> 02:03:06,553
analysis in a way that the day 
today

1292
02:03:11,118 --> 02:03:15,371
term is not reinforced that way.
>> One of the key reinforced 

1293
02:03:16,346 --> 02:03:20,759
things, even going down to sales

1294
02:03:27,763 --> 02:03:30,212
, I really love that, can you 
speak a little bit towards the 

1295
02:03:30,413 --> 02:03:32,413
challenges? You highlighted this
a little bit but the Intel 

1296
02:03:32,445 --> 02:03:34,445
community has their biases and 
the way they work, different 

1297
02:03:34,476 --> 02:03:37,513
types of people versus your 
operators, both very important, 

1298
02:03:37,928 --> 02:03:40,162
they really appreciate you 
highlighting the importance and 

1299
02:03:40,363 --> 02:03:43,613
like you said, it is a group 
effort but what are some of the 

1300
02:03:43,814 --> 02:03:47,147
challenges of getting both 
groups together to work together

1301
02:03:49,311 --> 02:03:51,242
and take advantage of each 
other's skill sets. 

1302
02:03:51,244 --> 02:03:55,900
>> One of the challenges is we 
do have different frames

1303
02:03:59,468 --> 02:04:01,501
of information and the timelines
that we use are very different, 

1304
02:04:01,701 --> 02:04:06,384
Intel is focused on that novel, 
unique, what is next, and the 

1305
02:04:06,584 --> 02:04:10,035
work that we do in investigating
to understand them gives us a 

1306
02:04:10,236 --> 02:04:12,236
lot of explanatory

1307
02:04:15,521 --> 02:04:17,521
detail. That is very powerful 
but the more explanatory detail 

1308
02:04:17,552 --> 02:04:19,786
you have the harder it is to be 
predictive so striking that 

1309
02:04:19,986 --> 02:04:22,835
balance between the two is a 
real challenge for a lot of the 

1310
02:04:23,035 --> 02:04:26,687
teams but without that, it is 
really difficult for ops to 

1311
02:04:26,888 --> 02:04:31,316
consume and really use that 
information. Because the time it

1312
02:04:31,463 --> 02:04:38,062
takes to build the detection is 
on a different timeline the way 

1313
02:04:38,263 --> 02:04:40,913
Intel works, again, this is one 
of the reasons why I think 

1314
02:04:41,113 --> 02:04:43,350
ATT&CK is so helpful because it 
helps to bridge  that different.

1315
02:04:44,110 --> 02:04:50,257
It makes both sides a little bit
uncomfortable in a good way, by 

1316
02:04:50,458 --> 02:04:52,691
pushing them both out of their 
comfort zone, that is how you 

1317
02:04:52,894 --> 02:04:56,506
know you are making progress.
>> And you mentioned the staple 

1318
02:04:56,643 --> 02:05:00,412
signal between Intel and feeding
operations, personally what can 

1319
02:05:00,613 --> 02:05:06,911
I do to provide feedback with 
the topic, like you said, isn't 

1320
02:05:07,669 --> 02:05:09,669
hot anymore?

1321
02:05:11,383 --> 02:05:14,019
>> That is a great question, and
my talk focused on the Intel to 

1322
02:05:14,220 --> 02:05:19,410
ops and it closes that loop, so 
I think one of the

1323
02:05:24,787 --> 02:05:26,402
things that becomes very 
apparent when teams start 

1324
02:05:26,403 --> 02:05:28,403
looking at ATT&CK, when you have
the discussions about  

1325
02:05:28,434 --> 02:05:30,469
visibility detection, it 
showcases those blind spots and 

1326
02:05:30,670 --> 02:05:32,670
those become important for Intel

1327
02:05:37,784 --> 02:05:40,018
to note because then you need 
earlier warning, even if it is 

1328
02:05:40,220 --> 02:05:42,453
lower fidelity because you know 
you got more work to do. So 

1329
02:05:42,654 --> 02:05:44,654
basically, by doing this work, 
ops can help refine the 

1330
02:05:44,687 --> 02:05:47,233
requirements for Intel in a way 
that is very powerful and

1331
02:05:51,950 --> 02:05:56,883
our usability.
>> That is a very unique 

1332
02:05:57,084 --> 02:05:59,084
perspective, you talked about 
bringing people within the 

1333
02:05:59,211 --> 02:06:01,754
community, so taking them back 
to your teaching endeavors, how 

1334
02:06:02,515 --> 02:06:08,451
do you, what do you think is the
best time to introduce students 

1335
02:06:08,865 --> 02:06:10,683
or junior analysts or 
experienced engineers into the 

1336
02:06:10,684 --> 02:06:15,513
ATT&CK community? 
>> Anytime is a good time, a 

1337
02:06:15,659 --> 02:06:17,659
particular

1338
02:06:19,418 --> 02:06:21,804
, highlighting where it is we 
want to go and

1339
02:06:25,922 --> 02:06:27,922
you are building the muscle 
memory

1340
02:06:31,208 --> 02:06:33,442
for the organization, it is very
powerful if you can sell this 

1341
02:06:33,643 --> 02:06:36,281
idea, this is how we want to 
work together, to work better. 

1342
02:06:36,481 --> 02:06:38,513
The more the people understand 
that in the early phases of 

1343
02:06:38,727 --> 02:06:41,566
their career, the easier it is 
all the way through. And I think

1344
02:06:41,767 --> 02:06:44,862
that ATT&CK is a great way  to 
break down some of the 

1345
02:06:45,014 --> 02:06:47,014
complexity of cyber security 
overall

1346
02:06:50,445 --> 02:06:53,857
. It is an easier reference 
point

1347
02:06:59,036 --> 02:07:01,036
. 
>> That is a very good point, 

1348
02:07:01,068 --> 02:07:03,068
dealing with that matrix

1349
02:07:06,340 --> 02:07:08,374
fire years ago, and I appreciate
what you said about the 

1350
02:07:08,574 --> 02:07:15,031
complexity settings but at the 
end of the day, whether it is 

1351
02:07:15,184 --> 02:07:17,522
scaling the junior staff, to be 
more competent with what they 

1352
02:07:18,278 --> 02:07:20,278
are doing

1353
02:07:21,576 --> 02:07:24,224
, and as people leave, this is a
very dynamic field, you have to 

1354
02:07:24,424 --> 02:07:27,676
fill in those holes. So I really
appreciate everything you said, 

1355
02:07:27,876 --> 02:07:31,075
anything else you wanted to say 
from your talk? 

1356
02:07:31,076 --> 02:07:35,595
>> I'm not sure, I'm not sure if
I have enough means.

1357
02:07:35,754 --> 02:07:37,754
>> I think you did, that was 
fantastic,

1358
02:07:43,115 --> 02:07:45,349
so we really appreciate that, so
a personal story, how did you 

1359
02:07:45,549 --> 02:07:47,729
get into ATT&CK?  What was your 
adoption process like? 

1360
02:07:47,730 --> 02:07:53,472
>> I mentioned my experience 
starting as an Intel analyst in 

1361
02:07:54,441 --> 02:08:02,411
department defense, both 
predating MITRE  ATT&CK,  it was

1362
02:08:02,613 --> 02:08:05,664
when I came into the private 
sector and I was hit by how 

1363
02:08:05,865 --> 02:08:07,865
tactical the implementation of

1364
02:08:11,137 --> 02:08:13,581
Intel was and I started looking 
around, there's got to be a way 

1365
02:08:13,783 --> 02:08:16,019
to draw this discussion up to 
that more robust level, that is 

1366
02:08:16,220 --> 02:08:21,501
when I found ATT&CK, I was very 
excited about it.  In 2015 when 

1367
02:08:21,705 --> 02:08:23,827
it was first coming out, it was 
pretty unknown.

1368
02:08:27,387 --> 02:08:29,419
It has been tremendously 
exciting to see over the past 2 

1369
02:08:29,633 --> 02:08:31,633
years how the community has 
gathered around us and we 

1370
02:08:31,653 --> 02:08:34,502
decided that this is how we are 
going to talk about it. It is 

1371
02:08:34,702 --> 02:08:37,340
that critical mass as the 
foundation for all the things we

1372
02:08:37,553 --> 02:08:41,812
are seeing today, more teams 
using this, and now I think you 

1373
02:08:42,025 --> 02:08:46,079
are getting that velocity where 
we are going to get a lot more 

1374
02:08:46,279 --> 02:08:50,961
automation both to produce 
intelligence for ATT&CK and also

1375
02:08:51,162 --> 02:08:53,162
consume it. 
>>

1376
02:08:59,082 --> 02:09:01,118
That is awesome, I appreciate 
what you said about coming from 

1377
02:09:01,319 --> 02:09:04,116
the government side, there is a 
lot of Intel driven people and 

1378
02:09:04,268 --> 02:09:07,203
going to the private, and it was
using those, both communities 

1379
02:09:07,404 --> 02:09:12,232
need both aspects of that. On 
that thread, more on the private

1380
02:09:12,434 --> 02:09:16,545
sector, you speak of culture and
the interrelationship, what else

1381
02:09:16,758 --> 02:09:21,827
can we do as the ATT&CK 
community to embed this Intel 

1382
02:09:22,029 --> 02:09:23,753
data  driven approach to our 
people? 

1383
02:09:23,754 --> 02:09:25,805
>> Events like

1384
02:09:30,566 --> 02:09:35,849
this are very central to that, 
it is allowing the community to 

1385
02:09:36,051 --> 02:09:37,871
share what has learned and 
equally what hasn't, that 

1386
02:09:37,872 --> 02:09:39,703
accelerates that learning and 
the more people become familiar 

1387
02:09:39,704 --> 02:09:41,704
with it, the more greater it 
becomes

1388
02:09:45,187 --> 02:09:47,222
, success feeds on itself, and 
during the question and answer 

1389
02:09:47,422 --> 02:09:51,826
session, a well-timed vignette 
appeared at a company in your 

1390
02:09:51,984 --> 02:09:55,753
industry can be very compelling 
in helping build that buy-in 

1391
02:09:55,954 --> 02:09:59,009
with the team. So events like 
this are very important for 

1392
02:09:59,206 --> 02:10:02,327
circulating that oxygen amongst 
the wider community. 

1393
02:10:02,328 --> 02:10:08,040
>> I think it is great, even 
coming to an event like this

1394
02:10:11,388 --> 02:10:13,420
, where a lot of people are 
maybe apprehensive to approach 

1395
02:10:13,634 --> 02:10:16,020
somebody like you, the keynote 
speaker, so any advice for 

1396
02:10:16,225 --> 02:10:20,229
others that might want an advent

1397
02:10:24,187 --> 02:10:26,187
? 
>> First of all, come say hi.

1398
02:10:27,372 --> 02:10:29,372
>> You have some wine

1399
02:10:33,944 --> 02:10:35,944
? 
>> Do we have one yet, it is a 

1400
02:10:35,976 --> 02:10:38,209
little early. But, don't be 
afraid to come say hi, for first

1401
02:10:38,969 --> 02:10:40,969
time speakers,

1402
02:10:46,133 --> 02:10:47,952
at those vignettes, thinking 
about speaking can be incredibly

1403
02:10:47,953 --> 02:10:50,389
intimidating but it is a great 
way to get out there and makes 

1404
02:10:50,601 --> 02:10:52,834
it easier to clarify in your 
head, what makes it work and 

1405
02:10:53,597 --> 02:10:55,597
what doesn't.

1406
02:10:56,887 --> 02:10:58,920
>> What is your favorite tactic?
>> That is such a loaded 

1407
02:10:59,672 --> 02:11:02,732
question [Laughter] I'm going to
go with a simple one, I like 

1408
02:11:02,879 --> 02:11:04,879
spearfishing.

1409
02:11:06,437 --> 02:11:09,687
It is such a central part of the
attacks that we see and the way 

1410
02:11:09,888 --> 02:11:13,351
that it becomes the gateway to 
the rest of the phase of how 

1411
02:11:13,552 --> 02:11:18,116
that attack unfolds. It is 
something that is really

1412
02:11:22,078 --> 02:11:26,146
showing how well it can work, it
is an oldie but a goodie, it is 

1413
02:11:26,905 --> 02:11:28,905
a classic. 
>>

1414
02:11:31,217 --> 02:11:34,012
It might grow, it might shrink, 
we never know, but I definitely 

1415
02:11:34,168 --> 02:11:36,905
appreciate it, thank you for 
your time and thank you for 

1416
02:11:37,119 --> 02:11:38,490
participating, it was truly an 
honor. 

1417
02:11:38,491 --> 02:11:42,591
>> Thank you.
>> Next up, we will be inviting 

1418
02:11:42,805 --> 02:11:49,908
our new face of ATT&CK , Blake 
Strom , but we will be back in a

1419
02:11:50,109 --> 02:11:52,109
couple of minutes.

1420
02:14:07,829 --> 02:14:13,519
>> Welcome back,  I'm going to 
sit down with Blake Strom, thank

1421
02:14:13,720 --> 02:14:16,716
you for being here , what do you
think about the conference so 

1422
02:14:16,869 --> 02:14:19,619
far?
>> It has been amazing, we are 

1423
02:14:19,820 --> 02:14:22,255
already one day down and we had 
a lot of great conversations 

1424
02:14:22,456 --> 02:14:25,909
yesterday, we got to get some 
great feedback from people on 

1425
02:14:26,110 --> 02:14:29,295
the techniques which was really 
awesome, it was the birds of 

1426
02:14:29,441 --> 02:14:34,443
feather that I lead, so great 
conversations, we had fun at the

1427
02:14:34,644 --> 02:14:37,894
beer garden last night. 
>> I imagine so, you've got your

1428
02:14:38,509 --> 02:14:45,814
coffee already? Good to hear. 
ATT&CK is everywhere , 4 years 

1429
02:14:46,013 --> 02:14:50,897
ago, when you made that tiny 
matrix, did you think it would 

1430
02:14:51,097 --> 02:14:53,432
grow to where we are sitting 
today? Especially with everybody

1431
02:14:54,550 --> 02:14:58,404
here today and viewing online?
>> Not at all, we are trying to 

1432
02:14:58,618 --> 02:15:06,540
solve our internal problems with
trying to merge Intel to see 

1433
02:15:06,741 --> 02:15:09,267
whether or not the analytics we 
were doing

1434
02:15:15,466 --> 02:15:17,297
with other research projects 
were actually useful, I didn't 

1435
02:15:17,298 --> 02:15:19,532
know it was going to be so 
useful for the entire community,

1436
02:15:19,733 --> 02:15:22,384
we were just trying to solve all
of our problems but it turns out

1437
02:15:22,585 --> 02:15:24,294
they were problems that 
everybody else had. 

1438
02:15:24,295 --> 02:15:26,295
>>

1439
02:15:28,071 --> 02:15:30,705
You saw that idea early and you 
thought this was the best way to

1440
02:15:30,906 --> 02:15:33,342
do it and you ran with it. We 
appreciate that, so thank you. 

1441
02:15:33,543 --> 02:15:37,811
What is next? You gave us some 
ideas on medication, sub 

1442
02:15:38,012 --> 02:15:40,811
techniques, cloud, what is on 
the horizon for ATT&CK 2020? 

1443
02:15:46,747 --> 02:15:48,982
>> We are going to continue 
doing what is already out there 

1444
02:15:49,197 --> 02:15:51,228
because we have to maintain it 
as new techniques are discovered

1445
02:15:51,428 --> 02:15:54,266
and used, so we need to maintain
that but we are also going to be

1446
02:15:54,467 --> 02:15:56,915
doing a revamp of the data 
sources once the sub techniques 

1447
02:15:57,116 --> 02:15:59,116
are done to provide more 
granularity

1448
02:16:02,185 --> 02:16:04,237
and people can assess whether or
not the sensors are working 

1449
02:16:04,438 --> 02:16:07,086
effectively for them or what 
type of data they need to drive 

1450
02:16:07,848 --> 02:16:10,488
their analytics. Another thing 
we are doing is releasing a 

1451
02:16:10,637 --> 02:16:15,357
attack for ICS, there has been a
ton of work going on with that 

1452
02:16:15,506 --> 02:16:17,506
project

1453
02:16:18,859 --> 02:16:20,859
, there are already some 
presentations out there but we 

1454
02:16:20,895 --> 02:16:24,960
really want to get those out 
later this year. We are working 

1455
02:16:25,160 --> 02:16:28,411
on a network of devices, 
techniques that adversaries used

1456
02:16:28,612 --> 02:16:35,725
to gain average access on 
switches, so that is still in 

1457
02:16:35,925 --> 02:16:37,958
the research phase, we will look
to publish that little bit 

1458
02:16:38,162 --> 02:16:43,445
further on next year. 
>> It seems like every time we 

1459
02:16:43,846 --> 02:16:48,924
get a new platform, people want 
to attack that same model, and 

1460
02:16:49,125 --> 02:16:51,361
use that same framework so I 
appreciate all the work you are 

1461
02:16:51,562 --> 02:16:53,562
doing to implement all of that.

1462
02:16:57,047 --> 02:16:59,047
Speaking on one of the big 
things we talked about, 

1463
02:16:59,081 --> 02:17:00,496
understanding the threat and 
understanding the adversary, 

1464
02:17:00,498 --> 02:17:03,748
from your perspective, what do 
you see as the next big thing? 

1465
02:17:04,164 --> 02:17:08,829
Is it a certain industry? What 
is keeping you up at night? It 

1466
02:17:09,030 --> 02:17:12,081
seems like different methods of 
execution and different methods 

1467
02:17:12,285 --> 02:17:14,285
of trying to evade current 
differences

1468
02:17:22,244 --> 02:17:24,677
, that is where a lot of the 
focus is, the adversaries are 

1469
02:17:24,878 --> 02:17:28,944
aware that there is a lot of 
visibility in this way so they 

1470
02:17:29,145 --> 02:17:31,378
are going to try to navigate 
around that and figure out ways 

1471
02:17:31,579 --> 02:17:33,557
of doing things that aren't 
being looked at by defenders. 

1472
02:17:33,558 --> 02:17:36,245
>> How does the community 
address that issue? We always 

1473
02:17:36,459 --> 02:17:40,512
want to build that technical 
knowledge and share that 

1474
02:17:41,263 --> 02:17:44,175
knowledge but there are 
different adoptions from 

1475
02:17:44,376 --> 02:17:46,770
different fields, how do we 
address the issues and the 

1476
02:17:46,924 --> 02:17:48,924
variance in execution?

1477
02:17:51,895 --> 02:17:53,726
>> It is mainly the 
contributions, as people see 

1478
02:17:53,727 --> 02:17:55,749
these things, they may not see 
that activity exactly when the 

1479
02:17:55,949 --> 02:17:59,815
adversary is detected, it might 
be something that they use like 

1480
02:18:00,016 --> 02:18:03,884
a credential dumping, and as 
they analyze what actually 

1481
02:18:04,084 --> 02:18:11,387
happened and piece it together, 
but we saw the after affects 

1482
02:18:11,602 --> 02:18:13,602
because maybe it was

1483
02:18:16,877 --> 02:18:18,877
accessing the memory in a 
certain way that was being 

1484
02:18:18,909 --> 02:18:21,344
detected, so it is really trying
to look at who has that 

1485
02:18:21,546 --> 02:18:24,597
visibility in the community and 
make sure they are able to share

1486
02:18:24,797 --> 02:18:26,797
that information with us with 
her

1487
02:18:30,487 --> 02:18:32,487
, whether directly or openly 
reporting when they see these 

1488
02:18:32,519 --> 02:18:34,550
incidents. 
>> Can you speak towards how we 

1489
02:18:34,750 --> 02:18:39,017
see the community being involved
in the ATT&CK, we love email and

1490
02:18:39,218 --> 02:18:43,326
twitter, how does the community 
do this, like you said before, 

1491
02:18:43,484 --> 02:18:48,905
is that this is a 100% community
effort, just remind people out 

1492
02:18:49,058 --> 02:18:54,125
there, and me as well, how do we
keep this community tight?

1493
02:18:54,276 --> 02:18:57,302
>> We talk to people at 
conferences, we hold events like

1494
02:18:58,062 --> 02:19:00,062
ATT&CKcon 

1495
02:19:04,208 --> 02:19:06,028
but to get directly involved 
with the contribution process, 

1496
02:19:06,029 --> 02:19:08,877
the best mechanism we have right
now is over email, so you can 

1497
02:19:09,077 --> 02:19:13,745
send us your ideas of what you 
think is missing from ATT&CK 

1498
02:19:13,960 --> 02:19:15,960
along with some supporting 
evidence, the things we look for

1499
02:19:16,195 --> 02:19:20,342
merely our thread until, the 
adversaries are known to use

1500
02:19:28,168 --> 02:19:32,434
things, it might not be 
something that recently a 

1501
02:19:33,186 --> 02:19:35,186
researcher discovered,

1502
02:19:37,721 --> 02:19:40,567
it is cool to have that so we 
can have it on our radar and 

1503
02:19:40,769 --> 02:19:43,405
have some evidence of use when 
it pops up later but we need to 

1504
02:19:43,606 --> 02:19:45,638
use the thread until aspect of 
these because people really want

1505
02:19:45,852 --> 02:19:49,100
to use ATT&CK as a way to 
prioritize because  they want to

1506
02:19:49,301 --> 02:19:54,172
prioritize, they want to focus 
on what is being done first. 

1507
02:19:54,374 --> 02:19:56,374
That is the real power of 
ATT&CK. 

1508
02:19:56,492 --> 02:20:02,094
>> Like Toni said, this is a 
very complex  problem, so 

1509
02:20:02,295 --> 02:20:04,295
knowing where to start is 
probably the hardest question. 

1510
02:20:04,327 --> 02:20:06,327
Any plans for Halloween?

1511
02:20:10,427 --> 02:20:12,661
I've got to fly back early 
Thursday morning to be home in 

1512
02:20:12,862 --> 02:20:14,479
time to take the kids 
trick-or-treating Thursday. Any 

1513
02:20:14,480 --> 02:20:17,414
costume ideas yet?
>> For me? 

1514
02:20:17,416 --> 02:20:23,832
>> For them, or you?
>> My daughter is going to be a 

1515
02:20:24,590 --> 02:20:28,704
scary cat and my son has a 
dinosaur costume.

1516
02:20:28,872 --> 02:20:31,552
>> I'm going to challenge the 
community to tweet some costume 

1517
02:20:31,752 --> 02:20:37,176
ideas for Blake, maybe get him 
in a syringe for processing 

1518
02:20:37,351 --> 02:20:40,077
injections. Feel free to 
Photoshop him as well, that 

1519
02:20:40,290 --> 02:20:43,943
would be excellent. Anything you
want to tell the community, we 

1520
02:20:44,144 --> 02:20:46,376
have a great following online, I
hope you were watching the 

1521
02:20:47,126 --> 02:20:49,315
stream and reading the tweets

1522
02:20:53,079 --> 02:20:55,512
, but anything you want to push 
to the community? And I said 

1523
02:20:55,726 --> 02:20:57,758
contribution is key on the sub 
techniques and as we develop, 

1524
02:20:57,959 --> 02:21:01,412
the matrix, feedback is 
incredibly important. Anything 

1525
02:21:01,614 --> 02:21:05,164
you want to push out to all of 
our fans or friends?

1526
02:21:09,536 --> 02:21:12,171
>> Just tell us how we can be 
better, we are here for the 

1527
02:21:12,371 --> 02:21:14,404
community and we need your 
feedback, we need help to 

1528
02:21:14,606 --> 02:21:18,060
improve ATT&CK overtime.  If you
think there are things that can 

1529
02:21:18,275 --> 02:21:20,275
help with the

1530
02:21:22,742 --> 02:21:25,176
methodology, let us know and we 
will see what we can do about 

1531
02:21:25,377 --> 02:21:27,510
it. This extends beyond just 
contributions but also analytics

1532
02:21:30,865 --> 02:21:34,449
, we are taking contributions 
there, if you have data related 

1533
02:21:34,630 --> 02:21:38,475
to ATT&CK sightings, that would 
be really interesting  for us.

1534
02:21:42,238 --> 02:21:44,883
It is after an effort we kicked 
off this year and we are trying 

1535
02:21:45,084 --> 02:21:46,702
to partner with various 
industries to share information 

1536
02:21:46,703 --> 02:21:49,137
with us based on what they are 
seeing, so a lot of vendor 

1537
02:21:49,351 --> 02:21:53,203
products are mapping to ATT&CK 
so the detections are labeled 

1538
02:21:53,965 --> 02:21:55,965
with 

1539
02:21:58,690 --> 02:22:00,690
the techniques, that is very 
interesting for us because it 

1540
02:22:00,724 --> 02:22:02,724
gives us more real-time view of 
what adversaries are doing 

1541
02:22:02,759 --> 02:22:06,154
beyond the finished Intel 
imports that are beyond the 

1542
02:22:06,304 --> 02:22:11,685
various obvious technique use, 
so getting that trending data so

1543
02:22:11,900 --> 02:22:15,137
we can say, these particular 
techniques were more popular in 

1544
02:22:15,352 --> 02:22:19,809
quarter one and quarter two, 
that would be very interesting 

1545
02:22:20,024 --> 02:22:23,170
for people because we would know
more what to focus on overtime. 

1546
02:22:23,171 --> 02:22:28,904
>> And last question, a little 
history lesson, what did the 

1547
02:22:29,104 --> 02:22:31,104
name ATT&CK come from? 

1548
02:22:35,653 --> 02:22:38,703
>> I will give Eric all the 
credit for that, he was a part 

1549
02:22:38,904 --> 02:22:42,970
of the original four that 
created ATT&CK and I think he 

1550
02:22:43,171 --> 02:22:47,438
was just driving to work one day
and he thought  ATT&CK . It was 

1551
02:22:47,639 --> 02:22:54,347
a very catchy term but it was 
not too bad but it caught 

1552
02:22:54,546 --> 02:22:56,575
people's attention and that is 
what we really wanted to do. 

1553
02:22:56,733 --> 02:23:02,264
>> It stuck indeed, with that, I
want to remind the community, 

1554
02:23:02,481 --> 02:23:04,481
please Tweet us, ATT&CKcon 

1555
02:23:07,752 --> 02:23:09,752
, don't forget about the watch 
party poster selfies, download 

1556
02:23:09,786 --> 02:23:12,981
that, we want to see your best 
Halloween costumes as well. With

1557
02:23:13,136 --> 02:23:17,608
that, ATT&CKcon will be back in 
a few minutes. 

1558
02:23:17,769 --> 02:23:19,769
>> Thank you.

1559
02:30:53,051 --> 02:31:02,868
>> Welcome back to MITRE  
ATT&CKcon  2.0, please give 

1560
02:31:03,071 --> 02:31:05,071
a warm welcome to Katie Nichols.

1561
02:31:08,552 --> 02:31:10,552
>> Welcome back to break 
everyone, I hope you enjoyed 

1562
02:31:10,586 --> 02:31:15,867
some of those donuts, and while 
we were taking a break here, I 

1563
02:31:16,069 --> 02:31:19,519
got a Tweet from Dawn that 
students at a watch party in 

1564
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:22,515
Virginia Beach, not too far away
were also snacking during their 

1565
02:31:22,675 --> 02:31:26,633
breaks, again, we appreciate all
the folks joining us online, 

1566
02:31:26,834 --> 02:31:35,570
hopefully you online as he well 
as you listening here, thank you

1567
02:31:36,173 --> 02:31:39,310
for that. The next speaker is 
coming from

1568
02:31:43,488 --> 02:31:48,974
nationwide, Andy Kettell and  
David Westin . And thread Intel 

1569
02:31:49,181 --> 02:31:54,462
is in their presentation title, 
so probably no surprise that I 

1570
02:31:54,864 --> 02:31:59,332
had the community on this one 
because they have so much 

1571
02:31:59,734 --> 02:32:03,877
communication on how to use 
thread Intel to prioritize your

1572
02:32:09,487 --> 02:32:11,523
uses, and I appreciate the 
success they have had, as well 

1573
02:32:11,727 --> 02:32:14,976
as some of the rocky starts they
had and the challenges they had 

1574
02:32:15,177 --> 02:32:19,061
when they were getting started. 
So please join me in welcoming 

1575
02:32:19,243 --> 02:32:21,243
David and Andy.

1576
02:32:28,582 --> 02:32:30,614
>> All right, good morning, 
Katie thank you very much for 

1577
02:32:30,815 --> 02:32:33,050
the introduction, we are excited
to be here today to talk about 

1578
02:32:33,812 --> 02:32:35,812
nationwide operationalizing

1579
02:32:38,738 --> 02:32:41,171
on ATT&CK, like any good story, 
it started off with a lot of 

1580
02:32:41,373 --> 02:32:43,404
promise, how great this could be
for the organization and we 

1581
02:32:44,155 --> 02:32:46,655
tried  to do it in our own 
environment and realized how 

1582
02:32:46,870 --> 02:32:49,944
tough it was and we tried our 
own ways and ended up realizing,

1583
02:32:50,110 --> 02:32:52,347
going into despair, realizing we
had no idea what we were doing 

1584
02:32:53,113 --> 02:32:55,395
and realizing the enormity of 
the situation in getting to a 

1585
02:32:55,596 --> 02:33:00,679
point where we almost gave up on
MITRE  ATT&CK  and almost threw 

1586
02:33:00,879 --> 02:33:06,767
it into the trash because we 
didn't know how to get value out

1587
02:33:06,969 --> 02:33:08,969
of this. Then we stumbled upon 
this thing called intelligence, 

1588
02:33:09,001 --> 02:33:11,436
and shed some light on how we 
could go about doing this, gave 

1589
02:33:11,650 --> 02:33:13,670
us some focus, gave us some 
privatization, it allowed us to 

1590
02:33:13,884 --> 02:33:16,014
see the light to seize the day,

1591
02:33:21,389 --> 02:33:23,389
and ultimately being able to 
operationalize this within our 

1592
02:33:23,780 --> 02:33:28,103
own environment. So not quite a 
Halloween story but we are very 

1593
02:33:28,304 --> 02:33:30,326
excited about the journey we 
have been on over the last 

1594
02:33:30,541 --> 02:33:32,975
several years and to be able to 
talk to you today about that. 

1595
02:33:33,176 --> 02:33:34,944
First we are going to hit our 
introductions here. 

1596
02:33:34,945 --> 02:33:40,899
>> I am Andy Kettell, I have 
been  in I.T. security for the 

1597
02:33:41,096 --> 02:33:47,999
past 4 years, I'm also the 
ATT&CK champion, spreading  all 

1598
02:33:48,212 --> 02:33:50,212
the goodness we can do with 
ATT&CK. 

1599
02:33:50,287 --> 02:33:52,287
>> And

1600
02:33:54,916 --> 02:33:59,279
I ended up joining nationwide in

1601
02:34:04,054 --> 02:34:06,290
2018 and I've been there since 
then, we have a couple other 

1602
02:34:06,491 --> 02:34:08,726
folks who have been on this 
journey, one of the big key 

1603
02:34:08,927 --> 02:34:11,362
lessons that we learned is that 
it just can't be a couple folks 

1604
02:34:11,563 --> 02:34:14,126
doing this, we have had quite 
the village helping us out

1605
02:34:19,898 --> 02:34:22,132
in the past year in particular, 
one of our associates is across 

1606
02:34:22,332 --> 02:34:23,952
town right now getting another 
presentation at another 

1607
02:34:23,953 --> 02:34:25,785
conference, very similar to the 
presentation we are getting 

1608
02:34:25,786 --> 02:34:31,474
here, so we also have the 
Columbus laboratory, it is one 

1609
02:34:31,675 --> 02:34:33,675
of the largest

1610
02:34:36,144 --> 02:34:38,144
in Columbus, Ohio to focus on 
cyber security challenges, that 

1611
02:34:38,178 --> 02:34:44,065
is another topic that we would 
love to chat with you about. We 

1612
02:34:44,266 --> 02:34:46,704
are going to start by focusing 
on how it didn't work and I'm 

1613
02:34:46,917 --> 02:34:50,967
going to give this over to Andy.
>> With many organizations, 

1614
02:34:51,169 --> 02:34:57,472
getting started can be quite 
challenging, understanding what 

1615
02:34:57,874 --> 02:35:00,471
ATT&CK is, who should we 
involve? How do we use this? 

1616
02:35:04,579 --> 02:35:06,612
Those are a few questions we 
wanted to answer, we put 

1617
02:35:06,813 --> 02:35:09,204
together a project with the 
approach of looking at taking 

1618
02:35:09,352 --> 02:35:11,352
the

1619
02:35:13,313 --> 02:35:15,347
MITRE techniques and lining them
up with our security tools and 

1620
02:35:15,547 --> 02:35:17,547
also the focus of testing the 
endpoints to identify any 

1621
02:35:17,580 --> 02:35:22,663
potential security threats.  So 
we started off squishy, that is 

1622
02:35:22,864 --> 02:35:28,749
a great name, we ended up with 
members of ATT&CK and the 

1623
02:35:28,963 --> 02:35:30,963
penetration team  coming 
together and

1624
02:35:36,067 --> 02:35:38,902
we were high-energy, excited, we
ended up with all the techniques

1625
02:35:39,118 --> 02:35:43,375
in the minor framework we had 
the security tools to look at 

1626
02:35:43,575 --> 02:35:45,717
and we have all these techniques
we wanted to

1627
02:35:50,694 --> 02:35:52,926
assess. We started off testing 
each technique one at a time, we

1628
02:35:53,127 --> 02:35:55,976
went very deep and very wide in 
those techniques, sometimes 

1629
02:35:56,177 --> 02:35:58,177
knocking down lines of defense 
on endpoints and retesting it 

1630
02:35:58,210 --> 02:36:02,476
again and again. A great 
approach, very thorough, we got 

1631
02:36:02,933 --> 02:36:06,944
a lot of good understanding 
about how the ATT&CK  techniques

1632
02:36:07,144 --> 02:36:09,144
operated but then leadership 
started coming to us saying, are

1633
02:36:09,741 --> 02:36:14,006
we done testing techniques? What
are the results? And then we 

1634
02:36:14,166 --> 02:36:16,166
started understanding

1635
02:36:20,751 --> 02:36:22,751
a few months into the project 
that the current methodologies 

1636
02:36:22,784 --> 02:36:24,619
and approaches will probably 
take several years going through

1637
02:36:24,621 --> 02:36:27,454
this and it wasn't working out. 
So for the first attempt, we 

1638
02:36:27,655 --> 02:36:30,504
learned a lot of what to do and 
what not to do with the MITRE 

1639
02:36:31,266 --> 02:36:36,389
framework . The primary thing 
is, there was a lack of focus, 

1640
02:36:36,601 --> 02:36:41,070
when we get done with testing a 
technique, we went forward and 

1641
02:36:41,270 --> 02:36:44,656
grabbed another technique, maybe
it was something we heard in the

1642
02:36:44,851 --> 02:36:48,174
news, an approach that some he 
wanted to test out. We didn't 

1643
02:36:48,374 --> 02:36:50,607
really have that focus that 
really drove a lot of this, we 

1644
02:36:51,358 --> 02:36:55,640
also weren't really formalized 
and how we wanted to document 

1645
02:36:55,883 --> 02:36:57,883
this, we went

1646
02:37:01,780 --> 02:37:04,014
forward testing out a technique 
and when we were done we moved 

1647
02:37:04,227 --> 02:37:06,227
onto another one but we really 
didn't capture consistently how 

1648
02:37:06,248 --> 02:37:10,470
the results were done. That also
led to a lack of participation 

1649
02:37:10,615 --> 02:37:12,615
because while the

1650
02:37:19,052 --> 02:37:20,922
team was working on it, the 
other engineers were 

1651
02:37:20,924 --> 02:37:22,907
participating but they weren't 
able to be active in the 

1652
02:37:22,908 --> 02:37:25,077
project. We had some 
participation that came up as 

1653
02:37:25,227 --> 02:37:29,010
well.
>> By the summer of 2018, we 

1654
02:37:29,211 --> 02:37:34,697
have been trying to 
operationalize MITRE  ATT&CK  

1655
02:37:35,098 --> 02:37:37,098
for a few months, and

1656
02:37:42,816 --> 02:37:44,848
the framework was going into the
trash, we had no excitement, 

1657
02:37:45,048 --> 02:37:47,282
nobody really understood what it
could do for us, none of our 

1658
02:37:47,482 --> 02:37:49,932
leadership could find value in 
what we were trying to do. So I 

1659
02:37:50,132 --> 02:37:54,802
like stories, stories help 
embrace new concepts, as well as

1660
02:37:55,002 --> 02:37:57,790
tricky concepts and one of the 
challenges we were having is we 

1661
02:37:57,942 --> 02:38:00,491
couldn't tell our story for what
we were trying to do with 

1662
02:38:00,691 --> 02:38:04,346
ATT&CK, if you asked  what our 
story was back in the summer of 

1663
02:38:04,546 --> 02:38:06,546
2018, it would be something 
similar to this. Hey, boss, 

1664
02:38:06,582 --> 02:38:08,888
we've got this 240 some odd

1665
02:38:13,281 --> 02:38:15,115
techniques that tell you 
everything that all actors are 

1666
02:38:15,116 --> 02:38:17,859
going to be able to do in our 
environment, we have looked

1667
02:38:23,436 --> 02:38:25,471
through those, I think we are 
pretty good against most of 

1668
02:38:25,672 --> 02:38:27,672
those techniques, we've got some
other ones we could probably 

1669
02:38:27,706 --> 02:38:30,344
work on and we are going to deep
dive into a couple of techniques

1670
02:38:30,557 --> 02:38:32,993
and see what we can come up 
with. Kind of boring, not really

1671
02:38:33,194 --> 02:38:35,026
giving excitement, not giving 
what leadership needs which is 

1672
02:38:35,027 --> 02:38:38,879
an understanding of what is 
going to affect him in his job. 

1673
02:38:39,080 --> 02:38:41,080
Let's change the story. So,

1674
02:38:44,366 --> 02:38:46,546
we added intelligence and the 
story started sounding like 

1675
02:38:46,694 --> 02:38:49,847
this. Our research indicates 
that there are 27 actors that 

1676
02:38:50,047 --> 02:38:52,181
are known to target similar 
peers in the finance

1677
02:38:57,164 --> 02:38:59,164
insurance industry, those actors
are known to use 91 specific 

1678
02:38:59,198 --> 02:39:01,014
techniques in our attack, 
additionally, we can further 

1679
02:39:01,015 --> 02:39:03,015
prioritize those techniques 
based on widespread use

1680
02:39:08,534 --> 02:39:11,170
, we are going to test those 91 
techniques and we are going to 

1681
02:39:11,383 --> 02:39:13,383
come up with medications and 
detections, we are going to 

1682
02:39:13,416 --> 02:39:15,416
protect against the most likely 
threat actors that are facing 

1683
02:39:15,999 --> 02:39:20,921
our industry. That is a lot 
better story, that tells senior 

1684
02:39:21,134 --> 02:39:23,155
leadership, it gets them excited
about what is most likely to 

1685
02:39:23,369 --> 02:39:25,402
affect them and affect our 
country company and what is 

1686
02:39:25,603 --> 02:39:29,613
going to keep our company safe.

1687
02:39:34,739 --> 02:39:36,973
Okay, so the process that we 
ended up using at nationwide was

1688
02:39:37,174 --> 02:39:39,174
a five-step process, we are 
going to talk about the 

1689
02:39:39,607 --> 02:39:45,707
intelligence failures but I will
say the best thing is that once 

1690
02:39:45,907 --> 02:39:47,907
we figure out the threat

1691
02:39:53,630 --> 02:39:55,248
intelligence phase, everything 
else will fall into place. 

1692
02:39:55,249 --> 02:39:57,496
Really, that was the roadmap 
that we used and once we have 

1693
02:39:57,697 --> 02:39:59,718
that down, everything was pretty
simple. I talked a second ago 

1694
02:39:59,931 --> 02:40:02,701
about 27 threat actors, that is 
what we were focused on at 

1695
02:40:02,840 --> 02:40:08,858
nationwide, and how we got there
was almost pure luck, in the 

1696
02:40:09,073 --> 02:40:14,146
summer of 2018 we had an intern 
and we gave her a typical 

1697
02:40:14,547 --> 02:40:16,547
project, go figure out all the 
threats that could potentially 

1698
02:40:17,151 --> 02:40:19,628
affect nationwide. We did this 
project completely separate from

1699
02:40:20,390 --> 02:40:26,743
MITRE  ATT&CK, if you  remember 
at the time, that was going 

1700
02:40:26,945 --> 02:40:29,983
nowhere, we were basically 
getting ready to scrap that. And

1701
02:40:30,197 --> 02:40:33,650
when we put them together, that 
is when we realized we had a lot

1702
02:40:33,851 --> 02:40:39,135
going for the organization. She 
went out and she did a lot of 

1703
02:40:39,336 --> 02:40:41,454
open-source research and she 
ended up finding the spreadsheet

1704
02:40:42,173 --> 02:40:47,660
out there that had a couple 
hundred different threat actors,

1705
02:40:47,861 --> 02:40:49,861
the spreadsheet had a number of 
different tabs based on 

1706
02:40:49,894 --> 02:40:52,484
geographic location, it had a 
whole bunch of columns that we 

1707
02:40:52,633 --> 02:40:57,613
mentioned a threat actors has 12
or 13 other names, and it had 

1708
02:40:57,813 --> 02:41:02,286
columns for those. But it had a 
really unique column that talked

1709
02:41:02,486 --> 02:41:05,737
about the industries that they 
were known to target. We saw 

1710
02:41:05,937 --> 02:41:08,585
that as something that we could 
take advantage of our 

1711
02:41:08,785 --> 02:41:12,650
organization. We did a lot more 
research, we fine-tuned the 

1712
02:41:12,850 --> 02:41:18,334
spreadsheet, we added a few 
actors that we know about that 

1713
02:41:18,536 --> 02:41:20,971
weren't on there, we cleaned up 
some of the work that was in 

1714
02:41:21,171 --> 02:41:23,565
there, we had this big 
spreadsheet of data, so we 

1715
02:41:23,712 --> 02:41:28,689
needed to make this more 
valuable to nationwide. That is 

1716
02:41:28,889 --> 02:41:31,338
where we came up with a scoring 
system like you see on the 

1717
02:41:31,538 --> 02:41:35,696
screen. It is very basic, all we
did was started taking a look at

1718
02:41:36,008 --> 02:41:40,421
guessing at what each of the 
threat actors capability and 

1719
02:41:40,571 --> 02:41:42,571
intent work.

1720
02:41:47,584 --> 02:41:49,819
We are a US-based company, so if
the threat actor was targeting 

1721
02:41:50,019 --> 02:41:52,654
overseas and not in the U.S., we
are not going to care about it 

1722
02:41:52,869 --> 02:41:56,921
as much, if they are targeting, 
if they are financially 

1723
02:41:57,134 --> 02:41:59,168
motivating, we will give them 
one point. If they are targeting

1724
02:41:59,368 --> 02:42:01,368
the finance and endurance

1725
02:42:04,039 --> 02:42:08,503
insurance industry, we will give
them a point. The point is it 

1726
02:42:08,704 --> 02:42:10,704
wasn't very scientific, it was 
just

1727
02:42:13,989 --> 02:42:16,425
like, let's go throw a number on
there and we didn't worry about 

1728
02:42:17,188 --> 02:42:19,273
being exact on that. Same thing 
with capability, as we went 

1729
02:42:19,474 --> 02:42:21,474
through the research

1730
02:42:25,363 --> 02:42:27,197
and we were studying the 
different threat actors and 

1731
02:42:27,198 --> 02:42:29,013
somebody came out and said, 
these are very sophisticated 

1732
02:42:29,014 --> 02:42:31,408
threat actors, we would give 
them more points. And 

1733
02:42:31,551 --> 02:42:34,711
ultimately, if they had 
additional resources behind 

1734
02:42:34,912 --> 02:42:39,582
them, we would give them a few 
more points again, on a scale of

1735
02:42:39,783 --> 02:42:42,536
1 to 5. If we haven't seen

1736
02:42:47,100 --> 02:42:49,134
any activity in the last six 
months, 12 months, we would 

1737
02:42:49,335 --> 02:42:51,335
start taking away a half-point 
here or there.

1738
02:42:56,037 --> 02:42:59,895
So ultimately we have this great
spreadsheet now, we've got a 

1739
02:43:00,094 --> 02:43:02,541
bunch of numbers on it but it 
isn't telling the full story. So

1740
02:43:02,742 --> 02:43:04,742
what we realized,

1741
02:43:08,227 --> 02:43:10,249
we need to do what any 
self-respecting shop is going to

1742
02:43:10,465 --> 02:43:12,899
do, we put it into a chart. 
>> It is a very bright chart 

1743
02:43:13,100 --> 02:43:17,969
indeed, we have taken threat 
intelligence and visualized the 

1744
02:43:18,170 --> 02:43:21,021
actors and we have quickly 
learned a lot about the 

1745
02:43:21,222 --> 02:43:23,222
adversaries, one thing we picked
up

1746
02:43:26,507 --> 02:43:28,542
was that they were evenly spread
across the chart and they 

1747
02:43:28,743 --> 02:43:30,977
weren't clustered into one area,
this is the first time we were 

1748
02:43:31,178 --> 02:43:36,861
able to take threat intelligence
MD MITRE  ATT&CK framework and 

1749
02:43:37,062 --> 02:43:40,313
bring awareness to the security 
teams  and the leadership who 

1750
02:43:40,514 --> 02:43:42,702
especially liked the chart 
because it really brought home 

1751
02:43:42,856 --> 02:43:48,390
almost a face to the actors that
are operating against us. As 

1752
02:43:48,540 --> 02:43:50,540
many

1753
02:43:52,710 --> 02:43:54,528
professionals want to evaluate 
every single technique, every 

1754
02:43:54,530 --> 02:43:56,966
single threat and tool, 
following this approach, we are 

1755
02:43:57,180 --> 02:44:02,251
able to take that down to the 
top 27 actors that are operating

1756
02:44:03,015 --> 02:44:08,751
against us. We are able to look 
at the TTP's that they are using

1757
02:44:08,953 --> 02:44:10,953
and we want to give those the 
highest prioritization and 

1758
02:44:10,987 --> 02:44:15,053
understanding of how they are 
working against us. Now, we are 

1759
02:44:15,812 --> 02:44:20,938
armed with a focus, we know who 
we are going to go after and we 

1760
02:44:21,139 --> 02:44:24,287
know who we are looking into and
we can move on to the what. 

1761
02:44:24,289 --> 02:44:34,096
>> We went back to the MITRE  
ATT&CK  website, so we went to 

1762
02:44:34,281 --> 02:44:36,281
the ATT&CK 

1763
02:44:41,187 --> 02:44:43,187
navigators

1764
02:44:46,741 --> 02:44:49,940
, and you put in a threat actor 
and it gives you all the 

1765
02:44:50,091 --> 02:44:52,091
techniques

1766
02:44:55,476 --> 02:44:57,094
associated with that, there are 
27 different techniques 

1767
02:44:57,095 --> 02:44:59,127
associated with them. But we 
realized with 27, not all of 

1768
02:44:59,329 --> 02:45:01,764
them were on the MITRE  ATT&CK  
site, we used our own 

1769
02:45:01,978 --> 02:45:05,829
intelligence collection service,
and any of the other typical 

1770
02:45:06,244 --> 02:45:10,298
services are going to be able to
give you a simpler similar 

1771
02:45:10,498 --> 02:45:12,498
capability, to understand how 
the

1772
02:45:15,998 --> 02:45:18,226
anatomy is and the techniques 
associated with that. So we 

1773
02:45:18,428 --> 02:45:20,428
spent a lot of time,

1774
02:45:25,332 --> 02:45:27,166
we grabbed research from our 
friends at the Columbus 

1775
02:45:27,167 --> 02:45:32,653
laboratory, we threw it all 
together in a big pile. But we 

1776
02:45:32,841 --> 02:45:35,291
are not so worried about being 
right or wrong, so much as we 

1777
02:45:35,491 --> 02:45:37,524
are trying to get as much 
information on each of these 

1778
02:45:37,725 --> 02:45:39,725
actors as possible. We started 
off by putting everything into 

1779
02:45:39,758 --> 02:45:41,758
ATT&CK  navigator and we 
realized

1780
02:45:47,882 --> 02:45:50,114
we wanted to shape the data a 
little bit different, we wanted 

1781
02:45:50,315 --> 02:45:52,347
to put a heat map for the 
widespread use of certain 

1782
02:45:52,548 --> 02:45:54,581
techniques so we exported all of
that into a spreadsheet because 

1783
02:45:54,784 --> 02:45:56,784
we like spreadsheets and we 
ended up with something that 

1784
02:45:56,812 --> 02:45:59,259
looks like this. All of the 
yellow where we had one or two 

1785
02:45:59,460 --> 02:46:02,096
actors that were using a 
technique, that are closer to 

1786
02:46:02,297 --> 02:46:09,002
read, we had more that were 
using those techniques. But 

1787
02:46:09,764 --> 02:46:11,764
still clunky

1788
02:46:14,889 --> 02:46:17,536
, it is still messy, we are 
still not able to tell the full 

1789
02:46:17,738 --> 02:46:19,738
story. And the problem is

1790
02:46:24,239 --> 02:46:26,474
that you are still talking to 
this huge spreadsheet and it is 

1791
02:46:26,673 --> 02:46:28,904
still cluttered with a bunch of 
information, so we are going to 

1792
02:46:29,119 --> 02:46:31,352
remove all of the techniques 
that we are not going to focus 

1793
02:46:31,554 --> 02:46:33,554
on. Now you get what Blake 
mentioned earlier about not 

1794
02:46:33,587 --> 02:46:36,229
being able to put all of your 
MITRE  ATT&CK  on one slide, 

1795
02:46:36,424 --> 02:46:39,474
these are things that we care 
about at our organization. And I

1796
02:46:39,674 --> 02:46:45,157
have presented this to the CIO 
as far as on a PowerPoint slide 

1797
02:46:45,358 --> 02:46:51,045
similar to this, and it is 
unlike trying to get what MITRE 

1798
02:46:51,796 --> 02:46:53,796
ATT&CK 

1799
02:47:02,430 --> 02:47:04,451
looks like in one area. We 
started with 240 techniques and 

1800
02:47:04,665 --> 02:47:07,101
we had no idea where to start, 
now we have 91 techniques, we 

1801
02:47:07,301 --> 02:47:09,738
have some tactics that only have
four that we need to focus on, 

1802
02:47:09,939 --> 02:47:12,174
this is something that you can 
get into, you are taking that 

1803
02:47:12,374 --> 02:47:16,444
first bite of the apple, you 
need to take it before anything 

1804
02:47:16,645 --> 02:47:19,292
can move on, and this enabled us
to do that. In our mind, this 

1805
02:47:19,493 --> 02:47:23,349
was the most important thing for
us, to get to this point. Once 

1806
02:47:23,550 --> 02:47:28,220
we had 91 techniques, everything
else, to my favorite action 

1807
02:47:28,421 --> 02:47:32,890
character growing up, G.I. Joe, 
knowing is half the battle and 

1808
02:47:33,104 --> 02:47:35,104
quite honestly, that is true.

1809
02:47:42,240 --> 02:47:44,875
The next thing we needed to do 
was put that into the rest of 

1810
02:47:45,076 --> 02:47:47,322
the process, we talked about the
five step process that we had, 

1811
02:47:47,524 --> 02:47:49,545
once we had this, everything 
else really just fell right into

1812
02:47:49,759 --> 02:47:51,994
place. The next thing that we 
did with each of those 91 

1813
02:47:52,195 --> 02:47:54,232
techniques was to test those, we
had the penetration team at 

1814
02:47:54,429 --> 02:47:57,988
nationwide that ended up testing
these but the atomic red dream

1815
02:48:01,938 --> 02:48:04,374
team Scripps used the majority 
of these to be able to test so 

1816
02:48:04,588 --> 02:48:08,643
you don't necessarily need your 
ATT&CK  penetration to do this. 

1817
02:48:08,843 --> 02:48:12,910
As we tested these, there were 
some things that did work in our

1818
02:48:13,111 --> 02:48:15,505
environment and some things that
didn't work in our environment, 

1819
02:48:15,654 --> 02:48:18,998
and for those things that we 
were able to execute in the 

1820
02:48:19,211 --> 02:48:23,384
environment, we went back to the
website and pulled out each

1821
02:48:26,924 --> 02:48:28,553
detection and each 
recommendation we put on a 

1822
02:48:28,554 --> 02:48:33,623
separate line of the spreadsheet
and we then used that and we 

1823
02:48:33,837 --> 02:48:35,455
started working with our 
infrastructure folks and started

1824
02:48:35,456 --> 02:48:38,307
talking to them. In our 
environment, can we execute this

1825
02:48:38,507 --> 02:48:43,702
recommendation? If we could not,
we would modify that in some way

1826
02:48:45,611 --> 02:48:51,299
that would work for us. So a lot
of the recommendations were 

1827
02:48:51,517 --> 02:48:53,529
secure, very easy to do in the 
environment, and there were 

1828
02:48:53,743 --> 02:48:55,764
other things we couldn't do 
because of the way our network 

1829
02:48:55,977 --> 02:48:58,213
was set up, and some other 
things we realized that if we 

1830
02:48:58,976 --> 02:49:02,586
put together, we could get 
funding for that.

1831
02:49:06,738 --> 02:49:08,868
If these are threat actors that 
are specifically targeting

1832
02:49:12,837 --> 02:49:15,366
our industry, we might be able 
to get those projects started.

1833
02:49:19,129 --> 02:49:21,362
We kept everything close hold, 
we classified a lot of the data 

1834
02:49:21,563 --> 02:49:24,815
that was coming out of there, so
only a few people knew what was 

1835
02:49:25,566 --> 02:49:30,702
going on. Well only a few people
knowing what is going on doesn't

1836
02:49:30,916 --> 02:49:33,151
get people excited about what we
are doing here. We would split 

1837
02:49:33,352 --> 02:49:35,373
the script, we told everybody, 
we had weekly updates where we 

1838
02:49:36,123 --> 02:49:39,854
would share them here are the 
techniques we tested, here's 

1839
02:49:40,054 --> 02:49:42,181
what we were successful on, here
are the mitigations

1840
02:49:50,212 --> 02:49:52,446
detections and here is what we 
are doing about that, we had 

1841
02:49:52,646 --> 02:49:54,477
monthly meetings with executive 
leaders where they had the 

1842
02:49:54,478 --> 02:49:56,499
opportunity to help us questions
and understand what this was and

1843
02:49:56,713 --> 02:49:58,948
how we were implementing it. 
When we were done with the first

1844
02:49:59,148 --> 02:50:01,983
phase, we said we needed to go 
on a road show so we spent two 

1845
02:50:02,198 --> 02:50:03,615
months going throughout 
nationwide talking about MITRE 

1846
02:50:03,616 --> 02:50:07,672
ATT&CK, walking through  the 91 
techniques and showing them 

1847
02:50:08,086 --> 02:50:11,123
where we are protecting 
nationwide against the most 

1848
02:50:11,336 --> 02:50:14,374
likely actors to target our 
industry. We also took it on the

1849
02:50:14,588 --> 02:50:18,440
road outside nationwide, we've 
also got somebody over at 

1850
02:50:18,642 --> 02:50:23,114
another conference talking about
ATT&CK , but that was one of the

1851
02:50:23,315 --> 02:50:25,500
things that we found was very 
beneficial for operationalizing 

1852
02:50:25,646 --> 02:50:34,086
this. So, where do we end up 
with all of this? With a lot of 

1853
02:50:34,287 --> 02:50:36,321
work. There was a lot of 
recommendations that came out of

1854
02:50:36,522 --> 02:50:39,973
the work we did, we have 
implemented a lot of the 

1855
02:50:40,173 --> 02:50:42,206
projects we are working on right
now but most importantly we 

1856
02:50:42,407 --> 02:50:44,407
ended up with a change in our 
culture

1857
02:50:50,530 --> 02:50:53,178
so if you would have asked me 18
months ago what our culture was 

1858
02:50:53,379 --> 02:50:55,379
at nationwide I would tell you 
it was a compliance-based 

1859
02:50:55,415 --> 02:50:58,463
culture. If you ask me today, we
are talking about intelligence 

1860
02:50:58,667 --> 02:51:00,667
driven operations, we focus on 
what is the most important 

1861
02:51:00,696 --> 02:51:04,146
threat to our environment and we
go out and we take the security 

1862
02:51:04,347 --> 02:51:08,412
controls and cover against the 
most likely threats, that is a 

1863
02:51:08,613 --> 02:51:13,896
huge change and that is because 
of what we did because we 

1864
02:51:14,098 --> 02:51:16,098
started prioritizing, because we
focused our efforts on those 

1865
02:51:16,129 --> 02:51:19,479
threat actors and techniques 
that were targeting our network.

1866
02:51:22,014 --> 02:51:26,499
So, are we done? We've got a 
bunch more that we are doing and

1867
02:51:26,712 --> 02:51:30,569
I'm going to show you a few 
things. The chart we had 

1868
02:51:30,766 --> 02:51:36,454
earlier, that was just the first
go, we winged it. I'm not going 

1869
02:51:36,654 --> 02:51:42,354
to lie, we basically said, let's
just throw this out and see what

1870
02:51:42,554 --> 02:51:44,587
happens. Over time, we have 
found that we have gotten a 

1871
02:51:44,788 --> 02:51:48,853
better understanding of certain 
actors that are targeting us, we

1872
02:51:49,054 --> 02:51:51,076
threw this up about six months 
ago, but we realize that 

1873
02:51:51,290 --> 02:51:54,944
obviously with MITRE  coming out
with new techniques, we always 

1874
02:51:55,701 --> 02:52:02,046
have to reiterate through this 
and we had 19 new techniques 

1875
02:52:02,248 --> 02:52:05,912
that came out of this the time 
that we updated this chart. We 

1876
02:52:06,112 --> 02:52:11,597
went ahead and tested those and 
put in new mitigations and 

1877
02:52:11,798 --> 02:52:14,030
detections on those and we are 
constantly reviewing that on a 

1878
02:52:14,245 --> 02:52:18,510
monthly and quarterly basis. We 
talked earlier about 

1879
02:52:18,711 --> 02:52:20,529
prioritization of the 
techniques, so we talked about 

1880
02:52:20,531 --> 02:52:23,583
widespread use is that we 
prioritized and we have looked 

1881
02:52:23,781 --> 02:52:33,530
at it again and said, it is not 
only easy task execution, but we

1882
02:52:33,745 --> 02:52:35,745
have added the 19

1883
02:52:42,271 --> 02:52:44,505
new once we have done now. This 
enables us to have that 

1884
02:52:44,706 --> 02:52:46,741
conversation, now I can have a 
conversation if there are two 

1885
02:52:46,941 --> 02:52:48,774
different projects that need 
funding or resources, was that 

1886
02:52:48,775 --> 02:52:50,799
project dealing with one of 
these techniques or one that is 

1887
02:52:50,999 --> 02:52:52,999
89 or 90 on the ranking chart?

1888
02:53:04,204 --> 02:53:06,238
This is something that we didn't
have before, we couldn't have 

1889
02:53:06,438 --> 02:53:08,438
those conversations and quite 
honestly, we were spending a lot

1890
02:53:08,472 --> 02:53:10,503
of time focusing on techniques 
that didn't matter to us at 

1891
02:53:10,705 --> 02:53:12,705
nationwide and now every single 
time we talked about new 

1892
02:53:12,741 --> 02:53:14,357
projects, we talked about 
privatization, where does that 

1893
02:53:14,358 --> 02:53:15,991
rank as far as priority. 
>> Intelligence driving 

1894
02:53:15,992 --> 02:53:18,940
security, this has me excited 
the most, as a lot of us receive

1895
02:53:20,056 --> 02:53:23,910
our news from intelligence 
feeds, it is typically just 

1896
02:53:24,110 --> 02:53:28,580
threat actors, what they are 
doing, maybe some malware, and a

1897
02:53:28,780 --> 02:53:31,276
little story of what happened, 
they get into an environment, 

1898
02:53:31,628 --> 02:53:35,079
the normal stories that we 
typically hear. We are taking 

1899
02:53:35,280 --> 02:53:37,829
that intelligence and we are 
combining it with the ATT&CK  

1900
02:53:38,129 --> 02:53:42,953
framework to capture a strong 
message that goes across the 

1901
02:53:43,112 --> 02:53:46,009
entire information

1902
02:53:49,701 --> 02:53:53,368
, we still have information 
about what that attack is, we 

1903
02:53:53,770 --> 02:53:56,003
include a visual representation 
of how the attack was executed 

1904
02:53:56,204 --> 02:54:00,070
but now we lay out technique by 
technique how that attack was 

1905
02:54:00,471 --> 02:54:02,471
informed. We are

1906
02:54:05,139 --> 02:54:08,192
handing this off to one of our 
security engineers. They know 

1907
02:54:08,392 --> 02:54:12,249
our environment, they know a 
lines of defense. Taking 

1908
02:54:12,463 --> 02:54:14,797
information like this, 
intelligence driven and adding

1909
02:54:18,547 --> 02:54:20,995
MITRE to that, they can start 
looking at, where do I need to 

1910
02:54:21,196 --> 02:54:23,949
step in?  And we found that to 
be a huge success.

1911
02:54:28,917 --> 02:54:31,561
So, key takeaways, lessons 
learned from the first project 

1912
02:54:31,976 --> 02:54:36,031
helped drive some of the 
behaviors and the project that 

1913
02:54:36,247 --> 02:54:41,741
we took on, the key is focus. 
Documentation of how we are 

1914
02:54:41,929 --> 02:54:45,380
going to do the assessment 
process was key and involving a 

1915
02:54:45,582 --> 02:54:49,437
large team of people, I know one
of our feedback we heard from 

1916
02:54:49,651 --> 02:54:53,604
the first project was that 
ATT&CK  would go off and

1917
02:54:59,192 --> 02:55:01,425
do a finding and throw that onto
the organization. Here on this 

1918
02:55:01,626 --> 02:55:03,659
project, they were involved on 
day one, and we were also 

1919
02:55:03,860 --> 02:55:06,709
spreading the good news about 
what ATT&CK can do for them, the

1920
02:55:06,910 --> 02:55:09,749
other key take away  was 
involving leadership, when they 

1921
02:55:09,963 --> 02:55:13,158
are on board on a weekly basis 
and we have quarterly readouts 

1922
02:55:13,320 --> 02:55:18,686
to major findings or 
recommendations we come up with,

1923
02:55:18,900 --> 02:55:21,335
but involving them on a constant
basis was invaluable.

1924
02:55:21,489 --> 02:55:26,822
>> So that is our story, I think
we've got a couple minutes if 

1925
02:55:27,024 --> 02:55:29,024
there's anybody that has any 
questions.

1926
02:55:39,211 --> 02:55:41,756
>> Thank you for sharing that, 
as you implemented these 91

1927
02:55:45,914 --> 02:55:48,148
controls, did you get any other 
benefits? Did the red team quit 

1928
02:55:48,347 --> 02:55:50,347
because they couldn't hack into 
anymore? Were there too many 

1929
02:55:50,382 --> 02:55:51,946
alerts? What were some of the 
other effects? 

1930
02:55:51,947 --> 02:55:57,699
>> For us, the effect was just, 
for a lot of the changes we had 

1931
02:55:57,899 --> 02:56:00,483
to implement, those teams were 
overwhelmed, they had a lot of 

1932
02:56:00,639 --> 02:56:03,733
news coming at them, a lot of 
changes going, here we are 

1933
02:56:03,909 --> 02:56:07,439
saying, I need these 
recommendations done because we 

1934
02:56:07,640 --> 02:56:12,922
have 27 threat actors that are 
operating and coming at us, to 

1935
02:56:13,124 --> 02:56:15,359
help prioritize the work they 
needed to do, it also wasn't one

1936
02:56:16,125 --> 02:56:18,125
of those,

1937
02:56:21,254 --> 02:56:23,691
we have to find it and sold it, 
this was a real-world attack 

1938
02:56:23,891 --> 02:56:26,125
that was coming at us, so that 
helped drive the behavior and 

1939
02:56:26,876 --> 02:56:30,596
the thinking. They felt engaged,
they felt they were on board the

1940
02:56:31,346 --> 02:56:34,248
whole process.
>> I think that is the most 

1941
02:56:34,462 --> 02:56:37,913
exciting thing, people believed 
in what they are doing, they 

1942
02:56:38,114 --> 02:56:40,707
believe and why they need to 
make these changes to the 

1943
02:56:40,867 --> 02:56:45,630
environment. So, before we did 
this, we would get a lot of 

1944
02:56:45,831 --> 02:56:47,831
pushback from the infrastructure
folks, we were adding work to 

1945
02:56:47,866 --> 02:56:51,718
the workload, now we are talking
about, here is a threat to your 

1946
02:56:51,931 --> 02:56:54,638
environment, it is not just a 
regulatory piece, this is an 

1947
02:56:54,968 --> 02:56:59,038
actual actor that is known to 
target this area and we are 

1948
02:56:59,239 --> 02:57:01,270
putting in controls to stop 
that, that tells a much better 

1949
02:57:01,472 --> 02:57:03,472
story for them

1950
02:57:06,889 --> 02:57:12,595
.
>> It seems like one of your 

1951
02:57:12,750 --> 02:57:17,922
successes was filtering 
according to industry, I was 

1952
02:57:18,122 --> 02:57:21,172
wondering if you think maybe 
that is something the community 

1953
02:57:21,374 --> 02:57:28,026
can add to navigator, just like 
where we can break it down

1954
02:57:32,144 --> 02:57:34,377
to actors, maybe we can gather 
Intel and break it down into 

1955
02:57:34,578 --> 02:57:36,975
industries to help others get 
back pass that learning curve, 

1956
02:57:37,126 --> 02:57:43,928
maybe? I will let MITRE take 
that one on  him about one of 

1957
02:57:44,128 --> 02:57:46,128
the biggest concerns by doing 
this is, there are 266 

1958
02:57:46,162 --> 02:57:48,162
techniques, what about those 
other

1959
02:57:51,448 --> 02:57:53,448
ones? What are

1960
02:58:03,021 --> 02:58:05,021
we doing with those other 
techniques? We don't want to 

1961
02:58:05,053 --> 02:58:07,289
forget about those other ones 
and that is the sequel to some 

1962
02:58:07,489 --> 02:58:09,928
of the stuff we are doing, we 
are going back and going through

1963
02:58:10,128 --> 02:58:12,160
some of the other techniques. I 
would be a little hesitant 

1964
02:58:12,361 --> 02:58:14,999
because it gave us a start but 
we still need to go through some

1965
02:58:15,216 --> 02:58:20,696
of the other techniques. 
>> I will jump in and say it is 

1966
02:58:20,898 --> 02:58:22,715
really tough, because sometimes 
in the open source reports, 

1967
02:58:22,717 --> 02:58:24,717
those industries aren't always 
identified so you're going to be

1968
02:58:24,750 --> 02:58:30,069
hearing from my colleague, we 
are going to talk about it, and 

1969
02:58:30,269 --> 02:58:32,303
hopefully we can get some of 
that industry data to do 

1970
02:58:32,507 --> 02:58:34,538
something along the lines of 
what you asked about. Thank you 

1971
02:58:34,740 --> 02:58:36,740
Andy and David for a great talk.

1972
02:58:42,249 --> 02:58:44,280
So, the debate over spreadsheets
is heating up online, I'm glad 

1973
02:58:44,494 --> 02:58:48,548
David is on team Katie here, but
we have some spreadsheet haters,

1974
02:58:48,748 --> 02:58:53,831
so I need to chat with you 
during the break and we will 

1975
02:58:54,233 --> 02:58:56,680
convert you all and shout out to
them for a great talk on 

1976
02:58:56,880 --> 02:59:01,148
prioritizing a value project and
a great project name, Squishee ,

1977
02:59:01,349 --> 02:59:06,968
that was new for me. My pleasure
to introduce our next presenter,

1978
02:59:07,447 --> 02:59:09,447
Philippe Langlois  and

1979
02:59:18,754 --> 02:59:25,521
Joshua Franklin, this helps play
a better role in why defense is 

1980
02:59:25,722 --> 02:59:27,954
needed, but it is sometimes 
tough, how does that fit in with

1981
02:59:28,719 --> 02:59:33,237
the controls? We hope that 
Philip and Joshua will give us 

1982
02:59:33,438 --> 02:59:36,488
some insights into that topic. 
Please join me in welcoming 

1983
02:59:36,689 --> 02:59:42,174
Philip and Joshua. 
>> Thank you so much. All right,

1984
02:59:42,375 --> 02:59:46,239
I am formally from CIS, Josh is 
from current CIS and when 

1985
02:59:46,439 --> 02:59:49,489
choosing a presentation, don't 
include your previous employer 

1986
02:59:49,891 --> 02:59:51,891
in the title when you are 
presenting

1987
02:59:55,994 --> 02:59:58,628
but, I wanted to give a big 
thank you to Verizon, when we do

1988
02:59:58,829 --> 03:00:00,461
this presentation, this is 
something I worked pretty 

1989
03:00:00,462 --> 03:00:04,516
extensively on with my time at 
CIS, so this is more of a 

1990
03:00:04,716 --> 03:00:06,716
journey, let's go together. 
>> My name is

1991
03:00:10,406 --> 03:00:12,797
Joshua Franklin, I am the 
product owner of the CIS 

1992
03:00:12,945 --> 03:00:16,453
controls, I did 10 years in the 
federal government, most of it 

1993
03:00:16,608 --> 03:00:24,989
at NIST. If you have your 
favorite, I probably wrote that 

1994
03:00:25,149 --> 03:00:34,175
one. I also did a lot of telecom
work on mobile ATT&CK, so that  

1995
03:00:34,576 --> 03:00:36,576
is very important.

1996
03:00:40,264 --> 03:00:41,635
I am a cyber security standard 
sky. 

1997
03:00:41,637 --> 03:00:45,550
>> As mentioned, I am currently 
the Verizon DBIR  co-author, I 

1998
03:00:45,751 --> 03:00:47,751
started in September

1999
03:00:50,623 --> 03:00:53,672
and I'm going to keep on this as
long as I can, I was a product 

2000
03:00:53,874 --> 03:00:56,925
owner for the controls and I did
a lot of things in terms of 

2001
03:00:57,126 --> 03:00:59,106
doing assessments for helping 
organizations understand their 

2002
03:00:59,107 --> 03:01:02,740
security posture. I can maybe 
code myself out of it.

2003
03:01:07,082 --> 03:01:09,117
So one of the consistent 
problems we have seen, we like 

2004
03:01:09,520 --> 03:01:12,059
to fall under the defenders 
dilemma

2005
03:01:22,107 --> 03:01:24,107
, so as a defender,

2006
03:01:29,426 --> 03:01:31,660
there is a lot of complexity to 
the problem, the biggest problem

2007
03:01:31,860 --> 03:01:34,498
is really, how do I know what 
the right thing to do is? There 

2008
03:01:34,712 --> 03:01:36,712
is 1 million different options,

2009
03:01:39,780 --> 03:01:41,813
there's a lot of different 
options and a lot of different 

2010
03:01:42,014 --> 03:01:44,752
possibilities and things you can
do. The next part of the problem

2011
03:01:50,951 --> 03:01:56,244
, how do I demonstrate to others
I have done the right thing? 

2012
03:01:56,647 --> 03:01:58,680
Because you may figure it out 
for yourself but you have 

2013
03:01:58,881 --> 03:02:03,150
internal stakeholders that need 
to have confidence in you, and 

2014
03:02:03,351 --> 03:02:05,351
you need external stakeholders 
to have confidence in you, so 

2015
03:02:05,373 --> 03:02:08,171
that is what CIS is focused on 
is addressing these types of 

2016
03:02:08,337 --> 03:02:13,306
questions.
>> So, who is CIS? We are a 

2017
03:02:13,508 --> 03:02:17,777
nonprofit based out of Albany, 
New York, basically we have both

2018
03:02:17,977 --> 03:02:24,879
an operations side and a best 
practices and policies side. 

2019
03:02:25,842 --> 03:02:34,432
Next slide, a lot of folks know 
is because operationally, we run

2020
03:02:34,632 --> 03:02:36,669
the multistate information 
sharing and analysis Center, we 

2021
03:02:36,867 --> 03:02:38,867
basically have a whole bunch of 
sensors and

2022
03:02:43,570 --> 03:02:47,308
we can basically let them know 
that we have been popped.

2023
03:02:53,108 --> 03:02:59,562
We have both the benchmarks and 
the CIS controls in terms of 

2024
03:02:59,718 --> 03:03:03,879
benchmarks, basically pick your 
favorite and we have some cyber 

2025
03:03:04,080 --> 03:03:07,266
security super hyper detailed 
guidance for how to configure 

2026
03:03:07,472 --> 03:03:09,472
it.

2027
03:03:12,004 --> 03:03:17,233
I like to say they don't break 
stuff as much.

2028
03:04:43,328 --> 03:04:47,740
We have the implementation 
groups. Basically taking all of 

2029
03:04:47,948 --> 03:04:57,533
the 171 CIS sub controls and 
splitting them into hard. We are

2030
03:04:57,734 --> 03:05:02,205
preaching everyone at the very 
least should be connecting 

2031
03:05:02,405 --> 03:05:06,467
implementation group 1. That is 
what we are defining his basic 

2032
03:05:07,228 --> 03:05:11,742
cyber hygiene. A lot of folks 
use that word but they all mean 

2033
03:05:12,155 --> 03:05:16,204
different things. Basic cyber 
hygiene means this.  

2034
03:05:16,356 --> 03:05:19,609
>> In terms of creating best 
practices, there is really a 

2035
03:05:19,782 --> 03:05:22,911
spectrum. We are in the early 
phases of developing best 

2036
03:05:23,111 --> 03:05:25,111
practices is a community.

2037
03:05:27,986 --> 03:05:30,218
CIS controls is community built.
A lot of smart people that were 

2038
03:05:30,978 --> 03:05:36,723
behind it. You bring smart 
people together and you say what

2039
03:05:36,966 --> 03:05:40,132
you need to be doing? Do we get 
started, and as we grow as an 

2040
03:05:40,280 --> 03:05:42,953
industry we have to start 
looking at how can we find the 

2041
03:05:43,105 --> 03:05:47,470
data to support our position? 
How do we know what are the 

2042
03:05:48,233 --> 03:05:52,144
actual shifts and changes in the
trends in terms of adversaries? 

2043
03:05:52,544 --> 03:05:58,635
This is kind of the of a complex
problem. Especially as we scale,

2044
03:05:58,837 --> 03:06:03,708
we still bring in our biases. We
have inherent biases in terms of

2045
03:06:03,910 --> 03:06:05,910
what is going on.

2046
03:06:08,984 --> 03:06:11,428
But that is not necessarily with
the date is going to be showing.

2047
03:06:11,628 --> 03:06:13,859
What we want to do is move us 
towards a data-driven model 

2048
03:06:14,059 --> 03:06:16,304
versus controls. That's where we
want to go and start looking at 

2049
03:06:16,504 --> 03:06:18,504
testing. Creating hypothesis. 
Does this recommendation 

2050
03:06:19,088 --> 03:06:24,824
actually prevent we are planning
to prevent? What brought us to 

2051
03:06:25,585 --> 03:06:28,672
the pre-attack. We have taken a 
couple stabs at this initiative.

2052
03:06:28,888 --> 03:06:33,347
Start looking at how can we can 
get good understanding for what 

2053
03:06:33,547 --> 03:06:35,994
is happening for adversaries? 
The first one we created was 

2054
03:06:36,194 --> 03:06:41,671
released in 2016. It realized a 
killed chain of the cyber 

2055
03:06:41,872 --> 03:06:46,131
notion. And also the NIST cyber 
security framework. It was 

2056
03:06:46,344 --> 03:06:48,519
really about helping 
organizations understand the 

2057
03:06:48,675 --> 03:06:53,649
trade-offs. What is the right 
thing to do and how much do I 

2058
03:06:53,850 --> 03:06:57,907
need to do it? As a community we
can also do this together. Don't

2059
03:06:58,120 --> 03:07:01,700
have to figure it out on our 
own. Can actually collaborate on

2060
03:07:01,888 --> 03:07:06,440
initiative. Not every 
organization has access to the 

2061
03:07:06,641 --> 03:07:10,903
brainpower in this room. Right? 
We are very fortunate. Are very 

2062
03:07:11,517 --> 03:07:15,978
specialized people. At the end 
of the day that is not the 

2063
03:07:16,178 --> 03:07:19,840
access most organizations have. 
So we are trying to look at this

2064
03:07:20,040 --> 03:07:24,301
from an industry perspective. 
How can we benefit everyone? Our

2065
03:07:24,502 --> 03:07:27,348
understanding, the general 
trends, we can start help 

2066
03:07:27,548 --> 03:07:29,176
organizations make those 
decisions without having to have

2067
03:07:29,177 --> 03:07:37,096
a large staff. So this is what 
it looks like. Version 1. As you

2068
03:07:37,297 --> 03:07:39,940
can tell it has a killed chain 
like style phase in the top. And

2069
03:07:40,141 --> 03:07:42,141
then you have the

2070
03:07:47,053 --> 03:07:48,877
NIST cyber security security 
functions. Control do one of 

2071
03:07:48,878 --> 03:07:51,042
five things, help you detect, 
protect, respond, recover and 

2072
03:07:51,207 --> 03:07:54,516
identify. This is honestly our 
first cut. It's an ongoing 

2073
03:07:54,667 --> 03:07:58,630
process. From there we 
identified what controls do a 

2074
03:07:58,830 --> 03:08:02,839
different steps in the process. 
So that if maybe you can 

2075
03:08:02,999 --> 03:08:08,324
implement application white 
listing, it may be an 

2076
03:08:08,472 --> 03:08:10,198
alternative control can help 
either in front of the process 

2077
03:08:10,199 --> 03:08:13,246
later in the process. It's all 
about making educated decisions 

2078
03:08:13,446 --> 03:08:17,107
in terms of what the overall 
control selection is. However, 

2079
03:08:17,868 --> 03:08:21,661
their limitations. Not every 
attack will follow that pattern.

2080
03:08:24,617 --> 03:08:26,647
When I joined the team, let's 
look at literature. What is 

2081
03:08:26,847 --> 03:08:30,306
everyone writing about? What are
they saying in terms of trends? 

2082
03:08:30,508 --> 03:08:37,617
Really great resources some from
Verizon, obviously, and other 

2083
03:08:38,018 --> 03:08:41,075
resources out there. How can we 
go and make sense of this? All 

2084
03:08:41,276 --> 03:08:44,012
right, so for six months I went 
through every single report.

2085
03:08:52,234 --> 03:08:53,615
And codified every single 
finding.  

2086
03:08:53,616 --> 03:08:55,616
>> Superfund?  
>> It was super fun. It takes a 

2087
03:08:55,695 --> 03:08:57,726
large amount of resources. But 
that is how you can leverage 

2088
03:08:58,485 --> 03:09:01,733
these things. But it's not 
really scalable. Reviewing these

2089
03:09:01,881 --> 03:09:06,999
time-consuming, some of these 
reports tend to be marketing 

2090
03:09:07,144 --> 03:09:11,321
focused. Which is fine, it's a 
marketing tool. And sometimes 

2091
03:09:11,535 --> 03:09:14,580
it's difficult to understand the
underlying data. Every 

2092
03:09:14,780 --> 03:09:17,016
organization has a different 
view of the same problem. How do

2093
03:09:17,212 --> 03:09:22,088
we actually go and make sense of
all these different views? And 

2094
03:09:22,291 --> 03:09:26,964
how can we really leverage them?
So thankfully, ATT&CK came 

2095
03:09:27,727 --> 03:09:32,857
along.  And helped us get a 
better understanding as to what 

2096
03:09:33,058 --> 03:09:38,952
is going on. We can start 
looking at this and look at 

2097
03:09:39,156 --> 03:09:41,383
ATT&CK as a standard language 
for adversaries are doing.  It 

2098
03:09:41,583 --> 03:09:47,075
is been evolving over time. 
Mitigations I think are very big

2099
03:09:47,276 --> 03:09:49,909
improvement in that. Now we can 
start looking at very tangible 

2100
03:09:50,109 --> 03:09:53,157
objects within the framework. 
It's not this thing we have to 

2101
03:09:53,922 --> 03:09:59,048
pull out from text, we can start
looking at it, we can start 

2102
03:09:59,249 --> 03:10:01,492
tying it back to controls. Which
will help us at least understand

2103
03:10:02,242 --> 03:10:04,242
the relationship between 
mitigations and controls we 

2104
03:10:04,482 --> 03:10:10,374
recommend to MITRE.  And then 
this is obviously a giant 

2105
03:10:10,523 --> 03:10:13,676
eyechart. This is to prove we 
did it. We will be releasing 

2106
03:10:14,434 --> 03:10:18,750
this publicly in the next few 
weeks.  

2107
03:10:18,904 --> 03:10:20,904
>> A couple months.  
>> A few weeks, tomorrow. Asked 

2108
03:10:20,981 --> 03:10:25,655
Josh he will give it to you in a
drive. The idea is we can tie 

2109
03:10:25,854 --> 03:10:31,543
back our content. We set 
prioritization matters. And this

2110
03:10:31,743 --> 03:10:36,216
is the first six controls. As it
ties back to mitigations and as 

2111
03:10:36,417 --> 03:10:43,323
is mitigations tieback to the 
techniques. However there are 

2112
03:10:43,524 --> 03:10:48,599
still limitations. It doesn't 
really tell us where to start. 

2113
03:10:48,800 --> 03:10:50,230
We are assuming our 
prioritization scheme is 

2114
03:10:50,231 --> 03:10:54,292
correct. Maybe it is, maybe it 
isn't. So what we want to do is 

2115
03:10:54,493 --> 03:10:59,506
a second version of the 
community ATT&CK model.  Next 

2116
03:10:59,655 --> 03:11:04,796
slide. So we are revamping the 
community ATT&CK model. 

2117
03:11:10,940 --> 03:11:12,940
We wanted to be founded in 
MITRE. It provides a 

2118
03:11:12,970 --> 03:11:15,000
standardized language. We can 
all tie into it.  Is a 

2119
03:11:15,201 --> 03:11:17,444
conference about it. There's a 
good way to sneak in here and 

2120
03:11:17,646 --> 03:11:20,289
talk about this,  it ties into 
ATT&CK. But also helps us  talk 

2121
03:11:20,490 --> 03:11:26,369
the same language. So what we 
have done is -- okay. The timer 

2122
03:11:26,584 --> 03:11:31,182
is finally up-to-date. Longest 
women in the world. So,

2123
03:11:35,306 --> 03:11:37,336
what the community ATT&CK model 
is going to be an understanding 

2124
03:11:37,549 --> 03:11:39,782
of what are the most common 
things happening.  What are the 

2125
03:11:39,982 --> 03:11:43,639
techniques involved with those 
common occurrences? And what are

2126
03:11:43,839 --> 03:11:46,485
the controls? So as we are 
moving and progressing, it says 

2127
03:11:46,685 --> 03:11:49,934
controls are an evolving thing. 
On the verge of seven, Josh, 

2128
03:11:50,693 --> 03:11:57,445
tomorrow writing version 8 after
he updates and publishes. But 

2129
03:11:57,645 --> 03:12:00,288
next year he will be working on 
the next iteration. So how can 

2130
03:12:00,488 --> 03:12:03,331
we start using the data and 
understanding of what's 

2131
03:12:03,533 --> 03:12:08,407
happening in the industry? Part 
of that, we have to tie our 

2132
03:12:08,621 --> 03:12:11,454
contents together which we have 
done. So we have a mapping of 

2133
03:12:11,668 --> 03:12:17,348
controls to the technique and 
controls to the mitigations. The

2134
03:12:17,548 --> 03:12:19,993
next thing we wanted to start 
looking at the data. Right? What

2135
03:12:20,194 --> 03:12:24,868
are the techniques that are most
commonly used? So there are 

2136
03:12:25,618 --> 03:12:29,532
different ways to look at 
prioritization. So obviously I 

2137
03:12:29,746 --> 03:12:34,208
want to be an artist. But this 
is an issue where we can start 

2138
03:12:34,410 --> 03:12:37,056
looking at the MITRE data.  It 
warrants a bit more insight than

2139
03:12:37,257 --> 03:12:43,349
I have done. If you can look at 
MITRE attack as graphs , there 

2140
03:12:43,549 --> 03:12:46,192
are a lot of neat things you can
start looking at. Or the most 

2141
03:12:46,393 --> 03:12:50,667
commonly used techniques? There 
are also issues with this 

2142
03:12:50,868 --> 03:12:57,298
approach. Is limiting. There is 
very much a focus on APT.  Each 

2143
03:12:57,456 --> 03:13:02,040
citation tends to be different. 
Different groups or tools, that 

2144
03:13:02,240 --> 03:13:06,704
is not what is hurting most 
people. So there is very much a 

2145
03:13:06,904 --> 03:13:12,196
focus in terms of that. But it's
a starting point. I actually 

2146
03:13:12,396 --> 03:13:16,256
have the data in graphic format 
if anyone is ever interested. 

2147
03:13:16,657 --> 03:13:19,502
Talk to me and I will post it on
Twitter or whatever and get it 

2148
03:13:19,704 --> 03:13:23,965
out there.  
>> Yeah, so, as you said dated 

2149
03:13:24,178 --> 03:13:28,188
is very important. And so 
through the MSI our operational 

2150
03:13:28,339 --> 03:13:34,526
fund, we have lots and lots of 
data with basically sensors in a

2151
03:13:34,741 --> 03:13:37,585
lot of state local counties. And
we're basically able to leverage

2152
03:13:38,346 --> 03:13:42,865
that data to see if the controls
we are recommending make a lot 

2153
03:13:43,466 --> 03:13:48,636
of sense. And so here are the --
this is the top 10 malware

2154
03:13:54,238 --> 03:13:56,065
witnessed is reporting. This 
information gets posted on our 

2155
03:13:56,067 --> 03:13:59,211
blog every once in a while. But 
we can say maybe

2156
03:14:03,376 --> 03:14:06,166
we want the CIS controls to 
mitigate these top 10 pieces of 

2157
03:14:06,318 --> 03:14:11,302
malware. If we want that, how do
we check that out? If you sort 

2158
03:14:11,503 --> 03:14:15,042
of overlay all of the at least 
six of these

2159
03:14:18,609 --> 03:14:22,471
attack matrices over one 
another, we basically want to 

2160
03:14:22,672 --> 03:14:24,905
make sure we have a control that
basically mitigates each of 

2161
03:14:25,666 --> 03:14:28,768
these techniques. And so, that 
is something we are really going

2162
03:14:29,525 --> 03:14:34,196
to be thinking is one of the 
most important outputs for the 

2163
03:14:34,349 --> 03:14:44,198
community model. We have 20 

2164
03:14:44,399 --> 03:14:48,674
controls. But we actually have 
171 sub controls. A lot of the 

2165
03:14:48,874 --> 03:14:52,523
sub controls have kind of made 
their way into the CIS controls 

2166
03:14:53,273 --> 03:15:01,461
over time. And sometimes it sort
of feels like techno, a mixture 

2167
03:15:01,674 --> 03:15:07,970
of magic and tech. There's they 
are there because a smart person

2168
03:15:08,731 --> 03:15:12,030
said so. They should basically 
be there. We want to figure out 

2169
03:15:12,231 --> 03:15:16,038
which ATT&CK pass  we want the 
CIS controls to mitigate 

2170
03:15:16,214 --> 03:15:21,975
against. It is more than just 
the top 10 malware. There is 

2171
03:15:22,390 --> 03:15:27,803
fishing cream, also accidental 
incidents. We're basically 

2172
03:15:27,968 --> 03:15:29,968
defining the top

2173
03:15:33,360 --> 03:15:36,607
ATT&CK pass inside of the 
community ATT&CK model  that the

2174
03:15:36,808 --> 03:15:38,808
CIS controls are going to defend
against.  

2175
03:15:38,953 --> 03:15:43,913
>> The ATT&CK pass are looking 
at the sequence of events. We 

2176
03:15:44,116 --> 03:15:46,559
have a tendency  to look at them
as individual moments. But 

2177
03:15:46,759 --> 03:15:50,418
there's really a series. 
Sequence of things that occurs. 

2178
03:15:50,819 --> 03:15:52,819
Part of that is also 
preconditions for those things 

2179
03:15:53,211 --> 03:15:56,920
to occur. As we are starting to 
look through the understanding, 

2180
03:15:57,322 --> 03:16:01,996
this technique requires 
administrative privileges. 

2181
03:16:02,396 --> 03:16:04,750
Requires system-level access. Or
such and such.

2182
03:16:08,284 --> 03:16:10,528
Well, what is the thing that 
happened prior to that for them 

2183
03:16:10,729 --> 03:16:12,960
to get that level of access? So 
we start understanding what is 

2184
03:16:13,710 --> 03:16:19,667
the sequence. We can't defend 
against all the techniques. 

2185
03:16:20,068 --> 03:16:22,068
Right? But they're probably a 
handful of techniques that are 

2186
03:16:22,099 --> 03:16:25,443
more commonly used effectively. 
That we don't know that.

2187
03:16:29,008 --> 03:16:31,038
Is a community that's we want to
move towards, understanding what

2188
03:16:31,238 --> 03:16:33,238
are the most common techniques, 
what should everyone be 

2189
03:16:33,628 --> 03:16:37,946
defending against? And that's 
what the controls would be 

2190
03:16:38,147 --> 03:16:40,736
looking to do as part of the 
community ATT&CK model.  

2191
03:16:40,881 --> 03:16:46,279
>> Yet, so we are basically 
going to be embarking on this 

2192
03:16:46,481 --> 03:16:52,574
journey of figuring out what 
these top ATT&CK paths are.  

2193
03:16:52,975 --> 03:16:55,620
There are a bunch of different 
ways we could be doing this. 

2194
03:16:55,820 --> 03:17:00,648
What were the largest breaches 
ever? Maybe it was based on the 

2195
03:17:00,804 --> 03:17:06,991
criticality of the assets that 
were affected. Did these 

2196
03:17:07,192 --> 03:17:13,222
breaches cost a bunch of money? 
Did Brian blog about it way too 

2197
03:17:13,369 --> 03:17:17,147
much? There are a whole bunch of
different criteria that we can 

2198
03:17:17,348 --> 03:17:22,225
use for basically inclusion. Of 
these attack paths. To sort of 

2199
03:17:22,626 --> 03:17:27,908
take a small bite of that, since
Phil is here there is a really 

2200
03:17:28,121 --> 03:17:34,414
nice Verizon report out there 
that basically says 28% of all 

2201
03:17:34,615 --> 03:17:40,657
breaches can be attributed to 
malware. About 30% of those 

2202
03:17:40,804 --> 03:17:45,475
breaches can be attributed to 
ransomware. Let's take a quick 

2203
03:17:45,638 --> 03:17:54,519
look at this and see how we 
would use ATT&CK here.  Here is 

2204
03:17:54,733 --> 03:17:58,994
want to cry. It does a bunch of 
things but what is the important

2205
03:17:59,195 --> 03:18:05,846
thing that makes it ransomware? 
We can see data encrypted for 

2206
03:18:06,037 --> 03:18:10,978
impact, highlighted in the top 
right and inhibit system 

2207
03:18:11,178 --> 03:18:13,178
recovery in the bottom right. Ex
slide.

2208
03:18:17,408 --> 03:18:19,408
For the

2209
03:18:22,552 --> 03:18:26,214
NotPetya we see the data 
encrypted. At the very least  we

2210
03:18:26,415 --> 03:18:28,648
want to make sure we have a CAS 
control the basically mitigates 

2211
03:18:28,848 --> 03:18:31,896
that in some sort of 
authoritative data set that is 

2212
03:18:32,097 --> 03:18:36,708
justifying the sub control 
existence. I would like to point

2213
03:18:36,892 --> 03:18:42,054
out that there is ransomware on 
mobile. And they have an 

2214
03:18:42,816 --> 03:18:49,576
encrypted file there. At the 
same type of thing is not inside

2215
03:18:49,777 --> 03:18:59,114
a mobile attack. I'm just drying
a mobile attack is out there. 

2216
03:18:59,315 --> 03:19:01,960
Don't forget it's really 
important. Cool. So, we have 

2217
03:19:02,161 --> 03:19:05,411
already seen some of the tech 
patterns we are really 

2218
03:19:05,824 --> 03:19:13,136
interested in. So MITRE has two 
mitigations  associated to the 

2219
03:19:13,337 --> 03:19:18,778
data encrypted for impact 
technique. We have five sub 

2220
03:19:18,991 --> 03:19:23,896
controls that could potentially 
help out here. But specifically 

2221
03:19:24,849 --> 03:19:30,405
only 10 out one and cannot five 
only mitigate this individual 

2222
03:19:31,356 --> 03:19:35,425
attack pattern. The big question
here next is do we need sub 

2223
03:19:35,581 --> 03:19:41,975
controls 2, 3 and 4? It's worth 
taking a step back and going 

2224
03:19:42,176 --> 03:19:46,239
through the big exercise. We're 
basically going to be using 

2225
03:19:46,652 --> 03:19:48,652
ATT&CK to do that. 

2226
03:19:52,130 --> 03:19:57,003
>> So this is what we try to do 
in terms of CIS. Find a way to 

2227
03:19:57,217 --> 03:19:59,648
bridge our operations and 
policy. And do it at scale. In a

2228
03:19:59,849 --> 03:20:02,898
day we want to make sure our 
recommendations, CIS controls 

2229
03:20:03,661 --> 03:20:07,615
are benchmarks that can tie back
to something consistent. This is

2230
03:20:08,133 --> 03:20:11,637
our pipedream of having a 
community ATT&CK model obviously

2231
03:20:11,874 --> 03:20:17,318
powered by  ATT&CK be that 
translation point.  Where the 

2232
03:20:17,532 --> 03:20:21,792
instant response can codify and 
tell us how trends are changing 

2233
03:20:22,551 --> 03:20:27,430
the patterns. There is a finite 
number of patterns. 266 

2234
03:20:27,615 --> 03:20:30,933
patterns. They're probably only 
going to be a handful. We don't 

2235
03:20:31,134 --> 03:20:35,599
know that yet because we're in 
the early phases. But I think 

2236
03:20:35,813 --> 03:20:38,446
that's what we need to move 
forward. Really understanding 

2237
03:20:38,860 --> 03:20:42,108
what things are most in common, 
can we start as a community and 

2238
03:20:42,322 --> 03:20:46,772
address them together? Next 
steps, Josh?  

2239
03:20:46,961 --> 03:20:54,895
>> We are going to be developing
the CIS community attack model. 

2240
03:20:55,312 --> 03:20:59,774
We are looking to basically get 
it out sometime later this year 

2241
03:20:59,974 --> 03:21:03,437
or early next year. I don't 
think Phil knew that. It's not 

2242
03:21:03,638 --> 03:21:07,699
his fault. We are looking for 
folks to contribute. So if you 

2243
03:21:08,460 --> 03:21:16,640
have data, if you have a lot of 
knowledge in specialization like

2244
03:21:16,840 --> 03:21:20,088
in this area, if you just like 
to talk loudly, we want folks to

2245
03:21:20,289 --> 03:21:26,794
basically chip in. This is a 
community driven standard. So 

2246
03:21:26,994 --> 03:21:28,994
reach out to us at

2247
03:21:33,024 --> 03:21:35,256
controls info@CISsecurity.org.  
>> Or workbench.  

2248
03:21:35,415 --> 03:21:41,829
>> I will get you hooked up.  
>> That's it. It looks like we 

2249
03:21:42,029 --> 03:21:45,890
have a few --  
>> We had 45 minutes of content 

2250
03:21:46,091 --> 03:21:49,379
we got into -- this is awesome. 
>> Questions?

2251
03:21:56,246 --> 03:21:58,246
>> You guys are so loud.

2252
03:22:02,944 --> 03:22:08,020
>> Thinking about soft of these 
communities of people who do the

2253
03:22:08,236 --> 03:22:13,515
day to date threat defense and 
Intel and network defense are 

2254
03:22:13,715 --> 03:22:16,725
often separate from the controls
folks. What have you seen there?

2255
03:22:19,406 --> 03:22:22,252
What can you comment on and what
you think the rest of us can do 

2256
03:22:22,453 --> 03:22:24,485
to help you bridge those? 
Anything you can comment on for 

2257
03:22:24,686 --> 03:22:26,797
that?  
>> That is a really good point. 

2258
03:22:27,480 --> 03:22:32,960
There definitely two separate 
communities. And, events like 

2259
03:22:33,117 --> 03:22:35,117
this

2260
03:22:38,090 --> 03:22:41,752
both halves together, I would 
say in the best practices and 

2261
03:22:42,512 --> 03:22:45,560
standard side, we need this 
communities help to make sure 

2262
03:22:45,714 --> 03:22:53,664
everyone is able to leverage 
these free, large, open control 

2263
03:22:53,818 --> 03:22:58,002
frameworks. Things will get 
better unless we all pitch in.  

2264
03:22:58,541 --> 03:23:03,585
>> To build on what Josh is 
saying, the problem is complex.

2265
03:23:07,348 --> 03:23:09,348
Cyber security is complex. 
Otherwise we wouldn't have jobs.

2266
03:23:09,349 --> 03:23:11,808
It touches a lot of different 
fields as well. The more we can 

2267
03:23:12,022 --> 03:23:14,022
speak a standardized language, 
the better it is. However, if 

2268
03:23:14,041 --> 03:23:17,500
you talk to legal and risk, and 
you start talking about 

2269
03:23:18,261 --> 03:23:23,181
individual techniques, that is 
not always going to translate. I

2270
03:23:23,395 --> 03:23:25,777
think we start looking at 
abstraction when we talk about 

2271
03:23:25,936 --> 03:23:27,936
patterns.

2272
03:23:29,894 --> 03:23:31,894
A phenomenal job about during 
the extraction, what are the 

2273
03:23:31,925 --> 03:23:34,770
things we are concerned about? 
That is key. Is a community we 

2274
03:23:34,972 --> 03:23:37,203
can come together and figure out
what are the things we can 

2275
03:23:37,966 --> 03:23:40,789
extract out? From a threat 
intelligence, obviously tracking

2276
03:23:43,298 --> 03:23:46,226
[Indiscernible] is a big part of
your job. However, that is not 

2277
03:23:46,377 --> 03:23:50,207
the only thing impacting people.
When you start looking at the 

2278
03:23:50,407 --> 03:23:52,407
different languages and 
standardize, it will be much 

2279
03:23:52,531 --> 03:23:54,566
bigger.  
>>

2280
03:24:06,460 --> 03:24:08,771
Okay. There we go. I just wanted
to know

2281
03:24:12,352 --> 03:24:14,585
, maybe just real quick because 
I know you're running out of 

2282
03:24:14,786 --> 03:24:17,017
time, a little more about how 
you decide where things fall on 

2283
03:24:17,218 --> 03:24:21,279
the implementation levels. That 
was the only part I was a little

2284
03:24:21,494 --> 03:24:24,540
lost on.  
>> That is a whole other talk. 

2285
03:24:24,943 --> 03:24:29,341
So the invitation groups were 
anything that CIS rolled out in 

2286
03:24:29,497 --> 03:24:35,098
April. It basically took about a
year. There was, there were 

2287
03:24:35,299 --> 03:24:39,561
literally hundreds of people in 
the community that basically, it

2288
03:24:39,775 --> 03:24:43,424
was a standards development. It 
was a bunch of folks kind of 

2289
03:24:44,188 --> 03:24:46,188
arguing about

2290
03:24:48,100 --> 03:24:50,947
what makes the most sense. I see
this a lot. I see this a lot. 

2291
03:24:51,148 --> 03:24:54,194
That is definitely sometimes 
foldable to the you know, 

2292
03:24:54,595 --> 03:25:00,122
loudest voice in the room right?
That is one of the big hopes we 

2293
03:25:00,286 --> 03:25:02,932
are going to get out of this is 
that we will basically be able 

2294
03:25:03,534 --> 03:25:10,240
to reassess we have the right 
sub controls in the super, super

2295
03:25:10,440 --> 03:25:13,035
basic group. Sort of smaller 
businesses and smaller 

2296
03:25:13,180 --> 03:25:17,486
organizations. It's going to be 
a big effort.  

2297
03:25:17,647 --> 03:25:23,244
>> As we set up a criteria, 
basically, the resources, what 

2298
03:25:23,444 --> 03:25:27,308
do we expect them to have? In 
terms of I.T. and specializing 

2299
03:25:27,509 --> 03:25:32,386
in cyber security. And then what
is the potential impact, right? 

2300
03:25:32,586 --> 03:25:36,234
So if someone is responsible for
a critical piece of the 

2301
03:25:36,449 --> 03:25:40,710
structure, getting away with the
bear minimum is necessarily good

2302
03:25:40,910 --> 03:25:43,404
enough. We took that into 
consideration. So far we have 

2303
03:25:43,556 --> 03:25:47,100
gotten feedback on it. Yes, sir.
>>

2304
03:25:59,598 --> 03:26:01,831
I will ask it quickly. The 
question I have, are there 

2305
03:26:02,045 --> 03:26:04,880
controls we have in place today 
that are doing such a great job 

2306
03:26:05,080 --> 03:26:07,080
that ATT&CK 

2307
03:26:09,357 --> 03:26:11,322
techniques aren't even showing 
up in the framework?  

2308
03:26:11,323 --> 03:26:14,223
>> So I have another slide that 
looked at some of the different 

2309
03:26:14,973 --> 03:26:19,272
controls and application white 
listing is one of these that 

2310
03:26:19,437 --> 03:26:23,438
comes up very frequently. As 
being very effective. However, 

2311
03:26:23,773 --> 03:26:28,099
it is also very hard to do. It 
takes a lot of resources to do. 

2312
03:26:28,249 --> 03:26:30,249
But it is

2313
03:26:35,148 --> 03:26:37,594
one that ties back, just look at
the mitigation, it ties back to 

2314
03:26:37,795 --> 03:26:39,824
Lotta mitigation. I don't have 
the exact number but I have 

2315
03:26:40,025 --> 03:26:42,025
something, administrative 
privileges, general 

2316
03:26:42,056 --> 03:26:44,701
configuration and then 
application.  

2317
03:26:44,852 --> 03:26:47,747
>> There are also a lot of sub 
controls the don't have a direct

2318
03:26:47,947 --> 03:26:52,624
correlation. Stuff like, 
accidental errors, fires, 

2319
03:26:52,826 --> 03:26:59,121
floods, acts of God, aliens, 
those sorts of things. Will 

2320
03:26:59,322 --> 03:27:01,767
Smith. All of that.  
>> A great note to end on. Will 

2321
03:27:01,969 --> 03:27:04,812
Smith. Thank you so much 
Philippe Langlois and Joshua 

2322
03:27:05,576 --> 03:27:09,026
Franklin.   
>> [Applause]   

2323
03:27:09,171 --> 03:27:14,250
>> We have a little more to come
on the controls topic. Make sure

2324
03:27:17,604 --> 03:27:19,635
you to catch my teammate Mike 
long who's been looking into 

2325
03:27:19,836 --> 03:27:22,280
this from a ATT&CK  perspective 
to bring the communities 

2326
03:27:22,482 --> 03:27:24,836
together. We are starting to see
seems. I love how they talked 

2327
03:27:24,991 --> 03:27:28,176
about the data driven approach 
against biases. Anytime someone 

2328
03:27:28,937 --> 03:27:33,039
benches biases it's a great 
topic for threat Intel and this 

2329
03:27:33,254 --> 03:27:35,254
conference. Moving on to our 
next speaker,

2330
03:27:39,337 --> 03:27:41,782
Tony Lambert from Red Canary. A 
lot of things I love about this 

2331
03:27:41,983 --> 03:27:44,632
talk.  Those of you who know 
ATT&CK  pretty well know we are 

2332
03:27:44,828 --> 03:27:49,089
strong on Windows, maybe not so 
much on the next. He is actively

2333
03:27:49,853 --> 03:27:53,353
looking at that in the 
community, another theme in the 

2334
03:27:53,968 --> 03:27:55,968
talk is alert double.

2335
03:28:01,691 --> 03:28:04,887
20 is going to walk us through 
some tips. I want to thank him 

2336
03:28:05,029 --> 03:28:10,354
for contributing to the 
suppository.  

2337
03:28:10,508 --> 03:28:16,669
>> [Indiscernible-low volume].  
>> With that please join me in 

2338
03:28:16,830 --> 03:28:19,008
welcoming Tony Lambert. 
>> [Applause]  

2339
03:28:26,870 --> 03:28:30,129
>> So this talk kind of started 
off with a nebulous sort of 

2340
03:28:30,731 --> 03:28:35,006
cloudy mission from one of the 
managers at Red Canary. If 

2341
03:28:35,217 --> 03:28:40,284
you've ever met Joe, he has the 
propensity to talk with his 

2342
03:28:40,484 --> 03:28:44,145
hands waving all the time, he 
looks like a windmill. When he 

2343
03:28:44,346 --> 03:28:47,392
talked to his he said, we have a
lot of people asking about Linux

2344
03:28:48,153 --> 03:28:52,103
coverage.  We want to expand 
things and make things better. 

2345
03:28:52,470 --> 03:28:56,935
As we did more research, we 
started looking at, what public 

2346
03:28:57,700 --> 03:29:00,885
research existed, and there's 
not a lot of public research 

2347
03:29:01,211 --> 03:29:03,844
except for a few notable 
instances people talk about 

2348
03:29:04,044 --> 03:29:06,233
their data server Linux 

2349
03:29:10,146 --> 03:29:12,514
systems being breached. Everyone
and their brother has an IOP 

2350
03:29:12,681 --> 03:29:17,256
device that has been breached. 
We can glean some things from 

2351
03:29:17,457 --> 03:29:19,488
that. So we really delve into 
figuring out some of the 

2352
03:29:19,688 --> 03:29:22,938
payloads the bad guys use. Some 
of the tools used and how to use

2353
03:29:23,151 --> 03:29:28,016
process monitoring around this. 
A little bit about me. I work at

2354
03:29:28,766 --> 03:29:33,907
Red Canary. Most of my day job 
is finding out what bad guys 

2355
03:29:34,119 --> 03:29:36,351
use, how they use it and how to 
detect it. Recovering systems 

2356
03:29:36,551 --> 03:29:40,010
admin, used to work in higher 
head and state government sort 

2357
03:29:40,775 --> 03:29:45,091
of areas. And it's an entirely 
different environment. I love 

2358
03:29:45,853 --> 03:29:50,572
the change. Used to teach on the
side and I still love to teach. 

2359
03:29:50,974 --> 03:29:56,254
It's why I'm here doing this. 
This is also why I am attracted 

2360
03:29:56,454 --> 03:29:58,488
to threat intelligence but when 
you look at intelligence it is 

2361
03:29:58,700 --> 03:30:05,197
lifelong education another name.
When we have intelligence driven

2362
03:30:05,398 --> 03:30:09,463
security means we are educating 
ourselves before an event. I 

2363
03:30:09,664 --> 03:30:13,727
wanted to start off talking 
about what an actual alterable 

2364
03:30:13,928 --> 03:30:19,822
technique is.  Deal a lot with 
alerts in various parts of our 

2365
03:30:20,022 --> 03:30:24,699
lives. Alerts art necessarily 
something that happens with 

2366
03:30:25,100 --> 03:30:27,100
security products, happen with 
your smoke detector at home, all

2367
03:30:27,132 --> 03:30:29,778
sorts of areas. You may have a 
car alarm. I want to kind of 

2368
03:30:29,979 --> 03:30:32,614
show what the difference is 
between an alert from your 

2369
03:30:33,363 --> 03:30:35,873
security product and an alert in
your daily life and how we can 

2370
03:30:36,074 --> 03:30:42,572
draw some of that context from 
the daily life that let you know

2371
03:30:42,771 --> 03:30:44,771
immediately something is wrong 
but that in your security 

2372
03:30:44,803 --> 03:30:50,094
products. Figure out how to make
your alerts not suck. You want 

2373
03:30:50,294 --> 03:30:52,727
to cover a little decision 
criteria. How do you make a good

2374
03:30:52,928 --> 03:30:55,709
alert? If you want to edit from 
a systematic process, how can 

2375
03:30:55,866 --> 03:30:59,998
you braid some of these things? 
There's no matrices or 

2376
03:31:00,171 --> 03:31:05,528
spreadsheets. It is 
significantly less structured 

2377
03:31:05,929 --> 03:31:10,406
than some of the previous talks 
going to talk a little bit about

2378
03:31:10,606 --> 03:31:12,839
it and actively. And were going 
to cover some actual hard, fast 

2379
03:31:13,040 --> 03:31:15,623
into the weeds analytics that we
have implemented in our 

2380
03:31:15,776 --> 03:31:19,132
organization that have been 
relatively high fidelity for us.

2381
03:31:19,346 --> 03:31:23,809
Some that haven't. And some 
absolutely sucked when we tried 

2382
03:31:24,569 --> 03:31:30,315
them out. Hopefully this will 
help you a little bit. This 

2383
03:31:30,517 --> 03:31:33,762
stuff has been derived from 
adversary payloads, raw data, it

2384
03:31:33,964 --> 03:31:35,893
is something that is not 
necessarily for me synthesized 

2385
03:31:35,894 --> 03:31:40,268
report. It is stuff seen in the 
wild. To start off we have to 

2386
03:31:40,468 --> 03:31:44,071
define what an alert is. At its 
core an alert is some sort of 

2387
03:31:44,263 --> 03:31:49,608
notification of abnormal 
condition in the environment. If

2388
03:31:49,809 --> 03:31:52,256
you have a car alarm, it means 
someone is picking and. If you 

2389
03:31:52,456 --> 03:31:55,088
have a smoke detector this means
there is smoke somewhere in the 

2390
03:31:55,301 --> 03:31:58,560
house. Something is going on you
don't want to go on and you need

2391
03:31:58,750 --> 03:32:04,096
to fix it quickly. The idea 
behind an alert though is for 

2392
03:32:04,252 --> 03:32:07,487
you to understand what is going 
on and act. You have to have 

2393
03:32:07,681 --> 03:32:10,426
some greater context. You have 
to know why the alert has fired,

2394
03:32:12,158 --> 03:32:14,389
you have to know what condition 
the alert is telling you about 

2395
03:32:14,589 --> 03:32:17,036
and you need to know how to act 
afterwards. For example with a 

2396
03:32:17,797 --> 03:32:22,716
smoke detector. The context for 
this alert, there is smoke in 

2397
03:32:23,481 --> 03:32:27,996
your bedroom you need to get out
fast. If you had security 

2398
03:32:28,209 --> 03:32:31,457
products to give you that kind 
of immediacy and context, we 

2399
03:32:31,657 --> 03:32:34,703
will have the smoke detectors go
off and there is no smoke, stuff

2400
03:32:34,903 --> 03:32:38,162
like that, pulse positives, but 
the more you can provide that 

2401
03:32:38,362 --> 03:32:42,559
context, the happier your 
analysts are going to be. With 

2402
03:32:42,705 --> 03:32:49,532
anything, your alerts require 
care and feeding. We try to look

2403
03:32:49,733 --> 03:32:51,733
at alerts is kind of a 
diagnostic process, something 

2404
03:32:51,763 --> 03:32:55,425
going wrong in your environment.
When you go to the doctor, some 

2405
03:32:55,625 --> 03:32:59,899
of you, your care requires care 
and feeding. You may have 

2406
03:33:00,100 --> 03:33:02,733
individualized care plan for 
you. This is going to be the 

2407
03:33:02,947 --> 03:33:08,025
same thing with your alerting. 
With your security program. Any 

2408
03:33:08,224 --> 03:33:10,224
security program you implement 
is going to be a little 

2409
03:33:10,255 --> 03:33:14,720
different from your friends. The
best is when you can stick to, 

2410
03:33:14,920 --> 03:33:19,599
it's like an exercise. As long 
as you can keep tuning you're 

2411
03:33:19,799 --> 03:33:23,259
going to get better this.  
>> What does the alert workflow 

2412
03:33:24,015 --> 03:33:30,567
look like? The alert will fire 
soon afterward. Just because it 

2413
03:33:30,767 --> 03:33:35,030
has occurred doesn't mean the 
alert will fire. This is a 

2414
03:33:35,242 --> 03:33:38,436
really good thing to focus on 
when you look at sensor 

2415
03:33:38,625 --> 03:33:42,703
placement. If the fire happens 
in the house there is no smoke 

2416
03:33:42,857 --> 03:33:44,857
detector,

2417
03:33:46,616 --> 03:33:49,407
no alert. If there's an activity
on an endpoint or cross a 

2418
03:33:49,575 --> 03:33:54,742
network there's no alert. To 
move down the workflow we have 

2419
03:33:54,943 --> 03:34:02,051
to have a sensor. Somewhere 
between two and three, your 

2420
03:34:02,251 --> 03:34:04,283
analyst comes in for the day, 
they check their email and 

2421
03:34:04,495 --> 03:34:07,330
grabbed the coffee and finally 
they dial in and start looking 

2422
03:34:07,544 --> 03:34:13,985
at their high-priority alerts. 
Eventually the alert has to go 

2423
03:34:14,159 --> 03:34:18,305
somewhere. There's and escalate 
but there is a hide. Escalation 

2424
03:34:18,505 --> 03:34:23,585
maybe to a threat intelligence 
or incident response team. That 

2425
03:34:23,786 --> 03:34:27,236
alert has to go somewhere or 
else it's dropped in a 

2426
03:34:27,450 --> 03:34:29,682
bottomless hole. If you want to 
hide things you have to document

2427
03:34:29,883 --> 03:34:33,744
false positives. Every time you 
have a hide you should learn 

2428
03:34:33,945 --> 03:34:36,178
something new about your 
organization. Talk a lot about 

2429
03:34:36,942 --> 03:34:41,872
threat hunting. That there is no
such thing as an unsuccessful 

2430
03:34:42,072 --> 03:34:44,506
hunt because every time you hunt
you learn something new and you 

2431
03:34:44,707 --> 03:34:46,707
should have documentation. The 
same thing should be true with 

2432
03:34:47,302 --> 03:34:50,814
your alerts. Every time you have
a false positive alert it 

2433
03:34:51,014 --> 03:34:55,677
doesn't mean it was an on 
accessible unsuccessful alert it

2434
03:34:55,890 --> 03:34:57,890
means you learned something new.
There are some problems with 

2435
03:34:57,923 --> 03:35:03,000
alerts. I have to say, my wife 
helped me pretty fruit proofread

2436
03:35:03,201 --> 03:35:05,844
my slides and she panicked when 
she saw this picture because she

2437
03:35:06,045 --> 03:35:10,143
is not used to having more than 
10 unread emails in her inbox. 

2438
03:35:10,309 --> 03:35:15,991
If you buy a security product 
most of the time if you leave it

2439
03:35:16,204 --> 03:35:18,436
at the default there's a lot of 
context missing. When you buy 

2440
03:35:18,636 --> 03:35:23,513
something from security vendor 
X, vendor X has no idea what's 

2441
03:35:23,713 --> 03:35:26,159
going on in your environment. 
You may have a special snowflake

2442
03:35:26,359 --> 03:35:29,206
product only in the auto 
industry. You may have something

2443
03:35:29,409 --> 03:35:32,252
in the Department of Energy that
is never seen the light of the 

2444
03:35:32,453 --> 03:35:36,258
anywhere else. So that may cause
tons and tons of false 

2445
03:35:36,436 --> 03:35:40,779
positives. Vendors will error on
high volume by default because 

2446
03:35:40,980 --> 03:35:43,559
they don't want you to miss 
something. They just tell you 

2447
03:35:43,708 --> 03:35:47,886
everything. For you to make 
things better you have to give a

2448
03:35:48,087 --> 03:35:50,586
little context. You have to show
analysts why it's important, 

2449
03:35:50,930 --> 03:35:52,973
what to do afterwards and 
provide guidance for the 

2450
03:35:53,734 --> 03:35:59,664
escalation process. As we are 
sent down the path of trying to 

2451
03:35:59,877 --> 03:36:02,667
make alerts better we have to 
take time to do a systematic 

2452
03:36:02,835 --> 03:36:06,170
process of what actually makes 
it alert better. What do we 

2453
03:36:06,372 --> 03:36:09,655
qualify as a good alert? 
Theoretically we want an alert 

2454
03:36:10,033 --> 03:36:13,080
to take very little time to 
investigate. We want that alert 

2455
03:36:13,280 --> 03:36:17,744
to have enough context the 
analyst can come up, have the 

2456
03:36:17,957 --> 03:36:22,221
alert right in front of their 
face, they can say, the number 

2457
03:36:22,421 --> 03:36:25,069
1, thing two, the number 3 has 
happened, we don't have to do a 

2458
03:36:25,274 --> 03:36:28,917
lot of investigation can just 
follow it back to the origin and

2459
03:36:29,130 --> 03:36:32,177
markable this information, give 
it to her instant responders can

2460
03:36:32,377 --> 03:36:34,377
go toward mediation.

2461
03:36:36,842 --> 03:36:38,842
The quicker they can do that 
investigation process the better

2462
03:36:38,872 --> 03:36:41,117
the alert is going to be. You 
can go into more alerts 

2463
03:36:41,318 --> 03:36:43,867
afterwards or take a break 
afterwards. We want alerts to be

2464
03:36:46,998 --> 03:36:48,998
, you know, fairly significant 
in terms of abnormality. We 

2465
03:36:49,030 --> 03:36:52,692
don't want an alert it says, 
hey, somebody has logged off a 

2466
03:36:52,891 --> 03:36:58,983
Windows computer somewhere at 5 
PM. That is an alert. It's not a

2467
03:36:59,733 --> 03:37:05,079
significant alert. What the less
significant alert does is train 

2468
03:37:05,280 --> 03:37:09,143
your personnel to ignore alerts.
That is not something you want 

2469
03:37:09,343 --> 03:37:11,588
to do. How would you feel if 
every time you cooked smoke 

2470
03:37:11,788 --> 03:37:14,836
detector went off. Sooner or 
later you will learn to ignore 

2471
03:37:15,037 --> 03:37:17,471
it when there's a real fire in 
the house. Does the same thing 

2472
03:37:17,672 --> 03:37:22,349
with security alerts. We want to
have a little time to respond 

2473
03:37:22,750 --> 03:37:28,048
for any sort of alerts. You want
to be quick to investigate and 

2474
03:37:28,244 --> 03:37:30,627
quick to remediate. The more 
information you have in this 

2475
03:37:30,804 --> 03:37:33,395
alert to lead your instant 
response to reform your 

2476
03:37:34,286 --> 03:37:40,422
mediation the better it's going 
to be happier your yard team is 

2477
03:37:40,635 --> 03:37:46,114
going to be in a happy analysts.
Everone is going to be happy 

2478
03:37:46,315 --> 03:37:55,872
around. Want to take a look at 
the Linux side the don't suck.  

2479
03:37:56,273 --> 03:37:58,501
I will tell you about when that 
didn't work well towards the 

2480
03:37:58,717 --> 03:38:01,284
end. All of these have been 
derived from real life adversary

2481
03:38:01,442 --> 03:38:05,212
tools, my wife is been actually 
entertained by me think handling

2482
03:38:05,413 --> 03:38:10,281
payloads at home, figure out 
what bad guys use an hour, it's 

2483
03:38:10,424 --> 03:38:15,975
been an interesting experience. 
First one I wanted to touch is 

2484
03:38:16,388 --> 03:38:18,621
time stomping. This is going to 
be a practice of changing 

2485
03:38:18,821 --> 03:38:24,661
timestamps on eight system. This
happens in opportunistic 

2486
03:38:24,814 --> 03:38:31,412
attacks, it happens in targeted 
attacks, anywhere a bad guy can 

2487
03:38:31,626 --> 03:38:34,259
drop a file the going to want to
shield it it's there or slow 

2488
03:38:34,458 --> 03:38:38,256
down forensic analysis. Most 
commonly in some of these 

2489
03:38:38,412 --> 03:38:42,947
optimistic things we see the 
touch command, touch will be 

2490
03:38:43,644 --> 03:38:47,461
used to modify timestamps or 
create empty files. Most of the 

2491
03:38:47,661 --> 03:38:50,056
time we will see touch with

2492
03:39:00,866 --> 03:39:02,899
we are using a reference file, 
taking the timestamp from one 

2493
03:39:03,111 --> 03:39:05,957
file and plan to get on another.
We have to think of, what is the

2494
03:39:06,157 --> 03:39:10,419
bad guys intend? They want to 
make whatever file they aremay 

2495
03:39:10,620 --> 03:39:14,079
click it looks like it was there
at the time of installation. 

2496
03:39:14,481 --> 03:39:18,742
Most of the time when we see 
timestamps being modified this 

2497
03:39:18,956 --> 03:39:21,389
is going to be something from an
installation, something from 

2498
03:39:21,588 --> 03:39:25,653
normal system management. Most 
of the time was normal system 

2499
03:39:25,853 --> 03:39:27,884
management you're not going to 
see all of the timestamps being 

2500
03:39:28,099 --> 03:39:31,134
modified at the same time and 
you're probably not going to see

2501
03:39:31,349 --> 03:39:33,782
all the timestamps modified at 
the same time from timestamps of

2502
03:39:34,193 --> 03:39:39,678
the file there originally 
installed on the system. This is

2503
03:39:39,878 --> 03:39:41,911
going to be something really 
suspicious right off the bat. It

2504
03:39:42,110 --> 03:39:45,560
gives your analyst some quick 
investigation time. They can 

2505
03:39:45,760 --> 03:39:48,808
look at what issue is the 
command, the origin of the file 

2506
03:39:49,022 --> 03:39:56,531
that is being timestamps Combi 
have two investigative leads. We

2507
03:39:56,732 --> 03:40:00,599
know this file is probably going
to be evil and we are going to 

2508
03:40:00,794 --> 03:40:03,839
have to get rid of it and they 
get a head start on things. The 

2509
03:40:04,589 --> 03:40:09,331
next one is diving a little bit 
into process injection. This is 

2510
03:40:09,531 --> 03:40:13,193
notoriously kind of weird on a 
Windows side. Just is weird on 

2511
03:40:13,394 --> 03:40:21,316
the Linux side.  Some techniques
are little odd to spot. For the 

2512
03:40:21,517 --> 03:40:27,208
one we're covering here, process
injection using LD preload. If 

2513
03:40:27,409 --> 03:40:30,615
you haven't floated 
aroundcircles  it's a wonderful 

2514
03:40:30,763 --> 03:40:37,166
functionality from the [ Name 
Unknown ] that lets you specify 

2515
03:40:37,367 --> 03:40:43,460
a shared object library, the 
Linux equivalent of a DLL  and 

2516
03:40:43,661 --> 03:40:45,289
injected into any process 
running for particular user 

2517
03:40:45,290 --> 03:40:50,316
context. Let's imagine you 
haven't SSH process, you want 

2518
03:40:50,463 --> 03:40:55,395
your adversaries ivory to steal 
credentials to load into this 

2519
03:40:55,560 --> 03:41:02,759
process. You want PS to not 
return back malicious processes 

2520
03:41:02,959 --> 03:41:05,391
whenever you get started 
investigating things. You can 

2521
03:41:05,605 --> 03:41:09,053
preload a malicious library into
these processes to manipulate 

2522
03:41:09,455 --> 03:41:12,513
output, steal credentials, do 
something else. Most of the time

2523
03:41:12,714 --> 03:41:14,944
this happens on the user side 
but it could happen at the 

2524
03:41:15,694 --> 03:41:18,603
system level. If you have tools 
in your environment to let you 

2525
03:41:18,804 --> 03:41:22,867
audit commandline flags or, 
especially at the environment 

2526
03:41:23,818 --> 03:41:28,958
variable level, this is awesome 
if you can look for LD preload. 

2527
03:41:29,372 --> 03:41:33,436
There are very few times you're 
probably going to use this in 

2528
03:41:33,637 --> 03:41:38,718
your environment. The only time 
I have seen in our dataset words

2529
03:41:38,918 --> 03:41:41,097
use legitimately is for folks 
using very specific monitoring 

2530
03:41:41,247 --> 03:41:45,414
software. And if you are using 
that monitoring software you are

2531
03:41:45,615 --> 03:41:49,679
probably going to know. System 
admins are going to know it's a 

2532
03:41:49,879 --> 03:41:52,614
documented exception. The thing 
that is must much less common is

2533
03:41:54,755 --> 03:41:57,400
modification of this LDS preload
file. This lets you 

2534
03:41:58,351 --> 03:42:02,818
[Indiscernible] will execute a 
process and it will preload in 

2535
03:42:02,966 --> 03:42:08,322
your Apache user may specify a 
process and the preload comes 

2536
03:42:08,471 --> 03:42:14,056
in. Defining something preloaded
for the entire system. The 

2537
03:42:14,256 --> 03:42:16,702
really cool thing about this is 
it is quick to respond to. You 

2538
03:42:16,903 --> 03:42:21,522
can delete the LDS preload file 
without harming the rest of the 

2539
03:42:21,671 --> 03:42:25,641
system. Most of the time if you 
have a monitoring solution, you 

2540
03:42:25,843 --> 03:42:28,276
won't want to do that. You can 
un-define your environment 

2541
03:42:28,486 --> 03:42:32,134
variable and it will help clean 
this up quickly. You can go and 

2542
03:42:32,348 --> 03:42:36,198
tackle whatever library has been
specified inside that variable. 

2543
03:42:36,613 --> 03:42:39,660
It is very quick to respond to. 
The really cool thing, this is 

2544
03:42:40,421 --> 03:42:42,421
used by

2545
03:42:45,542 --> 03:42:47,542
root kits to hide activity all 
the time. Hide network 

2546
03:42:47,573 --> 03:42:49,402
connections and process 
activity. By doing just a little

2547
03:42:49,403 --> 03:42:54,081
bit of quick deletion you can 
undo the functionality of a root

2548
03:42:54,282 --> 03:42:58,087
kit that may be hiding processes
go after the real threat on your

2549
03:42:58,256 --> 03:43:05,041
system. And the final one for 
the ones that don't suck, I want

2550
03:43:05,254 --> 03:43:09,315
to talk about masquerading. We 
talk a lot more about it on the 

2551
03:43:09,517 --> 03:43:12,162
Windows side because every 
process likes to hide as a host.

2552
03:43:12,923 --> 03:43:17,843
On the Linux side we see some of
the same things.  If you dissect

2553
03:43:18,045 --> 03:43:20,689
some of the crypto mining, 
resource hijacking scripts from 

2554
03:43:21,449 --> 03:43:26,168
the past you will see a lot of 
process names the look like K 

2555
03:43:26,781 --> 03:43:33,486
worker DS. K audit. These are 
intended to confuse defenders 

2556
03:43:33,687 --> 03:43:35,719
and make them think they're 
looking at a kernel thread. When

2557
03:43:35,919 --> 03:43:39,780
you are looking at a Linux  and 
you look at PS, chances are you 

2558
03:43:39,982 --> 03:43:42,628
have seen some weird looking 
processes that start with a K 

2559
03:43:42,828 --> 03:43:48,723
and have brackets. Those are 
processes that correspond with 

2560
03:43:49,123 --> 03:43:52,068
kernel threads. They don't have 
binary images or a path or valid

2561
03:43:53,188 --> 03:43:58,068
hash or things like that. So 
when you do see a process named 

2562
03:43:59,030 --> 03:44:04,296
K or has a name of a kernel 
thread inside of it, and it is 

2563
03:44:04,453 --> 03:44:08,625
represented in something that 
has a path, especially a 

2564
03:44:09,039 --> 03:44:11,272
temporary directory, it's 
something really suspicious and 

2565
03:44:11,473 --> 03:44:14,518
should fire an alert to 
investigate your crew. This is 

2566
03:44:14,718 --> 03:44:16,718
going to be quick to 
investigate, FindWhat dropped 

2567
03:44:17,314 --> 03:44:21,629
that file. If you have the right
tooling you can go back and 

2568
03:44:21,829 --> 03:44:25,089
figure out what process executed
around that time, what files 

2569
03:44:25,289 --> 03:44:28,032
were dropped around that time. 
And run it to ground from there.

2570
03:44:29,554 --> 03:44:37,277
You may have noticed a trend so 
far. Which tactic have all of 

2571
03:44:37,477 --> 03:44:43,273
these analytics fallen into? I 
heard evasion. Defense of Asian.

2572
03:44:43,974 --> 03:44:48,396
We typically have seen with 
various public research and 

2573
03:44:48,554 --> 03:44:52,035
payloads that attackers will 
follow kind of a specific 

2574
03:44:52,183 --> 03:44:54,295
methodology, they will 
compromise a web app, 

2575
03:44:54,450 --> 03:44:56,450
compromising database, use

2576
03:45:02,059 --> 03:45:04,293
W get to pull down a payload and
then execute the payload 

2577
03:45:04,907 --> 03:45:06,721
immediately afterwards. In 
Windows land we call this living

2578
03:45:06,722 --> 03:45:09,729
off the land. They are using 
built-in tools to the operating 

2579
03:45:09,911 --> 03:45:14,447
system to download and operate 
their exploits. With any sort of

2580
03:45:14,648 --> 03:45:18,510
living off the land opportunity 
for adversary, we have to assume

2581
03:45:18,711 --> 03:45:22,576
the capabilities of the same as 
your systems admins. We have to 

2582
03:45:22,777 --> 03:45:26,436
assume they are the same as 
desktop admins. Was going to be 

2583
03:45:26,636 --> 03:45:29,685
the telling difference here is 
that we have to figure out what 

2584
03:45:29,886 --> 03:45:35,580
the adversary's intent is. The 
most functional analytics for us

2585
03:45:35,781 --> 03:45:38,011
have been the ones that show 
intent. Escalating shows clear 

2586
03:45:38,212 --> 03:45:41,873
intent. There is no reason a 
kernel thread should be living 

2587
03:45:42,073 --> 03:45:46,549
in a temporary directory. Is is 
going to be evil and we can 

2588
03:45:46,750 --> 03:45:49,544
track it down better. We are 
going to see the trend continue 

2589
03:45:49,693 --> 03:45:52,431
on. Here the analytics we can 
kind of make work. They start 

2590
03:45:53,195 --> 03:45:55,894
off noisy, but as you tune them 
in your environment the going to

2591
03:45:56,655 --> 03:45:58,655
get better.

2592
03:46:00,970 --> 03:46:02,970
Remote file copy. Attacker tries
to download and execute their 

2593
03:46:03,001 --> 03:46:06,384
tools. Most of the time using a 
curl command is going to be 

2594
03:46:06,558 --> 03:46:12,345
evil. If you have a business 
case for this is legitimate in 

2595
03:46:12,546 --> 03:46:14,777
your environment please contact 
me, I want to know. We can work 

2596
03:46:14,978 --> 03:46:17,943
it out from there. We can find 
if there is a better way.

2597
03:46:22,299 --> 03:46:24,530
And typically, so that is 
probably going to lead to a high

2598
03:46:24,731 --> 03:46:26,764
fidelity alert. What is less 
high fidelity is going to be 

2599
03:46:26,964 --> 03:46:30,978
something like Kohler W get 
reaching out to a random IP 

2600
03:46:31,132 --> 03:46:34,082
address to download eight [ Name
Unknown ] or some other tool is 

2601
03:46:34,283 --> 03:46:37,533
going to affect an IOT system. 
What you have to do is figure 

2602
03:46:37,733 --> 03:46:39,733
out what IP addresses,

2603
03:46:43,224 --> 03:46:45,255
what scopes are called to by 
your systems and then start 

2604
03:46:45,455 --> 03:46:47,686
alerting on the things outside 
those scopes. So if you look for

2605
03:46:47,887 --> 03:46:51,949
W get and and IP address outside
of your scope of management that

2606
03:46:52,162 --> 03:46:54,193
is something that can turn into 
a high fidelity alert depending 

2607
03:46:54,394 --> 03:46:58,258
on your environment. If you 
manage a large IP space I'm very

2608
03:46:58,459 --> 03:47:03,537
sorry, it's going to get rough. 
Next one is remote services for 

2609
03:47:03,737 --> 03:47:06,293
lateral movement. This is an 
actual example of what I believe

2610
03:47:07,398 --> 03:47:09,398
another threat actor,

2611
03:47:14,098 --> 03:47:15,726
cryptocurrency resource 
hijacking, what they do to try 

2612
03:47:15,727 --> 03:47:18,358
to move laterally on the system.
If you ever done key-based 

2613
03:47:18,571 --> 03:47:23,437
authentication and configuration
for Lennox systems or you will 

2614
03:47:23,648 --> 03:47:26,080
typically see there's an 
authorized user, and authorized 

2615
03:47:26,830 --> 03:47:31,362
host file and all of your good 
key stuff that goes with it. But

2616
03:47:31,563 --> 03:47:35,839
these opportunistic scripts will
do is parse that authorized host

2617
03:47:36,039 --> 03:47:38,074
file and try to contact every 
host you've contacted in the 

2618
03:47:38,673 --> 03:47:44,770
authorized file and try to issue
a curl command and funnel that 

2619
03:47:44,971 --> 03:47:51,478
script into a shell. This is 
going to be a little more high 

2620
03:47:51,678 --> 03:47:55,539
fidelity depending on the side 
that's being used. We found that

2621
03:47:56,299 --> 03:47:58,784
sometimes however this matches 
up with an application 

2622
03:47:59,398 --> 03:48:05,090
deployment pattern. If you 
deploy [ Name Unknown ] in your 

2623
03:48:05,292 --> 03:48:07,123
environment or some cloud stuff 
in your environment, some 

2624
03:48:07,124 --> 03:48:10,773
installers, depending on how you
use them might match this 

2625
03:48:10,973 --> 03:48:14,836
pattern. You just have to tune 
those out. And now, this is the 

2626
03:48:15,036 --> 03:48:22,560
whole of shame. Anything 
discovery is going to suck. And 

2627
03:48:22,761 --> 03:48:27,024
mostly it's because operating 
system noise. When you log onto 

2628
03:48:27,787 --> 03:48:31,489
a system in Linux and has the 
prompt that says,  you are 

2629
03:48:31,702 --> 03:48:35,150
logged into this host this 
username, how do you think that 

2630
03:48:35,911 --> 03:48:37,911
gets generated?

2631
03:48:42,058 --> 03:48:44,088
Recon commands. If you're going 
to alert on recon commands or 

2632
03:48:44,288 --> 03:48:46,536
any sort of combination of recon
commands it's going to be rough 

2633
03:48:46,732 --> 03:48:49,377
on you. That works best for us 
is looking for some sort of 

2634
03:48:49,581 --> 03:48:53,790
cluster of activity where we can
say, there is maybe a little bit

2635
03:48:53,938 --> 03:49:01,151
of user recon, a little bit of 
network recon, a little bit of 

2636
03:49:01,553 --> 03:49:06,028
what users are on the system, 
when it occurs in a cluster like

2637
03:49:06,228 --> 03:49:08,228
this, chances are you are more 
likely to find someone 

2638
03:49:08,259 --> 03:49:11,866
enumerating the system looking 
for privilege explication 

2639
03:49:12,004 --> 03:49:14,764
vulnerabilities. It's not going 
to be something alert double. 

2640
03:49:14,964 --> 03:49:19,140
This is something you're going 
to be examining after-the-fact.

2641
03:49:23,503 --> 03:49:25,503
The use of

2642
03:49:28,580 --> 03:49:30,398
Sudo, it's admins favorite. 
Helps you make sandwiches, all 

2643
03:49:30,399 --> 03:49:34,261
the things  admin doesn't like 
to do. Long investigations with 

2644
03:49:34,463 --> 03:49:37,308
little return. Long rabbit holes
that you get nothing out of 

2645
03:49:37,521 --> 03:49:41,581
because you're going to flag 
every time your systems admin is

2646
03:49:41,781 --> 03:49:45,029
going to do something on a Linux
system. It's going to make the  

2647
03:49:45,591 --> 03:49:50,066
analyst, admins and advisors 
mad. If you really have to look 

2648
03:49:50,217 --> 03:49:54,383
at Sudo alerting in your 
environment,  do it in an audit,

2649
03:49:55,135 --> 03:49:59,808
a report, something where it's 
not a continuous monitoring 

2650
03:49:59,961 --> 03:50:04,739
effort. I have to make one 
caveat with this. When I made 

2651
03:50:04,940 --> 03:50:07,987
these slides I did not account 
for the edge case lability from 

2652
03:50:08,188 --> 03:50:14,484
a couple weeks ago with Sudo -1 
username.  That is a high 

2653
03:50:15,246 --> 03:50:19,365
fidelity alert. Get that one in.
But otherwise, it is better for 

2654
03:50:19,566 --> 03:50:26,478
reporting and audits. The final 
one, I have to include this 

2655
03:50:26,678 --> 03:50:30,076
because we did have someone ask 
about it. If you are not 

2656
03:50:30,223 --> 03:50:37,394
familiar, RM and RF means delete
all fires and force the 

2657
03:50:37,546 --> 03:50:41,702
deletion. Route is equivalent of
C Drive from Windows on the 

2658
03:50:41,917 --> 03:50:45,967
Linux system.  And theoretically
this is going to delete 

2659
03:50:46,181 --> 03:50:49,831
everything on the system it's 
going to do it very quickly. 

2660
03:50:50,244 --> 03:50:52,244
When someone approached us with 
a question about this analytic 

2661
03:50:52,276 --> 03:50:56,541
and says, can you detect in 
this, we said, well, we can 

2662
03:50:56,754 --> 03:50:59,174
write and analytic for it, and 
it relies on you basically 

2663
03:50:59,374 --> 03:51:01,374
winning a race.

2664
03:51:05,684 --> 03:51:08,117
You have to rely on your sensor 
making it back to the server 

2665
03:51:08,880 --> 03:51:12,382
that this command has arrived 
before it's messed up your 

2666
03:51:12,583 --> 03:51:15,631
sensor. You're not going to win 
the race 95% of the time. 

2667
03:51:16,033 --> 03:51:21,324
Especially in the land of SSD 
and high-speed processors. 

2668
03:51:21,727 --> 03:51:23,727
You're just not going to win

2669
03:51:26,805 --> 03:51:30,359
most of the time. If you do win 
I want to see how this comes up.

2670
03:51:30,677 --> 03:51:34,731
I would additionally argue that 
if you ever see this alert if 

2671
03:51:34,932 --> 03:51:37,981
you ever have this alert and you
get a hit, the bad guys probably

2672
03:51:38,182 --> 03:51:40,215
didn't get a successful 
execution because most of the 

2673
03:51:40,415 --> 03:51:46,512
time on modernsystems you have 
to include  a flag that says no 

2674
03:51:47,272 --> 03:51:51,989
preserved through. Is modern it 
says we need guardrails before 

2675
03:51:52,202 --> 03:51:54,433
people start blowing things up. 
And that's one of the good 

2676
03:51:54,634 --> 03:51:58,040
things about it. Most of the 
time your helpdesk is going to 

2677
03:51:58,200 --> 03:52:00,534
know that something has gone 
wrong with the system before you

2678
03:52:00,728 --> 03:52:06,168
know if someone has wiped it. 
It's just something that 

2679
03:52:06,316 --> 03:52:11,001
happens. And hopefully there 
will be evidence for you to 

2680
03:52:11,161 --> 03:52:14,538
figure out what happened when 
you get there. We have five 

2681
03:52:15,288 --> 03:52:21,252
minutes left. Alert where you 
can were possible. Alert on as 

2682
03:52:21,453 --> 03:52:26,533
much of those as you can. Report
and hunt, do cluster analysis 

2683
03:52:26,733 --> 03:52:30,795
where you can otherwise. I 
wanted to additionally share 

2684
03:52:30,995 --> 03:52:35,062
resources I thought were 
awesome. The most successful 

2685
03:52:35,262 --> 03:52:37,293
organizations we have talked to 
so far but haven't been using 

2686
03:52:37,493 --> 03:52:40,752
some sort of process monitoring 
commercial tool have been using 

2687
03:52:41,153 --> 03:52:48,061
some form of OS query 
combinations thereof. Trying to 

2688
03:52:48,263 --> 03:52:50,263
figure it out in their 
environment. If you want to 

2689
03:52:50,857 --> 03:52:52,857
learn about

2690
03:52:55,727 --> 03:52:57,727
auditd. 

2691
03:53:01,056 --> 03:53:05,533
There's a really good auditd 
project,  both have good high 

2692
03:53:06,134 --> 03:53:10,617
fidelity alerts. Some of them 
won't. Or some of the alerts 

2693
03:53:10,813 --> 03:53:16,509
won't be high fidelity. Is what 
you can and improve the rest. I 

2694
03:53:16,706 --> 03:53:21,674
want to open it up. Does anyone 
have questions? Yes, sir.

2695
03:53:28,027 --> 03:53:30,027
Raise high.

2696
03:53:35,529 --> 03:53:44,736
>> When you talk about I the 
action ability of an alert, the 

2697
03:53:44,937 --> 03:53:47,169
context the data source is 
providing, stuff like that, how 

2698
03:53:47,382 --> 03:53:51,446
much effort are you putting into
ensuring they are analysts no, 

2699
03:53:51,646 --> 03:53:56,110
how much of the context is 
analyst knowledge about these 

2700
03:53:56,310 --> 03:53:59,571
sorts of things. A lot of the 
stuff you went over today are be

2701
03:53:59,773 --> 03:54:02,565
aware of this. Refining a lot of
success just doing that?  

2702
03:54:02,716 --> 03:54:08,299
>> So what we have tried to do a
lot in our organization is 

2703
03:54:08,500 --> 03:54:10,948
really make it possible for our 
analysts to do just-in-time 

2704
03:54:11,146 --> 03:54:13,736
training. Were if they run 
across alert don't know they can

2705
03:54:13,890 --> 03:54:17,443
really read up quickly to be 
able to triage and take action 

2706
03:54:17,644 --> 03:54:19,644
on the alert.

2707
03:54:22,932 --> 03:54:25,566
What we have tried to do in our 
organization is try to make the 

2708
03:54:25,767 --> 03:54:27,800
details of an alert extremely 
visible for the analyst at the 

2709
03:54:28,001 --> 03:54:31,462
time of investigation. If we 
have particular use case 

2710
03:54:31,663 --> 03:54:33,695
analytic, a description for that
use case, example cases of where

2711
03:54:33,899 --> 03:54:39,987
it has been seen that is evil, 
documented false positives where

2712
03:54:40,188 --> 03:54:42,433
they can read what the alert was
generated, things like that, and

2713
03:54:42,634 --> 03:54:45,221
give further resources if they 
want to do additional ad hoc 

2714
03:54:45,377 --> 03:54:48,116
research. Has been the key 
success for us is focusing 

2715
03:54:48,317 --> 03:54:53,398
around some form of just-in-time
training to make as many 

2716
03:54:53,599 --> 03:54:55,599
resources available at the time 
of investigation as possible.  

2717
03:54:55,991 --> 03:55:02,331
>> I think I have one in the 
front row. We will get to you in

2718
03:55:02,544 --> 03:55:04,777
a second, sir.  
>> Thanks. Nice talk. Most of 

2719
03:55:04,977 --> 03:55:09,800
the techniques you presented 
here, live off the land for 

2720
03:55:09,946 --> 03:55:13,716
Windows, have you seen a 
prevalent use of more exultation

2721
03:55:14,477 --> 03:55:22,195
type techniques that are 
[Indiscernible] or just rare 

2722
03:55:22,346 --> 03:55:26,711
events they get fixed right 
away.  

2723
03:55:26,863 --> 03:55:31,728
>> Right, so there are some more
advance of attacks that are kind

2724
03:55:31,880 --> 03:55:36,457
of interesting. I know at least 
one threat actor, or couple of 

2725
03:55:37,209 --> 03:55:40,320
threat actor's have started 
using go binaries that are 

2726
03:55:40,521 --> 03:55:43,366
platform dependent that will 
crawl down go binaries to try to

2727
03:55:43,580 --> 03:55:47,846
evade some of the process 
monitoring activity. We kind of 

2728
03:55:48,046 --> 03:55:51,243
take the standpoint that the 
greatest enemy of process 

2729
03:55:51,434 --> 03:55:54,902
auditing is a random process 
doing random thing at a random 

2730
03:55:55,053 --> 03:55:59,622
time. We have started seeing 
adversaries do a lot more of 

2731
03:55:59,825 --> 03:56:02,471
that with public research. As 
for the specific kernel 

2732
03:56:03,229 --> 03:56:05,229
expectation stuff,

2733
03:56:07,747 --> 03:56:10,997
there have been some documented 
cases and public cases of that. 

2734
03:56:11,399 --> 03:56:13,643
The hard thing for seeing that 
in public research is that we 

2735
03:56:13,844 --> 03:56:15,844
see a lot of

2736
03:56:19,938 --> 03:56:21,938
kernel expectation stuff and 
proof of concept phase, but we 

2737
03:56:21,971 --> 03:56:26,437
don't see as many in the actual 
reporting act afterwards and so 

2738
03:56:26,638 --> 03:56:29,231
it has figured out it is happen 
in their environment.  

2739
03:56:29,396 --> 03:56:31,396
>>

2740
03:56:33,485 --> 03:56:35,485
Hello? Thank you very much.

2741
03:56:39,030 --> 03:56:40,861
Really interesting presentation.
One question. To what extent if 

2742
03:56:40,862 --> 03:56:45,739
any do you see changing behavior
in auto scaling groups for cloud

2743
03:56:45,939 --> 03:56:48,785
workloads for example affecting 
the type of alerts that may be 

2744
03:56:48,986 --> 03:56:52,232
relevant?  
>> So, all the alerts I have 

2745
03:56:52,983 --> 03:56:55,892
talked about so far, all these 
analytics, or assuming the 

2746
03:56:56,093 --> 03:56:59,756
perspective that you have some 
form of consul access to a 

2747
03:56:59,957 --> 03:57:05,237
server that assumes you own the 
machine and it's not, I say on 

2748
03:57:05,437 --> 03:57:07,468
the machine but it assumes you 
are the administrator of the 

2749
03:57:07,668 --> 03:57:10,114
machine and not just a consumer 
of its services. As you start to

2750
03:57:10,314 --> 03:57:13,561
move toward more cloud 
workloads, where your consumer 

2751
03:57:13,974 --> 03:57:19,055
of the server resources not an 
admin, hunting with these 

2752
03:57:19,256 --> 03:57:23,322
analytics is going to get 
harder. Will becomes more 

2753
03:57:23,520 --> 03:57:25,550
important at that phase is 
figuring out the right way to 

2754
03:57:25,750 --> 03:57:27,985
consume logs and enrich those 
logs to make your analysts have 

2755
03:57:28,201 --> 03:57:30,969
the right evidence at the right 
place at the right time.  

2756
03:57:31,119 --> 03:57:36,114
>> We are about to go to lunch. 
I encourage other questions. 

2757
03:57:36,314 --> 03:57:38,705
Hopefully your around. Please 
join me in thanking Tony.  

2758
03:57:38,858 --> 03:57:40,858
>> [Applause] 

2759
03:57:43,227 --> 03:57:48,308
>> Hopefully if you're using 
Linux or not,  a lot of great 

2760
03:57:48,710 --> 03:57:52,771
takeaways on what are alterable 
techniques.  I wanted to call a 

2761
03:57:52,973 --> 03:57:56,381
couple of tweets online. Thanks 
to all of our speakers. I think 

2762
03:57:56,562 --> 03:58:01,252
the ATT&CK conference is one of 
the very few in the world  there

2763
03:58:01,506 --> 03:58:04,552
almost all the talks around 
real-world security. And some 

2764
03:58:05,313 --> 03:58:09,833
folks watching from a boot camp 
in Amsterdam, they are turning 

2765
03:58:10,033 --> 03:58:13,442
in during their breaks, a busy 
day in Amsterdam all around the 

2766
03:58:13,588 --> 03:58:16,541
world. Thanks to Tony for that 
awesome talk. You're not heading

2767
03:58:17,302 --> 03:58:20,803
into lunch. I encourage you to 
visit the exhibitors. Think into

2768
03:58:21,004 --> 03:58:23,004
her lunch sponsor.

2769
03:58:25,481 --> 03:58:28,526
Chat, network, tweet at us what 
you are seeing. As a reminder 

2770
03:58:28,726 --> 03:58:31,172
for the online folks stick 
around because Jamie is going to

2771
03:58:31,372 --> 03:58:33,372
be interviewing folks on the

2772
03:58:36,855 --> 03:58:39,902
ATT&CK con couch. We will see 
you back here  at 1:20 PM. Enjoy

2773
03:58:40,661 --> 03:58:42,661
your lunch.

2774
03:59:39,370 --> 03:59:43,215
>> [ The event is on a 50 minute
lunch break. The session will 

2775
03:59:43,379 --> 03:59:44,747
reconvene at 1:20pm Eastern 
Standard Time. Captioner on 

2776
03:59:44,748 --> 03:59:46,748
stand by ]

2777
04:00:28,584 --> 04:00:32,646
First to persevere. Your we are.
Now you're talking to the 

2778
04:00:32,846 --> 04:00:35,077
community about how successful 
your. Regulations. One of things

2779
04:00:35,289 --> 04:00:38,737
you mentioned is started going 
through the matrix one at a 

2780
04:00:38,938 --> 04:00:42,803
time. You had a hard time 
getting by in. Can you speak a 

2781
04:00:43,004 --> 04:00:46,455
little bit to identifying when 
you knew that was not the right 

2782
04:00:46,655 --> 04:00:49,048
approach?  
>> Yes, as we went through each 

2783
04:00:49,250 --> 04:00:53,364
technique we took the red team 
approach and we're testing it 

2784
04:00:53,565 --> 04:00:56,611
again and again, this is what we
love to do. Let's tear it apart 

2785
04:00:56,813 --> 04:01:01,291
and see how it works. We ran 
into is we noticed detections we

2786
04:01:01,504 --> 04:01:05,304
were hoping for were coming out 
this much. We have a lot of 

2787
04:01:05,465 --> 04:01:10,226
resources, we had other duties 
as assigned on our job, but we 

2788
04:01:10,426 --> 04:01:14,902
are also segmented off period of
time, you're in there, doing a 

2789
04:01:15,102 --> 04:01:19,368
lot of testing. What are the 
results? What is happening? As 

2790
04:01:19,569 --> 04:01:21,801
the months went by on the 
project, you start noticing, 

2791
04:01:22,563 --> 04:01:26,223
this approach we are getting 
great mitigations but it's 

2792
04:01:26,379 --> 04:01:30,743
taking longer than what we 
thought. Maybe this is not going

2793
04:01:30,943 --> 04:01:33,940
to help digest all 240 
techniques.  

2794
04:01:34,127 --> 04:01:40,088
>> That's a great point, as we 
were going through this, the 

2795
04:01:40,289 --> 04:01:42,289
engineer piece, everyone was 
excited about it. Having fun 

2796
04:01:42,881 --> 04:01:46,384
diving in to these techniques 
and driving it. But from a 

2797
04:01:47,143 --> 04:01:51,062
leadership perspective, what is 
in it for me, what is in the 

2798
04:01:51,823 --> 04:01:56,341
overall story? You were never 
able to tell that story. Again, 

2799
04:01:56,542 --> 04:02:01,220
this was a 15 month process. We 
would have a little spurt where 

2800
04:02:01,418 --> 04:02:04,666
we would go further and then it 
would die off and no one would 

2801
04:02:04,865 --> 04:02:07,312
pay attention to it for couple 
months and then we go for couple

2802
04:02:07,514 --> 04:02:10,348
more months as we found a new 
technique. But there was no 

2803
04:02:11,114 --> 04:02:15,286
momentum. Never momentum into we
put all the pieces together. 

2804
04:02:15,988 --> 04:02:21,733
Again, it was at a point where 
until you tell and convince the 

2805
04:02:21,931 --> 04:02:24,296
leadership to give you the 
resources and funding to move 

2806
04:02:24,458 --> 04:02:30,865
forward, it's not really going 
to go anywhere. And we were 

2807
04:02:31,065 --> 04:02:33,065
doing until we put the 
intelligence piece on there.  

2808
04:02:33,097 --> 04:02:35,097
>> That linear one by one 
approach lacks the storyline. 

2809
04:02:35,128 --> 04:02:37,128
Your great storytellers.

2810
04:02:40,205 --> 04:02:42,434
Scope with the CPI, at least the
analyst from the ground of 

2811
04:02:42,634 --> 04:02:45,882
conceit that the progression is.
Why is this important? Like 

2812
04:02:46,084 --> 04:02:49,944
Legos, building a giant puzzle. 
Really appreciate that, guys. 

2813
04:02:50,345 --> 04:02:53,804
One of the interesting things 
circling back to that before I 

2814
04:02:54,562 --> 04:02:58,001
move forward, you mentioned 
communicating results back to 

2815
04:02:58,158 --> 04:03:01,310
leadership. One of the things we
on MITRE have developed  to help

2816
04:03:01,523 --> 04:03:05,372
do that is the navigator. Any 
other Pro tips you have on 

2817
04:03:05,986 --> 04:03:07,602
making sure leadership 
understands the value of what 

2818
04:03:07,603 --> 04:03:11,824
you are doing?  
>> I think the navigator is 

2819
04:03:12,000 --> 04:03:15,319
perfect. I love it in the fact 
that you get the picture. Am a 

2820
04:03:15,534 --> 04:03:19,582
big fan of pictures. I'm not the
smartest guy in the world. When 

2821
04:03:19,795 --> 04:03:22,584
you put the picture out there it
tells you exactly what's going 

2822
04:03:22,795 --> 04:03:25,886
on. I think during the 
presentations today you cite 

2823
04:03:26,086 --> 04:03:30,958
couple of ways to do that. We 
talked about putting the 91 

2824
04:03:31,160 --> 04:03:36,372
techniques on one page. And then
being able to tell a story 

2825
04:03:36,576 --> 04:03:42,728
across all of those techniques. 
We didn't showed appear because 

2826
04:03:42,941 --> 04:03:46,190
of the lawyers would let us show
you exactly where our security 

2827
04:03:47,147 --> 04:03:51,665
controls are, and we showed all 
91 controls and where we were 

2828
04:03:51,866 --> 04:03:55,269
and where we will be on each of 
the security controls once we 

2829
04:03:55,424 --> 04:03:57,756
make the mitigations and 
detections and put it in place, 

2830
04:03:58,518 --> 04:04:03,850
it was, it made everyone's eyes 
go, we need to go here, there, 

2831
04:04:04,051 --> 04:04:07,047
we need to do it now. That was 
really the defining moment for 

2832
04:04:07,196 --> 04:04:13,801
us, getting the leadership going
, nodding their head and going I

2833
04:04:14,001 --> 04:04:17,396
have to do this. Is a living 
document. A question we often 

2834
04:04:17,554 --> 04:04:22,014
get, how do you make sure you're
covering your tracks from 

2835
04:04:22,323 --> 04:04:26,182
previous efforts? Like you said 
that kind of document, can go 

2836
04:04:26,583 --> 04:04:28,750
into side-by-side and do that 
type of analysis.  

2837
04:04:28,898 --> 04:04:32,072
>> That something we learn from 
one project to the next, the 

2838
04:04:32,274 --> 04:04:36,324
security landscape is dynamic. 
Something we would test an 

2839
04:04:37,076 --> 04:04:40,396
earlier iteration, needs to be 
tested again and again and 

2840
04:04:40,598 --> 04:04:43,842
again.  
>> Awesome. Great transition. 

2841
04:04:44,243 --> 04:04:48,306
One of the big things he always 
preaches attack is not it. That 

2842
04:04:48,507 --> 04:04:54,001
is not the stopping point. That 
is for you to take it into your 

2843
04:04:54,201 --> 04:04:56,831
own environment. When you 
mentioned [Indiscernible-low 

2844
04:04:57,045 --> 04:05:00,690
volume] you took ATT&CK and made
it your own.  Can you give us 

2845
04:05:01,104 --> 04:05:03,280
some insight and lessons learned
on that process?  

2846
04:05:03,439 --> 04:05:07,195
>> I will tell you and they 
actually talked during the 

2847
04:05:07,395 --> 04:05:12,671
presentation about how we use 
modern ATT&CK now  and our team 

2848
04:05:12,872 --> 04:05:17,948
creates the anatomy of attack 
documents. We will take a 

2849
04:05:18,150 --> 04:05:21,554
significant security event, 
ransomware for earlier this 

2850
04:05:21,722 --> 04:05:26,070
year, it took that and broke it 
down based in all the dirty 

2851
04:05:26,270 --> 04:05:28,814
research that came in. Broken 
down how to this attack happened

2852
04:05:30,330 --> 04:05:34,605
and broke it down by technique 
and we sure that, it was a three

2853
04:05:34,807 --> 04:05:37,037
or four page document and we 
shared it to a white Ottomans. 

2854
04:05:37,237 --> 04:05:41,247
Now our security operations 
Center can take these and build 

2855
04:05:41,395 --> 04:05:44,702
out detections. We can have 
conversations with 

2856
04:05:44,858 --> 04:05:49,628
infrastructure, the leadership 
can see it and all the time 

2857
04:05:49,828 --> 04:05:52,260
you're talking about attack 
techniques. That has been one of

2858
04:05:52,460 --> 04:05:55,241
the big keys we have done. We 
consistently are using the 

2859
04:05:55,392 --> 04:05:58,965
terminology from ATT&CK and that
is enabling everyone to 

2860
04:05:59,165 --> 04:06:01,596
communicate  that language. The 
other thing I think was a neat 

2861
04:06:01,810 --> 04:06:06,472
thing we did was, October is 
cyber security awareness month, 

2862
04:06:06,885 --> 04:06:15,612
and for this month we actually 
created a video. Related to 

2863
04:06:16,013 --> 04:06:19,060
phishing. It talked through a 
lot of the MITRE  techniques and

2864
04:06:19,261 --> 04:06:23,935
how when someone clicks on the 
link and starts walking through 

2865
04:06:24,135 --> 04:06:26,523
each technique associated with 
now are being installed on a 

2866
04:06:26,672 --> 04:06:33,887
device, it was kind of a neat 
way to get MITRE into the hands 

2867
04:06:34,087 --> 04:06:36,318
of 40,000 associates looking at 
this video  well beyond just the

2868
04:06:36,519 --> 04:06:40,581
I.T. folks.  
>> Absolutely. And that is one 

2869
04:06:40,993 --> 04:06:43,981
murky foundations, it's not just
a community product, a community

2870
04:06:44,161 --> 04:06:48,913
effort. All being on the same 
wavelength to communicate back 

2871
04:06:49,677 --> 04:06:55,543
and forth. One of the things we 
saw in twitter was the scoring 

2872
04:06:55,700 --> 04:07:00,885
system. Capability intent. I 
wanted to dig deeper into what 

2873
04:07:01,647 --> 04:07:05,561
makes something like that stand 
out so much? How do you quantify

2874
04:07:05,762 --> 04:07:08,607
the two values. Other other 
values that will be applicable 

2875
04:07:08,806 --> 04:07:13,882
to you guys do you have between 
your ears that are completely 

2876
04:07:14,083 --> 04:07:16,525
documented yet?  
>> I will grab this one. I mean,

2877
04:07:16,727 --> 04:07:21,097
quite honestly it is not 
scientific. That is a key piece.

2878
04:07:25,050 --> 04:07:27,696
We are not beholden to, I think 
people get bogged down a lot of 

2879
04:07:27,897 --> 04:07:29,897
times trying to make it this 
perfect scoring system. But 

2880
04:07:29,930 --> 04:07:36,421
honestly we just guessed. We did
a lot of guesswork. We did a lot

2881
04:07:36,622 --> 04:07:39,881
of research and that came up 
with, I feel this one is more 

2882
04:07:40,082 --> 04:07:44,496
capable than that one. Bottom 
line is, it doesn't have to be 

2883
04:07:44,645 --> 04:07:49,019
perfect. Has to do is get you 
from this big blob of a whole 

2884
04:07:49,220 --> 04:07:51,652
bunch down to a smaller blob I 
can then work from. That was 

2885
04:07:51,852 --> 04:07:55,514
really the key. He didn't get 
bogged down in the minutia a and

2886
04:07:55,714 --> 04:07:58,360
figure out the perfect scoring 
system. It's actually worked 

2887
04:07:59,117 --> 04:08:06,485
pretty well. We find it over the
course of the last year as we 

2888
04:08:06,685 --> 04:08:09,318
see more reports coming in, that
one isn't as capable as we 

2889
04:08:09,532 --> 04:08:13,993
thought for this organization 
doesn't have quite as much 

2890
04:08:14,395 --> 04:08:16,395
intent in our industry as we 
thought. Sign the presentation 

2891
04:08:16,426 --> 04:08:21,716
we had, 27 threat, I'm not sure 
of the number but we have top 10

2892
04:08:21,917 --> 04:08:24,963
or 12 threat actors we are 
working on. There are a lot less

2893
04:08:25,162 --> 04:08:27,395
than before because we have 
combined over the last year. 

2894
04:08:27,596 --> 04:08:33,287
That is not really necessarily a
new scoring system or 

2895
04:08:33,488 --> 04:08:37,151
prioritization, it's better 
understanding on our part of 

2896
04:08:37,352 --> 04:08:38,925
what the threat actor actually 
does.  

2897
04:08:38,926 --> 04:08:42,027
>> You actually generate those, 
there really interesting. Is the

2898
04:08:42,790 --> 04:08:47,656
tool in-house? The spreadsheet 
debate continues. That is 

2899
04:08:47,817 --> 04:08:52,382
fantastic. You are team XL?  
>> You're in the meeting, how do

2900
04:08:52,583 --> 04:08:56,844
we narrow this down? As soon as 
we put it into the spreadsheet, 

2901
04:08:57,045 --> 04:09:02,081
there it is. You can tell where 
you can focus start seeing the 

2902
04:09:02,232 --> 04:09:08,214
techniques and top quadrants.  
>> I think I'm hearing XL three 

2903
04:09:08,427 --> 04:09:13,650
and not XL zero. We will keep 
going. Final question, you 

2904
04:09:13,811 --> 04:09:16,949
mentioned one of the big things 
I heard the take away from your 

2905
04:09:17,714 --> 04:09:22,028
talk is the I.T. audit culture, 
were so security focused 

2906
04:09:22,227 --> 04:09:27,105
culture. Did a great job 
highlighting that.  

2907
04:09:27,260 --> 04:09:31,165
>> We still maintain the I.T. 
audit culture. That is our bread

2908
04:09:31,778 --> 04:09:37,872
and butter. However, adding the 
threat actor focus and 

2909
04:09:38,072 --> 04:09:42,495
intelligent focus to that, it 
enhances. We have a lot of 

2910
04:09:42,648 --> 04:09:47,145
priorities and demands we place 
on the different teams in our 

2911
04:09:47,319 --> 04:09:50,056
organization. This says I can 
outdrive some positive behavior 

2912
04:09:50,257 --> 04:09:54,724
on actionable intelligence. That
helps put a different lens. 

2913
04:09:55,139 --> 04:09:59,198
Before might've been we have 
this request, put it in. Now, we

2914
04:09:59,400 --> 04:10:01,990
have looked at it from this 
method. When you secure 

2915
04:10:02,140 --> 04:10:07,112
configurations you look at it 
from one way and now we try the 

2916
04:10:07,313 --> 04:10:09,559
MITRE approach and it does , 
have seen a lot of effectiveness

2917
04:10:10,155 --> 04:10:12,427
with that. Our operation 
security has greatly improved by

2918
04:10:12,598 --> 04:10:16,558
adding this extra vehicle now.  
>> Thank you.

2919
04:10:20,312 --> 04:10:22,557
Completely a pleasure and honor 
to sit down with you.  

2920
04:10:22,711 --> 04:10:29,251
>> Great being you here.  
>> In the meantime I want to 

2921
04:10:29,453 --> 04:10:32,911
call it special treats. Virginia
Beach, of the presentations are 

2922
04:10:33,672 --> 04:10:36,560
going great. As well as 
Amsterdam, hope you're having a 

2923
04:10:36,971 --> 04:10:38,971
great time out there. Also

2924
04:10:41,638 --> 04:10:45,903
personally Jacob, that was an 
awesome tree. I appreciate the 

2925
04:10:46,119 --> 04:10:48,549
name and number to printed out. 
One moment will we transition to

2926
04:10:48,749 --> 04:10:53,225
our next speaker. This will be 
Philippe Langlois and Joshua 

2927
04:10:53,985 --> 04:11:00,132
Franklin.  Actually going to 
take a minute. Will be back in a

2928
04:11:00,366 --> 04:11:02,366
couple seconds once the guests 
are ready.

2929
04:12:27,460 --> 04:12:31,122
>>> Welcome back I'm here with 
Josh and Phil. Who delivered a 

2930
04:12:31,322 --> 04:12:34,503
great talk about control. 
Really,

2931
04:12:39,032 --> 04:12:41,064
DBIR is your only authorship? 
Are you calling it quits after 

2932
04:12:41,479 --> 04:12:44,115
one  for one?  
>> We're going to try for one 

2933
04:12:44,315 --> 04:12:48,990
and then we will see where life 
takes us. I've been fortunate, I

2934
04:12:49,192 --> 04:12:51,192
joined the team in September.

2935
04:12:55,082 --> 04:12:57,728
So we are about to ramp up and 
hopefully get a new report out 

2936
04:12:57,928 --> 04:12:59,556
next year.  
>> Awesome. And Josh, the 

2937
04:12:59,557 --> 04:13:04,422
pending question is are the 
glasses always blue? Or is it a 

2938
04:13:04,623 --> 04:13:07,216
mood ring?  
>> I've got about 10 pairs of 

2939
04:13:07,374 --> 04:13:13,562
glasses. Some are 3-D printed, I
bring them places to have 

2940
04:13:13,776 --> 04:13:17,780
special lenses put in. My 
favorite ones look like a 

2941
04:13:17,944 --> 04:13:23,314
Stegosaurus with giant emerging 
eyebrows. My wife hates them and

2942
04:13:23,515 --> 04:13:25,546
says I'm not allowed to wear 
them at professional events.  

2943
04:13:25,746 --> 04:13:27,521
>> Go free to bring them 
tomorrow.  

2944
04:13:27,523 --> 04:13:30,425
>> Thank you.  
>> We have a special pair on 

2945
04:13:30,626 --> 04:13:33,890
deck for Halloween?  
>> I wish. I will definitely 

2946
04:13:34,233 --> 04:13:38,750
where the Stegosaurus pair. 
Appreciate it. I really 

2947
04:13:38,950 --> 04:13:44,641
appreciate your talk. He said 
controls is one of the topics 

2948
04:13:45,042 --> 04:13:47,228
that resonates with a lot of 
people but maybe 

2949
04:13:47,382 --> 04:13:49,382
underrepresented. Especially 
things like this were happy to 

2950
04:13:49,717 --> 04:13:51,547
get perspective. One of the 
biggest questions I had 

2951
04:13:51,548 --> 04:13:54,547
initially is you mentioned low, 
medium and high security 

2952
04:13:54,701 --> 04:13:59,056
controls. What is a good 
approach to define those? What 

2953
04:13:59,269 --> 04:14:02,058
do I need to worry about first 
versus down the road?  

2954
04:14:02,231 --> 04:14:06,381
>> I think you were just talking
about this outside. We actually 

2955
04:14:06,581 --> 04:14:12,874
get this question fairly often. 
CIS has a limitation groups so 

2956
04:14:13,274 --> 04:14:18,768
implantation group 1 is low and 
implementation group to, and 

2957
04:14:19,370 --> 04:14:25,667
group 3, so we let folks choose 
their own you know, group 

2958
04:14:26,081 --> 04:14:30,544
essentially based on basically 
resources dedicated to cyber 

2959
04:14:31,304 --> 04:14:36,839
security activities, basically 
knowledge or contractors that 

2960
04:14:37,039 --> 04:14:40,901
you have access to. And then 
verticality of access. So what 

2961
04:14:41,302 --> 04:14:46,592
that means, sometimes very large
organization actually starts 

2962
04:14:46,793 --> 04:14:51,151
with implantation group 1. 
Sometimes they are really small 

2963
04:14:51,823 --> 04:14:58,568
organizations with critical 
access assets. We are group 3 

2964
04:14:58,768 --> 04:15:02,229
and we need to all hundred said 
controls. Sometimes there is 

2965
04:15:02,388 --> 04:15:04,616
tailoring based on mission as 
well.

04:15:09,135 --> 04:15:10,752
And resources and what is 
available. There's always 

2968
04:15:10,753 --> 04:15:14,212
limitations in terms of 
technology. So it's all hitting 

2969
04:15:14,413 --> 04:15:18,275
that balance. Will be provided 
as a general balance and it's 

2970
04:15:18,491 --> 04:15:20,268
really there to help 
organizations get started.  

2971
04:15:20,269 --> 04:15:22,580
>> It makes absolute sense. 
Scaling is hard. 50,000 people 

2972
04:15:23,289 --> 04:15:25,289
doing something

2973
04:15:27,003 --> 04:15:28,834
easy 50,000 times, very 
challenging. One of the 

2974
04:15:28,835 --> 04:15:31,019
interesting things I was 
thinking about as we talked 

2975
04:15:31,177 --> 04:15:34,878
about going from low, medium and
high, sometimes there seems to 

2976
04:15:35,039 --> 04:15:38,317
be an understanding there is an 
abstraction to behavior and 

2977
04:15:38,475 --> 04:15:41,989
control. What is your best 
practices and approach, any pro 

2978
04:15:42,156 --> 04:15:46,908
tips for how do you have 
something as abstract this 

2979
04:15:47,659 --> 04:15:51,998
privilege access? How do you 
evaluate that?  

2980
04:15:52,163 --> 04:15:56,263
>> That is a loaded question. So
the way we have been looking at 

2981
04:15:56,465 --> 04:15:58,699
it is really from the 
system-level. We get a ground 

2982
04:15:58,900 --> 04:16:02,099
truth looking at things like 
configuration elements and 

2983
04:16:02,247 --> 04:16:05,597
vulnerabilities. What are the 
artifacts on the system that 

2984
04:16:06,258 --> 04:16:11,188
will allow certain activities? 
That comes back from CIS history

2985
04:16:11,904 --> 04:16:14,537
where we originate with 
benchmarks. Secured 

2986
04:16:14,749 --> 04:16:18,597
configuration and guidance. From
that we built assessment tools 

2987
04:16:18,810 --> 04:16:24,091
that look at configuration 
tools. The system artifacts, it 

2988
04:16:24,291 --> 04:16:26,927
doesn't have certain types of 
permissions around certain 

2989
04:16:27,138 --> 04:16:31,200
folders we know are being used 
by malicious actors? The more we

2990
04:16:31,401 --> 04:16:35,061
can kind of start looking for 
background truth and build up, 

2991
04:16:35,464 --> 04:16:39,327
less abstract it's going to be. 
That is really one of the main 

2992
04:16:39,530 --> 04:16:41,960
goals. And that is why I think 
ATT&CK provides a good junction 

2993
04:16:42,374 --> 04:16:45,420
because it is extremely 
technical. You can't go much 

2994
04:16:46,181 --> 04:16:52,327
lower level than that. Is a good
place to start start building an

2995
04:16:52,528 --> 04:16:56,379
a level of abstraction. User 
access control means this, but 

2996
04:16:56,592 --> 04:17:00,589
from a system-level it means you
have these folders and these 

2997
04:17:00,742 --> 04:17:05,052
permissions and these functions.
>> One of the things you kind of

2998
04:17:05,235 --> 04:17:10,810
mentioned was matching controls 
two techniques. It seems like 

2999
04:17:11,011 --> 04:17:13,041
yours is detection mitigation 
but asking from ATT&CK  is there

3000
04:17:13,241 --> 04:17:16,651
anything we can do to make that 
transition mapping?  

3001
04:17:16,806 --> 04:17:21,931
>> One of the difficult -- you 
made the big step. You released 

3002
04:17:22,217 --> 04:17:27,051
mitigations as its own object. I
think that is a big step in the 

3003
04:17:27,801 --> 04:17:29,898
right direction. Obviously 
there's always going to be 

3004
04:17:30,098 --> 04:17:35,392
finessing the languages. All the
nips and talks. I think that is 

3005
04:17:35,593 --> 04:17:37,824
more of a general statement. It 
is hard to talk about defenses 

3006
04:17:38,429 --> 04:17:43,568
and standardized. Right, what is
really AV? It can be anything. 

3007
04:17:43,916 --> 04:17:48,592
There's a lot of interpretation.
As an industry we have to get 

3008
04:17:48,793 --> 04:17:52,857
better as to how we define a 
security control actually does. 

3009
04:17:53,258 --> 04:17:57,880
We are moving in that direction 
but we're not there yet.  

3010
04:17:58,030 --> 04:18:04,030
>> One of my favorite sections, 
I've seen this a couple times, 

3011
04:18:04,431 --> 04:18:06,431
it was interesting to hear from 
your perspective, from the 

3012
04:18:06,465 --> 04:18:09,958
control side is [Indiscernible].
We all want the data, the data, 

3013
04:18:10,328 --> 04:18:14,990
and we get it and it's not what 
you wanted. As a DBIR author,  

3014
04:18:15,540 --> 04:18:19,819
what can producers do to buy the
right data?  

3015
04:18:19,984 --> 04:18:23,530
>> It's really about having a 
level of standards. Being able 

3016
04:18:23,731 --> 04:18:27,180
to talk the same language. Even 
that, it seems like we are 

3017
04:18:27,392 --> 04:18:32,473
moving towards that but that 
sounds super simple. When 

3018
04:18:32,677 --> 04:18:35,038
someone releases a report and 
says an increase in phishing. 

3019
04:18:35,191 --> 04:18:39,579
Okay. Is that email with a link,
is that an email with an 

3020
04:18:39,779 --> 04:18:41,779
attachment, is that an email 
requesting

3021
04:18:45,260 --> 04:18:47,260
Charlie send me your W-2s. Heidi
defend against those is 

3022
04:18:47,291 --> 04:18:49,884
different. Does the link then 
lead you to a place for 

3023
04:18:50,037 --> 04:18:52,037
credentials,

3024
04:18:54,205 --> 04:18:55,821
dropping malicious malware, 
these are all nuanced. It's 

3025
04:18:55,822 --> 04:18:58,670
important to understand because 
it implies and changes are going

3026
04:18:58,871 --> 04:19:02,278
to set up your defenses. How do 
you defend against malicious 

3027
04:19:02,420 --> 04:19:05,569
attachments are different than 
someone getting credentials. I 

3028
04:19:05,783 --> 04:19:12,680
think we have to go towards a 
more in-depth granular level. 

3029
04:19:13,094 --> 04:19:15,080
That attack is providing part of
that language.  

3030
04:19:15,081 --> 04:19:19,551
>> You think, piggybacking on 
attack, you mentioned 

3031
04:19:19,737 --> 04:19:25,476
standardization, even if we all 
write different things, but is 

3032
04:19:25,695 --> 04:19:31,573
there a need for a standardized 
hard format where we can pass 

3033
04:19:31,787 --> 04:19:34,619
things back and forth? Or are we
on the right path as it is?  

3034
04:19:34,820 --> 04:19:38,279
>> I think eventually, I have 
this philosophy, I love 

3035
04:19:38,480 --> 04:19:43,971
automation, but if you can't do 
it manually first, you don't 

3036
04:19:44,172 --> 04:19:47,218
necessarily have processes in 
place, and sometimes you doing 

3037
04:19:47,418 --> 04:19:49,863
automation for the sake of 
automation. I think we have to 

3038
04:19:50,065 --> 04:19:54,128
come together and figure out how
do we describe these? And the 

3039
04:19:54,528 --> 04:19:56,760
attack model might provide at 
eight nonautomated higher-level 

3040
04:19:57,174 --> 04:20:01,856
concept of what attackers are 
doing, this is the pattern has 

3041
04:20:02,604 --> 04:20:05,087
to take. Maybe eventually we 
start moving toward automated 

3042
04:20:05,300 --> 04:20:09,168
sharing where we can get the 
latest and greatest and it 

3043
04:20:09,363 --> 04:20:11,997
doesn't have to be in a 
quarterly review. We can say we 

3044
04:20:12,197 --> 04:20:17,074
know this technique is up and 
tomorrow it's down. Not making 

3045
04:20:17,824 --> 04:20:22,354
strategic decisions based off 
those smalltime bases from a 

3046
04:20:23,105 --> 04:20:26,014
tactical standpoint, if everyone
has seen this and maybe I should

3047
04:20:26,764 --> 04:20:30,077
also look.  
>> Makes absolute sense. One of 

3048
04:20:30,278 --> 04:20:33,685
the things threat your talk was,
the need for making universal 

3049
04:20:33,843 --> 04:20:36,787
decisions. We all see it's the 
same thing and you mentioned a 

3050
04:20:36,987 --> 04:20:41,405
lot of it, almost implied, data 
sharing.  

3051
04:20:41,553 --> 04:20:47,957
>> Understanding were to start. 
Coming from your perspective, is

3052
04:20:48,158 --> 04:20:51,817
there anything you suggest for 
enticing more data sharing?  

3053
04:20:52,367 --> 04:20:57,910
>> Sometimes their equity 
concerns. Or would people care 

3054
04:20:58,111 --> 04:21:00,343
about this stuff? How you pro 
people to come together and 

3055
04:21:00,957 --> 04:21:03,548
share data we need as a 
community to push forward?  

3056
04:21:03,752 --> 04:21:07,451
>> I can hop on this one. I'm 
not necessarily going to have 

3057
04:21:07,652 --> 04:21:12,692
the most popular,. Data sharing 
is useful for very trusted 

3058
04:21:12,839 --> 04:21:20,043
communities. This is one, you 
created a small community of 

3059
04:21:20,257 --> 04:21:23,090
people who have similar 
interests or types of paths to 

3060
04:21:23,840 --> 04:21:27,364
share information. But it's not 
necessarily the data sharing 

3061
04:21:28,122 --> 04:21:32,440
this important as the data 
message. How to make sent and 

3062
04:21:32,641 --> 04:21:39,353
form based on that? It's really 
a balancing act. More people 

3063
04:21:39,513 --> 04:21:42,183
will be consuming the 
translations. Necessarily the 

3064
04:21:42,934 --> 04:21:48,291
raw data. We have a concentrated
industry. Vendors play a large 

3065
04:21:48,492 --> 04:21:54,171
role as they are running tools, 
seeing the larger trends. More 

3066
04:21:54,372 --> 04:21:58,239
we can translate into actionable
things, what am I responsible 

3067
04:21:58,434 --> 04:22:01,894
for for the vendors perspective?
Update my [ Name Unknown ] 

3068
04:22:02,296 --> 04:22:05,702
that's done by the vendor. 
Signatures are done by the 

3069
04:22:05,853 --> 04:22:11,641
vendor. The majority of people 
need to know their up-to-date. 

3070
04:22:12,055 --> 04:22:18,350
Which is kind of the 
foundational context.  

3071
04:22:18,501 --> 04:22:20,781
>> It sounds like context is the
word of the day.  

3072
04:22:20,935 --> 04:22:25,795
>> You mentioned the CIS attack 
model out later this year. 

3073
04:22:25,946 --> 04:22:31,552
Workbench.CAS security.org. You 
mentioned you wanted feedback.  

3074
04:22:32,112 --> 04:22:39,574
>> So we are basically bringing 
people into the community

3075
04:22:44,756 --> 04:22:50,395
ATT&CK model now. We are asking 
people to send us an email  or 

3076
04:22:50,556 --> 04:22:55,210
join workbench like you just 
heard. Or, hit us up on Twitter.

3077
04:23:01,010 --> 04:23:05,875
At the Josh Pitt.  
>> It's blend been a pleasure. 

3078
04:23:06,293 --> 04:23:09,420
You so much.  
>> Next we have Tony Lambert . 

3079
04:23:10,300 --> 04:23:12,300
Thank you. 

3080
04:24:49,071 --> 04:24:51,303
>>> Welcome back I am sitting 
with Tony Lambert who delivered 

3081
04:24:52,065 --> 04:24:58,411
eight excellent talk on 21. I 
appreciate the time. How has it 

3082
04:24:58,612 --> 04:25:01,457
been for you so far?  
>> It's been very well 

3083
04:25:01,672 --> 04:25:03,702
organized. Everyone has been a 
pleasure to work with. If you 

3084
04:25:03,903 --> 04:25:09,181
are used to doing B sides, 
sometimes they are hairier than 

3085
04:25:09,382 --> 04:25:11,414
others when you try to speak. 
But everything has been really 

3086
04:25:11,615 --> 04:25:13,615
will organize. It's amazing.

3087
04:25:17,710 --> 04:25:19,742
>> I'm sure our staff loves to 
hear that.  

3088
04:25:19,907 --> 04:25:21,574
>> I appreciate that. I 
appreciated your talk, although 

3089
04:25:21,576 --> 04:25:25,223
it is one of our platforms 
represented it seems like the 

3090
04:25:25,837 --> 04:25:30,515
ugly stepchild. It's really 
underrepresented. Despite how 

3091
04:25:30,716 --> 04:25:33,085
prevalent it is. IOT is 
everywhere. First thing I wanted

3092
04:25:33,238 --> 04:25:37,411
to pick your mind on is what you
think there is such a slight on 

3093
04:25:37,625 --> 04:25:42,225
Linux.  I had some ideas.  
>> I think some of it comes from

3094
04:25:42,382 --> 04:25:47,368
simply population. And how the 
machines are being used. When 

3095
04:25:47,569 --> 04:25:51,028
you look at the population of 
Linux machines we have an 

3096
04:25:51,429 --> 04:25:54,835
increasing  number of IOT 
devices. We also have 

3097
04:25:54,996 --> 04:25:56,996
traditionally associated

3098
04:26:03,413 --> 04:26:05,042
Linux systems with data server 
environments. Windows systems 

3099
04:26:05,043 --> 04:26:07,277
are typically found all over the
place  end user workstations as 

3100
04:26:07,477 --> 04:26:11,139
well as servers, you're not 
going to see as many Linux  

3101
04:26:11,540 --> 04:26:16,006
desktops in the wild. I am one 
of the 2% waiting for the year 

3102
04:26:16,220 --> 04:26:18,220
of the Lennox

3103
04:26:21,498 --> 04:26:24,130
desktop. They are a victim of 
the population.  When people 

3104
04:26:24,545 --> 04:26:26,545
have breaches that involve

3105
04:26:30,028 --> 04:26:33,890
datacenter breaches they are not
as willing to talk about it. To 

3106
04:26:34,090 --> 04:26:36,481
keep the reports internal, they 
may not publish the.  

3107
04:26:36,643 --> 04:26:40,798
>> I've got to say if anyone in 
the brother has a DVR that is 

3108
04:26:40,998 --> 04:26:43,029
exposed to the Internet and they
have malware, they published 

3109
04:26:43,644 --> 04:26:49,322
that immediately. It's amazing. 
What's awesome. You mentioned we

3110
04:26:50,086 --> 04:26:56,230
are all in lifetime learning. We
can never stop. It seems like 

3111
04:26:56,430 --> 04:26:59,010
you either know it or you don't.
Some the techniques you 

3112
04:26:59,169 --> 04:27:02,322
mentioned, all the stuff, people
might not know that. You have 

3113
04:27:02,523 --> 04:27:07,000
any recommendations for people 
who are eager to work in Linux 

3114
04:27:07,201 --> 04:27:12,479
space but it's hard .  
>> Some of the best resources on

3115
04:27:12,692 --> 04:27:15,940
the Windows side people swear by
the Windows internals books and 

3116
04:27:16,141 --> 04:27:21,421
things like that. Has been 
helpful for me, a Lennox 

3117
04:27:21,622 --> 04:27:23,854
programming interface written by
the same guy that does a lot of 

3118
04:27:24,605 --> 04:27:29,750
demand pages for the system. It 
has been really helpful and 

3119
04:27:29,950 --> 04:27:32,694
covers a lot of system calls 
that are used, in legitimate and

3120
04:27:34,014 --> 04:27:37,062
malicious programs so you know 
how they work and how the 

3121
04:27:37,262 --> 04:27:40,671
programming works behind the 
scenes. We go and look at 

3122
04:27:40,834 --> 04:27:46,199
exploits, when we look at what 
bad guys are using, you find the

3123
04:27:46,399 --> 04:27:48,399
articles, tried to find the 
original payloads. Try to find 

3124
04:27:48,996 --> 04:27:52,905
the script. Maybe we'll find one
virus total or someone else or [

3125
04:27:53,106 --> 04:27:55,644
Name Unknown ] if you start 
searching, really dissect those.

3126
04:27:56,565 --> 04:28:01,229
Go into what each command does. 
To the manual pages. Figure out 

3127
04:28:01,442 --> 04:28:03,442
all how all of this works

3128
04:28:06,107 --> 04:28:08,138
, the deeper you dive the 
weirder this gets. When I 

3129
04:28:08,901 --> 04:28:15,659
started off, the LD preload, it 
was like black magic to me. And 

3130
04:28:15,859 --> 04:28:18,505
then I realized, wait a minute, 
this is a 20-year-old structure 

3131
04:28:18,706 --> 04:28:23,985
that no one has bothered to -- 
people have known about it for 

3132
04:28:24,185 --> 04:28:27,645
20 years but no one has really 
tried to build security around 

3133
04:28:27,847 --> 04:28:33,327
it and people assume that if 
it's going to mess up things for

3134
04:28:33,528 --> 04:28:35,528
everybody you have to be 
administrator. What happens with

3135
04:28:35,919 --> 04:28:37,919
administrator privileges? More 
you understand about how the 

3136
04:28:38,206 --> 04:28:40,850
structures work as you start 
going through the payloads, it 

3137
04:28:41,051 --> 04:28:45,715
gets weird, it gets fun. What 
has helped me the most is that 

3138
04:28:45,929 --> 04:28:47,520
book and looking through the 
payloads.  

3139
04:28:47,521 --> 04:28:52,626
>> When hearing is the Linux 
fear is  truly earned. A badge 

3140
04:28:52,826 --> 04:28:56,434
of honor.  
>> Badge of honor or badge of 

3141
04:28:56,605 --> 04:28:59,134
embarrassment from it's time you
spend looking at the manual. Is 

3142
04:28:59,334 --> 04:29:02,132
a significant amount of time to 
work on it. Some things are 

3143
04:29:02,300 --> 04:29:06,855
fairly simple, but if you have 
grown up on a Windows system, 

3144
04:29:07,045 --> 04:29:10,029
it's going to be significantly 
harder. I got a head start with 

3145
04:29:10,177 --> 04:29:13,555
this because in my previous job 
used to work in various systems,

3146
04:29:13,755 --> 04:29:19,434
I was a systems administrator 
and I used to do a little bit of

3147
04:29:19,648 --> 04:29:22,443
administration so I got a head 
start. I was prepared for 

3148
04:29:22,593 --> 04:29:26,342
success. And some folks have 
never encountered it until they 

3149
04:29:26,556 --> 04:29:30,204
get into a security job. That's 
when they have to learn the hard

3150
04:29:30,404 --> 04:29:34,478
way really fast.  
>> Getting back into the 

3151
04:29:34,880 --> 04:29:39,342
conversation you're talking 
about alterable detection. What 

3152
04:29:39,557 --> 04:29:44,219
makes a good alert.  One of the 
things I wanted to ask about, 

3153
04:29:44,420 --> 04:29:47,883
you build that context you 
focused on? Is it based on 

3154
04:29:48,083 --> 04:29:50,114
specific behavior detecting, the
environment, other variables 

3155
04:29:50,314 --> 04:29:55,190
like the capability? What are 
you collecting data from? How do

3156
04:29:55,391 --> 04:29:57,378
you know the context so crucial 
for that?  

3157
04:29:57,380 --> 04:30:04,535
>> What we try to do, in my 
organization for alerts, we try 

3158
04:30:04,735 --> 04:30:06,968
to actually put the criteria for
the alert in front of the 

3159
04:30:07,182 --> 04:30:09,614
analyst. We try to put all the 
process details, the process 

3160
04:30:09,815 --> 04:30:12,059
executing at that particular 
time, and within a couple of 

3161
04:30:12,259 --> 04:30:15,507
clicks of the mouse to bring up 
an interface that shows the 

3162
04:30:16,267 --> 04:30:19,769
process timeline and do things 
like that. Already we have the 

3163
04:30:20,533 --> 04:30:25,259
process context, all the things 
that has touched theoretically 

3164
04:30:25,661 --> 04:30:29,111
assuming that it gets captured 
properly. And we have the alert 

3165
04:30:29,323 --> 04:30:32,369
criteria. They already know two 
pieces of data, to investigative

3166
04:30:32,569 --> 04:30:37,803
leads and we can Zubac on the 
timeline -- zoom back on the 

3167
04:30:37,968 --> 04:30:44,153
timeline. We have also tried to 
do with some of our alerting 

3168
04:30:44,554 --> 04:30:46,554
criteria, we have an interesting
alert page analyst isn't sure 

3169
04:30:46,584 --> 04:30:50,447
what is going on in a particular
alert materia, maybe they're not

3170
04:30:51,209 --> 04:30:54,304
familiar with Linux they can 
click look at the alert page  

3171
04:30:54,505 --> 04:30:58,109
have examples of things they 
have seen in the wild that are 

3172
04:30:58,267 --> 04:31:01,613
malicious and documented known 
false positives. And if they 

3173
04:31:01,825 --> 04:31:05,888
want to learn more, a few 
records links to to the attack 

3174
04:31:06,089 --> 04:31:10,965
framework or other resources to 
understand how it works.  

3175
04:31:11,110 --> 04:31:13,110
>> It sounds like it starts with
collection, proceeds to analysis

3176
04:31:13,197 --> 04:31:18,010
and then follows up with IR. 
There is a full context.  

3177
04:31:18,168 --> 04:31:20,168
>> Absolutely.

3178
04:31:22,738 --> 04:31:25,533
The thing I always hear from 
people is, what you mean by 

3179
04:31:25,691 --> 04:31:31,277
context? What sort of context do
you need for this? I think a lot

3180
04:31:31,477 --> 04:31:33,508
of that is a self defining 
criteria in your organization. 

3181
04:31:33,710 --> 04:31:35,943
You don't know what context you 
needed to talk to your 

3182
04:31:36,143 --> 04:31:39,348
analyst's. If you want to know 
what context you need at your 

3183
04:31:39,506 --> 04:31:43,666
analyst, figure out what's going
to make their job easier. You're

3184
04:31:43,870 --> 04:31:46,099
going to be happier. They are 
going to be happier. Have a 

3185
04:31:46,300 --> 04:31:48,947
higher morale and a sense of 
ownership. It's going to be a 

3186
04:31:49,148 --> 04:31:51,591
better thing for all. But the 
analyst don't know until you 

3187
04:31:52,355 --> 04:31:56,670
test it. You got to do that 
testing and he's at the data.  

3188
04:31:56,871 --> 04:32:00,118
>> It's one of those things like
shopping for a car, you don't 

3189
04:32:00,319 --> 04:32:03,570
know what you want to see it 
sometimes. Is the same thing 

3190
04:32:03,776 --> 04:32:05,800
with some of these alerts until 
you start asking, have you 

3191
04:32:06,014 --> 04:32:08,045
thought of this before?  
>> We have all been there. 

3192
04:32:08,808 --> 04:32:13,410
Wrapping up, you've expressed or
shown a great deal of expertise,

3193
04:32:14,339 --> 04:32:19,566
but in your opinion what is next
for Linux?  It seems to be more 

3194
04:32:19,718 --> 04:32:24,296
ubiquitous.-We as a community 
grow and face the challenges?  

3195
04:32:24,835 --> 04:32:28,145
>> The next big thing of doing 
continuing monitoring of 

3196
04:32:28,361 --> 04:32:32,623
security and systems  we are 
fairly used to doing thread 

3197
04:32:32,825 --> 04:32:37,090
hunting from logs. Used to 
gathering logs from all sorts of

3198
04:32:37,292 --> 04:32:42,509
forms on Linux , where not used 
to continuous real-time 

3199
04:32:42,674 --> 04:32:48,065
monitoring. To do that a lot of 
times, if you are using a 

3200
04:32:48,463 --> 04:32:51,054
commercial tool chances are it 
has a kernel module involved, it

3201
04:32:51,212 --> 04:32:53,742
driver, something that is going 
to be a little unstable for the 

3202
04:32:53,942 --> 04:32:57,803
system and people really get 
uptight about the production 

3203
04:32:58,568 --> 04:33:01,867
Linux  data center. The don't 
want to reduce modules that will

3204
04:33:02,619 --> 04:33:06,546
cause instability. I think the 
really next big thing we're 

3205
04:33:06,746 --> 04:33:09,991
starting to see some commercial 
sensors and other tools is the 

3206
04:33:10,756 --> 04:33:14,871
implementation of where they 
take advantage more of audit 

3207
04:33:15,072 --> 04:33:19,538
subsystems that are built into 
the Linux  kernel like an audit 

3208
04:33:19,750 --> 04:33:25,942
subsystem the fuels auditd  and 
also process tracing.

3209
04:33:30,106 --> 04:33:31,736
It has been really heralded. 
Awesome for performance, 

3210
04:33:31,737 --> 04:33:33,967
diagnostics and tooling. The 
folks to container scaling. They

3211
04:33:34,728 --> 04:33:39,044
love it. You can also do good 
process and system call on a 

3212
04:33:39,246 --> 04:33:44,325
resistant to root kits. Once you
start seeing a new generation of

3213
04:33:44,525 --> 04:33:49,404
sensors and a new generation of 
things like the query and new 

3214
04:33:49,604 --> 04:33:51,234
technologies you're going to 
have more reliable data 

3215
04:33:51,235 --> 04:33:53,235
collection you can build

3216
04:33:55,497 --> 04:33:57,726
, continuous data collection you
can build analytics on top of.  

3217
04:33:57,942 --> 04:34:01,390
>> An exciting future. Thank you
for your time. Before I sign off

3218
04:34:02,155 --> 04:34:07,685
thank you ATT&CK a community , 
don't forget about the selfie 

3219
04:34:07,886 --> 04:34:12,967
posters. Like I said, we saw 
you, keep them coming. We love 

3220
04:34:13,169 --> 04:34:15,813
it. I'm going to sign off for 
the rest of the lunch break but 

3221
04:34:16,562 --> 04:34:21,501
stay tuned. ATT&CK Con will be 
back in about 25 minutes.  

3222
04:43:25,440 --> 04:43:35,353
>>> MITRE's  ATT&CK Con 2.0  
will continue in five minutes.

3223
04:43:36,467 --> 04:43:38,467
Please take your seats.

3224
04:46:03,056 --> 04:46:09,315
>>> ATT&CK Con  2.0 will 
continue in two minutes.

3225
04:48:26,356 --> 04:48:30,352
>>> If you are under attack she 
has got your back. Welcome back 

3226
04:48:30,498 --> 04:48:32,783
to ATT&CK Con 2.0 

3227
04:48:36,085 --> 04:48:37,714
.  
>> Just follow me around and 

3228
04:48:37,715 --> 04:48:41,720
hyped me up. Welcome back from 
lunch. Welcome back to those 

3229
04:48:41,878 --> 04:48:49,086
online. Thank you so much to 
VMRAY for sponsoring  our lunch 

3230
04:48:49,490 --> 04:48:53,352
including ice cream. I was 
particularly pumped about the 

3231
04:48:53,761 --> 04:48:56,607
ice cream. Some of you are still
wrapping that up. I'm going to 

3232
04:48:56,807 --> 04:49:00,868
be doing the same thing. 
Hopefully got to connect with 

3233
04:49:01,069 --> 04:49:03,300
folks online, hearing person. 
Think he to Jamie Williams and 

3234
04:49:03,513 --> 04:49:08,991
our special guest, and speakers 
on the ATT&CK Con couch.  We 

3235
04:49:09,192 --> 04:49:12,238
hope you enjoy that as well. It 
is now my pleasure to introduce 

3236
04:49:12,440 --> 04:49:15,700
Gary Gagnon.  He is the Vice 
President of Cyber Strategy and 

3237
04:49:15,902 --> 04:49:17,902
Chief Security Officer 

3238
04:49:21,331 --> 04:49:23,331
here at MITRE. 

3239
04:49:27,474 --> 04:49:30,320
As the chief security officer, 
there you go, the audio was 

3240
04:49:30,520 --> 04:49:33,113
excited about Gary coming on, as
the chief security officer 

3241
04:49:33,283 --> 04:49:37,840
directs efforts promoting 
security as a strategic asset 

3242
04:49:38,045 --> 04:49:41,694
across the company. He pioneered
MITRE's transformation from  a 

3243
04:49:41,894 --> 04:49:45,966
vulnerability based approach to 
a threat-based strategy allowing

3244
04:49:46,167 --> 04:49:48,167
us to identify and respond to 
emerging cyber threats.'s 

3245
04:49:48,197 --> 04:49:52,873
leadership and vision also help 
the the foundation on which 

3246
04:49:53,275 --> 04:49:55,863
ATT&CK was built and championed 
its release  4.5 years ago. 

3247
04:49:56,032 --> 04:49:59,931
Please join me in welcoming Gary
Gagnon. 

3248
04:50:00,079 --> 04:50:02,079
>> [Applause]  

3249
04:50:05,869 --> 04:50:11,761
>> Can you hear me? Is it turned
on? Yeah, so thank you, Katie. I

3250
04:50:11,961 --> 04:50:16,223
can't believe actually did all 
that. So yes, I am the vice 

3251
04:50:16,437 --> 04:50:19,431
president in charge of cyber 
security.

3252
04:50:22,929 --> 04:50:26,133
Those up so we could try things 
out ourselves, to try concepts 

3253
04:50:26,300 --> 04:50:29,838
out the we could advise the 
government on. Have been at 

3254
04:50:30,037 --> 04:50:34,313
MITRE since  1986 in cyber 
security. Pretty much all the 

3255
04:50:34,513 --> 04:50:41,424
time. I had a brief time I was 
outside of MITRE,  was recently 

3256
04:50:42,385 --> 04:50:45,072
at Amazon. It was the public 
service commission that MITRE 

3257
04:50:45,822 --> 04:50:49,697
hand  the brought me back here. 
Am really excited that I am 

3258
04:50:49,851 --> 04:50:54,827
back. So, this year the vibe in 
this room has been incredible. 

3259
04:50:55,028 --> 04:50:57,978
There is so much excitement, 
they transform coupled with

3260
04:51:01,522 --> 04:51:03,522
you are doing in partnership is 
really outstanding. I never 

3261
04:51:03,555 --> 04:51:06,601
would have thought 2015 when 
Blake presented the ATT&CK 

3262
04:51:07,351 --> 04:51:11,481
framework  to me that we would 
have this type across the 

3263
04:51:11,682 --> 04:51:13,682
ecosystem. I appreciate all the 
enthusiasm.

3264
04:51:17,582 --> 04:51:21,845
So, instead of talking about 
ATT&CK, you're going to hear a 

3265
04:51:22,047 --> 04:51:25,498
lot about ATT&CK,  I think a lot
of us should be thinking to 

3266
04:51:25,699 --> 04:51:28,681
ourselves, what is it we want to
get out of this time together 

3267
04:51:28,845 --> 04:51:33,214
today? We are certainly building
a partnership, we are building a

3268
04:51:33,977 --> 04:51:37,891
strong partnership the we want 
to continue to advance ATT&CK 

3269
04:51:38,091 --> 04:51:44,597
and threatened  informed defense
at large. This is event to 

3270
04:51:44,998 --> 04:51:47,230
socialize and get to know each 
other and strategize what to do 

3271
04:51:47,431 --> 04:51:50,690
next. In 1999 when we released 
CVE who would've thought 20 

3272
04:51:50,890 --> 04:51:56,987
years later that would still be 
an industry standard. And a 

3273
04:51:57,748 --> 04:52:04,700
quick statistics, 143,000 named 
abilities now. And we have 109 

3274
04:52:05,650 --> 04:52:11,150
CNA, companies have agreed to 
release their vulnerability 

3275
04:52:11,300 --> 04:52:15,630
information in 18 countries. I 
think we are on the same 

3276
04:52:15,784 --> 04:52:20,748
trajectory with ATT&CK, the same
type of momentum.  I want to 

3277
04:52:20,949 --> 04:52:23,508
encourage us all to continue the
engagement and work toward that.

3278
04:52:25,627 --> 04:52:31,313
So the idea behind ATT&CK was 
formed  out of what is called 

3279
04:52:31,512 --> 04:52:37,819
frustration on my part. I was 
watching this cutie security to 

3280
04:52:38,019 --> 04:52:43,297
the do what I call block and 
crouch. We were blocking and 

3281
04:52:43,498 --> 04:52:45,529
catching until he saw the next 
attack. Hopefully we saw and 

3282
04:52:45,731 --> 04:52:48,577
then we blocked and crouched. It
was not a proactive defense. We 

3283
04:52:48,778 --> 04:52:52,238
decided we were going to try to 
change the game. That simple 

3284
04:52:52,997 --> 04:52:57,935
high-level strategy, a talented 
team, you can do a lot of great 

3285
04:52:58,130 --> 04:53:00,563
things. And I think that is what
has happened here with us and 

3286
04:53:00,764 --> 04:53:04,982
now with you guys. Getting out 
of the vulnerability based 

3287
04:53:05,139 --> 04:53:08,889
crouch approach, to proactive 
defense is kind of a message I 

3288
04:53:09,101 --> 04:53:14,716
think we have been trying to 
deliver. I just got my talking 

3289
04:53:14,876 --> 04:53:17,375
points 10 minutes ago. So,

3290
04:53:23,312 --> 04:53:27,588
again, I encourage us all to 
continue to work together and 

3291
04:53:27,788 --> 04:53:30,021
try to stay engaged. I think 
Blake did a great job this 

3292
04:53:30,221 --> 04:53:33,014
morning when up the framework 
and what the future is going to 

3293
04:53:33,211 --> 04:53:36,314
hold. Rich is going to do a 
presentation later today on his 

3294
04:53:36,515 --> 04:53:41,805
vision and how he sees ATT&CK 
over the next few years . We are

3295
04:53:42,005 --> 04:53:44,005
looking for feedback and 
response on what that could look

3296
04:53:44,107 --> 04:53:46,680
like. We have some ideas but we 
are really looking for the 

3297
04:53:46,884 --> 04:53:51,757
community to help us shape it. 
So again, by numbers, we have 

3298
04:53:52,519 --> 04:53:57,853
more than 5000 people attending 
this event. Both here and in our

3299
04:53:58,054 --> 04:54:04,760
watch rooms and online. We have 
a tremendous turnout and again 

3300
04:54:04,961 --> 04:54:07,193
that excitement, I think we want
to take out of this conference 

3301
04:54:07,394 --> 04:54:10,240
into the future in what we are 
trying to do with ATT&CK.  So, 

3302
04:54:10,441 --> 04:54:13,647
thanks again for all your 
support. Thank you for coming 

3303
04:54:13,786 --> 04:54:18,501
out. It is interesting, I'm 
doing a welcome 1.5 days into a 

3304
04:54:18,779 --> 04:54:22,661
conference, with 1.5 days left. 
But that is okay. Welcome let's 

3305
04:54:22,829 --> 04:54:27,621
keep up the momentum. Thanks.  
>> [Applause] 

3306
04:54:37,250 --> 04:54:41,731
>> Thank you so much for her the
welcoming remarks. Time flies 

3307
04:54:41,926 --> 04:54:45,386
when you're having fun. We 
appreciate Gary's leadership as 

3308
04:54:45,591 --> 04:54:49,650
the ATT&CK team  and getting it 
released. I can't believe it's 

3309
04:54:49,850 --> 04:54:53,298
been 4.5 years. Thank you so 
much. Now coming back from lunch

3310
04:54:53,511 --> 04:54:58,589
we have a special treat for you.
I am not typing them up, it's 

3311
04:54:58,990 --> 04:55:02,237
awesome to live up to your 
expectations. Sarah and Jackie 

3312
04:55:02,452 --> 04:55:07,528
are going to be talking next. 
It's funny, I was enjoying 

3313
04:55:07,734 --> 04:55:09,961
introducing people from our team
because I remember earlier this 

3314
04:55:10,161 --> 04:55:12,808
year when they both came into my
office and I have been teaching 

3315
04:55:13,009 --> 04:55:17,073
them how to map things manually 
to ATT&CK like we did  in the 

3316
04:55:17,830 --> 04:55:20,722
training yesterday, and they 
were picking it up well. They 

3317
04:55:20,935 --> 04:55:25,552
looked at me and were like, 
Katie, can we write code to do 

3318
04:55:25,695 --> 04:55:32,098
this? And I am like, yes. I just
spending a couple years doing it

3319
04:55:32,311 --> 04:55:34,744
but if you want to write code to
automate that, yes. Afford. And 

3320
04:55:35,505 --> 04:55:39,005
they did. And I think it's a 
great story about the power of 

3321
04:55:39,756 --> 04:55:43,070
bringing new people into teams. 
They hadn't come along I 

3322
04:55:43,270 --> 04:55:45,270
would've been manually mapping 
this stuff.

3323
04:55:48,963 --> 04:55:50,994
I encourage you to bring new 
people and perspectives on to 

3324
04:55:51,194 --> 04:55:53,638
your teams because it has paid 
off for us. Sarah and Jackie are

3325
04:55:53,838 --> 04:55:56,070
going to talk about an awesome 
tool they have been working on. 

3326
04:55:56,271 --> 04:55:58,515
I'm not really going to steal 
any more of their thunder. I'm 

3327
04:55:58,715 --> 04:56:02,100
going to let you tell them about
it themselves. Please join me in

3328
04:56:02,239 --> 04:56:06,842
welcoming Jackie Lasky and Sarah
Yoder. 

3329
04:56:06,979 --> 04:56:09,589
>> [Applause]    
>> [ Captioners Transitioning ]

3330
04:56:18,378 --> 04:56:24,115
>> We are security engineers 
here at MITRE and we are going 

3331
04:56:24,315 --> 04:56:29,146
to share  our methodology behind
tram which we have been working 

3332
04:56:29,331 --> 04:56:34,473
on to create an easier way to 
map threats to ATT&CK.  We will 

3333
04:56:35,223 --> 04:56:40,575
start with, how does information
get into the ATT&CK site? This 

3334
04:56:40,776 --> 04:56:44,987
starts with finding  open threat
reportings, so looking at common

3335
04:56:45,136 --> 04:56:47,136
vendors

3336
04:56:56,218 --> 04:56:58,942
, and when we have the report, 
we will finally go through

3337
04:57:09,618 --> 04:57:11,853
and look for the attacks in 
there, some of you have learned,

3338
04:57:12,053 --> 04:57:14,488
this is a very manual process 
and it takes a long time, it 

3339
04:57:14,704 --> 04:57:16,704
usually starts by looking for 
the tactics, we will highlight 

3340
04:57:16,723 --> 04:57:21,394
along the way any verbs or 
tactics and when we are done we 

3341
04:57:21,607 --> 04:57:26,076
will repeat this process and 
look for all the techniques in 

3342
04:57:26,277 --> 04:57:28,310
the report, it takes a really 
long time to cross-reference the

3343
04:57:28,512 --> 04:57:30,331
tactics, the sentences and 
looking at the techniques that 

3344
04:57:30,332 --> 04:57:34,802
they map to. So all the data 
that is entered is done 

3345
04:57:35,002 --> 04:57:38,210
manually, which means it is hard
to keep it up-to-date, we have a

3346
04:57:38,376 --> 04:57:43,738
huge backlog of reports that are
on analyzed and we get to 

3347
04:57:43,940 --> 04:57:45,940
prioritize some over others, we 
also have human error. Two 

3348
04:57:45,975 --> 04:57:48,624
analysts may have two different 
interpretations of the same 

3349
04:57:49,387 --> 04:57:51,387
text, this

3350
04:57:53,080 --> 04:57:58,767
also has availability biased, 
you are more likely to think of 

3351
04:57:58,981 --> 04:58:01,003
the attack that you are already 
familiar with, which can cause 

3352
04:58:01,217 --> 04:58:03,451
you to overlook some of the less
common techniques that are out 

3353
04:58:03,651 --> 04:58:09,877
there. And also training new 
team members, too, it is a huge 

3354
04:58:10,078 --> 04:58:13,744
site. It is a lot to take in.

3355
04:58:18,068 --> 04:58:20,068
We call this tram

3356
04:58:22,736 --> 04:58:25,587
for short, and it grew out of a 
need to be able to automate some

3357
04:58:25,788 --> 04:58:28,488
of the stuff we do here. We are 
just going to give a quick 

3358
04:58:29,189 --> 04:58:32,907
little overview of the details 
to the technical approach as we 

3359
04:58:33,107 --> 04:58:35,542
started this project. We don't 
have a lot of time to get into 

3360
04:58:35,743 --> 04:58:39,194
the details but you can always 
find this after, the first step 

3361
04:58:39,395 --> 04:58:41,741
was to get data in. Basically we
just

3362
04:58:46,714 --> 04:58:48,949
grab down all the example data 
from each techniques page and we

3363
04:58:49,150 --> 04:58:51,385
are going to use that for the 
training data set, before we 

3364
04:58:51,585 --> 04:58:57,673
could do that, a lot of the text
is unstructured text in some 

3365
04:58:57,887 --> 04:59:00,122
human language, we had to get it
into a language that the 

3366
04:59:00,323 --> 04:59:02,356
computer could understand, this 
is where a lot of the data 

3367
04:59:02,557 --> 04:59:07,024
normalization occurs. We do a 
lot of things like doing the 

3368
04:59:07,426 --> 04:59:10,023
limitation, things like that, 
that is going to occur in this 

3369
04:59:10,173 --> 04:59:13,928
step. Once we have got the data 
in the good format, we can start

3370
04:59:14,129 --> 04:59:18,196
building and training models, to
do this we use Python's logistic

3371
04:59:18,397 --> 04:59:21,249
regression which is a supervised
classification method, and what 

3372
04:59:21,450 --> 04:59:24,795
each technique has is their own 
bottle model built for them.

3373
04:59:28,356 --> 04:59:30,738
The positive class consist of 
the examples from the attack 

3374
04:59:30,880 --> 04:59:35,664
site and the negative class 
consist of a variety of things, 

3375
04:59:35,865 --> 04:59:37,898
maybe like true negatives for 
sentences that don't link to any

3376
04:59:38,099 --> 04:59:40,897
at all, or other examples to 
differentiate between different 

3377
04:59:41,046 --> 04:59:46,220
techniques. So after we have 
trained and built the models, we

3378
04:59:46,435 --> 04:59:52,319
have to collect a reliable test 
data set that we can use, we do 

3379
04:59:52,463 --> 04:59:57,806
this using our own assess feed, 
you can just grab a bunch of 

3380
04:59:58,008 --> 05:00:00,644
reports that you want to look at
and use that to collect the test

3381
05:00:00,857 --> 05:00:02,857
data set that we used.

3382
05:00:12,633 --> 05:00:15,067
Once we have the test data, we 
were able to transform the test 

3383
05:00:15,268 --> 05:00:17,502
data with the models we built 
from the previous step, this is 

3384
05:00:17,716 --> 05:00:19,953
where we can perform a lot of 
the cross validation and check 

3385
05:00:20,153 --> 05:00:22,389
how the model is performing as 
we go through the process. Once 

3386
05:00:22,590 --> 05:00:25,025
we have ran the reports through 
the models, we get a print out 

3387
05:00:25,225 --> 05:00:27,458
that the analyst can look at and
decide whether they approve or 

3388
05:00:27,658 --> 05:00:29,893
edge reject the techniques found
in the model. We will have a 

3389
05:00:30,106 --> 05:00:32,943
list of the techniques and they 
can go through and decide if 

3390
05:00:33,144 --> 05:00:35,144
they like them or not.

3391
05:00:38,029 --> 05:00:40,465
We can also add ones that are 
missed as well. We have a 

3392
05:00:40,666 --> 05:00:43,151
feedback loop to improve the 
model as we go through, so we 

3393
05:00:43,299 --> 05:00:45,134
use the database to track the 
true positives, false positives,

3394
05:00:45,135 --> 05:00:51,223
things like that, to make the 
model better each time. We use a

3395
05:00:51,436 --> 05:00:54,275
pickle file so we can reload and
rebuild the models whenever the 

3396
05:00:54,476 --> 05:00:59,358
data gets added to the ATT&CK 
site. We had a lot of challenges

3397
05:00:59,559 --> 05:01:02,598
we had to overcome . The most 
obvious is extracting the 

3398
05:01:02,798 --> 05:01:10,317
meaning of text, we are still 
using humans in the process, so 

3399
05:01:10,518 --> 05:01:12,518
we need to improve

3400
05:01:17,831 --> 05:01:20,065
the feedback loop and improve 
the models as we go, but it 

3401
05:01:20,280 --> 05:01:22,303
almost always comes back to not 
having enough data to train 

3402
05:01:22,503 --> 05:01:24,503
with, this can lead to 
imbalanced data sets, we can 

3403
05:01:24,538 --> 05:01:26,862
have a large set of examples

3404
05:01:30,630 --> 05:01:32,866
, and we had some techniques of 
attacks that don't have any 

3405
05:01:33,065 --> 05:01:38,349
techniques at all, so on those 
cases, we had to build out 

3406
05:01:38,550 --> 05:01:42,415
regular expressions and matching
things to handle those cases 

3407
05:01:42,816 --> 05:01:44,816
that we couldn't build enough 
models for.

3408
05:01:51,352 --> 05:01:53,986
>> Now I'm going to go over how 
it looks, because we have a 

3409
05:01:54,202 --> 05:02:00,394
short timeslot, a lot of this 
demo, we are just going to skip 

3410
05:02:00,554 --> 05:02:02,554
through this, at this point in 
the tool, we would assume that 

3411
05:02:02,726 --> 05:02:04,726
the analyst has gone online, 
found the report they are 

3412
05:02:04,759 --> 05:02:08,213
interested in, grab the URL and 
ran it through the tool TRAM , 

3413
05:02:08,414 --> 05:02:13,085
this is the view that they would
see and as you can see, if they 

3414
05:02:13,285 --> 05:02:15,119
click on the highlighted 
sentence, it'll show you a 

3415
05:02:15,120 --> 05:02:19,789
couple of techniques that TRAM  
found, in this example, 

3416
05:02:19,990 --> 05:02:23,243
spearfishing link and attachment
going back to what Jackie said, 

3417
05:02:23,443 --> 05:02:27,913
sometimes the computer has 
trouble distinguishing several 

3418
05:02:28,114 --> 05:02:33,600
techniques. From here, we can go
ahead and reject spearfishing 

3419
05:02:33,801 --> 05:02:36,482
links since that wasn't what the
sentence was talking about and 

3420
05:02:36,651 --> 05:02:38,651
confirm or accept the 
spearfishing attachment.

3421
05:02:43,755 --> 05:02:46,193
Since that was correct. As you 
can see, it got rid of the 

3422
05:02:46,393 --> 05:02:48,393
spearfishing link from the list 
and added the attachment down 

3423
05:02:48,427 --> 05:02:52,584
into the confirmed techniques. 
So, from here, as mentioned,

3424
05:02:56,348 --> 05:02:59,090
the models will be updated based
on the accept or reject

3425
05:03:03,667 --> 05:03:05,700
as the analyst goes through this
report. He would follow this 

3426
05:03:05,900 --> 05:03:08,948
process for the rest of the 
report and you can then export 

3427
05:03:09,149 --> 05:03:14,927
it as a PDF. So, at the bottom 
of the PDF,

3428
05:03:20,123 --> 05:03:22,760
you would get a chart that looks
like this, that has all of the 

3429
05:03:22,961 --> 05:03:24,961
confirmed techniques from the 
report that you analyzed. So we 

3430
05:03:24,993 --> 05:03:27,629
hope this is a useful little 
snippet that the analyst can use

3431
05:03:27,831 --> 05:03:30,065
to share with maybe other 
members on your team or for us, 

3432
05:03:30,279 --> 05:03:34,268
we will probably be feeding this
to get more information into the

3433
05:03:34,409 --> 05:03:38,896
site. So why does this matter? 
Other than

3434
05:03:43,888 --> 05:03:46,522
a use case which was to automate
our jobs, we hope it is useful 

3435
05:03:46,723 --> 05:03:51,596
for you as well. We know that 
mapping reports to ATT&CK can be

3436
05:03:51,811 --> 05:03:53,831
overwhelming, there's a lot of 
techniques to choose from so we 

3437
05:03:54,045 --> 05:03:56,478
hope this is a good starting 
place  since there is only a 

3438
05:03:56,679 --> 05:03:59,049
handful of techniques that the 
analyst needs to review per 

3439
05:03:59,207 --> 05:04:06,637
sentence. As Jackie mentioned, 
remembering 266 and growing, it 

3440
05:04:06,838 --> 05:04:08,838
is hard, and there are many 
techniques that sometimes I 

3441
05:04:09,410 --> 05:04:13,944
forget about so luckily the 
computer doesn't have that 

3442
05:04:14,145 --> 05:04:19,629
problem, so it can remember them
for us. Next, we hope that you 

3443
05:04:19,842 --> 05:04:21,842
can use reporting that is 
important to you, whether that 

3444
05:04:21,864 --> 05:04:25,932
is internal report source, or if
you feel like ATT&CK doesn't 

3445
05:04:26,132 --> 05:04:29,584
have enough information on the 
financial sector or healthcare  

3446
05:04:29,998 --> 05:04:32,634
or whatever your use case may 
be, we hope you can use this to 

3447
05:04:32,834 --> 05:04:37,303
get more data for the techniques
that you care about. Some 

3448
05:04:37,504 --> 05:04:42,388
takeaways, many people have 
talked about ATT&CK helping to 

3449
05:04:42,589 --> 05:04:49,905
frame behaviors , moving away 
from IOC's and we hope that you 

3450
05:04:50,106 --> 05:04:52,341
can use a lot of what other 
people are discussing today, 

3451
05:04:52,542 --> 05:04:57,974
mainly the four main attack use 
cases which are the detections 

3452
05:04:58,127 --> 05:05:00,127
and

3453
05:05:03,913 --> 05:05:05,745
contract adversaries you care 
about using a cyber threat 

3454
05:05:05,746 --> 05:05:07,564
intelligence and potentially 
emulate those adversaries. We 

3455
05:05:07,565 --> 05:05:11,833
acknowledge that not getting 
data to attack is hard but that 

3456
05:05:12,033 --> 05:05:17,933
is where we thought TRAM could 
make it easier. With that, we 

3457
05:05:18,134 --> 05:05:22,803
have some time for questions.  
Most important, this will be 

3458
05:05:23,003 --> 05:05:25,036
open source and available to the
community hopefully by the end 

3459
05:05:25,237 --> 05:05:27,237
of the year.

3460
05:05:39,663 --> 05:05:44,897
>> Hi, this is fantastic, I have
been wondering, if you have had 

3461
05:05:45,048 --> 05:05:47,048
any

3462
05:05:49,206 --> 05:05:51,037
experience or the community has 
had any experience with 

3463
05:05:51,039 --> 05:05:54,489
overlapping this with a tip 
whether it is a commercial tool 

3464
05:05:54,690 --> 05:05:57,739
or integrating those two things.
>> We are still really early in 

3465
05:05:57,941 --> 05:05:59,941
this process on building this 
but

3466
05:06:04,442 --> 05:06:07,290
I can see as it gets more mature
and if the community can make it

3467
05:06:07,490 --> 05:06:09,886
even better, that would 
definitely be an option to be 

3468
05:06:10,032 --> 05:06:13,179
used.
>> Just a real quick technical 

3469
05:06:13,379 --> 05:06:19,680
question on your NLP, was that 
the only library or learning 

3470
05:06:20,080 --> 05:06:23,895
model that you considered or 
were there maybe a couple other 

3471
05:06:24,037 --> 05:06:27,200
candidates?
>> We are mostly just using the 

3472
05:06:27,400 --> 05:06:29,400
natural language kit in the tool
Python,

3473
05:06:33,893 --> 05:06:35,929
both of us have a small 
background, I have a computer 

3474
05:06:36,130 --> 05:06:38,564
science major but I don't have a
PhD in AI or machine learning, 

3475
05:06:38,779 --> 05:06:41,612
so I just went with what I am 
familiar with using our 

3476
05:06:41,826 --> 05:06:45,680
background and that is where we 
went from there. In the limited 

3477
05:06:46,080 --> 05:06:50,085
amount of time we had. Any other
questions?

3478
05:06:50,228 --> 05:06:58,683
>> I got my PhD from YouTube on 
machine learning [Laughter] so 

3479
05:06:58,884 --> 05:07:05,209
we are in good company. When you
do the release in open source, 

3480
05:07:05,789 --> 05:07:11,277
Jupiter notebook perhaps? 
>> The old code used to be on 

3481
05:07:11,678 --> 05:07:14,930
Jupiter notebook but we have it 
in a web app now, unless people 

3482
05:07:15,692 --> 05:07:18,471
want them, that is my old code. 
[Laughter]

3483
05:07:24,067 --> 05:07:26,716
>> Thank you, that was a great 
effort, you did a great job on 

3484
05:07:26,916 --> 05:07:29,150
this, I think the community can 
really run with this, so I 

3485
05:07:29,912 --> 05:07:31,912
appreciate it. 
>> Awesome, thank you.

3486
05:07:34,834 --> 05:07:38,798
>> Any other questions? We have 
one in the front here.

3487
05:07:52,106 --> 05:07:54,540
>> If I'm understanding it 
right, it is going to be a web 

3488
05:07:54,742 --> 05:07:57,126
app that is going to be hosted 
by you guys, correct? 

3489
05:07:57,128 --> 05:07:59,128
>> It is all run locally.

3490
05:08:02,049 --> 05:08:04,899
>> Okay, the next place I was 
going is how you are going to D 

3491
05:08:05,101 --> 05:08:07,536
conflict potentially if two 
people submit the same report 

3492
05:08:07,737 --> 05:08:12,420
and train it.
>> Right now it is run locally 

3493
05:08:12,620 --> 05:08:16,889
on the user system, we have 
looked into having it at a more 

3494
05:08:17,089 --> 05:08:19,325
centralized location so analysts
would be able to use it at the 

3495
05:08:19,527 --> 05:08:23,378
same time to kind of curb your 
thought of conflicting, we have 

3496
05:08:23,593 --> 05:08:26,588
some features that are in the 
works to tag reports that would 

3497
05:08:26,752 --> 05:08:28,752
say

3498
05:08:31,917 --> 05:08:34,151
Sarah is working on this one, 
Jackie is working on this other 

3499
05:08:34,351 --> 05:08:36,585
so hopefully the same analyst 
isn't working on the same 

3500
05:08:36,786 --> 05:08:38,216
report. 
>> Would you have the option to 

3501
05:08:38,217 --> 05:08:40,933
send the reports back to you 
guys to then update the matrix? 

3502
05:08:40,934 --> 05:08:45,120
>> Yes, through the normal 
contribution methods, yes, we 

3503
05:08:45,320 --> 05:08:48,924
would love to get more reports 
in that we didn't have to do 

3504
05:08:49,069 --> 05:08:53,390
ourselves. So we are definitely 
interested there. 

3505
05:08:53,391 --> 05:08:59,341
>> We hope it'll increase 
contributions as well. Great, 

3506
05:09:00,104 --> 05:09:02,104
thank you.

3507
05:09:07,861 --> 05:09:12,743
>> I think Sarah and Jackie have
generously offered to do live 

3508
05:09:12,944 --> 05:09:17,816
demos for folks, not on stage, 
but the folks have pulled them 

3509
05:09:18,031 --> 05:09:20,253
aside, it is a pretty exciting 
tool, we are excited to open 

3510
05:09:20,467 --> 05:09:25,338
that in the near future. If you 
have some questions, capture 

3511
05:09:25,539 --> 05:09:30,006
them during your break tonight, 
please join me in thanking Sarah

3512
05:09:30,767 --> 05:09:32,767
and Jackie.

3513
05:09:41,380 --> 05:09:43,380
A quick logistical note, for 
folks standing, you are welcome 

3514
05:09:43,414 --> 05:09:46,252
to come and fill in the seats, 
we don't bite on the side of the

3515
05:09:46,466 --> 05:09:48,901
room, I promise, it is going to 
be all right. Folks online also 

3516
05:09:49,102 --> 05:09:50,934
really appreciated Sarah and 
Jackie's talk, John said very 

3517
05:09:50,936 --> 05:09:54,122
cool overview of TRAM from Sarah
and Jackie , to map out reports 

3518
05:09:54,274 --> 05:09:56,274
of techniques,.

3519
05:10:00,475 --> 05:10:04,220
Data normalization is really 
hard work, impressive. So, kudos

3520
05:10:06,575 --> 05:10:09,208
from Twitter, those of you 
watching online as well. Thank 

3521
05:10:09,409 --> 05:10:11,957
you for your appreciation for 
Sarah and Jackie there. Now,

3522
05:10:16,534 --> 05:10:18,550
I'm really excited to introduce 
our next speakers who flew the 

3523
05:10:18,752 --> 05:10:21,680
farthest of anyone, all the way 
from Argentina, I still remember

3524
05:10:22,818 --> 05:10:28,921
when we were first on the call 
with them, we are really lucky 

3525
05:10:29,119 --> 05:10:31,756
as the ATT&CK team, we get to 
talk to you about how you are 

3526
05:10:31,957 --> 05:10:34,394
using  ATT&CK and we were 
chatting  and like many of you, 

3527
05:10:34,607 --> 05:10:39,678
of course I'm on slack, typing 
to admin like, this is so 

3528
05:10:39,879 --> 05:10:44,561
awesome, can you believe this? 
What are they doing? They 

3529
05:10:44,762 --> 05:10:48,214
created this whole library, way 
more than what we have on the 

3530
05:10:48,414 --> 05:10:50,414
public site, they customized it,
they added techniques, our minds

3531
05:10:51,007 --> 05:10:53,007
were blown.

3532
05:10:54,918 --> 05:10:57,353
Since then, it has been such a 
pleasure, we got to meet the 

3533
05:10:57,554 --> 05:10:59,790
team for the first time in Las 
Vegas. And they were generous 

3534
05:10:59,989 --> 05:11:02,104
enough to let me use some of 
their content

3535
05:11:06,898 --> 05:11:09,331
in my own presentation, so you 
are in for quite a treat, they 

3536
05:11:09,545 --> 05:11:11,981
are going to talk to you about 
how they did all their awesome 

3537
05:11:12,182 --> 05:11:14,617
work to create this library and 
give you some tips on how you 

3538
05:11:14,818 --> 05:11:17,052
can maybe create your own. 
Please welcome our two Argentina

3539
05:11:17,253 --> 05:11:21,834
speakers,  Valentina Palacin  
and Ruth Esmeralda Barbacil .

3540
05:11:25,738 --> 05:11:27,738
>>

3541
05:11:33,713 --> 05:11:36,083
Thank you everyone, thank you, 
Katie for the introduction, we 

3542
05:11:36,240 --> 05:11:41,433
are the writers of the MITRE 
framework and we are going to 

3543
05:11:41,634 --> 05:11:45,142
show you how to build  your own 
library. First, we are going to 

3544
05:11:45,298 --> 05:11:47,298
go into what is exactly

3545
05:11:52,604 --> 05:11:55,039
needed for the library and then 
we are going to cover how to 

3546
05:11:55,239 --> 05:11:57,474
build one, to speak a little bit
about the problems that we 

3547
05:11:57,674 --> 05:11:59,708
encounter, and to finally end 
with some lessons we learned so 

3548
05:11:59,908 --> 05:12:03,575
you can take it with you. First,
I'm going to talk a little bit 

3549
05:12:03,777 --> 05:12:10,225
about our background, Ruth is 
the library team

3550
05:12:16,163 --> 05:12:18,197
leader, she started almost 
around 4 years ago, she is the 

3551
05:12:18,399 --> 05:12:21,394
information security specialist,
information system engineer, and

3552
05:12:21,539 --> 05:12:23,566
myself, I have a background in 
translation

3553
05:12:27,136 --> 05:12:29,771
. So I contributed to the 
project for almost 2 years now. 

3554
05:12:29,974 --> 05:12:35,660
We have been helping with the 
process and I'm also using my 

3555
05:12:35,874 --> 05:12:38,195
program and skills to help the 
automation and data analysis. 

3556
05:12:38,196 --> 05:12:43,795
>> First, let me introduce to 
you a little bit about why we 

3557
05:12:43,996 --> 05:12:49,278
came out with this project. When
I first started, one of my first

3558
05:12:49,479 --> 05:12:51,479
tasks was collecting

3559
05:12:54,551 --> 05:12:57,198
from public sources, this was a 
really exhausting job, it was 

3560
05:12:57,398 --> 05:13:00,854
really messy, but we learned a 
lot about it and luckily 

3561
05:13:01,612 --> 05:13:03,612
everything is

3562
05:13:08,161 --> 05:13:13,849
gone through, so we don't have 
to do that anymore. One of the 

3563
05:13:14,050 --> 05:13:16,284
things we do with the 
spreadsheets that we use, we 

3564
05:13:16,499 --> 05:13:21,406
also describe the malware that 
was collected, so what is 

3565
05:13:21,727 --> 05:13:27,416
interesting about this, the 
description mixes with the 

3566
05:13:27,568 --> 05:13:29,568
malware,

3567
05:13:33,556 --> 05:13:35,590
computing through this data was 
very difficult. If I wanted to 

3568
05:13:35,790 --> 05:13:37,824
know what other pieces were 
used, it was very difficult for 

3569
05:13:38,025 --> 05:13:43,708
me. So one day, we were talking 
with the director of the team 

3570
05:13:44,660 --> 05:13:46,660
and

3571
05:13:49,397 --> 05:13:51,431
we were thinking about how we 
were going to improve the 

3572
05:13:51,632 --> 05:13:53,632
information that we were 
collecting but showing an 

3573
05:13:53,816 --> 05:14:00,165
interesting way and an easy way.
So this is how the library 

3574
05:14:00,929 --> 05:14:05,656
started. But, it seems to be the
solution to all of our desires 

3575
05:14:05,856 --> 05:14:14,941
and needs, made up enough, if we
do it well.

3576
05:14:16,827 --> 05:14:20,020
It is not a solution by itself, 
the project is meant to be for 

3577
05:14:20,180 --> 05:14:25,353
analysts, so they can dig into 
the data regarding it in an easy

3578
05:14:26,111 --> 05:14:28,940
way but they are the main 
thinkers about what the out 

3579
05:14:29,117 --> 05:14:33,773
point is going to be. This is 
not a collection of all

3580
05:14:39,575 --> 05:14:41,392
existing attacks, there's too 
many information, there are too 

3581
05:14:41,393 --> 05:14:43,426
many things happening out there 
so we focus only on highly 

3582
05:14:43,627 --> 05:14:48,709
targeted attacks, focusing on 
industries. This is also not an 

3583
05:14:48,909 --> 05:14:50,943
indicator feed, you may find 
some indicators but it is not 

3584
05:14:51,144 --> 05:14:53,144
meant to be

3585
05:14:56,029 --> 05:14:58,051
for something like that, it is 
only to check the information 

3586
05:14:58,252 --> 05:15:00,252
and validate the information 
that we are already putting on 

3587
05:15:00,285 --> 05:15:04,353
the page, also instructing 
through some things. It is also 

3588
05:15:05,112 --> 05:15:07,112
not perfect,

3589
05:15:09,838 --> 05:15:12,273
we are people, so we are prone 
to errors and we are not 

3590
05:15:12,474 --> 05:15:15,128
perfect. So we have to put our 
workflow which includes the 

3591
05:15:15,889 --> 05:15:20,755
quality assurance to be able to 
put the most information that we

3592
05:15:20,909 --> 05:15:26,227
can in the most meaningful way. 
And it is also not fixed in 

3593
05:15:26,378 --> 05:15:28,378
time,

3594
05:15:32,127 --> 05:15:40,301
with most information, it is 
alive. We need to have a 

3595
05:15:40,502 --> 05:15:42,949
normalized catalog of 
information so you can find 

3596
05:15:43,150 --> 05:15:47,618
information that you are trying 
to spot any particular or 

3597
05:15:47,819 --> 05:15:51,684
specific place of the report. 
Also, you can see this in the 

3598
05:15:52,444 --> 05:15:56,554
activity Journal, we have a 
server for each one of these 

3599
05:15:56,755 --> 05:15:59,191
threats, we've got a lot of 
operations so this is a way that

3600
05:15:59,405 --> 05:16:05,181
we can use them. Also, we need 
to have an all in one place

3601
05:16:09,558 --> 05:16:11,792
so you don't have to go through 
multiple sources and dig through

3602
05:16:11,993 --> 05:16:14,229
a lot of information because we 
have already done that for you. 

3603
05:16:14,429 --> 05:16:17,116
When we started with this, we 
are seeing this huge monster 

3604
05:16:17,278 --> 05:16:23,983
which is composed of sources and
a lot of things that overwhelm 

3605
05:16:24,184 --> 05:16:29,672
us and we feel very tiny against
this huge monster. Some of the 

3606
05:16:29,872 --> 05:16:33,525
issues that we came across that 
we are still struggling with, we

3607
05:16:33,726 --> 05:16:40,841
are not going to get rid of them
sooner, but we have a lot of 

3608
05:16:41,042 --> 05:16:42,459
diverse formatting and 
estimation of information, even 

3609
05:16:42,460 --> 05:16:46,071
for one organization, we may 
have different formatting 

3610
05:16:46,216 --> 05:16:50,997
between one report and another, 
so you won't find information 

3611
05:16:51,198 --> 05:16:55,054
always in the same place. We 
have a lot of overlapping 

3612
05:16:55,455 --> 05:16:59,257
contributions because we have a 
lock lack of

3613
05:17:04,607 --> 05:17:08,460
contributors that they are 
reporting on. So it is not easy 

3614
05:17:08,862 --> 05:17:14,756
for us. This feels like we are 
going to be crushed by fatigue 

3615
05:17:15,454 --> 05:17:18,620
but don't worry, we are not 
going to die. So, moving 

3616
05:17:18,821 --> 05:17:24,506
forward, we have this as an 
analogy, we sometimes feel like 

3617
05:17:24,921 --> 05:17:29,590
being a threat analyst is a 
little bit like going through a 

3618
05:17:29,792 --> 05:17:36,092
jungle of information and 
finding ancient data, trying to 

3619
05:17:36,293 --> 05:17:41,361
dig and find the treasure. So, 
what to do to not get buried by 

3620
05:17:41,575 --> 05:17:49,834
all of that, what we do is to 
follow the structure that is 

3621
05:17:49,982 --> 05:17:51,982
similar

3622
05:17:55,785 --> 05:17:57,822
to the one with MITRE. We 
distinguish the events and we 

3623
05:17:58,022 --> 05:18:06,490
organize them  against what 
industry they hit. We also read 

3624
05:18:06,640 --> 05:18:08,640
them

3625
05:18:11,842 --> 05:18:14,410
with the tools and we identify 
the tools, tactics and technical

3626
05:18:14,574 --> 05:18:17,727
procedures.
>> Let's talk a little bit what 

3627
05:18:17,928 --> 05:18:20,365
you will find when you get into 
the library, the first thing we 

3628
05:18:20,566 --> 05:18:27,373
do is to offer all the campaigns
around the day they happen.

3629
05:18:30,931 --> 05:18:32,964
Or if we don't have that 
information around the day they 

3630
05:18:33,724 --> 05:18:36,616
were released. We also try to 
follow the same structure for 

3631
05:18:36,817 --> 05:18:42,909
all the titles. We would like to
be able to see at a glance, what

3632
05:18:43,124 --> 05:18:45,124
was the target,

3633
05:18:49,815 --> 05:18:52,413
the country, the entity, and 
with what. We find that these 

3634
05:18:52,565 --> 05:18:57,132
structures, when you are doing 
analysis and when you are trying

3635
05:18:57,895 --> 05:19:02,619
to prioritize, then when you get
into one incident, this is like 

3636
05:19:03,222 --> 05:19:08,239
the scorecard, so you can see 
the release date, the competent 

3637
05:19:08,388 --> 05:19:10,388
level,

3638
05:19:12,775 --> 05:19:14,808
also the regions and countries 
it was affected and a little 

3639
05:19:15,008 --> 05:19:20,292
summary about the incident. 
Then, there is some information 

3640
05:19:20,494 --> 05:19:24,504
about the victims like in this 
other case, you will see that, 

3641
05:19:24,670 --> 05:19:32,674
too. And we follow terminology 
to classify the campaign 

3642
05:19:33,088 --> 05:19:35,272
according to the intended 
effects behind them. Finally, we

3643
05:19:35,425 --> 05:19:42,734
provide a link to the threat 
actor page. Then, all of

3644
05:19:46,292 --> 05:19:48,292
the scorecards follow domain 
information. And

3645
05:19:52,180 --> 05:19:54,180
that is structured in three 
sections, the first one is 

3646
05:19:54,214 --> 05:20:01,675
initial access section in which 
we try to figure out how it 

3647
05:20:01,857 --> 05:20:07,418
gained access to the system, we 
also contain the files that were

3648
05:20:08,174 --> 05:20:14,724
used and a list of all the tools
involved with a description and 

3649
05:20:14,925 --> 05:20:18,378
a link to the tool page. Also 
after that, we provide a 

3650
05:20:18,591 --> 05:20:21,831
description about the campaign. 
Finally, the page closes with 

3651
05:20:22,045 --> 05:20:27,269
what we call the analysis 
attribution and geolocation 

3652
05:20:27,412 --> 05:20:32,804
information. For example, if we 
have something that could be 

3653
05:20:33,005 --> 05:20:39,909
meaningful to know where the 
threat actor is located, or if 

3654
05:20:40,124 --> 05:20:44,790
there are similar things to 
other campaigns or groups, and 

3655
05:20:44,991 --> 05:20:48,644
in the last section which is the
analysis, we gather all the 

3656
05:20:48,857 --> 05:20:50,857
information related to why the

3657
05:20:56,363 --> 05:20:58,398
contribution was made or wasn't 
made, and when we can, we 

3658
05:20:58,598 --> 05:21:00,323
provide our own assessments 
about the incident. 

3659
05:21:00,324 --> 05:21:06,316
>> We call it tools because it 
is not only malware, it is tools

3660
05:21:06,531 --> 05:21:09,767
for this kind of stuff, but 
following some pattern similar 

3661
05:21:10,518 --> 05:21:16,428
to the text of our pages, we 
added a couple of additional 

3662
05:21:16,615 --> 05:21:18,615
things,

3663
05:21:22,158 --> 05:21:24,191
we put specific technical stuff 
that they are using in that 

3664
05:21:24,406 --> 05:21:32,470
specific campaign and we put 
where the malware was seen or 

3665
05:21:32,634 --> 05:21:34,634
reported.

3666
05:21:36,385 --> 05:21:40,235
One procedure is if we are 
changing the way the technique 

3667
05:21:40,451 --> 05:21:45,518
is applied so you can further 
decide how it is evolving. We 

3668
05:21:45,732 --> 05:21:48,983
also have information regarding 
the new gators that we see in 

3669
05:21:49,744 --> 05:21:51,744
those companies,

3670
05:21:55,674 --> 05:21:57,709
but this again is not an 
indicator, this is only to 

3671
05:21:57,910 --> 05:21:59,910
validate information that we are
already putting their, to also 

3672
05:22:00,504 --> 05:22:07,052
further instruct what might be 
helpful in hunting reports. For 

3673
05:22:07,253 --> 05:22:16,406
threat actors, talking about one
way to see it, I think this is 

3674
05:22:16,607 --> 05:22:21,077
the most clear way to see it, 
and the scorecard, things that 

3675
05:22:21,274 --> 05:22:25,541
we really think are important to
spot first, which are the 

3676
05:22:25,741 --> 05:22:27,574
affected countries and 
industries, we also try to 

3677
05:22:27,575 --> 05:22:31,430
understand what are the threat 
actor types if they are 

3678
05:22:32,189 --> 05:22:35,697
cybercrime, or also the 
sophistication level of these 

3679
05:22:35,897 --> 05:22:38,221
actors, and the motivations 
behind it. To do this,

3680
05:22:41,789 --> 05:22:43,821
this takes some vocabulary 
because we want to use the same 

3681
05:22:44,021 --> 05:22:46,021
language across all of the 
industry.

3682
05:22:50,325 --> 05:22:52,959
If you look on the right part of
the screen, you're going to see 

3683
05:22:53,160 --> 05:22:55,809
the content table, one of the 
things at the bottom is the 

3684
05:22:56,010 --> 05:22:58,245
toolset, which is just a summary
of the tools and companies that 

3685
05:22:58,446 --> 05:23:00,446
we already mentioned. But, you 
can see everything that is 

3686
05:23:00,479 --> 05:23:04,012
related to this actor and to the
data. We also have

3687
05:23:09,777 --> 05:23:14,442
other information, sometimes we 
can link them with a specific 

3688
05:23:14,589 --> 05:23:20,689
campaign. For example, you can 
see we have the abilities

3689
05:23:25,058 --> 05:23:29,525
used by this industry, when we 
started this project, we thought

3690
05:23:30,286 --> 05:23:32,286
understanding the initial

3691
05:23:35,828 --> 05:23:37,828
actors, the organization was 
really important for clients but

3692
05:23:38,210 --> 05:23:40,210
the tactic

3693
05:23:42,731 --> 05:23:45,165
didn't assist at other times so 
we came up with this entry point

3694
05:23:45,927 --> 05:23:50,382
of tactic, and we could stick 
with the framework.

3695
05:23:50,543 --> 05:23:52,543
>>

3696
05:23:54,101 --> 05:23:56,101
Now let's talk about the 
problems we have encountered. 

3697
05:23:56,134 --> 05:24:00,404
For sure, the most difficult to 
identify are the false flag 

3698
05:24:00,805 --> 05:24:05,479
campaigns, the analysis bias, we
have to remember that we work 

3699
05:24:06,241 --> 05:24:11,576
closely with social services, we
try to do otherwise sometimes 

3700
05:24:11,777 --> 05:24:15,228
but it is difficult and 
time-consuming. We also have to 

3701
05:24:15,429 --> 05:24:17,863
carry with our own bias, too. 
And also the misattribution 

3702
05:24:18,479 --> 05:24:21,113
because sometimes a report 
doesn't have information about 

3703
05:24:21,865 --> 05:24:27,417
what, why attribution was made 
or they don't have indicated 

3704
05:24:27,618 --> 05:24:30,144
compromise that we can download 
to carry out our own analysis.

3705
05:24:35,139 --> 05:24:38,831
But remembering that we are all 
humans, there are some things to

3706
05:24:39,352 --> 05:24:44,676
show you, these are examples 
that we identified and we are 

3707
05:24:44,877 --> 05:24:51,179
going to share with you. For 
example, in this case, we find 

3708
05:24:51,379 --> 05:24:53,211
that allegedly, there was a 
threat actor targeting Argentina

3709
05:24:53,212 --> 05:24:58,285
so we were curious because it is
our area of work. We went there 

3710
05:24:58,499 --> 05:25:04,736
and it turns out, the indicators
were uploaded by our research 

3711
05:25:04,883 --> 05:25:08,587
team. So, it is important to 
remember that not all the time

3712
05:25:13,527 --> 05:25:15,962
where a file is loaded it means 
the attack is happening there. 

3713
05:25:16,163 --> 05:25:18,163
But I'm sure

3714
05:25:22,816 --> 05:25:27,737
, another thing we find 
problematic, this is a tricky 

3715
05:25:28,489 --> 05:25:31,742
one because we cannot know all,

3716
05:25:35,259 --> 05:25:37,585
or the people publishing the 
report, neither us, we sometimes

3717
05:25:41,349 --> 05:25:45,014
find things like this in this 
case, which is referring to a 

3718
05:25:45,215 --> 05:25:51,104
campaign that happened a long 
time ago. We found a Spanish 

3719
05:25:51,302 --> 05:25:53,302
expression, which is

3720
05:26:00,596 --> 05:26:02,596
is pronounced

3721
05:26:05,958 --> 05:26:07,958
"LA CONCHA DE TU MADRE"

3722
05:26:10,129 --> 05:26:16,693
, and it is translated as the 
shell of your mother, which is 

3723
05:26:16,893 --> 05:26:22,180
not exactly that, the meaning is
something like your mother's 

3724
05:26:22,942 --> 05:26:27,667
private parts. And why? While we
are talking about this? Why we 

3725
05:26:27,866 --> 05:26:35,587
are showing you this? If we go 
to this map, in countries where 

3726
05:26:35,788 --> 05:26:38,986
Spanish is spoken officially, 
and I'm stressing officially 

3727
05:26:39,128 --> 05:26:42,693
because there are more countries
in which Spanish is spoken but 

3728
05:26:43,443 --> 05:26:47,301
from those, that expression is 
used only in seven countries. We

3729
05:26:47,453 --> 05:26:54,071
note this is not enough in 
itself to assure that the threat

3730
05:26:54,271 --> 05:26:56,271
actor comes from these places 
but, maybe we have another 

3731
05:26:56,304 --> 05:27:02,549
indicator that we can add to 
say, well, it is from here, and 

3732
05:27:02,788 --> 05:27:06,658
especially seeing that we have a
fairly active threat actor on 

3733
05:27:07,408 --> 05:27:09,810
the region. And finally,

3734
05:27:15,608 --> 05:27:17,630
we left the biggest headache for
last which is the overlapping 

3735
05:27:17,831 --> 05:27:20,679
attributions, that is what we 
call multiple names for the same

3736
05:27:21,440 --> 05:27:25,348
threat actor, the way we dealt 
with this is to create something

3737
05:27:25,549 --> 05:27:28,083
similar to the attack matrix for
tactics and techniques, but with

3738
05:27:29,617 --> 05:27:34,018
vendors and aliases. I assure 
you,

3739
05:27:39,774 --> 05:27:42,408
you probably all want to see it 
but I'm not going to show you 

3740
05:27:42,623 --> 05:27:45,458
that, it takes a lot of work. It
takes a lot of research and very

3741
05:27:45,658 --> 05:27:47,658
complex and refined work. We 
have to especially mention one 

3742
05:27:47,691 --> 05:27:50,486
of our team members that 
couldn't be with us, he is 

3743
05:27:50,645 --> 05:27:54,273
helping with it.

3744
05:28:01,509 --> 05:28:05,704
Would we also do is rate the 
sources, we find a way to rate 

3745
05:28:05,861 --> 05:28:10,245
the sources, considering its 
type. Also, using the matrix, we

3746
05:28:10,446 --> 05:28:12,446
rate them according to the

3747
05:28:18,367 --> 05:28:20,367
visibility by region, based on 
public reports, remember we are 

3748
05:28:20,402 --> 05:28:23,236
always talking about public 
reports. Also, we rate 

3749
05:28:23,652 --> 05:28:27,715
independent researchers by their
reputation and also, we judge if

3750
05:28:27,917 --> 05:28:35,914
the source has IOC is available.
But, even though having

3751
05:28:39,901 --> 05:28:41,933
a formula is awesome and we 
encourage everyone to come up 

3752
05:28:42,133 --> 05:28:44,724
with your own formula to do 
this, it is important to 

3753
05:28:44,871 --> 05:28:51,003
remember that you need to be 
able to overrule it as you see 

3754
05:28:51,661 --> 05:28:53,661
fit when necessary.

3755
05:28:57,567 --> 05:29:00,886
Let's keep moving on, I want to 
teach you how to read the book 

3756
05:29:01,031 --> 05:29:03,351
of secrets, let's keep in mind 
when you are reading

3757
05:29:07,318 --> 05:29:09,752
a source, you have to identify 
whether it is a campaign or a 

3758
05:29:09,965 --> 05:29:12,347
malware piece or maybe a 
combination, we are going to 

3759
05:29:12,509 --> 05:29:15,786
focus on the malware reports 
because we are going to start 

3760
05:29:15,929 --> 05:29:17,929
the

3761
05:29:20,319 --> 05:29:22,555
TTP's from those. First, I want 
you to read a source and 

3762
05:29:22,755 --> 05:29:26,008
identify the paragraph 
describing the behavior, 

3763
05:29:26,409 --> 05:29:33,471
yesterday somebody did a CTI 
training here, but it is 

3764
05:29:33,664 --> 05:29:38,596
basically the same process, you 
have to read the source, 

3765
05:29:38,810 --> 05:29:42,662
identify a paragraph describing 
the behaviors, then you can move

3766
05:29:42,863 --> 05:29:47,091
on and identify the tactic. 
Think for just one second, we 

3767
05:29:47,260 --> 05:29:49,260
have 266

3768
05:29:55,051 --> 05:29:56,882
enterprise only techniques, and 
only 12 tactics, so clearly 

3769
05:29:56,884 --> 05:29:58,884
identifying the tactic is going 
to be much easier than 

3770
05:29:58,917 --> 05:30:00,950
identifying the technique. Once 
we have the tactic it belongs 

3771
05:30:01,150 --> 05:30:04,000
to, we are going to go through 
and look for all the techniques 

3772
05:30:04,760 --> 05:30:09,675
under that specific tactic on 
being able to spot, what are the

3773
05:30:09,889 --> 05:30:12,660
descriptions in the techniques 
that belong to that description.

3774
05:30:12,820 --> 05:30:14,820
But,

3775
05:30:17,598 --> 05:30:19,832
maybe you don't find what you 
are searching for, in that case,

3776
05:30:20,046 --> 05:30:22,627
you should create your own, 
let's move to a couple of 

3777
05:30:22,771 --> 05:30:28,973
examples of this. This is a 
piece of malware that the threat

3778
05:30:29,174 --> 05:30:36,895
actor is not really using a lot 
of validation but they are using

3779
05:30:37,510 --> 05:30:41,161
a certificate, this is clearly a
defense technique. We can find a

3780
05:30:41,363 --> 05:30:46,247
lot of techniques very specific 
techniques to the specific 

3781
05:30:46,448 --> 05:30:53,551
description of this, which is 
the code signing technique. We 

3782
05:30:54,301 --> 05:30:56,301
can see

3783
05:30:58,232 --> 05:31:00,469
it is clearly this technique 
that we are trying to spot. We 

3784
05:31:00,669 --> 05:31:05,941
have another example with a 
little bit more of a trigger, in

3785
05:31:06,155 --> 05:31:12,858
this case, this is a logoff 
instruction of the report, in 

3786
05:31:13,059 --> 05:31:17,113
this case, they are changing the
default credentials of the 

3787
05:31:17,328 --> 05:31:19,764
administrator account so the 
user can't access the system, 

3788
05:31:19,965 --> 05:31:22,334
they can of course even read

3789
05:31:26,054 --> 05:31:28,054
the notes which we don't 
recommend at all.

3790
05:31:33,160 --> 05:31:35,160
We couldn't find any technique

3791
05:31:38,042 --> 05:31:40,277
under this specific description,
so we came out with our own in 

3792
05:31:40,478 --> 05:31:48,965
this case, we are going to use 
the convention of ATT&CKcon  001

3793
05:31:51,241 --> 05:31:56,928
, and you should do the same, 
you should stick with one 

3794
05:31:57,129 --> 05:31:59,375
specific formula so you don't 
get lost. We also put a clear 

3795
05:31:59,575 --> 05:32:01,609
description of the name so you 
can understand where we are 

3796
05:32:02,369 --> 05:32:08,308
trying to say with the 
technique. A week ago, we used 

3797
05:32:09,066 --> 05:32:12,980
another technique so now we can 
stick with this one and we can 

3798
05:32:13,180 --> 05:32:14,904
stick with the framework and 
move on. 

3799
05:32:14,905 --> 05:32:16,905
>> So,

3800
05:32:22,317 --> 05:32:24,149
now let's summarize everything 
with some lessons we learned 

3801
05:32:24,151 --> 05:32:27,403
that you can benefit from. 
First, choose a good technology 

3802
05:32:27,604 --> 05:32:34,506
to build on, again, information 
is alive, and the framework is 

3803
05:32:35,458 --> 05:32:37,458
constantly evolving

3804
05:32:43,045 --> 05:32:45,280
and the platform you're going to
use must support this kind of 

3805
05:32:45,481 --> 05:32:47,313
evolution and these kinds of 
changes. Also, do not 

3806
05:32:47,314 --> 05:32:49,343
misunderstand the objectives, 
again, there is a lot of 

3807
05:32:49,545 --> 05:32:51,779
information and a lot of text 
going on so you have to 

3808
05:32:51,980 --> 05:32:54,555
understand that you have limited
resources, you have to focus on 

3809
05:32:54,697 --> 05:32:57,467
something, so it is not about 
collecting everything. Again, in

3810
05:32:57,668 --> 05:33:03,157
our case, we are specifically 
trying to cover what our highly 

3811
05:33:03,358 --> 05:33:07,827
targeted attacks on industries 
in which we rely on.

3812
05:33:07,985 --> 05:33:12,294
>> And really important is to 
define good quality workflows. 

3813
05:33:12,696 --> 05:33:22,453
Think about this, what we do is 
we have 

3814
05:33:22,853 --> 05:33:24,853
a simplified version of the

3815
05:33:35,241 --> 05:33:37,074
editorial process, first one 
goes into production and creates

3816
05:33:37,075 --> 05:33:39,075
the report, for example extracts
the tactics and techniques, and 

3817
05:33:39,107 --> 05:33:41,128
somebody else will review it, 
and maybe he can add something. 

3818
05:33:41,342 --> 05:33:46,413
Maybe the producer forgot a 
technique or missed something. 

3819
05:33:46,828 --> 05:33:49,262
Or, the formatting is not right 
and we will be sent back to 

3820
05:33:49,463 --> 05:33:54,132
production and until it is 
sufficiently good enough to go 

3821
05:33:54,333 --> 05:33:56,782
to the periphery, which would be
the final set of eyes that will 

3822
05:33:56,983 --> 05:34:00,636
review all the content before it
gets approved and it'll be 

3823
05:34:01,036 --> 05:34:03,036
accessible to the client.

3824
05:34:07,743 --> 05:34:09,979
So, sticking with a good percent
of content, it is important that

3825
05:34:10,744 --> 05:34:12,744
you should

3826
05:34:16,481 --> 05:34:21,099
choosing what we call threat 
actors, but my director is that 

3827
05:34:21,255 --> 05:34:23,255
adversaries

3828
05:34:28,263 --> 05:34:30,698
, or cyber enemies, it is your 
choice, but the important thing 

3829
05:34:30,898 --> 05:34:36,548
is that you are not changing 
between terms on a whim, so we 

3830
05:34:36,707 --> 05:34:46,339
chose STIX.
>> It is also important to think

3831
05:34:46,540 --> 05:34:48,574
about how the information is 
going to be consumed, when we 

3832
05:34:48,789 --> 05:34:52,960
started, at first it was really 
messy and competent to go 

3833
05:34:53,381 --> 05:34:56,602
through, but we put a template 
on the structure

3834
05:35:01,372 --> 05:35:03,372
for the information so other 
reports are really easy to 

3835
05:35:03,405 --> 05:35:05,223
understand and really easy to 
spot the important information 

3836
05:35:05,224 --> 05:35:07,460
you are after. Also, think about
how all the information and the 

3837
05:35:07,662 --> 05:35:10,310
intelligence you are collecting 
can be transformed into more 

3838
05:35:10,511 --> 05:35:15,796
information, so you probably may
want to know which are the most 

3839
05:35:15,997 --> 05:35:20,668
targeted industries or maybe, 
what are the most used 

3840
05:35:20,871 --> 05:35:22,871
techniques for a specific 
country, or maybe you want to 

3841
05:35:23,463 --> 05:35:29,605
only know what are the most used
in a certain time. So having 

3842
05:35:29,806 --> 05:35:31,806
that, it'll allow you

3843
05:35:34,680 --> 05:35:38,748
to understand how to better 
structure the data. Also, for a 

3844
05:35:38,948 --> 05:35:42,000
summary of everything, you have 
to think what is really, really 

3845
05:35:42,200 --> 05:35:48,704
important to be consistent.
>> Before finishing, we want to 

3846
05:35:48,905 --> 05:35:52,557
say thank you to all of the 
members that could be here with 

3847
05:35:52,759 --> 05:35:57,429
us, but the project wouldn't be 
possible without their help. We 

3848
05:35:57,631 --> 05:35:59,631
also want to

3849
05:36:02,713 --> 05:36:04,713
say thank you to the ATT&CK 
team, Katie, Adam, Blake, 

3850
05:36:04,748 --> 05:36:06,782
Debbie, all the people behind  
ATT&CK for their support and 

3851
05:36:07,546 --> 05:36:12,265
collaboration  and thank you all
for listening to our 

3852
05:36:12,466 --> 05:36:14,702
presentation and if you have any
questions, you can ask or you 

3853
05:36:14,903 --> 05:36:16,903
can go to our social media.

3854
05:36:20,740 --> 05:36:23,522
>> We have time for questions

3855
05:36:27,094 --> 05:36:29,114
, who wants to ask some 
questions? You might not have 

3856
05:36:29,328 --> 05:36:33,798
the chance to see them very 
often to pick their brains. 

3857
05:36:34,200 --> 05:36:37,147
We've got a hand in the front.

3858
05:36:43,338 --> 05:36:47,808
It is your moment to shine, no 
pressure.

3859
05:36:47,962 --> 05:36:51,260
>> Thank you, we have something 
similar that we track our threat

3860
05:36:51,461 --> 05:36:53,832
actors with and I'm curious to 
know, after you document

3861
05:37:00,000 --> 05:37:02,434
a campaign or TTP, how often or 
how frequent are you going back 

3862
05:37:02,635 --> 05:37:04,635
to update that content within 
the repository because say you 

3863
05:37:04,669 --> 05:37:11,169
have a campaign from 2019 and 
2020, all those indicators might

3864
05:37:11,369 --> 05:37:12,900
be irrelevant for the new 
campaign. 

3865
05:37:12,902 --> 05:37:22,547
>> In fact, we are not all the 
time trying to 

3866
05:37:22,948 --> 05:37:24,982
read again all the sources 
because we have a lot of 

3867
05:37:25,182 --> 05:37:28,636
information but, we are tracking
every update that people are 

3868
05:37:28,837 --> 05:37:33,921
doing, also we are using our own
internal information, so once we

3869
05:37:34,123 --> 05:37:39,407
spot something new, we go back 
and we have a workflow, so we 

3870
05:37:39,607 --> 05:37:41,641
require updates and someone is 
going to be assigned to a 

3871
05:37:42,401 --> 05:37:46,312
specific item, they are going to
update everything and all again,

3872
05:37:46,513 --> 05:37:48,860
it is going to go through the 
workflow and everything. 

3873
05:37:48,861 --> 05:37:54,033
>> We go back to production and 
back to review basically, also 

3874
05:37:54,234 --> 05:37:56,615
keep in mind that TRAM 

3875
05:38:00,522 --> 05:38:03,573
library is a part of a big area,
it is not all that we do, we 

3876
05:38:03,774 --> 05:38:05,774
have another project where we 
update information and you can 

3877
05:38:05,808 --> 05:38:09,620
find more indicators. 
>> Thank you.

3878
05:38:09,770 --> 05:38:13,422
>> Any more questions from the 
audience? 

3879
05:38:13,423 --> 05:38:18,484
>> One that came into my 
personal slack, Adam Pennington,

3880
05:38:20,635 --> 05:38:25,718
can you talk about, what advice 
would you give to others on 

3881
05:38:25,920 --> 05:38:29,571
creating your own technique? 
>> The most important thing I 

3882
05:38:29,772 --> 05:38:37,093
think is to keep a specific 
format so you don't get lost, 

3883
05:38:37,295 --> 05:38:43,181
and keeping in mind that this 
may be added and also shared 

3884
05:38:43,583 --> 05:38:46,833
with technicals, it is going to 
help everyone, but don't be 

3885
05:38:47,048 --> 05:38:51,516
afraid to create your own 
technique, just be sure that 

3886
05:38:51,917 --> 05:38:53,917
there is no technique that 
already covers that, but don't 

3887
05:38:54,512 --> 05:38:58,208
be afraid. You can do it, we do 
it, we started like this and we 

3888
05:38:58,422 --> 05:39:00,857
found a lot of interesting 
information related to a couple 

3889
05:39:01,059 --> 05:39:05,529
of techniques we integrated for 
our own use, we even created a 

3890
05:39:05,730 --> 05:39:10,200
couple of techniques because we 
think it is important to create 

3891
05:39:10,401 --> 05:39:13,251
a sub technique in which we were
already talking about. But, 

3892
05:39:14,009 --> 05:39:20,966
doing that, we discovered a lot 
of abuse, so we started doing 

3893
05:39:21,168 --> 05:39:24,057
some research on that, there is 
really interesting information 

3894
05:39:24,417 --> 05:39:28,684
by covering only that specific 
part of the technique.

3895
05:39:28,832 --> 05:39:35,387
>> And also, just to add, not 
everything is worth a technique,

3896
05:39:35,587 --> 05:39:38,022
just make sure it is something 
that is unique or you are seeing

3897
05:39:38,772 --> 05:39:42,834
repeatedly. And you really have 
a need to describe that 

3898
05:39:43,000 --> 05:39:45,000
behavior.

3899
05:39:46,554 --> 05:39:52,041
>> I could see Blake and Adam 
adding alone, it is a challenge 

3900
05:39:52,242 --> 05:39:55,092
for you all, but can I get a 
thumbs up that it is okay for 

3901
05:39:55,294 --> 05:39:57,294
people to create their own 
techniques, that is ATT&CK 

3902
05:39:57,663 --> 05:40:01,996
approved ? Because we 
understand, not everything is 

3903
05:40:02,397 --> 05:40:06,467
something people can use. Of 
course let us know, and I think 

3904
05:40:06,664 --> 05:40:08,664
some of the techniques you have 
created

3905
05:40:12,967 --> 05:40:15,203
were then later added, so you 
were just a little quicker than 

3906
05:40:15,403 --> 05:40:18,858
us, so thank you for sharing 
that back. Other questions? 

3907
05:40:19,260 --> 05:40:23,411
Please join me in thanking 
Valentina and Ruth.

3908
05:40:28,601 --> 05:40:30,836
So, getting some love online, I 
wanted to read some of the 

3909
05:40:31,037 --> 05:40:34,905
favorite tweets and my Spanish 
is from college, it has been a 

3910
05:40:35,106 --> 05:40:44,604
little while, Andrew said, I 
think he learned to say bad 

3911
05:40:44,754 --> 05:40:51,967
things, and overlapping can be 
difficult when researching 

3912
05:40:52,718 --> 05:40:54,718
historical data

3913
05:40:57,240 --> 05:40:59,687
, I realize this is a lot of 
work, great job, ladies so 

3914
05:40:59,887 --> 05:41:02,122
getting some credit to the hard 
work of Valentina and Ruth and 

3915
05:41:02,883 --> 05:41:08,624
their team. Also, being a CTI 
analyst feels like being Indiana

3916
05:41:08,824 --> 05:41:10,658
Jones going through the jungle, 
digging through ancient data, 

3917
05:41:10,659 --> 05:41:19,392
having a lot of fun learning and
attack on building your own 

3918
05:41:19,793 --> 05:41:22,384
library. Any future presenters, 
if you are still working on your

3919
05:41:22,543 --> 05:41:27,315
slides, you can go ahead and try
to up your game in terms of 

3920
05:41:27,516 --> 05:41:30,451
slides there. I also wanted to 
take a moment to say thank you

3921
05:41:34,820 --> 05:41:40,462
to Bryce, who is a serial 
tweeter, they loved the 

3922
05:41:40,611 --> 05:41:42,611
graphics.

3923
05:41:45,387 --> 05:41:52,492
We have a special prize, this is
a vintage edition, ATT&CK flag  

3924
05:41:52,907 --> 05:41:56,665
signed by the cocreator. So, 
thank you for tweeting.

3925
05:42:05,287 --> 05:42:07,939
Thank you for your tweets, keep 
it up, if you would like to fly 

3926
05:42:08,136 --> 05:42:10,167
offstage, we are not going to 
stop you. Excellent. Thank you 

3927
05:42:10,369 --> 05:42:13,352
so much for that great 
presentation, this is sort of a 

3928
05:42:13,515 --> 05:42:22,638
threat Intel afternoon. The next
presenter is on that same theme

3929
05:42:26,147 --> 05:42:32,714
, it has been really exciting 
for me to see all the companies,

3930
05:42:33,474 --> 05:42:35,864
we have the top 20 techniques

3931
05:42:39,822 --> 05:42:41,856
, and the overwatch team 
releases their report and we see

3932
05:42:42,056 --> 05:42:44,695
their most frequent techniques, 
so we have all of their 

3933
05:42:44,908 --> 05:42:49,164
different disabilities and 
biases for the day, so I'm 

3934
05:42:49,378 --> 05:42:51,378
really excited to introduce 
these presenters to talk to you 

3935
05:42:51,400 --> 05:42:54,049
about how they found value in 
comparing what adversaries are 

3936
05:42:54,250 --> 05:42:58,102
doing. Please join me in 
welcoming Carl Sherman and Piotr

3937
05:42:58,866 --> 05:43:00,866
Wojtyla 

3938
05:43:02,506 --> 05:43:04,506
.
>>

3939
05:43:10,705 --> 05:43:13,696
Thank you so much, Katie. And,

3940
05:43:24,912 --> 05:43:27,146
is that better? There we go. 
Thank you. Good afternoon, it is

3941
05:43:27,360 --> 05:43:31,214
a privilege to be here and be 
presenting at ATT&CKcon, thank 

3942
05:43:31,415 --> 05:43:35,681
you so much for the introduction
, I am Karl Scheuerman and I'm 

3943
05:43:35,882 --> 05:43:39,537
joined by my friend ,  Piotr 
Wojtyla , we are from 

3944
05:43:39,952 --> 05:43:44,420
CrowdStrike, the overwatch  
threat hunting team, and on the 

3945
05:43:44,621 --> 05:43:47,015
team, we have been using ATT&CK 
for a few years 

3946
05:43:50,307 --> 05:43:53,158
, it has been great for us. What
we would like to talk to you 

3947
05:43:53,359 --> 05:43:55,359
about today is how

3948
05:43:59,047 --> 05:44:00,866
this past year, we have made 
some significant enhancements 

3949
05:44:00,867 --> 05:44:02,867
and improvements on how we are 
implementing ATT&CK into our 

3950
05:44:02,902 --> 05:44:05,136
hunting processes.  First, a 
quick word on our background, I 

3951
05:44:05,336 --> 05:44:08,320
started my career in government,
doing the military and 

3952
05:44:08,472 --> 05:44:12,039
intelligence immunity thing I 
have been at CrowdStrike  for 

3953
05:44:12,253 --> 05:44:15,186
over 4 years and I also still 
serve

3954
05:44:25,247 --> 05:44:27,480
in a part-time capacity in the 
air National Guard, I am the 

3955
05:44:27,681 --> 05:44:29,511
director of operations or cyber 
intelligence squad up in 

3956
05:44:29,512 --> 05:44:31,546
Washington state. I know a few 
speakers have talked about ways 

3957
05:44:31,746 --> 05:44:33,982
to conserve and giving back like
being a teacher, and as a 

3958
05:44:34,183 --> 05:44:37,130
natural national guardsmen, I am
a recruiter

3959
05:44:41,300 --> 05:44:43,735
, so if anybody is interested, 
I'm happy to talk to you about 

3960
05:44:43,936 --> 05:44:51,039
that during one of the breaks.
>> Hey everyone, it is great to 

3961
05:44:51,253 --> 05:44:55,721
be here, my name is Piotr 
Wojtyla  and I have been 

3962
05:44:56,122 --> 05:44:58,155
previously involved with 
incident response, but now I 

3963
05:44:58,355 --> 05:45:01,906
have been on the overwatch team,

3964
05:45:12,167 --> 05:45:14,399
and I have just been doing 
things that they have asked of 

3965
05:45:14,599 --> 05:45:16,031
me. 
>> Our agenda for today, we are 

3966
05:45:16,032 --> 05:45:18,464
going to talk to you about 
ATT&CK  the hard way, that is 

3967
05:45:18,664 --> 05:45:21,462
the way we were doing it earlier
this year, that had some 

3968
05:45:21,609 --> 05:45:25,579
challenges and I will talk about
the way we have made some 

3969
05:45:25,781 --> 05:45:28,828
improvements to that and now we 
are implementing ATT&CK  in a 

3970
05:45:29,029 --> 05:45:31,463
much easier way, you could say, 
and we will wrap up with talking

3971
05:45:31,662 --> 05:45:37,553
about some interesting TTP's we 
have seen in the wild over the 

3972
05:45:37,767 --> 05:45:39,787
first half of this year which 
sharing those examples we think 

3973
05:45:40,001 --> 05:45:42,001
helps validate the successes we 
have had in these improvements 

3974
05:45:42,033 --> 05:45:44,416
and how we have been 
implementing it in ATT&CK  warm 

3975
05:45:44,616 --> 05:45:51,976
recently. When we refer to 
specific adversaries, of course 

3976
05:45:52,190 --> 05:45:54,190
there are different naming 
conventions, we use the 

3977
05:45:54,369 --> 05:45:59,095
CrowdStrike  naming convention, 
which is the animal name, when 

3978
05:45:59,296 --> 05:46:04,578
we see panda cover that is the 
Chinese adversary, bears are 

3979
05:46:04,780 --> 05:46:07,831
Russian and someone, and if we 
say spiders, that is referring 

3980
05:46:08,032 --> 05:46:12,087
to criminal adversaries, so 
sometimes we refer to those. And

3981
05:46:12,288 --> 05:46:17,974
one other note, as we get 
started, the content we are 

3982
05:46:18,188 --> 05:46:20,009
sharing today, these interesting
findings of the valuable work 

3983
05:46:20,010 --> 05:46:22,010
that has been

3984
05:46:26,101 --> 05:46:28,101
leading to significant findings 
from a threat operations is the 

3985
05:46:28,135 --> 05:46:32,146
result of an entire team of 
overwatch threat hunters, we 

3986
05:46:32,303 --> 05:46:36,569
can't take all the credit, we 
have a great team and

3987
05:46:40,147 --> 05:46:42,916
this is very much a team effort 
that has resulted in this 

3988
05:46:43,070 --> 05:46:47,843
presentation. Okay, attacking 
the hard way, how are we 

3989
05:46:48,044 --> 05:46:52,445
implement and using ATT&CK prior
to this year?  It was a 

3990
05:46:52,594 --> 05:46:54,594
challenge

3991
05:46:55,762 --> 05:46:58,093
, we got a lot of value out of 
using

3992
05:47:01,853 --> 05:47:05,924
ATT&CK, we have gotten some 
great improvements overall  

3993
05:47:06,326 --> 05:47:08,694
because it has allowed us to 
standardize and more clearly 

3994
05:47:08,843 --> 05:47:11,397
communicate a threat findings to
customers, it has allowed us 

3995
05:47:12,148 --> 05:47:14,396
from an intelligence perspective
to more effectively and 

3996
05:47:14,544 --> 05:47:16,544
accurately

3997
05:47:20,131 --> 05:47:22,377
attack trends over time, and 
that is good stuff. As far as 

3998
05:47:22,578 --> 05:47:27,850
how we have gone about using 
ATT&CK in the past, more 

3999
05:47:28,064 --> 05:47:30,064
specifically, what we do is when
we identify target intrusions, 

4000
05:47:30,085 --> 05:47:33,287
we go back and  review all the 
data and manually map that back 

4001
05:47:33,442 --> 05:47:35,785
to ATT&CK techniques and we 
leverage all data sources we 

4002
05:47:35,986 --> 05:47:39,639
have access to  so primarily 
that is the falcon endpoint 

4003
05:47:39,839 --> 05:47:42,362
product, we have an point data 
that comes into the cloud

4004
05:47:49,795 --> 05:47:52,031
and we can partition off of the 
portions of that activity that 

4005
05:47:52,232 --> 05:47:54,264
is relevant to the targeted 
intrusion and map that. We also 

4006
05:47:54,465 --> 05:47:56,835
rely upon any forensics data 
that our services and response 

4007
05:47:56,997 --> 05:47:59,750
teams can pull back for us as 
well. And if there are samples 

4008
05:47:59,951 --> 05:48:05,636
from the activity that our 
intelligence team can get a hold

4009
05:48:05,836 --> 05:48:08,285
of and rivers and do some binary
analysis on that, we will pull 

4010
05:48:08,486 --> 05:48:11,325
that in as well, so any resource
we can, we will pull that in and

4011
05:48:11,940 --> 05:48:13,940
map that manually by going 
through that data as human 

4012
05:48:13,960 --> 05:48:15,960
analysts and identifying when 
certain techniques were employed

4013
05:48:16,090 --> 05:48:18,090
and

4014
05:48:24,128 --> 05:48:26,128
get that back to particular 
techniques. When we have done 

4015
05:48:26,147 --> 05:48:28,595
that mapping, both prior to this
year and still this year, we are

4016
05:48:28,796 --> 05:48:32,649
only doing that for targeted 
intrusions and that is the state

4017
05:48:32,852 --> 05:48:34,482
sponsor or even criminally 
motivated targeted actors who 

4018
05:48:34,483 --> 05:48:36,103
are going after specific 
organizations often times that 

4019
05:48:36,104 --> 05:48:38,104
his hands-on activity. We are 
not targeting the more common 

4020
05:48:38,135 --> 05:48:40,369
low level noisy commodity type 
malware threats that are also 

4021
05:48:41,132 --> 05:48:43,132
seen often

4022
05:48:44,837 --> 05:48:47,069
out there in the wild, these are
those targeted adversaries that 

4023
05:48:47,221 --> 05:48:50,016
we are taking the time to map 
but even still, we are analyzing

4024
05:48:51,137 --> 05:48:54,789
new intrusion activity on a 
daily basis, this is a laborious

4025
05:48:54,991 --> 05:48:57,438
process when you are having to 
do all this manually. Hence the 

4026
05:48:58,199 --> 05:49:00,199
illustration here

4027
05:49:04,144 --> 05:49:06,377
of constantly pushing the rock 
up the hill, it seems like we 

4028
05:49:06,578 --> 05:49:10,843
were constantly overwhelmed and 
having a difficult time doing 

4029
05:49:11,044 --> 05:49:13,282
this in a very manual process, 
so we have made some changes 

4030
05:49:13,481 --> 05:49:15,915
this year. We decided, we needed
to automate some of this as much

4031
05:49:16,115 --> 05:49:19,983
as possible, at least as much 
that makes sense, some of that 

4032
05:49:20,184 --> 05:49:23,635
was motivated by some of the 
presentations giving last year. 

4033
05:49:23,836 --> 05:49:25,868
There were presenters who talked
about the pros and cons of 

4034
05:49:26,072 --> 05:49:30,751
automating the attack technique 
mapping. So, we were going to 

4035
05:49:31,511 --> 05:49:36,435
give that a shot this year. 
First, we have taken advantage 

4036
05:49:36,636 --> 05:49:40,088
of our own product itself so the
falcon endpoint product that we 

4037
05:49:40,289 --> 05:49:42,289
use for a lot of our hunting

4038
05:49:45,773 --> 05:49:47,773
, it is already looking for 
specific malicious behaviors and

4039
05:49:48,367 --> 05:49:51,469
those behaviors, when they are 
fired, when they are triggered 

4040
05:49:51,670 --> 05:49:53,839
as detections in the process, 
the detections are already 

4041
05:49:53,999 --> 05:49:58,371
mapped to the most likely and 
most common attack technique for

4042
05:49:58,571 --> 05:50:00,805
that type of behavior, that is a
resource we can take advantage 

4043
05:50:01,006 --> 05:50:03,006
of to help automatically 
populate these

4044
05:50:06,491 --> 05:50:07,923
technique mappings for targeted 
intrusions because those 

4045
05:50:07,924 --> 05:50:09,924
targeted intrusions are going to
often times trigger at least 

4046
05:50:09,944 --> 05:50:15,228
some of those detections within 
the product itself, that is good

4047
05:50:15,428 --> 05:50:17,878
we can take advantage of that, 
also there is a lot more beyond 

4048
05:50:18,079 --> 05:50:19,896
our product detections of 
behaviors that we are looking 

4049
05:50:19,897 --> 05:50:24,165
for, a lot more expert mental 
hunting leads similarly can, to 

4050
05:50:24,365 --> 05:50:29,606
an extent, be mapped in advance 
to a most common or most likely 

4051
05:50:29,757 --> 05:50:33,717
attack technique associated with
that behavior. There is another 

4052
05:50:33,918 --> 05:50:38,321
batch of resources we can take 
into account, so using those 

4053
05:50:38,471 --> 05:50:45,909
capabilities, we are allowed to 
take some intrusion data and run

4054
05:50:46,109 --> 05:50:50,174
it through the script engine and
output for us automated mapped 

4055
05:50:50,376 --> 05:50:52,376
techniques for that particular 
targeted intrusion which is 

4056
05:50:52,501 --> 05:50:59,922
great. So, you see a very strict
stripped-down version of the 

4057
05:51:00,122 --> 05:51:05,406
output for the automated mapping
that we do, the most relevant 

4058
05:51:05,607 --> 05:51:09,812
key pieces here is what we are 
honing in on for focus.

4059
05:51:18,207 --> 05:51:20,428
So, in the first column, you got
that technique that has been 

4060
05:51:20,642 --> 05:51:22,663
mapped and the timestamp and the
associated command line for the 

4061
05:51:22,878 --> 05:51:25,111
activity for the behavior that 
was auto mapped, if you will. So

4062
05:51:25,311 --> 05:51:27,544
we will look at the first line 
briefly appear in the process 

4063
05:51:27,745 --> 05:51:29,745
injection technique mapping, so 
what is happening there is in 

4064
05:51:29,780 --> 05:51:32,012
that search protocol host 
process, a cobalt strike implant

4065
05:51:32,772 --> 05:51:37,499
has been injected into the 
process and is acting as that 

4066
05:51:37,700 --> 05:51:41,310
malicious implant therefore the 
process injection isn't making 

4067
05:51:41,460 --> 05:51:43,460
sense.

4068
05:51:46,023 --> 05:51:48,055
This is a real-world example 
from earlier this year, this was

4069
05:51:48,256 --> 05:51:50,256
a criminally motivated targeted 
intrusion against a financial 

4070
05:51:50,445 --> 05:51:52,445
sector institution

4071
05:51:54,494 --> 05:51:59,963
. And the next technique, if you
go down the line,

4072
05:52:05,128 --> 05:52:06,945
you can see there is 
masquerading that has been 

4073
05:52:06,946 --> 05:52:08,946
mapped to a similar search 
protocol host process. Now, what

4074
05:52:08,979 --> 05:52:13,047
is happening here is this flag 
on a particular behavior that 

4075
05:52:13,247 --> 05:52:19,546
was pre-mapped that we mapped 
because it is using for the 

4076
05:52:19,747 --> 05:52:21,747
protocol host. Essentially when 
the host is

4077
05:52:34,571 --> 05:52:36,404
executing normally, it is going 
to have additional commandline 

4078
05:52:36,405 --> 05:52:38,639
arguments with it, so when it is
executed in this fashion, there 

4079
05:52:38,840 --> 05:52:40,675
is no commandline arguments, 
there is something weird going 

4080
05:52:40,676 --> 05:52:42,905
on, we typically think that is 
some other piece of malware that

4081
05:52:43,107 --> 05:52:45,138
is trying to masquerade a search
protocol host. What is really 

4082
05:52:45,339 --> 05:52:47,339
happening here is that search 
protocol host is what is 

4083
05:52:47,372 --> 05:52:49,607
running, this is legit but it is
behaving and executing in a 

4084
05:52:49,808 --> 05:52:51,808
strange fashion because of that 
cobalt strike activity that I 

4085
05:52:52,399 --> 05:52:56,513
mentioned earlier. So for 
masquerading, it is not a true 

4086
05:52:56,713 --> 05:52:58,875
mapping, it is not a very 
accurate automated mapping

4087
05:53:04,234 --> 05:53:06,268
because that is not the type of 
masquerading that we were 

4088
05:53:06,468 --> 05:53:08,468
looking for when we originally 
created the map from that 

4089
05:53:08,502 --> 05:53:11,887
pattern to the technique of 
masquerading.

4090
05:53:18,455 --> 05:53:20,686
So, that would be an example of 
something we would filter out 

4091
05:53:20,886 --> 05:53:24,951
from the final results and have 
to go through. Here, even still 

4092
05:53:25,152 --> 05:53:26,982
with this automation happening, 
you still need that human 

4093
05:53:26,984 --> 05:53:30,837
analyst to go through and verify
actors and validate those 

4094
05:53:31,219 --> 05:53:34,503
findings to make sure the 
automated mapping is correct. 

4095
05:53:34,905 --> 05:53:36,905
Continuing down the line, 
commandline interface, that is 

4096
05:53:37,046 --> 05:53:39,046
self-explanatory

4097
05:53:40,186 --> 05:53:44,400
. Next you will see a couple 
techniques listed as the sensor 

4098
05:53:44,557 --> 05:53:46,887
technique, of course we 
recognize that it's not an 

4099
05:53:47,089 --> 05:53:51,355
official attack technique, that 
is an internal name that we use 

4100
05:53:51,556 --> 05:53:56,796
just because of there were a 
couple pieces of malware that 

4101
05:53:56,942 --> 05:54:00,636
triggered the next machine 
learning algorithms without were

4102
05:54:00,840 --> 05:54:07,603
identified, and since that 
malware in that generic sense is

4103
05:54:07,803 --> 05:54:09,836
too difficult to map into a 
single technique, we just have 

4104
05:54:10,051 --> 05:54:15,333
that placeholder there. So that 
is what is happening, and the 

4105
05:54:15,533 --> 05:54:17,711
final result, you see Windows 
admin shares was automatically 

4106
05:54:17,864 --> 05:54:19,864
mapped

4107
05:54:21,421 --> 05:54:23,756
to the behavior and that last 
final large commandline here

4108
05:54:27,308 --> 05:54:29,541
, and what is happening in that 
behavior, what the pattern was 

4109
05:54:29,742 --> 05:54:33,196
that triggered on that was a 
pattern looking for SNB exec, it

4110
05:54:33,410 --> 05:54:38,679
is that open source tool that 
acts like PS exec, adversaries 

4111
05:54:39,093 --> 05:54:42,844
use it from time to time, the 
user to perform

4112
05:54:46,399 --> 05:54:48,399
religious activity on a remote 
host, because of that remote 

4113
05:54:48,433 --> 05:54:51,809
behavior, we auto pre-map back 
to Windows because it often uses

4114
05:54:54,324 --> 05:54:57,119
Windows shares to execute on the
remote host. But you can see 

4115
05:54:57,279 --> 05:55:00,210
here, there is something 
different happening. This is the

4116
05:55:00,960 --> 05:55:02,960
SNB exec

4117
05:55:05,910 --> 05:55:07,931
tool used in this intrusion, 
there is a lot happening there, 

4118
05:55:08,132 --> 05:55:12,612
but essentially what it is doing
is it is executing on localhost,

4119
05:55:12,813 --> 05:55:15,049
it is not reaching out over the 
network to perform, it is 

4120
05:55:15,812 --> 05:55:17,812
malicious activity

4121
05:55:19,102 --> 05:55:21,102
. Therefore again, this is 
another case where even though 

4122
05:55:21,136 --> 05:55:23,136
it is a true positive hit of 
something malicious happening, 

4123
05:55:23,168 --> 05:55:25,002
the pattern being mapped to 
Windows shares doesn't really 

4124
05:55:25,003 --> 05:55:29,471
matter, it is not a correct 
mapping, this is another example

4125
05:55:29,672 --> 05:55:32,106
of something that we need to 
filter out of our results and we

4126
05:55:32,306 --> 05:55:34,306
wouldn't necessarily say that 
this is Windows shares in this 

4127
05:55:34,337 --> 05:55:37,588
example in this case. But, there
are probably other techniques. 

4128
05:55:38,002 --> 05:55:41,146
Auto mapping is only going to 
get you so far, you need a human

4129
05:55:46,127 --> 05:55:48,360
to validate the accuracy of the 
findings and you still have to 

4130
05:55:48,561 --> 05:55:50,595
go through all the event data 
because not everything in the 

4131
05:55:50,796 --> 05:55:53,030
intrusion necessarily is going 
to be a detected by some of our 

4132
05:55:53,231 --> 05:55:55,061
pre-mapped capabilities so there
still somewhat of a manual 

4133
05:55:55,063 --> 05:56:00,344
element to it. But automating 
gives us a jumpstart, it closes 

4134
05:56:00,545 --> 05:56:02,780
the gap and gives us a head 
start in mapping the entire 

4135
05:56:02,980 --> 05:56:10,299
intrusion into it.
>> Just to summarize, we take 

4136
05:56:10,500 --> 05:56:13,953
findings from different 
investigations for hunting 

4137
05:56:14,154 --> 05:56:20,252
intrusions, we mapped that based
on the ATT&CK framework  and 

4138
05:56:20,586 --> 05:56:22,629
then we create observable's, so 
examples of how this

4139
05:56:26,956 --> 05:56:29,189
specific technique was used. So 
it begs the question, what do we

4140
05:56:29,389 --> 05:56:32,129
do with that data next? The 
first thing we do is create

4141
05:56:36,492 --> 05:56:38,332
technical profiles for the 
adversaries that allows us to 

4142
05:56:38,333 --> 05:56:40,761
pivot based on the data that we 
mapped, that is an example, I 

4143
05:56:40,962 --> 05:56:43,810
want to know every single 
credential access technique, and

4144
05:56:44,012 --> 05:56:48,681
how that stuck against every 
technique and look for 

4145
05:56:48,882 --> 05:56:52,345
similarities, look for things 
that might be interesting. 

4146
05:56:52,746 --> 05:56:54,778
Another thing we do is take 
those active profiles and we 

4147
05:56:54,979 --> 05:56:57,063
apply that knowledge across our 
customers across different 

4148
05:56:57,214 --> 05:57:01,683
verticals and try to track 
campaigns across our customer 

4149
05:57:01,884 --> 05:57:03,884
base. Track and enrich

4150
05:57:06,565 --> 05:57:11,178
across our customer base. As an 
example, this year, we have an 

4151
05:57:11,366 --> 05:57:18,542
intrusion who targeted customers
across multiple verticals. And 

4152
05:57:18,742 --> 05:57:21,590
among many different techniques,
we saw one technique that was 

4153
05:57:22,351 --> 05:57:31,547
very similar. And the name would
be a three letter name of the 

4154
05:57:31,747 --> 05:57:34,117
customer they were after and 
that would be on different 

4155
05:57:34,267 --> 05:57:36,267
customers.

4156
05:57:45,556 --> 05:57:47,588
It wasn't the only thing that 
was specific to the adversary, 

4157
05:57:47,789 --> 05:57:49,789
it was just one of those 
behavioral technical things that

4158
05:57:49,823 --> 05:57:51,857
we looked at, okay, that was 
very similar to something else 

4159
05:57:52,058 --> 05:57:54,092
that we have seen but is also 
associated with that active 

4160
05:57:54,293 --> 05:57:56,728
base. The bottom line is that we
can use that based on the 

4161
05:57:56,928 --> 05:57:58,761
observable's that were created, 
to try to find different 

4162
05:57:58,762 --> 05:58:00,791
campaigns across our customer 
base. And what we do with that 

4163
05:58:00,993 --> 05:58:06,279
data is we create the final 
deliverables or the reporting 

4164
05:58:06,680 --> 05:58:09,664
that we share with our customers
and with the community as a part

4165
05:58:09,819 --> 05:58:11,859
of our yearly reports.

4166
05:58:15,573 --> 05:58:22,931
>> That is something you are 
seeing as an example up here, 

4167
05:58:23,345 --> 05:58:29,028
when we are completed with all 
of our analysis that has done 

4168
05:58:29,229 --> 05:58:31,664
all the mapping, we can deliver 
that and we do deliver that even

4169
05:58:31,878 --> 05:58:33,911
publicly at times or the annual 
or midyear reports are something

4170
05:58:34,111 --> 05:58:36,111
that is published

4171
05:58:43,650 --> 05:58:45,650
publicly and we haven't mapped 
with the details and facilitated

4172
05:58:45,683 --> 05:58:47,719
by the automated process, filled
in with some manual process but 

4173
05:58:47,917 --> 05:58:50,563
you get the end result like what
you see here, this is just an 

4174
05:58:50,763 --> 05:58:52,763
example. This isn't necessarily 
from the same intrusion that we 

4175
05:58:52,804 --> 05:58:54,833
saw before but this is just a 
couple different examples of 

4176
05:58:55,034 --> 05:58:57,055
what the final product looks 
like. And speaking of the annual

4177
05:58:57,269 --> 05:59:00,104
and midyear report, we just 
released a midyear report which 

4178
05:59:00,308 --> 05:59:02,538
covers the findings for the 
first half of the year, so if 

4179
05:59:02,753 --> 05:59:04,753
you just google

4180
05:59:07,221 --> 05:59:09,857
it, you can pull down a copy of 
that and it provides not just 

4181
05:59:10,059 --> 05:59:12,091
specific examples like what was 
in the previous slide but we 

4182
05:59:12,291 --> 05:59:15,491
also provide as best as we can 
the overall review of all of the

4183
05:59:15,640 --> 05:59:18,692
techniques, it is delivered in 
this heat map

4184
05:59:24,078 --> 05:59:26,714
view and we encourage you to 
take a look at that if you do 

4185
05:59:26,914 --> 05:59:29,148
want to dive into some of those 
additional details. There are a 

4186
05:59:29,362 --> 05:59:33,415
few of these examples, of course
sometimes we see some things a 

4187
05:59:33,616 --> 05:59:36,214
lot but we see some techniques 
used in a particularly unique 

4188
05:59:36,361 --> 05:59:39,919
fashion, so there are a few 
examples now as we continue with

4189
05:59:40,120 --> 05:59:42,154
the presentation that we will 
dive into of a few interesting 

4190
05:59:42,356 --> 05:59:46,422
technique implementations seen 
and targeted in the wild, the 

4191
05:59:46,622 --> 05:59:49,255
tactics highlighted in green are
the tactics we will share some 

4192
05:59:50,007 --> 05:59:52,007
examples from.

4193
05:59:53,737 --> 05:59:55,971
We are time-limited, so we can't
share from each of the tactic 

4194
05:59:56,176 --> 05:59:58,967
families but these are the ones 
we will dive into now. So, 

4195
05:59:59,130 --> 06:00:03,891
interesting TTP's in the wild, 
we will start with an intrusion 

4196
06:00:04,092 --> 06:00:06,092
that occurred against an 
academic institution.

4197
06:00:09,779 --> 06:00:11,609
Where the victim organization 
suspected something was going on

4198
06:00:11,611 --> 06:00:15,262
on their network, they called in
our services team to go and do 

4199
06:00:15,463 --> 06:00:20,682
an incident response, and we 
have partnered with our own 

4200
06:00:20,832 --> 06:00:23,446
ground responders to work 
together to help uncover 

4201
06:00:24,156 --> 06:00:28,868
potential evidence of the 
adversary there and it didn't 

4202
06:00:29,082 --> 06:00:31,936
take too long for us to find 
evidence of a targeted activity,

4203
06:00:32,117 --> 06:00:37,005
it looked like Velvet Chollima  
was on the network and turns 

4204
06:00:37,214 --> 06:00:39,798
out, further analysis confirmed 
that, and this was part of that 

4205
06:00:39,996 --> 06:00:42,841
larger stolen pencil campaign 
that was reported publicly and 

4206
06:00:42,996 --> 06:00:45,219
widely earlier this past year.

4207
06:00:48,779 --> 06:00:51,629
And, in this case, this is one 
of those institutions where 

4208
06:00:51,830 --> 06:00:55,080
North Koreans were actively 
targeting a number of academic 

4209
06:00:55,281 --> 06:00:57,460
institutions, that is what this 
institution intrusion was all 

4210
06:00:57,618 --> 06:00:59,618
about.

4211
06:01:01,164 --> 06:01:03,198
Among the artifacts we have 
uncovered pretty early on in the

4212
06:01:03,399 --> 06:01:05,399
course of the analysis was an 
implant that our intelligence 

4213
06:01:05,991 --> 06:01:10,464
team called gold stamp, they 
have a number of collection 

4214
06:01:10,616 --> 06:01:14,986
tactic capabilities, it can do 
some other things including an 

4215
06:01:15,185 --> 06:01:19,040
interesting twist on the 
clipboard data technique, with 

4216
06:01:19,254 --> 06:01:24,528
this implant is able to do is 
identify when a crypto currency 

4217
06:01:24,729 --> 06:01:27,323
wallet address is saved to the 
clipboard, it will replace that 

4218
06:01:27,496 --> 06:01:29,496
clipboard

4219
06:01:31,229 --> 06:01:33,263
saved wallet address with the 
wallet address that is owned by 

4220
06:01:33,464 --> 06:01:38,346
Velvet Chollima , therefore when
crypto activity happens, that 

4221
06:01:39,308 --> 06:01:42,558
crypto currency will be 
transferred to a Velvet Chollima

4222
06:01:43,975 --> 06:01:46,785
controlled account. Similarly, 
we will stay with

4223
06:01:52,764 --> 06:01:54,798
the same intrusion here because 
there is a lot of interesting 

4224
06:01:54,998 --> 06:01:56,818
dynamics involved in this 
particular intrusion, a lot of 

4225
06:01:56,819 --> 06:01:58,819
it was reported publicly but 
there are some other interesting

4226
06:01:58,854 --> 06:02:00,887
aspects to it that we wanted to 
highlight that wasn't talked 

4227
06:02:01,087 --> 06:02:04,138
about as much in the public. So 
something that happened early on

4228
06:02:04,338 --> 06:02:06,471
in this intrusion, the adversary
had gained access and

4229
06:02:12,871 --> 06:02:14,289
had entrenched themselves pretty
effectively throughout the 

4230
06:02:14,290 --> 06:02:16,323
network before we got there and 
before we had visibility and 

4231
06:02:16,523 --> 06:02:18,768
during that time, they were able
to dump credentials and gather a

4232
06:02:18,969 --> 06:02:25,413
number of valid accounts. For 
this one particular user, they 

4233
06:02:25,573 --> 06:02:27,594
reused the same credentials

4234
06:02:31,358 --> 06:02:35,961
for their academic account as 
their personal accounts, so the 

4235
06:02:36,108 --> 06:02:41,111
adversaries were able to get 
into their Gmail accounts and 

4236
06:02:41,867 --> 06:02:45,378
PayPal accounts, and they could 
take their browser extensions 

4237
06:02:45,579 --> 06:02:52,483
techniques to a whole new level 
if you will. They used this 

4238
06:02:52,684 --> 06:02:57,353
individual's Gmail account to go
into the Google Chrome web store

4239
06:02:57,554 --> 06:03:00,203
and they posted their browser 
extension to the Google Chrome 

4240
06:03:00,404 --> 06:03:04,015
web store and used his Gmail 
account to comment about how 

4241
06:03:04,168 --> 06:03:07,721
great this Google Chrome 
extension is and how everybody 

4242
06:03:07,920 --> 06:03:09,920
should download it, it gives you
these

4243
06:03:13,204 --> 06:03:15,236
great custom font capabilities 
and it turns out they are just 

4244
06:03:15,437 --> 06:03:17,606
trying to further infect more 
potential victims and obviously 

4245
06:03:17,753 --> 06:03:22,071
having a legitimate Gmail 
account that is common and 

4246
06:03:22,222 --> 06:03:26,109
commenting just shows the level 
of created

4247
06:03:30,268 --> 06:03:34,524
creativity that our adversaries 
will go to.

4248
06:03:34,683 --> 06:03:40,163
>> Another example from one of 
our customers, this was on the 

4249
06:03:40,358 --> 06:03:49,965
adversary targeted, and they 
used the combination of the 

4250
06:03:50,728 --> 06:03:58,087
valid accounts to log in and 
perform some basic things, try 

4251
06:03:58,301 --> 06:04:02,555
to identify systems and accounts
and systems they could login, 

4252
06:04:02,969 --> 06:04:04,969
things like that.

4253
06:04:08,856 --> 06:04:12,619
The key thing in this case is 
that they modified the systems

4254
06:04:21,851 --> 06:04:26,871
. They replaced tools on the 
system, so they recompiled the 

4255
06:04:27,019 --> 06:04:29,257
tools on the box, things like

4256
06:04:37,494 --> 06:04:39,930
VPS, any tool be administered or
might use or the user might use 

4257
06:04:40,131 --> 06:04:42,164
would basically have a new 
version, we have an extra code 

4258
06:04:42,379 --> 06:04:46,030
and that code checked, every 
time the command would be 

4259
06:04:46,231 --> 06:04:48,231
executed. The tool would first

4260
06:04:53,949 --> 06:04:55,983
check the directory, that was on
the system and in that 

4261
06:04:56,184 --> 06:04:57,803
directory, there would be 
information about the network, 

4262
06:04:57,804 --> 06:04:59,837
about processes and files, that 
would be redacted from the tool.

4263
06:05:00,038 --> 06:05:02,687
And that way the adversary would
basically be able to hide on the

4264
06:05:02,887 --> 06:05:05,013
system from anyone who was 
trying to investigate. Obviously

4265
06:05:05,937 --> 06:05:11,421
the functionality is similar in 
a way but they decided not to 

4266
06:05:12,386 --> 06:05:14,386
drop

4267
06:05:16,504 --> 06:05:19,339
specific tools with additional 
functionality. As you can see, 

4268
06:05:19,540 --> 06:05:24,624
on this slide, the snippet of 
that activity, the adversary 

4269
06:05:25,386 --> 06:05:29,289
basically removed the PS file 
and recompile their own version 

4270
06:05:29,705 --> 06:05:36,742
of PS and left it on the system.
Moving onto another example, the

4271
06:05:36,897 --> 06:05:43,447
same intrusion, this time in 
addition to the protector 

4272
06:05:44,277 --> 06:05:46,277
modified in

4273
06:05:50,016 --> 06:05:56,315
the potential adversaries, they 
have also modified SS H in a way

4274
06:05:56,516 --> 06:06:01,801
they could maintain access to 
the system as well as collect 

4275
06:06:02,001 --> 06:06:06,268
additional credentials, so that 
modified SS H binary would 

4276
06:06:06,669 --> 06:06:11,137
change the password function, 
they are responsible for 

4277
06:06:11,338 --> 06:06:15,765
validating user logons and it 
allowed them to provide the same

4278
06:06:15,931 --> 06:06:20,889
password to log into the system 
every time, as well as collect 

4279
06:06:21,090 --> 06:06:23,090
any legitimate user logon

4280
06:06:29,426 --> 06:06:31,660
username and password and save 
it into a file, that way they 

4281
06:06:31,862 --> 06:06:33,479
could then access those 
credentials or potentially reuse

4282
06:06:33,480 --> 06:06:39,366
it somewhere else on the metric.
Another story, at this time, one

4283
06:06:39,581 --> 06:06:45,664
of the adversaries targeting a 
software company, basically used

4284
06:06:45,866 --> 06:06:50,137
interactive logon to execute a 
script that automated a 

4285
06:06:50,337 --> 06:06:56,182
multistage execution process, a 
couple of downloads, the end 

4286
06:06:56,379 --> 06:06:58,379
result

4287
06:07:00,290 --> 06:07:02,736
were two files that were created
on the system, one of them was 

4288
06:07:02,937 --> 06:07:06,136
the INF file, that is the 
profile for the connection 

4289
06:07:06,293 --> 06:07:13,090
manager. That file was an 
implant and the protector 

4290
06:07:13,505 --> 06:07:18,462
executed the managers service on
the system

4291
06:07:23,455 --> 06:07:25,273
leading to the malicious 
implant. We usually see the 

4292
06:07:25,274 --> 06:07:29,945
connection manager being used by
the teams, but in this 

4293
06:07:30,159 --> 06:07:32,159
particular case, we suspected it
was the targeted adversary, most

4294
06:07:32,178 --> 06:07:36,203
likely one of the defenders. And
getting back to when I talked 

4295
06:07:36,363 --> 06:07:39,707
about those technical profiles, 
unfortunately our intelligence 

4296
06:07:39,907 --> 06:07:41,907
team didn't have enough 
information

4297
06:07:45,795 --> 06:07:48,032
based on the data that was 
available at the time, but based

4298
06:07:48,233 --> 06:07:50,233
on the behavioral and tactical 
level of information, we were 

4299
06:07:50,264 --> 06:07:55,345
able to gather, based on the 
observable's, based on the 

4300
06:07:55,547 --> 06:07:57,582
profiles that were created, we 
were able to look at similar 

4301
06:07:57,782 --> 06:08:00,216
activity of that specific panda 
and other Haverhill techniques. 

4302
06:08:00,618 --> 06:08:06,519
It is very likely that in this 
case, it was just based on the 

4303
06:08:06,719 --> 06:08:11,790
variables that we did. It allows
us to apply that profile to 

4304
06:08:12,540 --> 06:08:19,920
identify the producer and use 
that knowledge to identify other

4305
06:08:20,121 --> 06:08:23,266
activity specific to that actor 
within the network. The next one

4306
06:08:25,607 --> 06:08:34,089
is also specific to an adversary
who targeted this time a defense

4307
06:08:35,697 --> 06:08:41,595
industrial base company, and we 
would ask both the intelligence 

4308
06:08:41,756 --> 06:08:44,789
team in the front team to help 
out

4309
06:08:48,310 --> 06:08:50,310
.

4310
06:08:52,222 --> 06:08:59,524
And we have seen the protector 
using similar accounts to 

4311
06:08:59,738 --> 06:09:03,895
execute on the network but one 
of the most interesting findings

4312
06:09:04,406 --> 06:09:12,325
was a custom tool that they used
to steal and manipulate tokens 

4313
06:09:12,528 --> 06:09:15,322
in the memory that allow them to
impersonate any user on the 

4314
06:09:15,470 --> 06:09:18,828
system. So that tool, and you 
can see an example of the 

4315
06:09:19,030 --> 06:09:24,514
execution of that tool basically
working on a Windows system. You

4316
06:09:24,715 --> 06:09:27,152
impersonate the tool you want to
execute and that magically 

4317
06:09:27,353 --> 06:09:32,987
happens through the token 
impersonation on the system.

4318
06:09:33,140 --> 06:09:35,431
>> And

4319
06:09:38,931 --> 06:09:43,557
to name it after what technique 
they were using, or token, even 

4320
06:09:43,703 --> 06:09:48,481
ATT sometimes takes shortcuts. 
The last example we will share 

4321
06:09:48,681 --> 06:09:50,870
comes from a case of a game 
hunting

4322
06:09:53,968 --> 06:09:55,968
, what we are referring to are 
those targeted ransomware 

4323
06:09:56,560 --> 06:09:59,350
attacks where criminal adversary
will go after an organization of

4324
06:10:00,054 --> 06:10:02,054
various sizes, this example here
is from

4325
06:10:07,776 --> 06:10:08,991
a large international 
conglomerate organization that 

4326
06:10:08,992 --> 06:10:11,024
started but it can be an 
organization of any size with 

4327
06:10:11,235 --> 06:10:13,258
the targeted ransomware attack 
and this has gained a lot of 

4328
06:10:13,471 --> 06:10:15,289
popularity in recent months of 
course with smaller 

4329
06:10:15,290 --> 06:10:17,290
organizations like municipal 
governments

4330
06:10:20,372 --> 06:10:22,203
or public school districts, 
things like that being targeted 

4331
06:10:22,205 --> 06:10:26,260
with this ransom malware, and a 
particular organization tries to

4332
06:10:26,460 --> 06:10:28,841
spread that as well and hold it 
for ransom.

4333
06:10:37,031 --> 06:10:39,465
We do see this type of activity 
quite often in the most common 

4334
06:10:39,665 --> 06:10:41,665
types of ransomware employed in 
the big game hunting operation 

4335
06:10:41,698 --> 06:10:44,493
is that we uncover when we do 
our threat hunting is typically 

4336
06:10:44,639 --> 06:10:46,689
Dharma, that is somebody

4337
06:10:51,040 --> 06:10:53,040
interesting, and they SS

4338
06:10:58,156 --> 06:11:00,188
the Dharma and it is widely 
applied by a number of 

4339
06:11:00,389 --> 06:11:04,242
affiliates who use that 
ransomware. Even though a number

4340
06:11:04,456 --> 06:11:07,908
of different affiliates can be 
used to target various 

4341
06:11:08,108 --> 06:11:11,559
organizations, we still see 
quite a bit of overlap in TTP's,

4342
06:11:11,760 --> 06:11:16,642
utilized in the course of those 
big game hunting attacks that 

4343
06:11:16,842 --> 06:11:26,394
use Dharma, some of those common
TTP's are RDP password spring to

4344
06:11:26,595 --> 06:11:30,047
gain access into the network, 
they will also use the same 

4345
06:11:30,447 --> 06:11:33,899
scanning tool to spread their 
ransomware tool. They also 

4346
06:11:34,113 --> 06:11:36,666
really like to use different 
open-source

4347
06:11:45,887 --> 06:11:47,887
, openly available tools that 
allow them to disable security 

4348
06:11:47,922 --> 06:11:49,922
products on those endpoints so 
things like process hacker, PC 

4349
06:11:49,956 --> 06:11:52,389
Hunter, you see a lot of 
overlaps. We did see a lot of 

4350
06:11:52,590 --> 06:11:54,218
those behaviors in this 
particular attack that this 

4351
06:11:54,219 --> 06:11:59,705
attack added something we 
haven't seen from the other big 

4352
06:11:59,906 --> 06:12:01,736
hunting campaigns, and that is 
the modifications to the 

4353
06:12:01,737 --> 06:12:03,737
registry that were unusual, some
of those system setting changes.

4354
06:12:03,759 --> 06:12:07,220
What they did is they ran the 
command that led to the registry

4355
06:12:07,422 --> 06:12:11,274
change that you see there, where
the essentially change the 

4356
06:12:11,476 --> 06:12:15,743
settings to disable the timeout 
and the reason we suspect they 

4357
06:12:15,957 --> 06:12:17,957
did this is when they land on

4358
06:12:25,295 --> 06:12:27,530
the head with that RDP access, 
it could take some time to 

4359
06:12:27,730 --> 06:12:29,762
ultimately achieve their goals 
and they don't want to lose that

4360
06:12:29,963 --> 06:12:32,826
session access in the middle of 
that, it could take them hours, 

4361
06:12:33,013 --> 06:12:36,879
even days for them to move 
around, escalate privileges, 

4362
06:12:37,280 --> 06:12:41,746
move laterally to effectively 
spread the ransomware to lock 

4363
06:12:42,160 --> 06:12:44,382
down the network, they want to 
make sure they have enough time 

4364
06:12:44,595 --> 06:12:47,030
to do that so they modify the 
registry to make sure the RDP 

4365
06:12:47,234 --> 06:12:49,234
session wouldn't timeout.

4366
06:12:51,902 --> 06:12:54,373
That concludes our presentation,
we are grateful for the chance 

4367
06:12:54,752 --> 06:12:58,402
and we are happy to take some 
questions.

4368
06:12:58,604 --> 06:13:00,604
>> Perfect, thank you so much.

4369
06:13:07,139 --> 06:13:10,190
I will let folks talk to you 
during break since you hit your 

4370
06:13:10,390 --> 06:13:12,390
time exactly, which is pretty 
tough to do.

4371
06:13:17,707 --> 06:13:19,727
Thank you so much, a couple 
things I appreciate about that 

4372
06:13:19,941 --> 06:13:22,224
talk, you included some juicy 
details on adversary behaviors 

4373
06:13:22,580 --> 06:13:24,580
at the procedural level, we 
always say those procedures are 

4374
06:13:24,613 --> 06:13:27,047
key so I appreciate you did 
that. I just wanted to read a 

4375
06:13:27,806 --> 06:13:30,703
couple tweets, they highlighted 
the perils of automatically 

4376
06:13:30,903 --> 06:13:33,501
mapping threat data to minor 
attack and

4377
06:13:42,480 --> 06:13:43,909
automation processes don't 
always pick up important 

4378
06:13:43,910 --> 06:13:45,910
contacts so human reviews are 
important and that struck me 

4379
06:13:45,986 --> 06:13:48,168
because that is pretty much the 
same thing that Jackie and Sarah

4380
06:13:48,369 --> 06:13:50,002
said, almost exactly. That was 
awesome. Russell Thomas 

4381
06:13:50,003 --> 06:13:55,023
commented online, camerawork on 
MITRE ATT&CK live stream 

4382
06:14:01,579 --> 06:14:03,811
is fantastic, Tony and I were 
laughing, it is like the Academy

4383
06:14:04,012 --> 06:14:06,246
Awards, but for nerds, so that 
was a wonderful one. Another one

4384
06:14:06,447 --> 06:14:10,913
I wanted to call out, is Brian 
Neely here? I think I saw him in

4385
06:14:11,128 --> 06:14:13,360
the audience, if not, I will 
chat with him later, he tweeted,

4386
06:14:13,762 --> 06:14:20,824
extremely refreshing educational
session today. And some others, 

4387
06:14:20,986 --> 06:14:26,252
Google,  MITRE,  Sarah, Jackie,

4388
06:14:35,904 --> 06:14:38,339
Ruth, all experts, all women, so
I just wanted to read that one, 

4389
06:14:38,540 --> 06:14:40,372
thank you, Brian for 
acknowledging that because it is

4390
06:14:40,373 --> 06:14:43,010
pretty sweet to be up here with 
a lot of other women in cyber 

4391
06:14:43,210 --> 06:14:47,681
and nailing it and looking good 
at the same time. So with that, 

4392
06:14:48,096 --> 06:14:50,931
we will move onto the next 
speaker, this is a great use 

4393
06:14:51,144 --> 06:14:53,144
case, one of the things we love 
about

4394
06:14:59,264 --> 06:15:01,264
ATT&CKcon is bringing together 
all of your stories, and what 

4395
06:15:01,300 --> 06:15:06,773
others can learn  from how you 
have used those best practices. 

4396
06:15:07,188 --> 06:15:09,559
Chris Thayer is going to talk 
about a story ,

4397
06:15:14,090 --> 06:15:16,090
about building a detection 
program around

4398
06:15:20,595 --> 06:15:23,030
ATT&CK, how a team of one was 
able to start that for his 

4399
06:15:23,230 --> 06:15:25,772
company. So, please join me in 
welcoming  Chris Thayer .

4400
06:15:32,523 --> 06:15:34,719
>> Thank you, Katie.

4401
06:15:39,073 --> 06:15:41,509
And, I just wanted everybody to 
bear with me, this is my first 

4402
06:15:41,722 --> 06:15:43,722
talk in front of any conference

4403
06:15:47,208 --> 06:15:50,041
so, there is a small chance I 
may run out the door and back to

4404
06:15:50,242 --> 06:15:55,126
my car [Laughter] and thank you 
for laughing at that, that makes

4405
06:15:55,328 --> 06:15:57,762
the chance a little bit smaller.
I just wanted to start a little 

4406
06:15:57,964 --> 06:15:59,964
bit with my background

4407
06:16:13,405 --> 06:16:15,737
. Let's see if I can get this to
work.

4408
06:16:22,947 --> 06:16:24,947
There we go. Okay.

4409
06:16:28,844 --> 06:16:34,330
I'm from St. Louis, Missouri, I 
have 7 years background in 

4410
06:16:35,093 --> 06:16:37,933
information security, almost all
of it in IR

4411
06:16:44,285 --> 06:16:46,305
, working for MasterCard, I have
worked on their design and 

4412
06:16:46,519 --> 06:16:48,519
architecture team and their 
intelligence team and currently 

4413
06:16:48,538 --> 06:16:53,356
I am the technical lead for 
their digital forensics lab. 

4414
06:16:53,505 --> 06:16:56,370
Overall, I am a blue team or

4415
06:17:01,342 --> 06:17:03,379
at heart, has anybody played 
StarCraft at all? I remember as 

4416
06:17:03,780 --> 06:17:06,772
a kid, I loved playing it, I 
always had more fun holding up 

4417
06:17:06,923 --> 06:17:12,715
defenses than I did attacking 
people, which as anyone knows, 

4418
06:17:12,915 --> 06:17:15,565
that is not a good way to win, 
that is something I have taken 

4419
06:17:15,766 --> 06:17:17,899
into my career a little bit, I 
don't do

4420
06:17:27,140 --> 06:17:29,375
testing professionally but I 
have a lab where I try to keep 

4421
06:17:29,576 --> 06:17:32,013
my skills up because I think it 
is important when we are dealing

4422
06:17:32,213 --> 06:17:33,846
from the defensive side. So 
MasterCard, the digital 

4423
06:17:33,848 --> 06:17:36,281
forensics lab is an accredited 
lab which means we have a lot of

4424
06:17:36,481 --> 06:17:38,481
policies and procedures we have 
to follow, along with evidence 

4425
06:17:38,514 --> 06:17:40,548
handling and chain of custody 
and all of that. There are 

4426
06:17:40,749 --> 06:17:45,833
certain roles built out where I 
said I was a tech lead, there 

4427
06:17:46,037 --> 06:17:48,037
are a couple of rules with the 
procedures, we handle 

4428
06:17:48,064 --> 06:17:50,902
everything, all internal 
investigations from malware to 

4429
06:17:51,854 --> 06:17:55,881
web application possible 
compromises. As

4430
06:17:59,438 --> 06:18:01,618
tech lead, I am responsible for 
creating the investigation 

4431
06:18:01,777 --> 06:18:04,926
procedures, evaluating new 
hardware and implementing that. 

4432
06:18:05,126 --> 06:18:11,152
And on top of that, recently, as
Katie mentioned, I started a 

4433
06:18:11,298 --> 06:18:15,079
one-man threat hunting program, 
and the reason I wanted to 

4434
06:18:15,839 --> 06:18:20,562
mention that, I think that is a 
real common problem in our 

4435
06:18:20,763 --> 06:18:22,910
industry so anything I can do to
save time,

4436
06:18:27,466 --> 06:18:30,313
and automation I can do, I try 
to do it, I think there are a 

4437
06:18:30,513 --> 06:18:33,148
lot of people in the same boat 
that have been here, they do a 

4438
06:18:33,363 --> 06:18:36,714
lot of hard work, they can save 
us a lot of time.

4439
06:18:43,305 --> 06:18:45,305
All right, let's try this one.

4440
06:18:49,003 --> 06:18:54,890
So I wanted to go over the 
agenda really quick. The first 

4441
06:18:55,649 --> 06:18:59,917
part is, MITRE ATT&CK doesn't 
mean 

4442
06:19:05,043 --> 06:19:07,278
to be complex, I just want to 
throw a definition of what 

4443
06:19:07,479 --> 06:19:09,715
threat hunting is mainly because
I think there are a lot of 

4444
06:19:09,915 --> 06:19:12,763
different definitions out there,
it has been one of those words, 

4445
06:19:12,972 --> 06:19:15,198
and I think that at least for 
this presentation, I wanted to 

4446
06:19:15,398 --> 06:19:19,664
be on the same page. I wanted to
talk about the first phase which

4447
06:19:19,879 --> 06:19:25,765
is what I call just before the 
attack, and phase 2, just after 

4448
06:19:25,966 --> 06:19:30,235
the attack and if we have time, 
we will go through some 

4449
06:19:30,436 --> 06:19:35,920
questions and answers. So I 
wanted to talk about, we have 

4450
06:19:36,121 --> 06:19:39,572
seen a lot of presentations this
morning where everyone talked 

4451
06:19:39,773 --> 06:19:41,773
about implementing ATT&CK 

4452
06:19:45,057 --> 06:19:47,708
in their own way and one of the 
common trends is, it is complex.

4453
06:19:47,908 --> 06:19:50,832
There is a lot to do, we saw one
of the earlier presentations

4454
06:19:56,633 --> 06:19:59,081
said, if you're going to do this
right, it is probably going to 

4455
06:19:59,282 --> 06:20:01,100
take a year with your 
organization and I know 

4456
06:20:01,101 --> 06:20:03,550
everything moves slow because it
is not just you, you have to get

4457
06:20:03,750 --> 06:20:06,790
a lot of people to buy in, a lot
of the process is manual or you 

4458
06:20:06,992 --> 06:20:09,439
have to score it and map it and 
report on it and convince 

4459
06:20:09,639 --> 06:20:11,673
everyone that it is worth doing.
And sometimes that involves a 

4460
06:20:11,874 --> 06:20:14,106
lot of teams getting together 
and make sure that works. I kind

4461
06:20:14,307 --> 06:20:16,339
of wanted to bring our story 
together because I think that 

4462
06:20:16,540 --> 06:20:20,205
it's a way where you can use 
ATT&CK and kind of pick and 

4463
06:20:20,405 --> 06:20:23,858
choose what you use  and you can
do as little or as much as you 

4464
06:20:24,059 --> 06:20:27,108
want and you are the ones that 
decide where to go as you use 

4465
06:20:27,868 --> 06:20:29,868
ATT&CK. 

4466
06:20:31,775 --> 06:20:34,117
I did also want to mention that 
even though I

4467
06:20:40,314 --> 06:20:42,346
talked about implementing it, we
actually are doing that and if 

4468
06:20:42,548 --> 06:20:44,983
you are doing it, don't stop, 
that is great, this is just a 

4469
06:20:45,184 --> 06:20:53,921
complement to that. So, what is 
threat hunting? I recently did 

4470
06:20:54,322 --> 06:20:56,322
about six or seven interviews

4471
06:21:02,242 --> 06:21:04,275
with our team for an open 
position and I think every 

4472
06:21:04,476 --> 06:21:06,721
single person has threat hunting
on their resume so I asked them 

4473
06:21:06,923 --> 06:21:08,957
about it because I was 
interested in it because of this

4474
06:21:09,158 --> 06:21:11,491
program. One of the guys said, 
he was just making

4475
06:21:16,064 --> 06:21:19,715
some, another person said there 
were passion vulnerabilities, 

4476
06:21:19,916 --> 06:21:22,308
another person said they were 
going around and fixing bad 

4477
06:21:22,458 --> 06:21:27,837
policies and another guy told me
he was just looking for failed 

4478
06:21:28,051 --> 06:21:29,869
logins throughout the 
environment. All of these are 

4479
06:21:29,870 --> 06:21:32,305
good and we should be doing them
but I wouldn't consider any of 

4480
06:21:32,518 --> 06:21:35,354
those threat hunting. I threw up
the definition from online that 

4481
06:21:35,555 --> 06:21:40,438
I thought fit best and it is the
process of proactively searching

4482
06:21:40,838 --> 06:21:42,838
through systems to detect

4483
06:21:47,141 --> 06:21:48,759
isolated advanced threats that 
have existed in security 

4484
06:21:48,760 --> 06:21:53,232
solutions. I threw up the loop 
as well, it is important to see,

4485
06:21:53,432 --> 06:21:56,282
you start with a hypothesis, you
kind of investigate it through 

4486
06:21:56,482 --> 06:21:59,736
tools and techniques and you 
uncover new patterns which we 

4487
06:22:00,496 --> 06:22:02,496
talked about

4488
06:22:06,643 --> 06:22:08,664
TTP's earlier. I think it is 
important if you don't uncover 

4489
06:22:08,879 --> 06:22:10,899
new patterns, I think that both 
of those processes can provide 

4490
06:22:11,112 --> 06:22:15,782
you with good information but 
then you do analytics, make some

4491
06:22:15,982 --> 06:22:18,417
detections and see how I can 
deploy this throughout my entire

4492
06:22:18,617 --> 06:22:21,264
environment. So to me, I feel 
like the hardest part of this 

4493
06:22:21,465 --> 06:22:24,315
isn't necessarily the 
investigation or the analytics, 

4494
06:22:24,516 --> 06:22:29,184
we do that every day in our job,
I think the hardest part was 

4495
06:22:29,945 --> 06:22:35,230
creating that hypothesis, what 
indicates something is bad out 

4496
06:22:35,384 --> 06:22:40,555
there? And it goes back to the 
pyramid of pain where it is 

4497
06:22:40,769 --> 06:22:44,019
always easier to implement the 
IOC that we found, and 

4498
06:22:44,220 --> 06:22:48,889
uncovering the new tactics and 
techniques and procedures as 

4499
06:22:49,089 --> 06:22:51,089
they come out.

4500
06:22:58,228 --> 06:23:00,228
Before ATT&CK, used to go 
through and search through a 

4501
06:23:00,261 --> 06:23:02,496
bunch of tweets and blog posts, 
white papers, you have to scour 

4502
06:23:02,698 --> 06:23:07,377
the Internet to try to figure 
out what is going on  here. So, 

4503
06:23:07,578 --> 06:23:10,773
I will start at the beginning of
the program, like I said, I have

4504
06:23:10,965 --> 06:23:18,343
worked in MasterCard for around 
7 years in different areas, we 

4505
06:23:18,544 --> 06:23:23,214
spent a fair amount of money on 
information security, we have 

4506
06:23:23,630 --> 06:23:26,063
some perimeter defenses, we have
a bunch of agents going around, 

4507
06:23:26,264 --> 06:23:30,932
all of the logging is 
centralized, there is 

4508
06:23:31,133 --> 06:23:33,133
well-thought-out architecture 
and policy and we worked really 

4509
06:23:33,163 --> 06:23:36,830
hard to keep up with patching 
and new vulnerabilities, I 

4510
06:23:37,031 --> 06:23:41,086
thought we are in a pretty good 
spot going through, we work hard

4511
06:23:41,301 --> 06:23:49,571
and we do all this good stuff. 
Then I went to my first Defcon.

4512
06:23:54,292 --> 06:23:56,327
And it was an amazing talk, he 
had found vulnerabilities inside

4513
06:23:56,527 --> 06:23:59,483
common wireless mice and 
keyboards, he could do this from

4514
06:23:59,980 --> 06:24:01,980
200 meters away.

4515
06:24:05,867 --> 06:24:07,867
And, he could essentially do 
anything he wanted to your 

4516
06:24:07,901 --> 06:24:10,336
computer if you are using one of
those mice or keyboards. So he 

4517
06:24:10,551 --> 06:24:13,288
did what any would do, he 
created

4518
06:24:16,842 --> 06:24:19,077
a small Nintendo remote and he 
proceeded to mess with all the 

4519
06:24:19,838 --> 06:24:22,931
other presenters and the next 
year, he came and talked about 

4520
06:24:23,144 --> 06:24:26,797
it and showed everybody. 
Unfortunately, even after he 

4521
06:24:26,998 --> 06:24:28,998
reported a lot of these 
vulnerabilities, because of the 

4522
06:24:29,392 --> 06:24:32,995
nature of those mice and 
keyboards, they are untouchable

4523
06:24:40,405 --> 06:24:42,837
so if you go watch that talk, 
you could probably still do this

4524
06:24:43,051 --> 06:24:45,285
to a lot of people today. It was
really interesting. I thought 

4525
06:24:45,486 --> 06:24:47,519
about this and I'm going, I 
don't have a good defense 

4526
06:24:47,720 --> 06:24:49,754
against this with all the money 
we are spending and everything 

4527
06:24:49,956 --> 06:24:52,387
we are doing, I can't detect 
this, I would hope one of our 

4528
06:24:52,587 --> 06:24:56,655
other layers would, maybe a 
proxy might block it. But, if I 

4529
06:24:56,855 --> 06:24:58,889
have this much control, I can 
literally write the malware on 

4530
06:24:59,089 --> 06:25:04,775
your computer with the 
keystrokes with the script. So 

4531
06:25:04,975 --> 06:25:07,827
it blew me away and it changed a
lot of my worldview. Then I saw 

4532
06:25:08,029 --> 06:25:13,111
about 20 more talks after that 
that scared me just as much. So,

4533
06:25:13,313 --> 06:25:15,313
I came back

4534
06:25:19,602 --> 06:25:22,252
and I just thought, we got to 
figure out, how can I do more? 

4535
06:25:22,452 --> 06:25:26,263
How can we figure out how to be 
more secure? So, everybody has 

4536
06:25:26,429 --> 06:25:31,791
heard that old saying, dress for
the job you want, not for the 

4537
06:25:31,992 --> 06:25:35,859
job you have, so I love this 
cartoon, you see the boss, he's 

4538
06:25:36,061 --> 06:25:40,932
putting up the sign, and 
everybody comes in wearing 

4539
06:25:41,133 --> 06:25:48,453
superhero outfits and Darth 
Vader and I'm not as big of a 

4540
06:25:48,653 --> 06:25:52,815
fan for dress for the job you 
want but I am a big fan of

4541
06:26:00,845 --> 06:26:02,877
in my experience, doing the job 
you want that will eventually 

4542
06:26:03,078 --> 06:26:05,311
turn into that becoming your 
job. I will give you an example,

4543
06:26:05,511 --> 06:26:07,948
when I was in college, I worked 
for very small dealership and I 

4544
06:26:08,148 --> 06:26:10,596
was a chemistry major in 
college. All I was doing all day

4545
06:26:11,356 --> 06:26:13,356
was scanning

4546
06:26:16,080 --> 06:26:18,101
literature, they were in the 
process of making it so the 

4547
06:26:18,313 --> 06:26:20,345
salesman didn't have to carry 
around a briefcase that was this

4548
06:26:20,547 --> 06:26:22,779
big. So I started realizing a 
lot of these other people are 

4549
06:26:22,980 --> 06:26:24,946
having problems on their 
computer, just little 

4550
06:26:24,947 --> 06:26:27,046
troubleshooting problems and I 
started troubleshooting those I 

4551
06:26:27,247 --> 06:26:29,681
started dealing with network 
problems and it eventually 

4552
06:26:30,096 --> 06:26:36,180
turned into, I learned ASP.net 
and I was doing there entire 

4553
06:26:36,394 --> 06:26:39,993
website. This turned into a job 
and they essentially didn't 

4554
06:26:40,147 --> 06:26:43,498
realize they needed at that 
time, when I left, they had to 

4555
06:26:44,259 --> 06:26:46,259
replace me.

4556
06:26:49,185 --> 06:26:51,623
It also changed the course of my
career because I stopped being a

4557
06:26:51,819 --> 06:26:54,056
chemistry major and I started 
looking into computers. So, this

4558
06:26:54,268 --> 06:26:58,056
is what I did, I came back from 
Defcon

4559
06:27:03,206 --> 06:27:05,226
and I thought, we've got to do 
more. So I started 

4560
06:27:05,440 --> 06:27:07,461
brainstorming. How can we do 
this? How can we provide more 

4561
06:27:07,675 --> 06:27:09,675
security for our business and 
for our team?

4562
06:28:09,526 --> 06:28:12,357
-- It was real slow so we are 
doing it from one server that we

4563
06:28:12,570 --> 06:28:17,989
had were dropping executables 
for tools and it was slow. It 

4564
06:28:18,131 --> 06:28:24,343
was real in efficient. At the 
same time we are still 

4565
06:28:24,556 --> 06:28:29,988
moderately successful and we 
found Tom -- a lot of adware but

4566
06:28:31,253 --> 06:28:33,921
I don't necessarily want that on
the workstations but we found 

4567
06:28:34,304 --> 06:28:39,587
two rants and that was pretty 
amazing. To prevent infections 

4568
06:28:39,788 --> 06:28:42,560
would have sat there without the
program so I thought we were 

4569
06:28:42,708 --> 06:28:46,694
doing a pretty good job and I 
like this. I felt pretty 

4570
06:28:46,895 --> 06:28:52,125
successful so I met with a few 
team members and we decided we 

4571
06:28:52,269 --> 06:28:54,269
should

4572
06:28:57,251 --> 06:28:59,485
make a pitch to management and 
should do this full-time if we 

4573
06:28:59,685 --> 06:29:01,718
are getting this much success 
which is something that we are 

4574
06:29:01,919 --> 06:29:03,919
doing behind-the-scenes. Take it
further and see what they say. 

4575
06:29:03,950 --> 06:29:08,016
And so we set up a meeting with 
our vice president and created a

4576
06:29:08,778 --> 06:29:12,510
roadmap and mission statement 
and all these things and 

4577
06:29:12,684 --> 06:29:16,549
essentially a five-year plan. 
Sat down with them and they 

4578
06:29:16,750 --> 06:29:18,750
really liked it and

4579
06:29:25,485 --> 06:29:28,335
they said I will take this to my
management so we took it up and 

4580
06:29:28,536 --> 06:29:30,971
they also had good things to say
but then they came back and 

4581
06:29:31,171 --> 06:29:33,617
said, we don't have a lot of 
budget and there's a lot of 

4582
06:29:33,817 --> 06:29:36,399
people asking for extra 
headcount and that is the way it

4583
06:29:36,544 --> 06:29:40,857
goes. They said that we will do 
this for you and we will give 

4584
06:29:41,005 --> 06:29:46,005
you extra resources but we will 
give you time and like I 

4585
06:29:46,407 --> 06:29:50,071
mentioned earlier I'm from 
Missouri and does anyone know 

4586
06:29:50,271 --> 06:29:55,956
the Missouri state model? Yes 
the show me state. And that's 

4587
06:29:56,157 --> 06:30:02,860
what they said. Show me this is 
worth a full team time and they 

4588
06:30:03,060 --> 06:30:09,163
said we would give it time but I
want to see more. So that is 

4589
06:30:09,363 --> 06:30:17,888
what we did. And unfortunately 
it dawned on me that oh no, now 

4590
06:30:18,101 --> 06:30:20,336
they know about this and we had 
to perform. When they are 

4591
06:30:20,535 --> 06:30:25,819
watching and expecting things. 
So I came back and decided 

4592
06:30:26,020 --> 06:30:33,940
first, as everyone knows nothing
stays static for long. Doing 

4593
06:30:34,140 --> 06:30:36,172
these things over and over 
doesn't help so I decided we 

4594
06:30:36,372 --> 06:30:39,020
have to make a new program and 
scratch what we're doing and 

4595
06:30:39,221 --> 06:30:44,044
it's not really efficient and 
not going to finding new things.

4596
06:30:49,371 --> 06:30:53,038
And I have to do that with 20% 
of a person so they gave me one 

4597
06:30:53,239 --> 06:30:57,711
day a week to spend on it of 
course whether job was older and

4598
06:30:57,912 --> 06:31:01,240
it wasn't always one day a week 
so we had to do that with the

4599
06:31:06,032 --> 06:31:11,516
[ Inaudible ]. The first thing I
thought were realized that being

4600
06:31:12,267 --> 06:31:17,415
1000 host within one we have to 
make this efficient and in the 

4601
06:31:17,616 --> 06:31:22,125
process of rolling out more 
reloading for admin team and 

4602
06:31:22,489 --> 06:31:29,554
that was the avenue I took to 
start looking at this. We 

4603
06:31:29,701 --> 06:31:33,863
started, I don't know how many 
people are familiar with [ 

4604
06:31:34,625 --> 06:31:39,500
Inaudible ] response framework 
but I'm currently using a very 

4605
06:31:39,643 --> 06:31:45,029
heavily modified version of cons
and and it is not necessarily 

4606
06:31:45,243 --> 06:31:47,966
important the important part is 
to use the advantages of

4607
06:31:52,547 --> 06:31:54,547
reloading. We can do parallel 
processing and reach out to 

4608
06:31:54,581 --> 06:31:56,616
multiple hosts at once and use 
their resources instead of ours.

4609
06:31:56,817 --> 06:32:01,547
Also because we were using power
shall, I went from deploying 

4610
06:32:01,692 --> 06:32:07,986
executables or deploying other 
people's tools and now I have 

4611
06:32:08,189 --> 06:32:10,835
the freedom to run my own and I 
can pull just about anything I 

4612
06:32:11,036 --> 06:32:14,084
want. Which is great but it also
goes back to I have to do 

4613
06:32:14,285 --> 06:32:17,337
research and how do I figure out
what I want to pull? There's all

4614
06:32:17,538 --> 06:32:19,538
type of stuff

4615
06:32:23,423 --> 06:32:25,858
is too much to and will be in 
real trouble because only one 

4616
06:32:26,070 --> 06:32:30,125
person is looking through it 
right now. That is when a found 

4617
06:32:30,891 --> 06:32:38,201
a tack. -- Technician. Because 
other frameworks stopped at 

4618
06:32:38,344 --> 06:32:40,769
techniques or stopped at

4619
06:32:46,589 --> 06:32:48,820
tactics and so I need something 
deeper and more specific and we 

4620
06:32:49,021 --> 06:32:51,655
started using a tack with those 
where it goes I built out the 

4621
06:32:51,856 --> 06:32:58,362
framework, I could write three 
or four lines with code in a 

4622
06:32:58,562 --> 06:33:03,030
power show module and pullback 
information I could use on a 

4623
06:33:03,231 --> 06:33:06,439
technique and have to do it all 
at once but do it piece by 

4624
06:33:06,586 --> 06:33:12,173
piece. And I actually mainly 
focused on the gaps because I 

4625
06:33:12,373 --> 06:33:16,642
knew I worked in IR and I knew 
where the gaps were in 

4626
06:33:16,843 --> 06:33:19,827
constantly where we can see in 
this was also we were fixing the

4627
06:33:19,972 --> 06:33:21,972
butt

4628
06:33:24,977 --> 06:33:26,977
in a large organization there's 
change control and process built

4629
06:33:26,998 --> 06:33:30,462
around infrastructure and it 
takes time. A lot of times you 

4630
06:33:30,665 --> 06:33:32,896
know about those gaps four 
months before you can get a fix 

4631
06:33:33,096 --> 06:33:36,748
on in this way we could take 
this and write a few lines and 

4632
06:33:36,964 --> 06:33:40,614
cover that attack pretty much 
enterprise or that technique 

4633
06:33:41,014 --> 06:33:46,912
pretty much enterprisewide. The 
greatest thing since this was 

4634
06:33:47,113 --> 06:33:50,365
there an easy I can do it at 
scale and push it out to 

4635
06:33:50,564 --> 06:33:53,412
everyone and all of a sudden we 
are covered as opposed to the 

4636
06:33:53,614 --> 06:34:00,518
point of hardware or even an 
agent can be rough because have 

4637
06:34:00,719 --> 06:34:02,745
to go through testing and 
everything else in this was 

4638
06:34:02,895 --> 06:34:07,633
great because I'm minimally 
invasive, I pull the data and we

4639
06:34:07,831 --> 06:34:11,481
will see what the next time we 
come but resource cost which is 

4640
06:34:11,695 --> 06:34:14,733
the most important thing for me 
because I had to do my other job

4641
06:34:14,946 --> 06:34:19,615
and had to somehow accomplish 
this and attack was the reason 

4642
06:34:20,016 --> 06:34:26,114
we were able to do this because 
of the essentially resource cost

4643
06:34:26,316 --> 06:34:28,346
from us to the rest of the 
community and everyone creating 

4644
06:34:28,548 --> 06:34:34,035
these. It was a great as far as 
I was concerned a great switch. 

4645
06:34:34,436 --> 06:34:37,487
The other great thing was it 
covers [ Inaudible ] and so far 

4646
06:34:37,688 --> 06:34:41,142
I talked about Windows but that 
was not our goal and we wanted 

4647
06:34:41,343 --> 06:34:46,430
to expand this to the -- our own
environment and I will tell you,

4648
06:34:47,190 --> 06:34:55,356
I find with Lenexa not a big Mac
guy so having these actual 

4649
06:34:55,569 --> 06:34:57,603
techniques out there where I can
read them and understand and 

4650
06:34:57,803 --> 06:35:00,841
compare to other techniques, it 
might be more familiar and it 

4651
06:35:01,607 --> 06:35:09,936
was great.
>> This was phase 2 after 

4652
06:35:10,082 --> 06:35:12,082
attack.

4653
06:35:16,280 --> 06:35:18,727
And there are some things that 
we kept going strong and I still

4654
06:35:19,488 --> 06:35:23,597
run monthly stents but instill 
of going to 1000 host, I now 

4655
06:35:23,798 --> 06:35:27,404
collect data from 30,000 host. 
Windows and Maxon we have the 

4656
06:35:27,544 --> 06:35:30,455
unexcited in production right 
now. And

4657
06:35:33,951 --> 06:35:36,600
it is my goal for this hoping to
be able to hit the entire 

4658
06:35:36,801 --> 06:35:40,200
environment and slowly continue 
to add more and more techniques.

4659
06:35:42,090 --> 06:35:45,481
I will tell you right now that I
think we are at 31 techniques 

4660
06:35:45,627 --> 06:35:51,220
but proved this out where I have
had help. We have more people 

4661
06:35:51,421 --> 06:35:56,103
helping me and expanding those 
all the time and there is a lot 

4662
06:35:56,504 --> 06:36:01,575
of [ Inaudible ] and adversaries
and then going to take that back

4663
06:36:01,789 --> 06:36:06,861
and probably do more research to
the point where maybe we start 

4664
06:36:07,262 --> 06:36:09,262
looking at specific adversaries 
that are targeting us but I've 

4665
06:36:09,295 --> 06:36:13,977
been trying to fill the gaps 
that we know about and mainly 

4666
06:36:14,178 --> 06:36:17,429
that we have a solution in place
where we are months away in this

4667
06:36:17,630 --> 06:36:21,079
way I can fill that and go back 
and say that we have litigation 

4668
06:36:21,494 --> 06:36:25,092
and by some time until we get a 
minute that might be a little 

4669
06:36:25,238 --> 06:36:32,999
better and what's also nice 
about this is I am from one 

4670
06:36:33,146 --> 06:36:37,733
server in the plan is to get 
this closer and closer to 

4671
06:36:38,147 --> 06:36:46,473
hitting the entire environment 
in a week or so. The other nice 

4672
06:36:46,873 --> 06:36:49,107
step is we've been responsible 
for finding 15% of [ Inaudible ]

4673
06:36:49,320 --> 06:36:53,530
and no longer the low risk and 
where click fraud. We've been 

4674
06:36:53,672 --> 06:36:57,241
finding real things that are 
concerning witches even a little

4675
06:36:57,442 --> 06:37:03,126
more frustrating to me then come
back to my team where it's more 

4676
06:37:03,327 --> 06:37:08,813
sophistication and less time to 
work on this. The other great 

4677
06:37:09,014 --> 06:37:17,038
thing about this is it has 
helped the [ Inaudible ]

4678
06:37:20,194 --> 06:37:23,924
what is great about this that 
they go from manually looking at

4679
06:37:24,662 --> 06:37:28,312
a workstation or server after an
Olympic and pullback information

4680
06:37:28,513 --> 06:37:32,379
automatically and it also gets 
the analysts that don't have the

4681
06:37:33,139 --> 06:37:37,864
more experienced or less 
expensive they start asking why 

4682
06:37:38,065 --> 06:37:41,449
are you looking at this and why 
is this part important and we 

4683
06:37:41,595 --> 06:37:47,416
crews -- we increase the time it
takes to train stock analyst 

4684
06:37:47,617 --> 06:37:52,488
because they can use tools to 
re-create points on areas that 

4685
06:37:52,690 --> 06:37:54,723
they can look at in the 
investigation and it is great 

4686
06:37:54,930 --> 06:37:59,138
for them and they have these 
tools now where they can do it 

4687
06:37:59,281 --> 06:38:01,281
quickly. 
>>

4688
06:38:07,728 --> 06:38:10,766
I wish I could come out and say 
that I now have run a team but 

4689
06:38:11,528 --> 06:38:17,066
we are not there yet and I'm 
still proving this out and we 

4690
06:38:17,267 --> 06:38:21,536
were a little late to the game. 
I started the phase 2 around 

4691
06:38:21,737 --> 06:38:28,239
January of this year so we had 
time to get stats but still 

4692
06:38:28,440 --> 06:38:32,393
working at this and trying to 
get it going. I can also say

4693
06:38:36,158 --> 06:38:39,209
I would not have been able to do
this with the time that I had 

4694
06:38:39,410 --> 06:38:41,410
and not successful or attack

4695
06:38:44,694 --> 06:38:46,694
with the information provided 
that saved me so much time 

4696
06:38:46,715 --> 06:38:48,715
researching and so much time 
looking and improving out what 

4697
06:38:48,749 --> 06:38:52,415
was going on. 
>> And the last thing I want to 

4698
06:38:52,616 --> 06:38:57,605
hit on his with us using this we
can implement it slowly and pick

4699
06:38:58,450 --> 06:39:03,123
pieces and pick and choose what 
we are most worried about and go

4700
06:39:03,266 --> 06:39:05,266
through. 
>>

4701
06:39:07,841 --> 06:39:12,658
I think that is all I have. 
>> Does anyone have any 

4702
06:39:12,809 --> 06:39:14,809
questions? 
>>

4703
06:39:21,796 --> 06:39:28,366
You mentioned one of the future 
steps will be looking at 

4704
06:39:28,764 --> 06:39:32,016
industry specific for the 
techniques that you cover and 

4705
06:39:32,217 --> 06:39:34,664
I'm interested to know when you 
first started because some of us

4706
06:39:34,864 --> 06:39:40,750
are in the same spot, where did 
you start and what was the 

4707
06:39:40,950 --> 06:39:43,185
process because that is one of 
the stumbling points that I know

4708
06:39:43,398 --> 06:39:49,027
I find myself in like you I stay
up late and I didn't read.

4709
06:39:49,179 --> 06:39:56,122
>> I started because with 
espresso gaps so everyone that 

4710
06:39:56,264 --> 06:39:59,639
works insecurity knows where the
gaps are and trying to fill them

4711
06:39:59,852 --> 06:40:06,352
and I felt I was going into an 
area where I felt the worst gaps

4712
06:40:06,554 --> 06:40:10,406
were the biggest gaps and a lot 
of those are issues starting to 

4713
06:40:10,607 --> 06:40:17,110
come in place but not quick. It 
goes slow and I've looked at my 

4714
06:40:17,874 --> 06:40:23,612
program where the advantages 
adapting quicker than the 

4715
06:40:23,813 --> 06:40:26,460
business can and I will move on 
to the next thing as we provide 

4716
06:40:26,661 --> 06:40:28,661
coverage for those areas. 
>>

4717
06:40:40,470 --> 06:40:42,504
As much as from the attack came 
we appreciate seeing attack 

4718
06:40:43,264 --> 06:40:52,153
being the Superman in the Cape. 
You have seem to gone from zero 

4719
06:40:52,300 --> 06:40:55,703
to success and quickly and what 
was the biggest challenge in 

4720
06:40:55,904 --> 06:40:57,904
implementing the attack?
>>

4721
06:41:01,190 --> 06:41:06,670
This was a little easier because
I felt a lot of the challenge 

4722
06:41:06,885 --> 06:41:08,702
that other people have talked 
about is convincing everyone 

4723
06:41:08,704 --> 06:41:13,991
else since I was on my own and 
made it easier to train one but 

4724
06:41:14,192 --> 06:41:18,045
I think some of the challenge is
it is so vast and goes back to 

4725
06:41:18,461 --> 06:41:22,514
the previous question with 
picking a place to start and for

4726
06:41:22,715 --> 06:41:27,186
me it was decided there's no 
gaps in low hanging fruit and 

4727
06:41:27,400 --> 06:41:30,851
again because of resource issue,
these are easy for me to detect 

4728
06:41:31,052 --> 06:41:35,467
and so we move our father to 
ones that are harder to look at.

4729
06:41:37,497 --> 06:41:43,641
And it's great and detailed but 
scary when you take that first 

4730
06:41:44,405 --> 06:41:51,361
look and asking what do I do.
>> You're not alone. I feel we 

4731
06:41:51,563 --> 06:41:53,952
have heard that from many many 
others.

4732
06:41:54,097 --> 06:41:56,097
>>

4733
06:42:01,115 --> 06:42:08,630
I'm glad the other part is over.
>> Great first talk. Well done. 

4734
06:42:09,590 --> 06:42:14,265
You mentioned the ability for 
the treatment to go into the 

4735
06:42:14,415 --> 06:42:19,750
tool to see what to look for and
how is that documented and how 

4736
06:42:19,891 --> 06:42:22,943
are are they best able to go in 
and find out what

4737
06:42:26,708 --> 06:42:28,943
detection is for and why it is 
important and would you keep 

4738
06:42:29,704 --> 06:42:32,596
that data? 
>> Use an internal repository 

4739
06:42:33,357 --> 06:42:35,977
that works a lot like get hub.

4740
06:42:40,930 --> 06:42:43,165
An internal repository and put a
notation on there that I have 

4741
06:42:43,366 --> 06:42:45,600
two sets of scrubs and one does 
the data collection and another 

4742
06:42:45,801 --> 06:42:48,435
does more analysis and these 
analysis is uselessly because it

4743
06:42:48,637 --> 06:42:53,321
is mainly looking forward to 
goes since I have 30,000 homes 

4744
06:42:53,521 --> 06:43:00,013
to pull from it's easy to go on.
That is a lot of what it does 

4745
06:43:00,763 --> 06:43:04,435
but yes I write up in mainly a 
text file that I meet with them 

4746
06:43:04,618 --> 06:43:06,618
in

4747
06:43:09,765 --> 06:43:12,414
talk to them about it but it's a
text file on the repository and 

4748
06:43:12,616 --> 06:43:14,996
to make changes to the 
repository and they pulled it 

4749
06:43:15,186 --> 06:43:18,948
down.

4753
06:43:44,232 --> 06:43:48,163
having the testable finitude for
first public attack at tack and 

4754
06:43:48,365 --> 06:43:52,832
nothing quite like jumping to 
public speaking fire at one of 

4755
06:43:53,032 --> 06:43:55,467
the best conferences so far this
year so think you to Dawn cash

06:43:55,680 --> 06:43:59,935
thank you to Dawn -- thank you 
to Dawn.

dress for the job you want but 

4758
06:44:06,640 --> 06:44:08,672
do the job you want and people 
appreciate that. Neil Jenkins 

4759
06:44:08,873 --> 06:44:12,940
said the same thing saying Chris
lays it out and attack doesn't 

4760
06:44:13,140 --> 06:44:16,795
need to be complex, do the work 
you want to do and it will be 

4761
06:44:17,210 --> 06:44:21,879
your job. Neil says great job on
the first top from one

Welcome back and I am here with 
Ruth and [ Inaudible ] about 

4772
06:46:03,040 --> 06:46:05,040
building their [ Inaudible ]

4773
06:46:08,476 --> 06:46:13,595
>> Just want to note that we 
appreciate you coming out there 

4774
06:46:13,997 --> 06:46:16,030
all the way from Argentina and 
hopefully your travel was safe 

4775
06:46:16,783 --> 06:46:21,113
and comfortable. 
>> Yes. Twitter is living with 

4776
06:46:21,314 --> 06:46:25,380
feedback that you love there 
slide deck and call points and 

4777
06:46:25,581 --> 06:46:30,612
everyone loved that. Take away 
from your talk, want to start 

4778
06:46:30,795 --> 06:46:32,795
with

4779
06:46:35,538 --> 06:46:38,173
you took a tack and made it your
own and we appreciate that and 

4780
06:46:38,374 --> 06:46:41,020
not only did you make your own 
but also added to it and it 

4781
06:46:41,222 --> 06:46:43,656
could've to see that you made it
really something that you use in

4782
06:46:43,857 --> 06:46:46,093
the averment and the factor was 
the formula for data sources or 

4783
06:46:46,294 --> 06:46:47,926
intelligence sources. You 
actually push the challenge for 

4784
06:46:47,927 --> 06:46:53,703
any to say what are you doing 
with that? 

4785
06:46:53,705 --> 06:46:59,703
>> Ruth will explain.
>> We are using sources that we 

4786
06:47:00,466 --> 06:47:06,009
have challenges mainly with 
China and people usually [ 

4787
06:47:06,770 --> 06:47:13,313
Inaudible ] because of same 
tools and knowing that scoring [

4788
06:47:13,514 --> 06:47:16,875
Inaudible ] level for our 
efforts in using notable sources

4789
06:47:18,140 --> 06:47:24,081
and knowing everyone that ours 
writing those three parts can 

4790
06:47:24,695 --> 06:47:33,770
make those formula [ Inaudible ]
and you are in a different 

4791
06:47:33,953 --> 06:47:38,304
hemisphere and challenges that 
you deal with the CTA field 

4792
06:47:38,505 --> 06:47:43,587
especially Latin America? 
>> Yes not much of a maturity 

4793
06:47:43,788 --> 06:47:49,419
level and security we have a 
good team and the team members 

4794
06:47:49,566 --> 06:47:54,498
also give researchers more on 
attack Facebook there's not much

4795
06:47:54,681 --> 06:47:59,012
about [ Inaudible ] even when we
have great conference but also 

4796
06:47:59,763 --> 06:48:02,364
focus on everything in the 
attack part and

4797
06:48:08,564 --> 06:48:11,559
it's something that you need to 
defend yourself.

4798
06:48:11,703 --> 06:48:13,703
>>

4799
06:48:17,498 --> 06:48:24,616
There are organizations [ 
Inaudible ] and that is one of 

4800
06:48:25,217 --> 06:48:31,716
the main things [ Inaudible ]
>> Any ideas what to pitch to 

4801
06:48:31,930 --> 06:48:35,581
the communities about making 
change happening? To address 

4802
06:48:35,782 --> 06:48:41,763
these maturities and the team in
the field and I think I'm hoping

4803
06:48:42,895 --> 06:48:49,195
[ Inaudible ] and realize how 
important and how we can apply 

4804
06:48:49,396 --> 06:48:55,730
to a lot of defense methods and 
practice and attack and improve 

4805
06:48:56,450 --> 06:49:01,789
the [ Inaudible ] of the company
but I think in here people is 

4806
06:49:02,551 --> 06:49:07,264
more way just more aware of [ 
Inaudible ] and it's hard in the

4807
06:49:07,465 --> 06:49:14,384
market needs to realize on its 
own something that it's needing 

4808
06:49:14,585 --> 06:49:16,585
to be done. 
>>

4809
06:49:22,302 --> 06:49:24,738
How they can work together and 
talk about the same things in I 

4810
06:49:24,938 --> 06:49:29,406
think one of the things you 
heard was can build something 

4811
06:49:29,606 --> 06:49:33,071
and they will come in love it 
and learn and the committee so 

4812
06:49:33,271 --> 06:49:40,172
something it takes section of 
something with more success and 

4813
06:49:40,587 --> 06:49:45,657
a personal question was CTI 
experts obviously I think a lot 

4814
06:49:45,859 --> 06:49:49,725
of the things that talk happened
CTI focus and what do you think 

4815
06:49:49,925 --> 06:49:53,122
about trends with automation and
data sharing?

4816
06:49:53,307 --> 06:50:01,916
>> We have seen great [ 
Inaudible ] that automate the [ 

4817
06:50:02,116 --> 06:50:04,552
Inaudible ] process and those 
are great and I like those and I

4818
06:50:04,753 --> 06:50:09,636
think they give and make the 
framework go one step further 

4819
06:50:09,836 --> 06:50:15,106
because it's not only about 
analyzing but doing something 

4820
06:50:15,320 --> 06:50:18,971
practical so I think I really 
like this.

4821
06:50:19,116 --> 06:50:27,028
>> It's important trend with and
truly should be that way so you 

4822
06:50:27,176 --> 06:50:29,327
need people to check the 
information that you see [ 

4823
06:50:29,528 --> 06:50:35,565
Inaudible ] of [ Inaudible ] 
thing so you can use this 

4824
06:50:35,749 --> 06:50:40,859
product.
>> The I [ Inaudible ] replace

4826
06:50:45,584 --> 06:50:50,053
>> The automation talks [ 
Inaudible ] won't lose sight of 

4827
06:50:50,254 --> 06:50:55,123
those true crafts but can't 
replicate and no way to put that

4828
06:50:55,337 --> 06:51:02,445
in the computer and test it. And
[ Inaudible ] still that we are 

4829
06:51:02,645 --> 06:51:09,953
trying to use this and willing 
to train all the missions and 

4830
06:51:10,369 --> 06:51:12,369
working on those. 
>>

4831
06:51:16,661 --> 06:51:18,584
Out of curiosity, how do you 
recognize those?

>>

4833
06:51:28,646 --> 06:51:32,916
I was working on [ Inaudible ] 
in India and they are doing the 

4834
06:51:33,676 --> 06:51:38,591
same so they are trying to use 
the same [ Inaudible ] that [ 

4835
06:51:38,803 --> 06:51:41,793
Indiscernible - accent speaker ]
and it's interesting because if 

4836
06:51:41,941 --> 06:51:47,538
you have to understand where [ 
Inaudible ] why they are doing 

4837
06:51:47,738 --> 06:51:50,384
those and then you can 21 but 
not the same that they are using

4838
06:51:51,147 --> 06:51:55,257
the same.
>> It is harder when the 

4839
06:51:56,016 --> 06:51:59,515
adversary understands [ 
Inaudible ] it is challenging. 

4840
06:51:59,929 --> 06:52:02,968
Speaking of the school, 
something that I want to circle 

4841
06:52:03,180 --> 06:52:06,016
back to as we talked about new 
people wanting to enter the 

4842
06:52:06,778 --> 06:52:11,099
field and pushing a lot in the 
community that we need more help

4843
06:52:11,300 --> 06:52:15,570
in talent and skill and smart to
look at holders and any advice 

4844
06:52:15,771 --> 06:52:17,771
wanting to enter the field like 
someone watching right now 

4845
06:52:17,804 --> 06:52:20,162
saying this is exciting I love 
what they are doing. 

4846
06:52:20,163 --> 06:52:28,369
>> We struggle a little bit with
[ Inaudible ] CTA team has to be

4847
06:52:29,136 --> 06:52:33,639
an engineer and that is not 
true, it can be problematic and 

4848
06:52:33,841 --> 06:52:36,235
we need people from different 
backgrounds. Some of the tasks 

4849
06:52:36,385 --> 06:52:42,789
are dealing with [ Inaudible ] 
background and that is a one 

4850
06:52:42,989 --> 06:52:49,239
thing and I think for candidates
we look or curiosity and people 

4851
06:52:49,384 --> 06:52:56,954
that read the news and not only 
[ Inaudible ]

4852
06:52:57,095 --> 06:53:02,281
>> But research for people that 
want to do that because they 

4853
06:53:03,031 --> 06:53:08,936
like it. I think that is 
important. The passion.

4854
06:53:09,079 --> 06:53:12,118
>> One thing I took away from 
the talk

4855
06:53:15,688 --> 06:53:18,337
was a level settings and this is
going to be perfect and this is 

4856
06:53:18,537 --> 06:53:21,373
what it is and we work with them
and improve later on I think we 

4857
06:53:21,588 --> 06:53:23,608
are running on time and I 
appreciate your time. I hope 

4858
06:53:23,822 --> 06:53:25,381
this is a great expense for you 
both.

4865

COMFORTABLE COUCH. BEFORE I CAME
FROM TECHNICAL AND I HAVE AN 

4866
06:55:56,219 --> 06:55:58,219
INTERESTING QUESTION.

4867
06:56:01,890 --> 06:56:07,486
>> I love the cartoons. 
>> Yes, our intelligence team is

4868
06:56:07,702 --> 06:56:09,702
the team that

4869
06:56:12,954 --> 06:56:15,141
gets to run with naming the 
adversaries and sometimes we get

4870
06:56:15,357 --> 06:56:17,982
to contribute to that but they 
are the ones that get to do 

4871
06:56:18,205 --> 06:56:21,489
that. I can't take credit for 
any of the names. I hope that 

4872
06:56:21,705 --> 06:56:28,264
someday I will have enough sway 
with to convince them to do 

4873
06:56:28,487 --> 06:56:30,341
this. 
>> Have you done any?

>> I think that is a great name.

4876
06:56:41,828 --> 06:56:44,765
No complaints. 
>> Adding to your talk, one 

4877
06:56:44,927 --> 06:56:49,702
thing with this, you had an 
interesting perspective on this.

4878
06:56:49,926 --> 06:56:58,457
What is unique is that you are 
not parsing reporting that you 

4879
06:56:58,890 --> 06:57:03,484
are parsing telemetry. 
>> Do you want to speak about 

4880
06:57:03,701 --> 06:57:07,641
the opportunities and challenges
with parsing the data and trying

4881
06:57:07,858 --> 06:57:10,923
to automate the mapping process?
>> It's not easy by any means 

4882
06:57:11,140 --> 06:57:13,768
because there is so much 
variance that can happen. There 

4883
06:57:13,984 --> 06:57:22,515
is so much data. In some sent, 
we have been able to find a way 

4884
06:57:22,737 --> 06:57:26,452
to automate this. The ways we 
have gone about using the 

4885
06:57:26,675 --> 06:57:31,047
detections and patterns that we 
are looking for has so far been 

4886
06:57:31,264 --> 06:57:34,987
the most effective solution we 
have down. I view this as, we 

4887
06:57:35,748 --> 06:57:40,023
are in an extremely leveraged 
position because we have a lot 

4888
06:57:40,783 --> 06:57:44,170
of telemetry to analyze. A lot 
of people in the industry are 

4889
06:57:44,393 --> 06:57:48,550
looking in their own inefficient
and we have privileged you being

4890
06:57:48,767 --> 06:57:51,394
able to see a wide scope across 
the globe about this intrusion 

4891
06:57:52,155 --> 06:57:55,363
activity. That in and of itself 
makes me grateful. 

4892
06:57:55,365 --> 06:58:01,292
>> Trying to map it all and 
automating as much as possible.

4893
06:58:06,705 --> 06:58:08,451
There will be some of the manual
process. 

4894
06:58:08,452 --> 06:58:11,080
>> It seems like a pendulum off,
you want more data enemy wants 

4895
06:58:11,297 --> 06:58:13,267
to much. The learning curve. 
>> Yes, for sure. 

4896
06:58:13,268 --> 06:58:15,889
>> One of the points, like you 
said, you are in an interesting 

4897
06:58:16,329 --> 06:58:18,956
position. One key point that 
we've seen is shearing. You have

4898
06:58:19,716 --> 06:58:24,862
that perspective and you have 
learned lessons and you skillet 

4899
06:58:25,079 --> 06:58:27,921
and you learn from the scaling 
of the data. For those out there

4900
06:58:28,145 --> 06:58:30,145
in the sharing well, how would 
you

4901
06:58:33,391 --> 06:58:35,391
pitch people on building a 
community so we can take 

4902
06:58:35,577 --> 06:58:37,106
advantage of what you are 
seeing? 

4903
06:58:37,107 --> 06:58:42,577
>> The biggest challenge with 
data sharing is the production 

4904
06:58:42,800 --> 06:58:45,420
of information specific to the 
customer. That's the biggest 

4905
06:58:45,644 --> 06:58:49,907
challenge because when you think
about it, if the company was 

4906
06:58:50,127 --> 06:58:53,517
breached they would release 
information about that to the 

4907
06:58:53,733 --> 06:58:57,232
public. It might affect many 
different things and it would be

4908
06:58:57,456 --> 06:58:59,857
out of control. Making sure that
you can get this information and

4909
06:59:00,082 --> 06:59:03,577
have a common primer to share 
the information in between the 

4910
06:59:04,344 --> 06:59:09,050
parties is crucial and I think 
that is one of the biggest 

4911
06:59:09,264 --> 06:59:11,451
challenges of why some companies
hold back and why some people 

4912
06:59:11,674 --> 06:59:15,171
hold back because they don't 
want to put the customers that 

4913
06:59:15,388 --> 06:59:17,388
trusted them as trusted partners
to release the information to 

4914
06:59:17,581 --> 06:59:20,206
the public. 
>> That is a challenge by 

4915
06:59:20,968 --> 06:59:25,018
itself. 
>> That is a challenge. One of 

4916
06:59:25,234 --> 06:59:27,644
the themes for the afternoon has
been context. Sort of a 

4917
06:59:28,407 --> 06:59:31,783
double-edged sword. Reduction in
sensitivity and respecting 

4918
06:59:32,015 --> 06:59:37,047
whoever the data owner is versus
the context, being able to paint

4919
06:59:37,263 --> 06:59:44,921
the full picture. That is 
something where the insets, the 

4920
06:59:45,144 --> 06:59:46,998
insights -- finding the perfect 
balance. 

4921
06:59:46,999 --> 06:59:48,999
>> Yes,

4922
06:59:50,608 --> 06:59:52,608
we have considered how to 
automate some redaction. If we 

4923
06:59:52,801 --> 06:59:55,207
want to share it has to be 
redacted. That is something that

4924
06:59:55,422 --> 06:59:57,828
is essential and we are the 
custodians of the data on behalf

4925
06:59:58,046 --> 07:00:01,168
of our customers and we cannot 
take the risk of exposing some 

4926
07:00:01,335 --> 07:00:08,550
of the more detailed telemetry. 
It is a huge risk to share the 

4927
07:00:08,766 --> 07:00:14,547
level of detail. So, that's why 
we've had to -- we can't share 

4928
07:00:14,715 --> 07:00:18,391
everything. There is no way to 
sanitize enough effectively to 

4929
07:00:18,608 --> 07:00:24,515
share that whitening. We select 
what is potentially the most 

4930
07:00:24,732 --> 07:00:29,327
impactful or the most useful 
content from our findings to 

4931
07:00:29,550 --> 07:00:34,467
share and that is what goes into
this. That goes through a heavy 

4932
07:00:34,631 --> 07:00:39,609
redaction verification review 
process. There is no way to do 

4933
07:00:39,832 --> 07:00:44,098
that for everything. 
>> Managing resources. 

4934
07:00:44,099 --> 07:00:51,857
>> Speaking of the media report,
one interesting thing I saw from

4935
07:00:52,081 --> 07:00:54,081
your example was there are some 
new techniques. Some clipboard 

4936
07:00:54,268 --> 07:00:57,655
data that you don't see often. 
Also oldies and goodies. There 

4937
07:00:57,822 --> 07:01:01,705
is interface and the power show.
How do you balance not jumping 

4938
07:01:01,921 --> 07:01:06,388
on the new thing versus getting 
really good at the old 

4939
07:01:06,553 --> 07:01:08,976
techniques that every adversary 
uses? 

4940
07:01:08,977 --> 07:01:14,155
>> I think that is the biggest 
challenge. The cool thing about 

4941
07:01:14,389 --> 07:01:18,110
our team is the fact that, there
are many different people with 

4942
07:01:18,327 --> 07:01:22,701
many different backgrounds a 
different perspective. Also 

4943
07:01:23,685 --> 07:01:26,641
thinking about what is 
interesting and what you don't 

4944
07:01:27,406 --> 07:01:29,485
care about. We bring many 
different perspectives to the 

4945
07:01:29,701 --> 07:01:32,639
table and when we rainstorm 
about this, what is unique and 

4946
07:01:32,805 --> 07:01:36,923
different, it allows us to have 
many different perspectives and 

4947
07:01:37,686 --> 07:01:41,295
I will put this together and it 
becomes what we have. For this 

4948
07:01:41,519 --> 07:01:45,218
report or this particular thing 
we have never seen this before. 

4949
07:01:45,452 --> 07:01:51,467
We have never seen them doing 
this they could change the 

4950
07:01:51,632 --> 07:01:55,082
behavior. We look for those 
developing needs or something 

4951
07:01:55,298 --> 07:01:57,485
that was not discussed in the 
open source or it wasn't 

4952
07:01:57,701 --> 07:02:00,767
discussed in the public before. 
Like I said, I think everyone 

4953
07:02:00,983 --> 07:02:07,109
has a bias to what they find 
interesting and we try to we've 

4954
07:02:07,332 --> 07:02:10,608
been in and make sure that 
everybody can understand this 

4955
07:02:10,832 --> 07:02:13,457
and we decide between ourselves 
as a team what will be put 

4956
07:02:14,216 --> 07:02:17,831
forward. 
>> Absolutely. We will just 

4957
07:02:18,047 --> 07:02:20,233
talking about that. Unless you 
have perfect did you will be 

4958
07:02:20,457 --> 07:02:22,644
biased. We are in a constant 
battle to overcome biases. One 

4959
07:02:23,408 --> 07:02:29,203
question is, I don't know if you
saw the talk earlier this 

4960
07:02:29,878 --> 07:02:31,878
morning but this is going to be 
how these different plant forms 

4961
07:02:32,051 --> 07:02:34,235
coming up. For challenges and 
opportunities do you see as we 

4962
07:02:34,452 --> 07:02:37,188
approach these new domains we've
never done before, especially 

4963
07:02:37,354 --> 07:02:43,076
with your scale and visibility? 
>> The aspect of the changes are

4964
07:02:43,246 --> 07:02:47,795
coming, I can probably only 
speak for myself but I look 

4965
07:02:48,019 --> 07:02:53,046
forward to the introduction of 
the sub techniques. This is an 

4966
07:02:54,020 --> 07:02:59,829
important angle that needs to be
built in. To give the additional

4967
07:03:00,046 --> 07:03:03,546
layer of fidelity understanding 
what the adversaries are doing. 

4968
07:03:03,985 --> 07:03:07,044
Categorically it makes more 
sense to have the additional 

4969
07:03:07,267 --> 07:03:09,548
layer and that will help us 
communicate things more 

4970
07:03:09,719 --> 07:03:16,236
effectively. Also for the pros 
and cons, the reality is that a 

4971
07:03:16,453 --> 07:03:24,765
number of vendors use the ATT&CK
framework to validate visibility

4972
07:03:24,982 --> 07:03:26,982
into threatened detection 
capabilities. I think the 

4973
07:03:27,060 --> 07:03:36,358
additional layer is a great 
addition for vendors, for 

4974
07:03:36,582 --> 07:03:39,748
security defenders to recognize 
that when this product is 

4975
07:03:39,914 --> 07:03:45,986
capable of, say it is capable of
identifying this technique now 

4976
07:03:46,202 --> 07:03:48,935
you can say, there is a lot of 
implementations of that 

4977
07:03:49,096 --> 07:03:51,096
technique.

4978
07:03:52,984 --> 07:03:55,612
Now it is sub techniques and we 
will be able to make more 

4979
07:03:55,829 --> 07:03:57,141
informed decisions on defensive 
capabilities, essentially. 

4980
07:03:57,142 --> 07:04:00,200
>> Yes, that is great. 
>> One of the main takeaways, 

4981
07:04:00,640 --> 07:04:03,707
visually I remember the 
navigator layer with the most 

4982
07:04:04,139 --> 07:04:08,293
common techniques. It was how 
dark it was. Once we can break 

4983
07:04:09,045 --> 07:04:14,954
this out we can get a granular 
layer. What do you mean by that?

4984
07:04:15,123 --> 07:04:19,071
>> Thank you for your time. 
>> Thank you. 

4985
07:04:19,072 --> 07:04:25,357
>> We are on Attackcon.  We will
transition to the next guest, 

4986
07:04:25,581 --> 07:04:28,913
Chris Thayer.  We will be back 
momentarily. 

4987
07:04:28,915 --> 07:04:30,915
>>

4988
07:06:07,080 --> 07:06:09,534
Welcome back. I am here with

4989
07:06:13,205 --> 07:06:15,392
Chris Thayer. A first-time 
presenter. How did that go?  How

4990
07:06:15,608 --> 07:06:17,608
does it feel? 
>> I was super nervous. It 

4991
07:06:18,124 --> 07:06:20,124
wasn't bad

4992
07:06:21,731 --> 07:06:24,358
once I get up there but I was 
really nervous. The first part 

4993
07:06:24,581 --> 07:06:26,549
of the day. So, a load off my 
chest. 

4994
07:06:26,550 --> 07:06:31,362
>> 3-4 more minutes and you will
be good for the day. Go get some

4995
07:06:31,578 --> 07:06:33,578
wine and relax. 
>> I'm glad you didn't run away 

4996
07:06:33,764 --> 07:06:37,358
to your car. I wanted to give 
you some feedback. Twitter loved

4997
07:06:37,652 --> 07:06:42,848
your quote on don't dress for 
the job you want, to the job you

4998
07:06:43,012 --> 07:06:47,911
want. You have already become 
famous. That's awesome. 

4999
07:06:47,912 --> 07:06:49,954
>> Getting to your talk, I 
appreciate your talk. One thing 

5000
07:06:50,170 --> 07:06:53,013
I wanted to touch on was, you 
mentioned you are the lead for 

5001
07:06:53,764 --> 07:06:57,394
your forensics lab. From a 
forensics perspective, how does 

5002
07:06:57,610 --> 07:07:00,675
this look? 
>> We focus on mitigation 

5003
07:07:00,892 --> 07:07:04,918
detection but from retroactive 
perspective how does this look? 

5004
07:07:05,088 --> 07:07:10,188
>> I feel that it helps in that 
area because a forensics team 

5005
07:07:10,356 --> 07:07:17,299
handles forensics and internal 
investigations. We have that 

5006
07:07:17,515 --> 07:07:19,515
little investigation piece on 
there. there have been times 

5007
07:07:20,030 --> 07:07:23,424
where I'm sitting there and I 
see some behavior I know it's 

5008
07:07:23,640 --> 07:07:26,049
bad but I can't figure out what 
happened. I can't always pull 

5009
07:07:26,811 --> 07:07:35,017
the disk. I had to go down the 
list. It has helped because as I

5010
07:07:35,234 --> 07:07:37,234
mentioned in the talk, before

5011
07:07:43,330 --> 07:07:45,516
ATT&CK was around, it was hard 
unless you have 30 years' 

5012
07:07:45,732 --> 07:07:48,357
experience to know about that 
stuff.  Now that it's all in one

5013
07:07:48,581 --> 07:07:52,298
spot I just go through and make 
sure I am covering all my bases 

5014
07:07:52,515 --> 07:07:55,141
when I do the investigation. I 
feel like it fits right in with 

5015
07:07:55,798 --> 07:08:00,049
almost everything. 
>> Perfect feedback as the Olaf.

5016
07:08:01,269 --> 07:08:04,002
We strive to make sure this is a
community, and inclusive 

5017
07:08:04,172 --> 07:08:09,361
community. Anyone willing to put
in the effort, we are willing to

5018
07:08:09,579 --> 07:08:13,952
ring you on and make you a part 
of it. Like you said, different 

5019
07:08:14,391 --> 07:08:16,358
aspect events different value 
and we are appreciative that. 

5020
07:08:16,359 --> 07:08:20,731
>> Yes, like I said a couple of 
years ago before ATT&CK,  

5021
07:08:21,171 --> 07:08:26,861
getting this knowledge would 
take 30 years' experience. It is

5022
07:08:27,079 --> 07:08:28,878
really nice for everybody 
learning this. 

5023
07:08:28,879 --> 07:08:32,550
>> I don't know how long you 
been working with ATT&CK,  do 

5024
07:08:32,767 --> 07:08:34,568
you have favorite tactic or 
technique? 

5025
07:08:34,569 --> 07:08:41,953
>> I like persistence. I feel 
like that is one area. Some 

5026
07:08:42,170 --> 07:08:46,767
other stuff may be harder to go 
through. You need persistence. 

5027
07:08:47,200 --> 07:08:49,448
It's nice because a lot of times

5028
07:08:54,639 --> 07:08:58,577
I can gravitate there when I am 
doing investigation. 

5029
07:08:58,579 --> 07:09:02,517
>> That makes sense. 
>> You are speaking of evidence.

5030
07:09:02,733 --> 07:09:04,701
One of the questions I have 
personally, you mentioned 

5031
07:09:04,702 --> 07:09:06,702
developing a hypothesis

5032
07:09:09,513 --> 07:09:11,513
with hypothesis-based testing or
hunting. How do you deal with 

5033
07:09:11,705 --> 07:09:17,392
uncertainty? Like you said, you 
are not certain about this. How 

5034
07:09:17,609 --> 07:09:19,609
do you overcome that? 
>> It depends on the situation. 

5035
07:09:19,798 --> 07:09:23,295
>> Sometimes I will ask a 
person. I will give them a call 

5036
07:09:23,519 --> 07:09:28,764
and say, were you doing this? Is
it a part of your project? A lot

5037
07:09:28,988 --> 07:09:32,469
of times it is piecing together 
maybe more than one technique. 

5038
07:09:33,249 --> 07:09:38,443
So, if I only see one I am 
skeptical that this is going on.

5039
07:09:38,825 --> 07:09:43,419
It looks different but it's not 
bad. If I can piece together 

5040
07:09:43,860 --> 07:09:46,046
different techniques on 
different tactics, I usually 

5041
07:09:46,269 --> 07:09:49,437
know that there is something 
there I need to look closely at.

5042
07:09:49,599 --> 07:09:55,779
Or, it is marrying these 
together. Using another source 

5043
07:09:55,943 --> 07:10:03,327
there, I know that if this is a 
specific group I know where to 

5044
07:10:03,545 --> 07:10:05,952
look for other pieces. Putting 
this together and saying this is

5045
07:10:06,170 --> 07:10:09,018
what is going on. 
>> Absolutely. It's all about 

5046
07:10:09,235 --> 07:10:14,482
the full picture. You mentioned 
three or four different skill 

5047
07:10:14,705 --> 07:10:16,234
set so billing the community is 
keen. 

5048
07:10:16,235 --> 07:10:18,859
>> Yes, the communication. This 
is the one of the things I love 

5049
07:10:19,076 --> 07:10:22,577
about ATT&CK.  It sits in the 
middle of all this so you create

5050
07:10:23,342 --> 07:10:24,985
the standard language you can 
use. 

5051
07:10:24,986 --> 07:10:27,172
>> Absolutely. One of the things
I appreciated about your talk 

5052
07:10:27,389 --> 07:10:31,545
and a lot of people liked, was 
you took us through the line, 

5053
07:10:32,294 --> 07:10:36,795
timeline of before ATT&CK  and 
was an all parental, a 

5054
07:10:37,546 --> 07:10:41,391
monumental change. You have any 
advice for anyone who wants to 

5055
07:10:41,608 --> 07:10:45,148
replicate that? How do you drive
your organizational change? 

5056
07:10:45,149 --> 07:10:51,983
>> My advice would be, take it 
slow. Take it junk junk. If you 

5057
07:10:52,201 --> 07:10:57,233
try to implement everything at 
once, you are either going to be

5058
07:10:57,396 --> 07:11:01,080
working 90 hours a week or it 
will fail. I think that if you 

5059
07:11:01,735 --> 07:11:03,744
take it piece by piece you can 
show

5060
07:11:07,644 --> 07:11:10,264
it's worth to management and the
rest of the teams and once you 

5061
07:11:10,487 --> 07:11:13,329
do that they will hop on board 
and say this is great. Then you 

5062
07:11:13,546 --> 07:11:15,732
have everybody else that wants 
to help you instead of everybody

5063
07:11:15,955 --> 07:11:18,140
telling you I'm going to do it 
the old way. 

5064
07:11:18,141 --> 07:11:24,045
>> Fantastic. Thank you for your
time. Please enjoy the rest of 

5065
07:11:24,268 --> 07:11:26,237
this presentation this 
afternoon. We will be back 

5066
07:11:26,238 --> 07:11:33,237
tomorrow morning. Don't forget 
to keep tweeting. We love this 

5067
07:11:33,457 --> 07:11:37,498
and we are documenting the mall.
Thank you for tuning in. See you

5068
07:11:37,663 --> 07:11:39,663
tomorrow.

5069
07:13:47,550 --> 07:13:53,505
We now return to ATT&CKcon.  
Please take your seat. 

5070
07:13:53,507 --> 07:13:55,507
>>

5071
07:14:00,778 --> 07:14:02,778
>>

5072
07:14:05,575 --> 07:14:09,424
All right. Welcome back, 
everyone. I know everyone is 

5073
07:14:09,640 --> 07:14:17,734
pumped about those cookies. 
Fresh cookies. Come in and find 

5074
07:14:17,951 --> 07:14:22,986
your seat as you are wrapping up
the day. We have a series of 

5075
07:14:23,202 --> 07:14:28,237
talks for you. 15-20 minutes to 
keep things interesting. The 

5076
07:14:28,454 --> 07:14:30,857
speakers will be brief and get 
to their point. This will be 

5077
07:14:31,081 --> 07:14:34,581
great to wrap things up with 
great speakers. Make sure to 

5078
07:14:35,344 --> 07:14:40,704
stick around as you come back to
the auditorium here. It is my 

5079
07:14:40,920 --> 07:14:44,423
pleasure to introduce one of my 
teammates. I love this part. We 

5080
07:14:44,643 --> 07:14:47,374
are bringing you these ATT&CK  
updates

5081
07:14:51,202 --> 07:14:53,828
. What are some cool things 
we've done in the past? What are

5082
07:14:54,045 --> 07:14:56,672
we doing in the future? This is 
an exciting effort that John has

5083
07:14:56,889 --> 07:15:01,701
been working on. John is from 
MITRE.  We have been chatting. 

5084
07:15:02,140 --> 07:15:04,983
It has been 10 years. In that 
time he has done what a few 

5085
07:15:05,423 --> 07:15:10,451
things with the attack team 
helping with the repository and 

5086
07:15:10,669 --> 07:15:12,862
running analytics and helping 
with different agencies use 

5087
07:15:13,078 --> 07:15:17,670
ATT&CK as  well as what everyone
is talking about. This will be 

5088
07:15:18,420 --> 07:15:21,921
interesting. Please join me in 
welcoming John Wunder.  

5089
07:15:21,922 --> 07:15:23,922
>>

5090
07:15:28,828 --> 07:15:31,887
>> Thank you for that 
introduction. I am excited to be

5091
07:15:32,638 --> 07:15:38,014
talking about ATT&CK sightings. 
At ATT&CKcon  last year I had 

5092
07:15:38,237 --> 07:15:41,079
some of the first conversations 
about siting for some of you 

5093
07:15:41,295 --> 07:15:44,143
that are here today. A lot of 
that conversation that we are 

5094
07:15:44,360 --> 07:15:46,987
seeing here, we took the notes 
and when I talk about this today

5095
07:15:47,204 --> 07:15:53,328
keep in mind that that is a 
result of you talking about it. 

5096
07:15:53,768 --> 07:15:56,397
It also addresses a lot of the 
things that we heard today. A 

5097
07:15:56,611 --> 07:15:59,014
lot of the needs we heard today,
the need to prioritize defenses 

5098
07:15:59,236 --> 07:16:04,267
and the need to make our 
intelligence actionable. We 

5099
07:16:04,483 --> 07:16:08,861
collected the idea for these. 
Before I talk about this I want 

5100
07:16:09,077 --> 07:16:11,077
to talk about the

5101
07:16:14,768 --> 07:16:16,768
threat intelligence reports. 
They are great and they can tell

5102
07:16:16,953 --> 07:16:18,922
you about new, interesting 
techniques. They can tell you 

5103
07:16:18,923 --> 07:16:21,108
about tools and the different 
things that people are up to. 

5104
07:16:21,325 --> 07:16:25,592
For intelligent reports are 
great to finalize detailed 

5105
07:16:25,772 --> 07:16:30,299
information about what people 
are doing and what tools are 

5106
07:16:30,516 --> 07:16:32,516
doing and what the new 
techniques are that are out 

5107
07:16:32,702 --> 07:16:36,642
there. That said, the threat 
intelligence reports are not the

5108
07:16:36,858 --> 07:16:40,797
best way to answer every 
question we have. These are a 

5109
07:16:41,014 --> 07:16:43,424
form of threat intelligence but 
there are other forms of this as

5110
07:16:43,640 --> 07:16:46,266
well. Threat intelligence 
reports desk for example they 

5111
07:16:46,482 --> 07:16:51,952
take a long time to right. We 
have to have an analyst write 

5112
07:16:52,175 --> 07:16:54,578
them and they have to go through
legal and the marketing teams 

5113
07:16:54,795 --> 07:16:57,206
and you have to have them go 
through publications and they 

5114
07:16:57,884 --> 07:17:00,048
have to get out there. people 
have to read them. So, see a 

5115
07:17:00,264 --> 07:17:03,768
number of threat intelligence 
reports, a lot of them skill 

5116
07:17:03,985 --> 07:17:07,500
-wise there are not as many 
reports as there are incidents 

5117
07:17:07,700 --> 07:17:12,624
or events out there. the scale 
and scope of things covered by 

5118
07:17:12,786 --> 07:17:18,206
this is not as broad as what we 
see out there. second, threat 

5119
07:17:18,422 --> 07:17:20,936
intelligence reports are focused
on the in-depth analysis can. We

5120
07:17:21,101 --> 07:17:24,980
won't write intelligence reports
about the ways that this 

5121
07:17:25,733 --> 07:17:30,780
adversary did this. This means 
that threat intelligence reports

5122
07:17:30,945 --> 07:17:34,209
are important because they help 
us form an attack but they

5123
07:17:37,673 --> 07:17:41,174
also have other needs and that 
is where sightings come in. As 

5124
07:17:41,390 --> 07:17:43,800
we think about how to answer 
these questions that is where we

5125
07:17:44,016 --> 07:17:47,516
see these use cases. I will talk
about what that means in a 

5126
07:17:47,732 --> 07:17:50,174
minute. Think about how you 
answer these questions. Which 

5127
07:17:50,575 --> 07:17:53,908
techniques are common X that can
be tough to answer with

5128
07:17:58,455 --> 07:18:00,200
threat intelligence reporting's 
are they talking about this 

5129
07:18:00,201 --> 07:18:02,201
technique because it happens 
more often or because it is 

5130
07:18:02,391 --> 07:18:06,329
novel and interesting and 
unique? Second, how the 

5131
07:18:06,547 --> 07:18:10,140
techniques are used together in 
conjunction with each other. 

5132
07:18:10,305 --> 07:18:15,080
This is where a great set of 
data would help us answer this. 

5133
07:18:15,296 --> 07:18:18,798
How do we see things that happen
out of the box. Third, has usage

5134
07:18:19,015 --> 07:18:24,047
changed over time. Intelligence 
reports and compass data from 

5135
07:18:24,264 --> 07:18:26,891
many years or months and it's 
hard to tell what it looks like 

5136
07:18:27,654 --> 07:18:30,498
this year versus last year 
versus the year before. That 

5137
07:18:30,663 --> 07:18:36,076
needs more information as well. 
>> Yes, how does prevalence 

5138
07:18:36,517 --> 07:18:40,016
differ by sector or geographic 
area? How do we see it at an in 

5139
07:18:40,767 --> 07:18:45,484
depth level? Again, threat 
intelligence reports talk about 

5140
07:18:45,701 --> 07:18:50,736
this a lot. The breadth and 
depth of that reporting is not 

5141
07:18:51,171 --> 07:18:54,018
as big as it could be if you 
look at the scope of incidents 

5142
07:18:54,235 --> 07:19:00,143
that happened in the world. This
is where we see this fitting in.

5143
07:19:00,360 --> 07:19:04,514
What do I mean by that? When I 
think about this I think about 

5144
07:19:04,738 --> 07:19:08,454
observations that provide 
evidence that an ATT&CK 

5145
07:19:08,671 --> 07:19:13,700
technique is in use.  Would not 
be great to know when it's in 

5146
07:19:13,924 --> 07:19:15,924
use without having to read all 
of these intelligence reports? 

5147
07:19:16,639 --> 07:19:19,825
We can think of a couple of 
different types of threat 

5148
07:19:20,576 --> 07:19:22,576
intelligence reports.

5149
07:19:25,516 --> 07:19:27,486
Direct technique sightings, if 
you think about the different 

5150
07:19:27,487 --> 07:19:31,641
ways you might have evidence of 
an ATT&CKcon technique in use, 

5151
07:19:31,858 --> 07:19:36,013
one way is, you are looking at  
the logs and seeing actions 

5152
07:19:36,236 --> 07:19:38,863
happening on the systems and 
networks that correspond to an 

5153
07:19:39,295 --> 07:19:41,923
ATT&CK technique. For example if
I'm looking at this  and I see 

5154
07:19:42,139 --> 07:19:46,950
for example a memory read, it is
direct evidence that this has 

5155
07:19:47,390 --> 07:19:52,640
occurred and it's great evidence
that that technique happened. 

5156
07:19:52,857 --> 07:19:55,706
There are other types of 
evidence as well. We might not 

5157
07:19:55,922 --> 07:19:58,005
have something quite that 
conclusive for example. This 

5158
07:19:58,174 --> 07:20:02,486
tool is capable of doing this. 
What if it is blocked at the 

5159
07:20:02,703 --> 07:20:07,296
firewall and we bought it 
because of this. That's not 

5160
07:20:07,513 --> 07:20:12,763
quite as good as the evidence is
seeing the actual memory dump 

5161
07:20:12,987 --> 07:20:14,987
but a pretty good indication 
that our adversaries are trying 

5162
07:20:15,173 --> 07:20:18,779
to do credentialing. If you see 
this being blocked at your 

5163
07:20:18,946 --> 07:20:23,047
firewall this is the idea that 
we've seen a piece of software 

5164
07:20:23,263 --> 07:20:26,547
that enables us to do this. 
Indirect software sightings get 

5165
07:20:26,763 --> 07:20:30,141
of the concept of threat 
intelligence reporting that goes

5166
07:20:30,306 --> 07:20:34,203
through the automated 
mechanisms. Maybe I see an 

5167
07:20:34,951 --> 07:20:39,561
indicator shared and I didn't 
see it myself and I don't know 

5168
07:20:39,723 --> 07:20:45,362
that, whether it was a 
successful attack or not 

5169
07:20:45,578 --> 07:20:47,764
successful, and I don't know 
what happened but the fact that 

5170
07:20:47,987 --> 07:20:50,390
somebody is sharing this tells 
me that that is probably in use 

5171
07:20:50,608 --> 07:20:53,233
and that the adversaries are 
looking to do credential 

5172
07:20:53,984 --> 07:20:56,733
dumping. Hopefully you can see 
that while these are different 

5173
07:20:56,955 --> 07:21:01,545
novels some great evidence of 
the technique occurring and 

5174
07:21:01,769 --> 07:21:04,171
others are more indirect. It is 
evidence that a technique is in 

5175
07:21:04,388 --> 07:21:07,231
use in the real world. That is 
what we want to get out with 

5176
07:21:07,982 --> 07:21:11,612
these sightings. We feel like 
something that would be useful 

5177
07:21:12,044 --> 07:21:14,044
is more direct evidence of

5178
07:21:16,856 --> 07:21:19,267
ATT&CK techniques at use in the 
real world and that is where 

5179
07:21:19,484 --> 07:21:22,109
this idea has come from.  In 
order to help enable that to 

5180
07:21:22,325 --> 07:21:26,482
make it happen we proposed an 
idea of ATT&CK sightings and 

5181
07:21:26,705 --> 07:21:30,205
have talk to you some  about 
this today. I would happy to 

5182
07:21:30,421 --> 07:21:34,143
talk to Marty. What we are 
proposing is, MITRE collects 

5183
07:21:34,360 --> 07:21:37,858
sightings and  we take these in 
and when you think about 

5184
07:21:38,082 --> 07:21:42,013
assigning, I talked about the 
three types. Think about the 

5185
07:21:42,237 --> 07:21:44,857
type of siding and the technique
ID and the tactic ID in the 

5186
07:21:45,081 --> 07:21:48,140
timestamp and maybe some other 
things. That is what we are 

5187
07:21:48,357 --> 07:21:50,768
talking about we talk about the 
siding. What if MITRE  elected 

5188
07:21:50,985 --> 07:21:54,269
these and they were anonymized 
at some level before after they 

5189
07:21:55,029 --> 07:21:58,859
get to MITRE and we aggregate 
them and make  intelligent 

5190
07:21:59,075 --> 07:22:04,550
decisions and reports based on 
this? We could publish insights 

5191
07:22:04,766 --> 07:22:07,607
and ideally if we get a good 
amount of data we feel like it 

5192
07:22:07,831 --> 07:22:09,831
makes sense we could publish 
data sets that helps researchers

5193
07:22:10,018 --> 07:22:14,612
like yourselves figure out 
insights that we at MITRE 

5194
07:22:14,828 --> 07:22:17,894
couldn't figure out. The idea is
to create  the sightings echo 

5195
07:22:18,111 --> 07:22:20,115
system where we constantly 
collect telemetry about the

5196
07:22:23,797 --> 07:22:26,207
attack, ATT&CK are in usage and 
republish this in terms of  

5197
07:22:26,423 --> 07:22:31,674
insights as well as raw data. 
>> You can imagine it looking 

5198
07:22:31,891 --> 07:22:36,048
like this. On the left you can 
see the systems under attack. 

5199
07:22:37,016 --> 07:22:39,016
Our individual

5200
07:22:40,860 --> 07:22:42,606
laptops and servers and 
infrastructure. We are doing 

5201
07:22:42,607 --> 07:22:45,890
security monitoring on these. 
Security monitoring will lead to

5202
07:22:46,107 --> 07:22:51,154
detections when we have an 
attack. At some level this will 

5203
07:22:51,359 --> 07:22:53,359
create reporting so we can do 
reporting of those detections 

5204
07:22:53,550 --> 07:22:59,058
and that could happen through 
your MS SP or a security vendor.

5205
07:23:01,421 --> 07:23:03,609
At that point I want to 
highlight this because if you 

5206
07:23:03,825 --> 07:23:06,235
are working with those, that is 
a great way to anonymize the 

5207
07:23:06,452 --> 07:23:08,452
data. One thing that

5208
07:23:11,486 --> 07:23:13,889
MITRE doesn't want to do is to 
be responsible for collecting a 

5209
07:23:14,113 --> 07:23:16,516
lot of sensitive data about  
techniques seen in the wild at 

5210
07:23:16,733 --> 07:23:18,960
specific organizations. We are 
happy to work with you

5211
07:23:22,857 --> 07:23:25,044
if you are one of those 
organizations and you want to 

5212
07:23:25,268 --> 07:23:27,894
contribute what you find but we 
think it makes a lot of sense, 

5213
07:23:28,111 --> 07:23:30,111
really, to look at the people 
collecting data from multiple 

5214
07:23:30,297 --> 07:23:32,483
organizations at the same time 
so they can do the anonymous 

5215
07:23:33,233 --> 07:23:36,204
Haitian force. We will continue 
to look at this and try to 

5216
07:23:36,421 --> 07:23:38,421
aggregated and we have people 
that are privacy experts that 

5217
07:23:38,608 --> 07:23:42,987
can look at how to keep it from 
being D anonymized and then we 

5218
07:23:43,204 --> 07:23:46,925
publish our insights. That is 
the operating model that we are 

5219
07:23:47,141 --> 07:23:51,079
hoping for. We have three 
communities of interest that we 

5220
07:23:51,296 --> 07:23:56,325
want to help. One is 
contributors and probably the 

5221
07:23:56,549 --> 07:23:59,030
most in part of the ecosystem, 
providing information of value.

5222
07:24:04,639 --> 07:24:06,605
MITRE is not providing 
information about use of the 

5223
07:24:06,606 --> 07:24:08,606
contributors are the most 
important part and we want to 

5224
07:24:08,800 --> 07:24:11,425
make sure that they are able to 
easily contribute  and they are 

5225
07:24:11,641 --> 07:24:13,610
protected from disclosing too 
much information and that they 

5226
07:24:13,611 --> 07:24:15,611
acknowledged for providing 
something of value. We want to 

5227
07:24:15,798 --> 07:24:17,798
give people credit when they 
give information that helps the 

5228
07:24:17,984 --> 07:24:20,061
community. 
>> Second we want to help the 

5229
07:24:20,223 --> 07:24:23,669
defenders, host of us here are 
defenders whether they are 

5230
07:24:23,893 --> 07:24:26,078
analysts or operators or 
hunters. They we want to be able

5231
07:24:26,842 --> 07:24:30,892
to help defenders prioritize 
actions and the threat 

5232
07:24:31,108 --> 07:24:35,706
intelligence a look at to have 
more information and we want 

5233
07:24:35,922 --> 07:24:38,549
them to help understand and 
communicate the value of their 

5234
07:24:38,766 --> 07:24:41,394
work. It is easy to do if you 
now have dissection for this 

5235
07:24:41,609 --> 07:24:47,081
that happened last year. More so
than here is a thing I saw on a 

5236
07:24:47,298 --> 07:24:51,235
couple of reports. Lastly we 
want to help them change their 

5237
07:24:51,453 --> 07:24:53,476
defenses based on what we are 
seeing. 

5238
07:24:53,477 --> 07:24:58,668
>> Last, we want to help 
researchers. There is a lot of 

5239
07:24:58,893 --> 07:25:01,624
great research happening and a 
lot of the research needs good 

5240
07:25:01,787 --> 07:25:06,859
data. I think by publishing the 
data sets we can enable the 

5241
07:25:07,027 --> 07:25:09,825
research by anonymizing it and 
make sure that the contributors 

5242
07:25:10,050 --> 07:25:12,675
are safe and giving researchers 
what they need to do their jobs.

5243
07:25:12,891 --> 07:25:16,721
Helping them to develop new 
approaches and understand how 

5244
07:25:16,939 --> 07:25:21,420
adversarial usage can differ. I 
think we all internally think 

5245
07:25:21,644 --> 07:25:24,357
that and know that probably a 
finance sector is attacked to 

5246
07:25:24,522 --> 07:25:27,763
really than a defense base. It 
would be great to have data to 

5247
07:25:28,513 --> 07:25:32,617
prove that. So, we are just 
lying on her own intuition. 

5248
07:25:32,618 --> 07:25:36,608
>> Lastly, to do things I can 
think of. I needed three 

5249
07:25:36,772 --> 07:25:41,873
bullets. I needed some research 
to come up with a third item 

5250
07:25:42,036 --> 07:25:46,800
here. How can you contribute? We
wanted to make it as easy as 

5251
07:25:47,016 --> 07:25:49,910
possible. Email us or find me 
after the break or find a

5252
07:25:57,732 --> 07:26:00,362
DeLoitte member. We will hook 
you up and we want to make this 

5253
07:26:00,579 --> 07:26:02,982
as easy as possible. You will 
need to generate some did appear

5254
07:26:03,206 --> 07:26:05,391
we have data format that we 
define. It is  ready 

5255
07:26:05,608 --> 07:26:07,608
straightforward and you can 
create it yourself. If you know 

5256
07:26:08,342 --> 07:26:11,299
the MMS, MIS P developer -- that
was the case. We talked about 

5257
07:26:11,516 --> 07:26:16,111
siding ends of now you can use 
them to export the sightings and

5258
07:26:16,327 --> 07:26:22,019
they contribute that back to 
MITRE. Or if you are using other

5259
07:26:22,236 --> 07:26:25,078
files, send us whatever you have
and  we will take it. We are 

5260
07:26:25,294 --> 07:26:27,919
willing to -- we care about the 
data. We don't care what format 

5261
07:26:28,143 --> 07:26:33,389
you give us the data in. Then, 
send it to us. I wanted to call 

5262
07:26:33,606 --> 07:26:37,767
out some related work. First, 
Red Canary released a threat 

5263
07:26:37,984 --> 07:26:42,363
detection report last year and 
is twitter can be trusted they 

5264
07:26:42,579 --> 07:26:44,765
are releasing another one soon 
talking about the top 10 

5265
07:26:44,987 --> 07:26:49,576
techniques that they found in a 
while. À great tips on how to 

5266
07:26:49,807 --> 07:26:52,211
find those techniques. 
>> Second, Karl mentioned  

5267
07:26:52,748 --> 07:26:57,454
CrowdStrike.  Released two 
different reports and one thing 

5268
07:26:57,672 --> 07:27:00,298
I thought they did that made a 
lot of sense and the second 

5269
07:27:00,514 --> 07:27:02,795
report, the major report they 
released recently was talking 

5270
07:27:02,963 --> 07:27:06,206
about changes from the 2018 
report to the 2019 report. Also 

5271
07:27:06,423 --> 07:27:11,672
where maybe you should not take 
some of those changes is 

5272
07:27:11,894 --> 07:27:13,894
seriously because there could be
issues with data. They were 

5273
07:27:14,081 --> 07:27:17,140
pretty thoughtful about the 
changes and some of the changes 

5274
07:27:17,363 --> 07:27:19,203
aren't as significant as they 
seem. 

5275
07:27:19,204 --> 07:27:21,204
>> Last,

5276
07:27:22,825 --> 07:27:25,726
VERIS. They do a lot of metadata
type of work.  The demographics.

5277
07:27:26,764 --> 07:27:31,141
We think this is complementary. 
>> The current status is, we are

5278
07:27:31,358 --> 07:27:35,295
collecting sightings under NDE. 
You don't necessarily have to 

5279
07:27:35,519 --> 07:27:37,519
sign this and we find that many

5280
07:27:40,987 --> 07:27:43,172
organizations want to do this to
protect themselves but the goal 

5281
07:27:43,389 --> 07:27:45,581
is to have more divisions over 
this year and eventually move 

5282
07:27:45,804 --> 07:27:47,809
toward having insights 
published. That's what I've got.

5283
07:27:48,641 --> 07:27:51,795
Thank you. Here is the URL to 
get involved and you can email 

5284
07:27:51,965 --> 07:27:54,642
us. I'm happy to take your 
questions. 

5285
07:27:54,643 --> 07:28:00,671
>> We are right on time. Thank 
you, John. John will hangout at 

5286
07:28:01,422 --> 07:28:04,939
the reception. Please talk to 
him.

5287
07:28:08,548 --> 07:28:12,309
We will anonymize your data. 
>> Thank you so much, John. 

5288
07:28:12,311 --> 07:28:20,454
>> A question I get is, can you 
track industry? I have been 

5289
07:28:20,623 --> 07:28:26,050
asked this. We want to sort 
these groups by industry. With 

5290
07:28:26,267 --> 07:28:31,735
something like sightings we can 
do that. That is exciting. I 

5291
07:28:31,951 --> 07:28:37,042
think someone is still watching 
and it's 1:30 AM there. he said

5292
07:28:41,577 --> 07:28:43,763
this is a cool project coming 
up. Collaboration is key and 

5293
07:28:43,986 --> 07:28:46,612
this will encourage that. All 
the way to India, they hear your

5294
07:28:46,832 --> 07:28:50,420
name, John, of collaboration. 
>>> Next, Alan Thompson the 

5295
07:28:50,587 --> 07:28:52,587
chief technology officer at

5296
07:28:56,019 --> 07:29:01,264
Looking Glass.  This focused on 
the network side. Often people 

5297
07:29:01,488 --> 07:29:03,892
think about the endpoint when 
they are looking for different 

5298
07:29:04,109 --> 07:29:07,391
behaviors. Yes, there's a lot 
there but you can get some bang 

5299
07:29:07,608 --> 07:29:13,957
for your buck in terms of these 
devices. Alan leads technical 

5300
07:29:14,173 --> 07:29:18,329
strategy and product technology 
across all of Looking Glass  and

5301
07:29:18,547 --> 07:29:23,800
is involved with the standards 
and cochair of the 

5302
07:29:24,779 --> 07:29:28,389
interoperability subcommittee. 
He does a lot of work there. 

5303
07:29:28,613 --> 07:29:32,380
lease join me in welcoming Alan 
Thompson. 

5304
07:29:32,381 --> 07:29:34,381
>> Thank you 
>>

5305
07:29:37,797 --> 07:29:41,777
Whoever organized this calendar 
did an awesome job because

5306
07:29:45,675 --> 07:29:48,077
John Wunder gave me a great 
setup for my presentation.  I'm 

5307
07:29:48,295 --> 07:29:55,299
here to talk about this and at 
Looking Glass we started a  

5308
07:29:55,826 --> 07:29:59,232
research project to understand 
how we can do thread detection 

5309
07:29:59,983 --> 07:30:04,923
and mitigation in new, 
innovative ways, particularly 

5310
07:30:05,363 --> 07:30:09,609
talking about how cavers are 
important and technical 

5311
07:30:09,781 --> 07:30:14,999
indicators are important. 
Important but insufficient. We 

5312
07:30:15,206 --> 07:30:19,674
are looking for a way to up 
level the ability to create 

5313
07:30:19,840 --> 07:30:23,842
detection. As I was preparing 
this presentation, the 

5314
07:30:24,007 --> 07:30:26,007
presentation

5315
07:30:27,672 --> 07:30:29,858
morphed from showing you the 
metrics more to what we learned 

5316
07:30:30,081 --> 07:30:32,483
as we went through it. Hopefully
these lessons we learned as we 

5317
07:30:33,249 --> 07:30:36,245
went through translate into some
lessons

5318
07:30:39,705 --> 07:30:41,890
you could maybe apply to your 
environments. I want to cover 

5319
07:30:42,547 --> 07:30:44,734
three things. The first is to 
give you some background on 

5320
07:30:45,173 --> 07:30:47,904
ZEEK.  How many of you know 
about ZEEK?  Awesome.

5321
07:30:52,390 --> 07:30:54,799
I have asked that question 
before and it was like -- I 

5322
07:30:55,016 --> 07:30:56,768
don't know. 
>> Next, how we prepared the 

5323
07:30:56,769 --> 07:31:03,110
data to interact with both STIX 
and  ATT&CK and how we use it to

5324
07:31:03,550 --> 07:31:05,845
correlate in the real world 
environment. In the background 

5325
07:31:06,014 --> 07:31:10,326
perspective we have been around 
a long time. I think I'm 

5326
07:31:10,550 --> 07:31:12,512
repeating things that people 
already know. I want to 

5327
07:31:12,513 --> 07:31:17,218
highlight something that ZEEK  
had that was attracted to us. It

5328
07:31:17,383 --> 07:31:20,665
is open-source with a lot of 
contributions.

5329
07:31:25,421 --> 07:31:27,608
It was incredibly interesting to
us because we didn't want to 

5330
07:31:27,831 --> 07:31:30,017
reinvent the wheel. We wanted to
build upon the excellence that 

5331
07:31:30,233 --> 07:31:32,427
was already in the open source 
community. We also wanted to 

5332
07:31:32,643 --> 07:31:35,269
look at how we can scale it out 
to any software environment and 

5333
07:31:35,485 --> 07:31:38,550
any number of efferent 
capabilities. These are some of 

5334
07:31:38,767 --> 07:31:44,675
the things we get from Zeek as 
part of  detection as potential 

5335
07:31:44,891 --> 07:31:46,891
mitigation. You can see

5336
07:31:49,704 --> 07:31:51,890
basic stuff but hopefully you 
can see some of the important 

5337
07:31:52,106 --> 07:31:54,841
things that you can do with 
integration with sandbox and 

5338
07:31:55,007 --> 07:32:00,298
intelligence. Some of the higher
level cavers such as these 

5339
07:32:00,463 --> 07:32:03,925
things. These are some things 
that the open-source community 

5340
07:32:04,141 --> 07:32:10,483
and Zeek have  attributed. They 
may or not be applicable but the

5341
07:32:10,710 --> 07:32:13,109
key is they are available as a 
reference if nothing else. From 

5342
07:32:13,326 --> 07:32:16,445
a basic perspective I will just 
expand this because everybody 

5343
07:32:16,826 --> 07:32:24,048
knows about Zeek.  The key point
is that Zeek  is not just 

5344
07:32:24,266 --> 07:32:27,325
analysis but also embraces the 
approach to deployment so you 

5345
07:32:27,550 --> 07:32:32,139
can deploy a controller which 
advises the policy and control 

5346
07:32:32,363 --> 07:32:37,392
to the individual network. I 
know this is a simplistic 

5347
07:32:37,608 --> 07:32:42,860
example for the key point is 
that Zeek receives a copy  of 

5348
07:32:43,076 --> 07:32:45,264
the traffic and runs analyzes on
the traffic. From a more 

5349
07:32:46,014 --> 07:32:49,424
advanced perspective, and this 
is where it gets interesting, 

5350
07:32:50,186 --> 07:32:54,014
Zeek  embodies a distributed 
system built upon the active 

5351
07:32:54,454 --> 07:32:59,488
framework and the ability to 
start to have multiple nodes 

5352
07:32:59,704 --> 07:33:04,171
acting on events and collaborate
to understand behavior a 

5353
07:33:04,341 --> 07:33:08,233
potentially call in information.
This becomes interesting when 

5354
07:33:08,456 --> 07:33:10,259
you want to scale this 
capability. 

5355
07:33:10,260 --> 07:33:14,797
>> In reality the production 
environment is not as simple as 

5356
07:33:15,560 --> 07:33:20,263
the diagram. It is typically 
much more collocated. The key 

5357
07:33:20,487 --> 07:33:26,612
point is, I want to be able to 
deploy Zeek detection and all  

5358
07:33:27,045 --> 07:33:29,981
these environments, not just the
perimeter and the DNC and in the

5359
07:33:30,150 --> 07:33:32,355
club and everywhere. So, if I'm 
designing a capability to detect

5360
07:33:34,267 --> 07:33:37,109
these sightings that John was 
talking about, I don't want just

5361
07:33:37,331 --> 07:33:39,331
the sightings on the perimeter. 
Wants

5362
07:33:45,642 --> 07:33:47,642
the firewall is probably 
blocking that anyway. I want to 

5363
07:33:47,828 --> 07:33:49,796
understand the sightings I'm 
seeing inside the network and 

5364
07:33:49,797 --> 07:33:52,422
inside the cloud. I need to be 
able to do that using a 

5365
07:33:52,638 --> 07:33:55,703
capability and Zeek is 
well-designed for that.  Some of

5366
07:33:55,921 --> 07:33:58,546
the things we did when we 
started this project to employ 

5367
07:33:58,769 --> 07:34:03,451
Zeek to detect  things was, 
first we had a lot of 

5368
07:34:03,613 --> 07:34:09,701
intelligence. I don't just mean 
a datalink but continuing 

5369
07:34:10,141 --> 07:34:12,141
monitoring this. 
>> And how do we correlate that 

5370
07:34:12,640 --> 07:34:15,064
intelligence with ATT&CKcon and 
you sat in  Zeek? 

5371
07:34:20,518 --> 07:34:28,079
I have worked a lot on this. 
STIX is an important  to erasure

5372
07:34:28,295 --> 07:34:30,295
intelligence. Most intelligence

5373
07:34:33,764 --> 07:34:36,936
was have the proprietary format 
and they are slowly adopting 

5374
07:34:37,109 --> 07:34:42,130
this. We wanted to start with 
this. Next, how to do related to

5375
07:34:44,046 --> 07:34:46,888
ATT&CK? I will show you an 
example.  How did we correlate 

5376
07:34:47,112 --> 07:34:50,388
the activities we are seeing in 
Zeek back to the intelligence  

5377
07:34:50,923 --> 07:34:56,516
and back to the environment. We 
used that and I will explain 

5378
07:34:57,279 --> 07:34:59,279
this. 
>> Finally as John touched on, 

5379
07:34:59,576 --> 07:35:03,335
how do you act on it?

5380
07:35:07,233 --> 07:35:11,173
This is about how to enforce 
mitigation and I am not 

5381
07:35:11,389 --> 07:35:14,670
presenting on that, I am just 
highlighting that we used Zeek 

5382
07:35:14,894 --> 07:35:16,894
for that. 
>> 

5383
07:35:20,232 --> 07:35:22,232
Open-source.

5384
07:35:25,830 --> 07:35:28,456
We built that over many years to
adjust the data. The key thing 

5385
07:35:28,672 --> 07:35:34,802
is, there were 1800 intelligence
patterns. That's not like 

5386
07:35:35,016 --> 07:35:38,954
instances, these are individual 
pieces of data that describe the

5387
07:35:39,706 --> 07:35:42,763
attack patterns. The challenge 
we had, how do we map that to 

5388
07:35:42,925 --> 07:35:49,892
the MITRE attack?  We came up 
with a simple technique. We say 

5389
07:35:50,114 --> 07:35:53,831
that for a particular attack 
pattern it maps to this tactic 

5390
07:35:54,048 --> 07:35:59,733
and these techniques. The reason
we did that, when we ingest the 

5391
07:35:59,950 --> 07:36:03,019
data we want to correlate all of
the different intelligence we 

5392
07:36:03,232 --> 07:36:07,264
are receiving in STIX 2 back to 

5393
07:36:11,984 --> 07:36:17,989
MITRE so that we know which  
technique is being seen. For 

5394
07:36:18,156 --> 07:36:23,578
example, this is an attack 
pattern. Sticks to the format. 

5395
07:36:24,013 --> 07:36:32,111
This should now be familiar. We 
do this with the MITRE attack  

5396
07:36:32,328 --> 07:36:37,581
in their definition. So, we just
copied it. What we did was, we 

5397
07:36:37,798 --> 07:36:43,046
applied it to our STIX 2 
intelligence object. We have the

5398
07:36:43,269 --> 07:36:47,420
exact mapping.  We did that 
across the 1800 different things

5399
07:36:48,171 --> 07:36:53,110
we did. Using the data mapping 
technique. At the second thing 

5400
07:36:53,327 --> 07:37:00,326
is, we wanted to map it through 
relationships to the UU ID. They

5401
07:37:00,549 --> 07:37:05,139
published the state. One 
criticism, if you are looking 

5402
07:37:05,362 --> 07:37:10,175
for input, we use names but the 
challenge was finding out which 

5403
07:37:10,937 --> 07:37:15,094
name matched the UU ID. It's a 
real pain in the  . 

5404
07:37:21,157 --> 07:37:27,452
ass. This is really hard. If you
had a dictionary would be 

5405
07:37:27,670 --> 07:37:30,736
easier. That is what we did. We 
mapped all our intelligence back

5406
07:37:31,497 --> 07:37:36,856
to the MITRE attack. So,  when 
we saw an instance of a 

5407
07:37:37,080 --> 07:37:42,109
particular piece of intelligence
we knew exactly which UU ID in 

5408
07:37:42,549 --> 07:37:45,391
ATT&CK was matching and we could
generate the metrics  from that.

5409
07:37:45,617 --> 07:37:50,417
So, that is some of the data 
stuff. I've got 6 minutes left. 

5410
07:37:50,641 --> 07:37:56,546
I hope I will make it. The next 
part is around expanding the 

5411
07:37:56,764 --> 07:37:59,210
question -- the intelligence 
question which may seem a little

5412
07:38:00,046 --> 07:38:04,418
esoteric but the key point is, 
this is a typical intelligence 

5413
07:38:04,858 --> 07:38:07,485
question you want to ask and get
an answer to. You are just 

5414
07:38:08,247 --> 07:38:14,484
asking about IP you are also 
asking about sector and active 

5415
07:38:14,701 --> 07:38:23,017
versus inactive and which IP is 
marked and which have active 

5416
07:38:23,234 --> 07:38:25,234
threats, not just historical 
threats and then want to know 

5417
07:38:25,860 --> 07:38:27,438
which patterns match those 
things. 

5418
07:38:27,439 --> 07:38:31,768
>> This is a simple query but if
you are doing it on a big data 

5419
07:38:32,202 --> 07:38:36,246
leg and drinking coffee and you 
don't have to respond in real 

5420
07:38:36,410 --> 07:38:40,072
time, you've got forever to 
answer. We don't. We have to 

5421
07:38:40,296 --> 07:38:45,417
answer these questions quickly. 
High scale. The problem is, many

5422
07:38:45,580 --> 07:38:51,099
sources that represent the same 
data, any have the same data and

5423
07:38:53,422 --> 07:38:56,048
this makes it more complicated 
to answer questions. Ultimately,

5424
07:38:56,264 --> 07:38:58,264
all these differences

5425
07:39:01,291 --> 07:39:04,574
in how the data represented, 
just because they use STIX does 

5426
07:39:04,797 --> 07:39:07,524
that mean they have normalized 
everything.  One thing that we 

5427
07:39:07,744 --> 07:39:10,482
found is that even though we 
mapped this, we didn't have a 

5428
07:39:10,699 --> 07:39:13,765
normalized data set. But we 
ended up doing was coming up 

5429
07:39:13,982 --> 07:39:20,322
with a data model that asserts 
ask about entities. By 

5430
07:39:21,074 --> 07:39:26,232
normalizing this and all this 
information in this simplistic 

5431
07:39:26,448 --> 07:39:31,684
model it allowed us to answer 
questions like the intelligence 

5432
07:39:32,353 --> 07:39:37,603
question quickly. That became, 
is important when you start to 

5433
07:39:37,826 --> 07:39:42,254
do the metrics in the network as
I showed earlier. 

5434
07:39:42,255 --> 07:39:49,090
>> So, an example. By modeling 
the data that we ingest, we went

5435
07:39:49,262 --> 07:39:55,106
from the typical 150 million 
records a day which is probably 

5436
07:39:55,322 --> 07:39:59,045
small for some people, which 
reduced to two 19 million per 

5437
07:39:59,263 --> 07:40:04,289
day by remodeling the data in 
the entity capability. We went 

5438
07:40:04,516 --> 07:40:11,166
from 150 gigabits to 30 
gigabits. That may be small in a

5439
07:40:11,336 --> 07:40:16,981
day but multiply that by 30 and 
60, etc. and you can see the 

5440
07:40:17,197 --> 07:40:26,822
problem there. so, back to Zeek.
Model it and the entity helped 

5441
07:40:27,039 --> 07:40:29,777
with the correlation and 
performance. But, Zeek  comes 

5442
07:40:30,105 --> 07:40:34,482
with a basic intelligence 
framework to be able to identify

5443
07:40:34,698 --> 07:40:39,070
intelligence. This is the part 
here. They have an Intel store 

5444
07:40:39,726 --> 07:40:44,323
that records what intelligence 
is being seen. All of that 

5445
07:40:44,539 --> 07:40:49,357
correlation and all of that maps
to the attack and we build that 

5446
07:40:50,119 --> 07:40:53,288
correlation here. And whenever 
we see a correlation from a 

5447
07:40:53,512 --> 07:40:56,792
particular event we map it back 
into the database. What we are 

5448
07:40:57,013 --> 07:40:59,852
able to do is take the 
advantages of all the 

5449
07:41:00,292 --> 07:41:02,700
intelligence and all of ATT&CK  
and put it back into the 

5450
07:41:03,465 --> 07:41:08,819
intelligence store. I got 3 
minutes left. I want to give you

5451
07:41:09,043 --> 07:41:14,618
a basic example of a simple 
ATT&CK event.  I will explain 

5452
07:41:14,786 --> 07:41:18,887
this. This is a typical event. 
It has a lot of information 

5453
07:41:19,648 --> 07:41:24,354
here. You can see which network 
and the aspect of traffic that 

5454
07:41:24,571 --> 07:41:28,509
was detected and what Intel and 
the labels associated and the 

5455
07:41:28,726 --> 07:41:35,725
destination network. Why does 
this matter? First, you can 

5456
07:41:35,949 --> 07:41:39,449
understand gap analysis and you 
can start to see where in the 

5457
07:41:39,666 --> 07:41:42,069
network you have coverage or you
don't. This is important if you 

5458
07:41:42,293 --> 07:41:45,136
are trying to provide a plea 
coverage across your entire 

5459
07:41:45,898 --> 07:41:49,291
enterprise network. What 
applications are you seeing? Are

5460
07:41:50,052 --> 07:41:56,074
you seeing specific ones or only
a subset? Again, this is 

5461
07:41:56,290 --> 07:41:58,290
important for metrics and 
analysis. Intelligence

5462
07:42:01,761 --> 07:42:04,162
-- what data is getting the most
hits and what intelligence is 

5463
07:42:04,386 --> 07:42:07,235
the most relevant to your 
environment? This is where the 

5464
07:42:07,447 --> 07:42:11,166
data modeling and data prep 
aspect really kicks in. We are 

5465
07:42:11,823 --> 07:42:18,054
able to tie it to the MITRE 
Kramer  to see what we are 

5466
07:42:18,217 --> 07:42:20,898
seeing. And what classification

5467
07:42:24,730 --> 07:42:26,730
speaks to the relevance and the 
prioritization that John 

5468
07:42:27,241 --> 07:42:31,944
mentioned. Also, how to do this 
against other things. For 

5469
07:42:32,695 --> 07:42:36,538
example, which patterns, etc. 
>> Finally, I want to summarize.

5470
07:42:37,303 --> 07:42:41,792
Our spirits was that Zeek was 
incredibly flexible  and useful 

5471
07:42:42,225 --> 07:42:45,818
for doing the crosscorrelation 
and detection and enterprise 

5472
07:42:45,980 --> 07:42:50,757
environment. It was useful to 
prepare and model the data 

5473
07:42:50,975 --> 07:42:53,601
upfront and then make sure that 
the correlation could be 

5474
07:42:54,364 --> 07:42:57,539
optimized for very large scale 
and high-speed. With that, I 

5475
07:42:58,302 --> 07:43:04,143
want to call out forever, 
whoever put in that &. 

5476
07:43:04,144 --> 07:43:11,136
>> This is an inside joke. With 
that I will take questions. 

5477
07:43:11,137 --> 07:43:16,880
>> Please join me in thanking 
Alan. 

5478
07:43:16,882 --> 07:43:18,882
>>

5479
07:43:21,271 --> 07:43:29,255
This made me giggle. Do you 
Zeek,  bro? We like those nerd 

5480
07:43:30,008 --> 07:43:33,194
jokes. 
>> I am moving on. It is my 

5481
07:43:33,411 --> 07:43:35,411
pleasure to introduce the next 
speaker,

5482
07:43:39,103 --> 07:43:41,103
Bob Rudis from Rapid7.  His talk

5483
07:43:45,229 --> 07:43:47,197
caught our eye because 
visualization is tough and good 

5484
07:43:47,198 --> 07:43:49,384
visualization is very tough. He 
has released an open source tool

5485
07:43:49,688 --> 07:43:52,443
which we love. Carrying, sharing
with the community and open 

5486
07:43:52,660 --> 07:43:56,694
tools everyone can use to do 
this. On that note please join 

5487
07:43:56,857 --> 07:44:00,538
me in welcoming Bob Rudis.  
>>

5488
07:44:03,693 --> 07:44:09,506
This is a talk for everyone but 
it is geared toward service 

5489
07:44:09,723 --> 07:44:13,446
writers and large organizations.
If you are in one of those 

5490
07:44:13,663 --> 07:44:17,816
categories, raise your hand. 
Hopefully as this evolves, how 

5491
07:44:18,257 --> 07:44:21,801
many people use R? Nice. 
>>

5492
07:44:26,566 --> 07:44:29,414
What I have tried to do is take 
some of the practices we are 

5493
07:44:29,631 --> 07:44:31,816
doing internally and open-source
them and give tools to folks so 

5494
07:44:32,039 --> 07:44:35,539
we can all make security better.
To help organizations have 

5495
07:44:35,755 --> 07:44:39,255
better security outcomes. 
Quickly about me, or 20 years I 

5496
07:44:39,483 --> 07:44:43,635
had a real job like most of you 
and then I did this thing called

5497
07:44:43,851 --> 07:44:47,570
the data breach investigation 
report and now I am the chief 

5498
07:44:48,007 --> 07:44:54,130
data scientist at Rapid7.  I am 
not out there in the trenches 

5499
07:44:54,347 --> 07:44:59,382
keeping organizations save every
day. I work at the lab where we 

5500
07:44:59,598 --> 07:45:02,880
do a lot of research and reports
and I do a lot of work and you 

5501
07:45:03,097 --> 07:45:07,910
are the unsung heroes of 
security. There is an old book 

5502
07:45:08,349 --> 07:45:10,349
out about this called data 
ribbon security that is five 

5503
07:45:10,536 --> 07:45:15,442
years old. If you would like to 
play with them data at Rapid7 

5504
07:45:20,816 --> 07:45:23,881
if you want to have at that it's
all yours. Sign up and go there 

5505
07:45:24,098 --> 07:45:26,941
if you want to do that. Folks 
that use R there are about 90 

5506
07:45:27,164 --> 07:45:30,006
packages related to cyber 
security. Have at that and there

5507
07:45:30,223 --> 07:45:34,379
is another one now. 
>> This is my obligatory MITRE 

5508
07:45:35,130 --> 07:45:38,591
attack.  I have been talking 
about ATT&CK  for about a year.

5509
07:45:42,254 --> 07:45:44,664
ATT&CK kept me in cybersecurity.
I was getting down about it for 

5510
07:45:44,880 --> 07:45:47,507
a while and when  ATT&CK came 
out I got invigorated because  

5511
07:45:47,723 --> 07:45:49,909
it was filling in missing gap. 
We have really embraced ATT&CK 

5512
07:45:50,660 --> 07:45:56,474
at  Rapid7 especially in the 
lab.  Where we deal with a bunch

5513
07:45:57,129 --> 07:46:00,414
of organizations dealing with 
response for them. For a while 

5514
07:46:00,631 --> 07:46:05,665
we were hand coding our 
incidents and the detections 

5515
07:46:06,099 --> 07:46:10,800
from the environment that they 
did. Starting in January this 

5516
07:46:10,963 --> 07:46:17,690
year that is an automated 
process simple to the automated 

5517
07:46:17,914 --> 07:46:20,316
processes you have heard here. I
love the theme of her today. 

5518
07:46:20,539 --> 07:46:24,254
Whoever organized this did an 
amazing job. You can do the 

5519
07:46:24,471 --> 07:46:29,507
automation and it will work. It 
is pretty cool. I will show you 

5520
07:46:29,725 --> 07:46:33,111
some of the results here. If you
want to see ATT&CK -based 

5521
07:46:33,276 --> 07:46:36,832
reports, our reports starting 
with this quarter are all 

5522
07:46:36,996 --> 07:46:41,315
basically doing ATT&CK -based 
metrics and all the other 

5523
07:46:41,538 --> 07:46:47,443
metrics out there except for the
other one you see. ATT&CK is 

5524
07:46:47,668 --> 07:46:50,507
mostly used on red and blue  
team, that's the way I've seen 

5525
07:46:51,268 --> 07:46:54,663
it used. You are out there in 
the trenches doing the work 

5526
07:46:54,879 --> 07:47:00,133
either defending or on the red 
team doing things. These are two

5527
07:47:00,350 --> 07:47:04,721
ways of using it but I don't see
ATT&CK  being used at this team 

5528
07:47:04,945 --> 07:47:11,285
and they are not colorful at the
layer team. My goal with this 

5529
07:47:11,505 --> 07:47:14,353
and we do this on a regular 
basis is to use ATT&CK at a 

5530
07:47:14,569 --> 07:47:19,163
macro level 2  convey what is 
going on across the customers 

5531
07:47:19,596 --> 07:47:22,222
and to the individual customers 
and at the industry level. We 

5532
07:47:22,445 --> 07:47:25,339
have the ability to have an idea
of what is happening. 

5533
07:47:25,340 --> 07:47:27,340
>>

5534
07:47:32,069 --> 07:47:35,402
I am not a big fan of this but I
think everyone is. 

5535
07:47:35,403 --> 07:47:39,942
>> Sorry, I one of those guys. 
It is all out there and you can 

5536
07:47:40,159 --> 07:47:44,756
grab it from there and we will 
get you a view so we don't have 

5537
07:47:44,972 --> 07:47:46,972
time to go to detail. First,

5538
07:47:51,535 --> 07:47:54,160
program everything but why am I 
doing this in R and trying to 

5539
07:47:54,377 --> 07:47:58,098
get you to use this? This is R. 
Open source like everything else

5540
07:47:58,315 --> 07:48:01,820
that you use. It is built for 
doing data science tasks 

5541
07:48:02,582 --> 07:48:05,751
including visualization. In this
case it has a rich echo system 

5542
07:48:06,503 --> 07:48:10,789
for doing data visualization and
that is one thing I like to do 

5543
07:48:11,005 --> 07:48:15,709
with it. R isn't just R. It has 
other tools. Can interface with 

5544
07:48:15,890 --> 07:48:18,262
everything. Whatever list you 
want,

5545
07:48:22,599 --> 07:48:24,786
it can interface with any 
language out there and you can 

5546
07:48:25,002 --> 07:48:27,194
use it effectively and a lot 
more effectively than you can 

5547
07:48:27,411 --> 07:48:30,476
for other languages. If you 
haven't tried it, I encourage 

5548
07:48:30,693 --> 07:48:34,193
you to give it a shot. If you 
are going to use R,  you need to

5549
07:48:34,409 --> 07:48:38,131
use R  Studio. It is a free 
product. The reason I'm saying 

5550
07:48:38,347 --> 07:48:45,570
to use this, it makes R, the way
I use it --  it's the best 

5551
07:48:46,538 --> 07:48:50,814
investigation console ever made.
Even though you don't know about

5552
07:48:51,038 --> 07:48:55,197
it you can do all sorts of 
things and you can execute 

5553
07:48:55,411 --> 07:49:00,883
things line by line. I will talk
about notebooks and a second. If

5554
07:49:01,097 --> 07:49:03,940
you are a fan you can you stop 
in notebook format and if you 

5555
07:49:04,164 --> 07:49:06,566
want to use your favorite 
language you can even like in a 

5556
07:49:06,789 --> 07:49:08,975
ripple 4. Our studio is a great 
environment for doing these 

5557
07:49:09,737 --> 07:49:12,690
things. It gives it more 
superpowers than it already has.

5558
07:49:12,913 --> 07:49:18,599
More reasons for why to use R. 
>>  The markdown is the main 

5559
07:49:19,255 --> 07:49:24,395
reason why doing things within 
the R context  work well. Or two

5560
07:49:24,559 --> 07:49:28,878
flavors. In notebook format 
where if you are one of those 

5561
07:49:29,101 --> 07:49:34,787
weird notebook fans,. I think 
browsers are for browsing. Just 

5562
07:49:35,548 --> 07:49:41,892
my opinion. You can write code 
for reports that you can write 

5563
07:49:42,056 --> 07:49:45,944
hereto. One thing that you get 
with this which I will show you 

5564
07:49:46,160 --> 07:49:48,441
is an already prebuilt report 
for generating some initial 

5565
07:49:48,668 --> 07:49:54,472
high-level visualizations that 
will be expanded over time. R  

5566
07:49:54,911 --> 07:49:59,067
markdown isn't just limited to 
the R language but you can do 

5567
07:49:59,284 --> 07:50:02,098
other things. You can do 
anything you want  and it is 

5568
07:50:02,265 --> 07:50:03,659
expandable and it does a lot of 
things. 

5569
07:50:03,660 --> 07:50:07,159
>> It can also do allocation 
building. It is a simple 

5570
07:50:07,383 --> 07:50:12,195
application building interface 
that ties in code and code logic

5571
07:50:12,412 --> 07:50:14,157
and presentation in a 
straightforward way. You can 

5572
07:50:14,158 --> 07:50:16,782
have the ability to create 
interactive presentations and 

5573
07:50:17,006 --> 07:50:21,163
one of the goals is toward the 
end I will help out an app so 

5574
07:50:21,379 --> 07:50:23,347
you can have the ability to do 
this. 

5575
07:50:23,348 --> 07:50:27,557
>> What is the purpose of ATT&CK
? Some of the initial

5576
07:50:35,379 --> 07:50:37,346
purpose is to show you the 
distribution of techniques 

5577
07:50:37,347 --> 07:50:39,347
across the customer base within 
a customer in a particular 

5578
07:50:39,534 --> 07:50:41,726
industry and however you want to
slice the categories. Where do 

5579
07:50:41,943 --> 07:50:44,344
we have technology that is as a 
provider or as an organization? 

5580
07:50:44,569 --> 07:50:46,970
Where do we have workforce gaps?
I will talk about that. Where 

5581
07:50:47,195 --> 07:50:48,940
should we invest our limited 
budget insert defense 

5582
07:50:48,941 --> 07:50:52,663
technologies or certain defense 
processes? How does this compare

5583
07:50:53,423 --> 07:50:57,692
with that? That could be 
anything. These tactics against 

5584
07:50:57,909 --> 07:50:59,909
these tactics or

5585
07:51:02,816 --> 07:51:08,412
you can do this because we have 
the ability to put this into a 

5586
07:51:08,628 --> 07:51:11,470
particular format. I will and 
with the dwell time trend. I am 

5587
07:51:11,694 --> 07:51:17,379
a big fan of this. We call this 
the detection deficit. I call 

5588
07:51:17,595 --> 07:51:21,974
the dwell time at work. One 
thing that you get with this is 

5589
07:51:22,192 --> 07:51:27,320
a prebuilt set of things that 
make it easier to use the CTI 

5590
07:51:27,485 --> 07:51:31,595
format. The previous speaker 
said you can stare at this and 

5591
07:51:31,818 --> 07:51:35,317
it's like looking at the heart 
of this but it will drive you 

5592
07:51:35,534 --> 07:51:41,221
mad. It is not suited for data 
science tasks. As I told Katie I

5593
07:51:41,443 --> 07:51:44,284
am not a big fan of Excel but 
I'm a big fan of rectangular 

5594
07:51:44,506 --> 07:51:49,318
data. I have made these 
rectangular and put it here so 

5595
07:51:49,535 --> 07:51:51,938
you can use it and I provided 
other tools and mechanisms for 

5596
07:51:52,164 --> 07:51:55,005
you to take the data and enable 
it to do other kinds of tasks 

5597
07:51:55,767 --> 07:51:59,600
with the tasks on there. I will 
not go through this are. This is

5598
07:51:59,817 --> 07:52:03,848
a teaser and you can do this. 
The thing about this is, every 

5599
07:52:04,015 --> 07:52:09,500
time they grab this and rebuild 
the package and ties it and

5600
07:52:17,627 --> 07:52:23,258
we use MITRE and  code our 
incidents. Some of it is through

5601
07:52:24,538 --> 07:52:28,037
automation and some of it is 
done themselves. This is a 

5602
07:52:28,253 --> 07:52:30,879
sample I am using that is the 
foundation of the data and I 

5603
07:52:31,319 --> 07:52:35,291
have other visualizations based 
here. Don't get hung up on this.

5604
07:52:36,131 --> 07:52:38,535
I will support using whatever 
you want whether it is the STIX 

5605
07:52:39,300 --> 07:52:44,004
on , STIX format of the sharing 
of these things that are out 

5606
07:52:44,220 --> 07:52:53,847
there,  I hope that VERIS and  
SDN  -- ATT&CK will have a love 

5607
07:52:54,063 --> 07:53:00,845
child to give us a great  use of
this. So this is -- what you get

5608
07:53:01,069 --> 07:53:03,689
out of the box with this? You 
will have the ability to analyze

5609
07:53:03,912 --> 07:53:06,755
the metrics and produce heat 
maps in a way that I like to do 

5610
07:53:06,971 --> 07:53:10,694
this. I hope to convince you of 
this. Also relative ATT&CK  

5611
07:53:11,673 --> 07:53:16,164
distributions. The thing on the 
left is one giant HTML page that

5612
07:53:16,925 --> 07:53:22,065
was generated. What you see 
copied and pasted are some of 

5613
07:53:22,288 --> 07:53:24,752
the expanded sections. Let's go 
through some of them. 

5614
07:53:24,753 --> 07:53:30,601
>> This is all you do. You do 
this by going into the package 

5615
07:53:30,815 --> 07:53:37,375
and starting a new R file  and 
it magically makes these charts 

5616
07:53:38,129 --> 07:53:43,505
for you. You don't have to do 
any work except to get the data 

5617
07:53:43,721 --> 07:53:46,348
in the format. I took a sample 
of all our incidents and created

5618
07:53:46,565 --> 07:53:49,081
this. I created a distribution 
based upon these incidents and 

5619
07:53:49,243 --> 07:53:52,692
created a selected sample of the
distribution for putting it into

5620
07:53:52,907 --> 07:53:58,163
the packet. You get real life 
incidents or at least a picture 

5621
07:53:58,381 --> 07:54:00,349
of real-life incidents based on 
the distributions that we've 

5622
07:54:00,350 --> 07:54:04,504
seen. Removing some things like 
talking points. One thing is you

5623
07:54:04,722 --> 07:54:09,792
get to see dwell time is upon 
this data set. The cool thing 

5624
07:54:09,976 --> 07:54:13,471
about this is, the whole idea is
that you want to reduce the 

5625
07:54:13,914 --> 07:54:16,314
dwell time. You have the ability
to show the reports and have 

5626
07:54:16,538 --> 07:54:22,006
them available and to them over 
time. This is looking at -- this

5627
07:54:22,222 --> 07:54:25,064
is the overall one and this is 
by quarter and this looks at the

5628
07:54:25,288 --> 07:54:29,438
overall and it's hard to see but
you basically get the overtime 

5629
07:54:29,664 --> 07:54:32,288
view of how you are doing with 
the dwell time so you can 

5630
07:54:32,503 --> 07:54:34,503
communicate that to show how 
well your technology is doing. 

5631
07:54:34,689 --> 07:54:37,755
Working on these things. You can
generate that in different ways.

5632
07:54:37,972 --> 07:54:40,600
There is a heat map view of 
doing the dwell time as well. 

5633
07:54:40,814 --> 07:54:44,319
That you can look at it more 
specifically and this is a 

5634
07:54:44,535 --> 07:54:48,691
better view. You can look at the
dwell time specifically by month

5635
07:54:48,908 --> 07:54:51,101
instead of by quarter. There's 
different ways to do this. If 

5636
07:54:51,318 --> 07:54:53,318
you want more views

5637
07:54:57,221 --> 07:55:00,285
, if you want to submit an issue
I will put it out there. it's 

5638
07:55:00,502 --> 07:55:03,347
not that much work and it's not 
that hard to copy and paste a 

5639
07:55:03,564 --> 07:55:05,533
template coat. 
>> I love this heat map versus 

5640
07:55:05,534 --> 07:55:07,534
the one I've seen produced 
showing the entire framework and

5641
07:55:07,720 --> 07:55:09,908
then you've got little things 
colored hair in there. I created

5642
07:55:10,131 --> 07:55:14,287
a way, with one call to one R 
potion to generate a heat  map 

5643
07:55:14,503 --> 07:55:18,233
with the most current technique 
within that particular tactic 

5644
07:55:18,442 --> 07:55:20,442
and put it out there.

5645
07:55:23,473 --> 07:55:26,096
you can do it proportionately 
this way or you can do it over 

5646
07:55:26,319 --> 07:55:28,945
time. I will go back to this. 
One of also done here is 

5647
07:55:29,161 --> 07:55:31,348
deliberately left out some 
things we had because you get to

5648
07:55:31,564 --> 07:55:34,630
immediate Lee see the gaps. You 
know that this is nowhere as 

5649
07:55:34,847 --> 07:55:40,533
near as big as the entire MITRE 
framework  and this discovery is

5650
07:55:40,757 --> 07:55:42,944
missing from this particular 
one. I did that on purpose. I 

5651
07:55:43,160 --> 07:55:45,563
will talk more about why that is
important in a minute. Being 

5652
07:55:45,787 --> 07:55:48,845
able to see where things are 
there is almost as important as 

5653
07:55:49,068 --> 07:55:51,688
seeing where things are or where
they are because you may have to

5654
07:55:51,912 --> 07:55:54,751
deal with but the gaps are. 
>> You can see it over time to 

5655
07:55:54,975 --> 07:55:58,909
see what has changed over the 
quarter. I want to go to this 

5656
07:55:59,126 --> 07:56:04,376
one and land on this. This is a 
cumulative distribution and the 

5657
07:56:04,599 --> 07:56:07,001
numbers are hard to see. It is 
probably easier online. You can 

5658
07:56:07,225 --> 07:56:10,506
look at the slides. What I've 
done is, it accumulates the 

5659
07:56:10,723 --> 07:56:14,239
tactics and techniques that 
occurred and sums them up and 

5660
07:56:14,438 --> 07:56:18,595
you get the percentage of those 
and add them over since we have 

5661
07:56:18,819 --> 07:56:26,251
a really nice open source chain 
to use to see the things 

5662
07:56:26,474 --> 07:56:30,411
progress over each individual 
category. I think there is a 

5663
07:56:30,629 --> 07:56:35,002
button. You can see that there 
are gaps in privilege escalation

5664
07:56:35,225 --> 07:56:37,844
and lateral movement. We can do 
which will be in the package is,

5665
07:56:38,068 --> 07:56:41,191
rolled down into what is in each

what isn't it there? That is a 

5668
07:56:51,191 --> 07:56:53,191
great conversation to have about
maybe the folks that your 

5669
07:56:53,376 --> 07:56:56,000
customers may have technology 
gaps. Things that detect and 

5670
07:56:56,224 --> 07:56:58,224
things that are feeding into 
your different environ to 

5671
07:56:58,721 --> 07:57:02,786
defining things. You may have 
gaps or an incident responder 

5672
07:57:03,003 --> 07:57:05,189
that doesn't like to deal with 
those types of events.

have some more tools at your

>>

5690
07:58:54,487 --> 07:58:56,487
Thank you, that is humbling.

5691
07:59:01,189 --> 07:59:03,625
Thank you for attending. I want 
to talk about the data, it is 

5692
07:59:03,839 --> 07:59:05,839
kind of important to me.

5693
07:59:10,943 --> 07:59:14,395
There is multiple ways to 
achieve that I believe. We 

5694
07:59:14,625 --> 07:59:19,612
probably don't have that much 
time. I have been in for a long 

5695
07:59:19,774 --> 07:59:25,040
time, working from the defensive
side. Working to learn more, the

5696
07:59:25,195 --> 07:59:29,631
most important to me is 
basically data I love data 

5697
07:59:29,832 --> 07:59:36,538
anyway you can get it. I didn't 
always be in this, I used to be 

5698
07:59:37,298 --> 07:59:40,607
a photographer. Which actually 
helps me get a different 

5699
07:59:40,808 --> 07:59:48,931
perspective of things. Sharing 
away from tunnel vision. I have 

5700
07:59:49,132 --> 07:59:52,486
two boys I truly love. Onwards. 
This is also,

5701
07:59:59,439 --> 08:00:06,199
. If you don't know yourself and
your data, your enemy. Just 

5702
08:00:06,401 --> 08:00:10,253
chasing whatever you want to do,
without a focus where you want 

5703
08:00:11,005 --> 08:00:16,099
to go. So the data is very 
important. Everybody knows this.

5704
08:00:19,607 --> 08:00:24,748
You don't have to read it, it 
fits on us live, slide. Having 

5705
08:00:24,881 --> 08:00:26,611
The the important current thing 
coverage is talking to it.about 

5706
08:00:26,612 --> 08:00:31,457
coverage. For this  example 
everything has the same value. 

5707
08:00:31,858 --> 08:00:35,732
Readable but some of them, you 
than have othersmore . The next 

5708
08:00:35,933 --> 08:00:42,038
thing you might be doing, just 
to have focus into where you 

5709
08:00:42,238 --> 08:00:47,715
want to go. With people that 
like the pictures. Again how do 

5710
08:00:47,927 --> 08:00:53,814
you achieve that coverage. There
is a lot of techniques, probably

5711
08:00:54,015 --> 08:00:59,500
in multiple ways, to execute 
them. How do achieve this. There

5712
08:00:59,701 --> 08:01:03,922
are multiple ways, playing with 
the tools, see what is 

5713
08:01:04,081 --> 08:01:06,081
generating.

5714
08:01:08,246 --> 08:01:10,246
You also need a lot of this 
stuff.

5715
08:01:15,150 --> 08:01:24,691
With these tools are maybe more.
And what I also get, we begin, 

5716
08:01:25,105 --> 08:01:32,410
usually you start with the stuff
you're scared about, or see okay

5717
08:01:32,625 --> 08:01:35,664
where do I have a correlation 
and start with that. Just an 

5718
08:01:35,864 --> 08:01:42,368
easy way of starting. A simple 
toolkit. But I figured it should

5719
08:01:43,132 --> 08:01:45,132
be portable

5720
08:01:51,923 --> 08:01:55,376
it's not the best tool, some 
love it, some hate it. And then 

5721
08:01:55,577 --> 08:02:04,027
also power shell, which is 
available. On Mac and Linux,

5722
08:02:07,090 --> 08:02:09,090
but nothing

5723
08:02:11,427 --> 08:02:16,031
besides power shell, I like it 
actually. In the script I 

5724
08:02:16,187 --> 08:02:20,312
provide, you get a nice file, 
you can load it to the 

5725
08:02:20,473 --> 08:02:28,890
navigator. Essentially the Excel
sheet, that framework I ingest 

5726
08:02:29,106 --> 08:02:37,632
the whole thing. And we put it 
into the right columns. So there

5727
08:02:38,392 --> 08:02:43,733
is a rates workbook, I rated 
every technique, and then the 

5728
08:02:44,135 --> 08:02:50,434
data sources, the most important
. This is super biased, the word

5729
08:02:50,635 --> 08:02:57,339
of the day. My interpretation of
the technique. If you don't 

5730
08:02:57,540 --> 08:02:59,573
trust me go through them and 
adjust accordingly. And the 

5731
08:03:00,336 --> 08:03:06,477
important point, the rating. I 
will begin to later, just to 

5732
08:03:06,892 --> 08:03:11,963
show you an overview. This is 
the data source one. You can 

5733
08:03:12,726 --> 08:03:18,467
read this or drill in a little 
bit. These are all techniques 

5734
08:03:18,669 --> 08:03:22,871
with the data sources. I gave 
them a rating which adds up to 

5735
08:03:23,030 --> 08:03:26,914
100 as a total rating score. 
That is important, later

5736
08:03:30,862 --> 08:03:33,911
when I select your data coverage
before every technique. For 

5737
08:03:34,113 --> 08:03:40,002
example if there are five, there
might be one that's the most 

5738
08:03:40,202 --> 08:03:44,473
important one for that 
technique. Some I deem less 

5739
08:03:44,674 --> 08:03:50,359
important for the technique. To 
the rating work, basically what 

5740
08:03:51,124 --> 08:03:56,664
I did, I went through the data 
sources and tied them to a 

5741
08:03:56,865 --> 08:03:58,865
joining event posts.

5742
08:04:02,150 --> 08:04:08,857
It is definitely not complete, 
just what I usually encounter. 

5743
08:04:09,257 --> 08:04:14,544
So you can add your own event 
IDs. With your logs and so on. 

5744
08:04:14,745 --> 08:04:16,745
And then you rate them and 
complete

5745
08:04:20,834 --> 08:04:23,228
and availability. How well are 
you covering it throughout your 

5746
08:04:23,386 --> 08:04:25,980
network. How quickly you get it 
into your loading environment. 

5747
08:04:26,135 --> 08:04:31,511
Which might be important as 
well. And where do you store it.

5748
08:04:31,824 --> 08:04:35,580
Do you ship it or keep it 
locally.

5749
08:04:40,145 --> 08:04:45,834
So that will be calculated into 
a mathematical score. But now 

5750
08:04:46,035 --> 08:04:51,722
you complete the ability, mostly
by the index time instead of 

5751
08:04:51,922 --> 08:04:57,609
generated time and so on. 
Definitely easier. What I do 

5752
08:04:57,810 --> 08:05:02,896
then, basically, I fact that her
the total score. At the right. 

5753
08:05:03,097 --> 08:05:09,604
And I calculate that against the
weight of the data source. To 

5754
08:05:09,804 --> 08:05:13,255
give you coverage for the 
technique in the end. So I do 

5755
08:05:13,456 --> 08:05:21,790
that through power shell. But if
this works, so basically I 

5756
08:05:21,992 --> 08:05:25,042
create the module for you that 
you install. And basically 

5757
08:05:25,245 --> 08:05:29,100
there's a couple of functions. 
You can download the latest tech

5758
08:05:29,861 --> 08:05:35,306
file which updated a couple of 
days ago. Thank you.

5759
08:05:39,255 --> 08:05:41,708
And you can updated then, so you
update your Excel sheet with the

5760
08:05:42,440 --> 08:05:47,793
same module . you can request an
adjacent file. I also added some

5761
08:05:47,995 --> 08:05:56,320
new features where I have some 
issues. You can see where you 

5762
08:05:56,520 --> 08:06:01,603
can apply at best. And now they 
are starting to make connection,

5763
08:06:01,804 --> 08:06:05,472
to make ability more so working 
towards implementing this into 

5764
08:06:05,672 --> 08:06:12,783
my tool book. It is a short demo
basically showing you, whenever 

5765
08:06:12,979 --> 08:06:17,863
you generate an adjacent file. 
With the PowerShell command did 

5766
08:06:18,065 --> 08:06:24,969
you get  this. And you see the 
total coverage for that 

5767
08:06:25,171 --> 08:06:29,180
technique. Also the stuff you 
are missing. So maybe it's not 

5768
08:06:29,338 --> 08:06:34,929
important but at least you know 
you are missing it. You have 

5769
08:06:35,129 --> 08:06:41,631
proper coverage in your fine. 
And the cool part about this, 

5770
08:06:42,033 --> 08:06:45,440
and the change log this morning 
I saw, now we are able to export

5771
08:06:47,517 --> 08:06:52,186
as well. So you can look it up 
in Excel again. Instead of 

5772
08:06:52,387 --> 08:07:00,110
hovering over all of these 
boxes. So I was already ranting 

5773
08:07:00,311 --> 08:07:02,760
a little bit about that. There 
are a couple of ways I perceive 

5774
08:07:02,961 --> 08:07:06,548
it can be used. Not only for 
grading and alert but for 

5775
08:07:06,710 --> 08:07:12,257
response. And if you initialize 
that basically the way I look at

5776
08:07:12,419 --> 08:07:20,229
it, to properly cover everything
, usually I deem techniques a 

5777
08:07:20,430 --> 08:07:24,897
little lower for instance 
hunting. It takes more time to 

5778
08:07:25,098 --> 08:07:29,300
dig into it. There's less 
pressure on false positive 

5779
08:07:29,460 --> 08:07:31,460
rates.

5780
08:07:33,435 --> 08:07:36,070
In the likelihood of covering 
the technique fully, is higher 

5781
08:07:36,472 --> 08:07:42,976
than when you start doing this. 
It's not exact science, it is my

5782
08:07:43,726 --> 08:07:45,726
opinion again

5783
08:07:52,735 --> 08:07:55,168
, so please bear with me there. 
I did the same thing basically. 

5784
08:07:55,369 --> 08:07:57,805
I added them all up and looked 
at the data sources, with the 

5785
08:07:58,006 --> 08:08:00,857
name is and what it does. And I 
rated it. I will zoom and again,

5786
08:08:01,058 --> 08:08:03,293
sorry. Basically on a 1 to 5 
scale, having full coverage for 

5787
08:08:04,058 --> 08:08:10,715
the technique. Later on it will 
be more granular. As I said,

5788
08:08:14,265 --> 08:08:18,273
for six months, that was another
caveat. It's amazing, a lot of 

5789
08:08:18,434 --> 08:08:24,835
coverage. But mind you, the 
actual way of covering it was 

5790
08:08:25,036 --> 08:08:29,210
probably a little bit more. 
Actually the orange one.

5791
08:08:32,757 --> 08:08:35,996
The right side of the spectrum. 
This partially has to do with 

5792
08:08:36,411 --> 08:08:40,831
six months, you have to 
configure it. Some with a big 

5793
08:08:40,989 --> 08:08:47,792
load. But also, the gap in the 
quality of the data sources. It 

5794
08:08:47,993 --> 08:08:51,745
is not perfect. I know they are 
working on it

5795
08:08:56,733 --> 08:08:59,366
. I am hopeful, I want to help 
them as well. This is something 

5796
08:08:59,567 --> 08:09:01,601
you have to keep in mind 
throughout the whole thing. It 

5797
08:09:01,801 --> 08:09:03,801
won't be a full assessment that 
guides you.

5798
08:09:08,507 --> 08:09:10,945
You have to find it there, keep 
that in mind. And as I 

5799
08:09:11,146 --> 08:09:14,331
mentioned, I am working on the 
mitigation, how it goes with the

5800
08:09:14,491 --> 08:09:18,251
mitigations in the latest 
updates, which I didn't have 

5801
08:09:18,466 --> 08:09:20,466
time to include.

5802
08:09:24,556 --> 08:09:27,809
But the same process goes there 
as well. So all of the defenses 

5803
08:09:28,010 --> 08:09:34,304
can be weighed, and how easy it 
is to bypass, to cover it. With 

5804
08:09:34,504 --> 08:09:38,320
three minutes left, part of the 
roadmap is adding the 

5805
08:09:38,482 --> 08:09:43,041
mitigations. But also I'm 
working with a colleague, Yost, 

5806
08:09:43,791 --> 08:09:47,924
on graphing the framework and 
what we did there was actually, 

5807
08:09:48,686 --> 08:09:50,919
the tactics are really linear.

5808
08:09:55,028 --> 08:10:03,358
With the kill chain does. Back 
and forth. So into tech, or a 

5809
08:10:04,118 --> 08:10:10,867
graph sorry. This is where you 
can fill in the sheet that shows

5810
08:10:11,082 --> 08:10:15,339
you the import with the ratings,
and it will show you the 

5811
08:10:15,753 --> 08:10:21,442
coverage here, and attckr can't 
take the whole path, it has to 

5812
08:10:21,640 --> 08:10:26,260
go another way . Easier to focus
again where you should be 

5813
08:10:26,425 --> 08:10:28,425
covering.

5814
08:10:30,381 --> 08:10:34,234
And if you have an EDR, this and
that, I probably need to go 

5815
08:10:34,434 --> 08:10:41,903
there and there. It works both 
ways. And one minute left, 

5816
08:10:42,061 --> 08:10:46,937
questions? Thank you. 
>> [applause]

>>

5818
08:10:53,737 --> 08:10:59,626
I didn't expect that either. Any
questions? Any questions at all 

5819
08:10:59,826 --> 08:11:05,175
for Olaf Hartong ? I really 
appreciate your gifts and your 

5820
08:11:06,063 --> 08:11:12,429
animation. Good for the end of 
the day. We appreciate it . grab

5821
08:11:12,631 --> 08:11:14,631
him at the reception. [applause]
>>

5822
08:11:18,520 --> 08:11:21,974
Grab him at the reception and 
pick his brain a little bit. I 

5823
08:11:22,175 --> 08:11:27,262
love the design background, it 
shows in the slides right. So 

5824
08:11:27,462 --> 08:11:30,916
now to wrap up the day, we can 
look back to the bigger picture.

5825
08:11:31,118 --> 08:11:34,460
Again it's a pleasure to 
introduce my teammates.

5826
08:11:38,435 --> 08:11:43,305
Richard Struse, I rely on him  
to pull me out from the tactical

5827
08:11:43,506 --> 08:11:45,540
level, thinking more 
strategically. The 

5828
08:11:45,741 --> 08:11:52,447
self-described idea guide. That 
is his thing. Also a cochair 

5829
08:11:52,647 --> 08:11:55,197
with the cyber intelligence, 
national standards organization.

5830
08:11:59,353 --> 08:12:04,223
Really active in the community. 
He flies around the world 

5831
08:12:04,438 --> 08:12:08,096
talking to people about the idea
of attack and threatened 

5832
08:12:09,055 --> 08:12:14,998
informed consent. Please join me
in welcoming Richard Struse . 

5833
08:12:15,198 --> 08:12:17,198
>> [applause] 
>>

5834
08:12:19,869 --> 08:12:29,167
The idea guy. Thank you all for 
sticking with us. Before I get 

5835
08:12:29,326 --> 08:12:35,870
into the meat of my talk, I want
to do three shout outs for some 

5836
08:12:36,022 --> 08:12:41,109
folks that have done an amazing 
job today. First our host

5837
08:12:45,473 --> 08:12:50,550
Katie Nickels, she has done a 
fabulous job . And second, soon 

5838
08:12:50,744 --> 08:12:54,760
to be on the today show. Jamie 
Williams.

5839
08:12:59,839 --> 08:13:04,355
And third maybe a less visible, 
but definitely very important, 

5840
08:13:05,328 --> 08:13:14,927
Adam Pennington. [applause] 
>> So, 

5841
08:13:15,328 --> 08:13:18,178
I just want to reward you for 
sticking through was something 

5842
08:13:18,379 --> 08:13:22,343
that's been easy to digest . we 
don't have any cat means, no 

5843
08:13:22,985 --> 08:13:28,939
magic uniforms, unicorns. I do 
want to talk, sit back and think

5844
08:13:29,141 --> 08:13:33,561
about what it is, when we start 
the talk about defense, what it 

5845
08:13:33,726 --> 08:13:36,753
means, what is the call to 
action.

5846
08:13:40,523 --> 08:13:42,523
So this is about action, a 
community made out of 

5847
08:13:42,569 --> 08:13:47,986
practitioners the doers . I am 
the idea guy, exhorting you to 

5848
08:13:48,148 --> 08:13:54,747
action. A neat job because you 
all invite such an amazing 

5849
08:13:54,946 --> 08:14:00,229
spirit of can do. Whether it is 
Olaf, or John, an amazing amount

5850
08:14:00,993 --> 08:14:06,316
of energy. That is great. How do
we focus and challenge that? 

5851
08:14:06,517 --> 08:14:10,384
About a year and a half ago I 
started using this term. Maybe 

5852
08:14:10,584 --> 08:14:16,173
two years ago now. Heightened 
informed defense. Not a new idea

5853
08:14:18,302 --> 08:14:20,755
. Maybe I wasn't the first 
person to use this term . you 

5854
08:14:20,950 --> 08:14:25,206
are all Precht missioners of 
informed defense, where the you 

5855
08:14:25,420 --> 08:14:31,912
call it that or not . but it's a
value, and putting a name to it,

5856
08:14:32,113 --> 08:14:34,113
to help us as a discipline

5857
08:14:36,796 --> 08:14:38,796
, start to understand and 
communicate that to each other. 

5858
08:14:38,829 --> 08:14:41,064
And also help people understand 
the value and extent of what we 

5859
08:14:41,265 --> 08:14:43,265
are doing. It really is a 
different paradigm.

5860
08:14:46,739 --> 08:14:48,773
Gary and his remarks earlier 
today, a nice job talking about 

5861
08:14:49,388 --> 08:14:54,260
the evolution. The vulnerability
centered model, to the world we 

5862
08:14:54,460 --> 08:14:57,110
are in today, at least in this 
room. A lot of people who will 

5863
08:14:57,871 --> 08:15:03,196
catch up. With part of what my 
message will be . but seeing the

5864
08:15:03,397 --> 08:15:08,079
great shift from vulnerability 
centric, fully patched, then 

5865
08:15:08,279 --> 08:15:10,646
you're good to go, to an 
understanding that is not 

5866
08:15:10,804 --> 08:15:16,002
enough. So threatened informed 
defenses, the recognition, just 

5867
08:15:16,202 --> 08:15:19,856
understanding the 
vulnerabilities. What your 

5868
08:15:20,057 --> 08:15:25,343
configurations are is critical, 
necessary but not sufficient., 

5869
08:15:25,552 --> 08:15:30,014
One of the cautionary notes, I 
dare talk to groups about attack

5870
08:15:30,776 --> 08:15:34,591
and defense. I often try to be 
really clear

5871
08:15:38,552 --> 08:15:40,988
. Teaching you to do this, I see
you as ambassadors of this 

5872
08:15:41,189 --> 08:15:44,442
community. And that is attacked 
and threatened informed consent 

5873
08:15:44,843 --> 08:15:46,843
is not a panacea.

5874
08:15:51,546 --> 08:15:53,582
It's not a dust you can sprinkle
on an otherwise insecure 

5875
08:15:53,783 --> 08:15:55,818
environment and make it better. 
If your environment has single 

5876
08:15:56,579 --> 08:16:03,142
factor domain, password's, a 
flat and segmented network. Any 

5877
08:16:03,328 --> 08:16:05,328
number, you don't understand 
what your assets are. You don't 

5878
08:16:05,362 --> 08:16:11,997
need ATT&CKcon ,  ATT&CK , you 
need basic hygiene on other 

5879
08:16:12,154 --> 08:16:16,734
things. Once you are tall enough
to ride the ride, then and only 

5880
08:16:16,935 --> 08:16:21,820
then are you ready to actually 
go to the connect level to get 

5881
08:16:22,020 --> 08:16:27,091
inside the adversaries decision 
room and figure out how to be 

5882
08:16:27,303 --> 08:16:29,303
there waiting for them before 
they get there

5883
08:16:32,576 --> 08:16:34,822
. It is a critical message. When
you're talking to colleagues and

5884
08:16:35,586 --> 08:16:39,694
friends, coworkers.  Maybe I 
need the ATT&CK thing. Make sure

5885
08:16:39,894 --> 08:16:43,348
they are really ready , tall 
enough to ride the ride. The 

5886
08:16:43,548 --> 08:16:46,396
last thing we want to do as a 
community is to turn into a 

5887
08:16:47,157 --> 08:16:51,468
machine, self-perpetuating 
motion machine, where we just 

5888
08:16:51,682 --> 08:16:56,300
talk to each other about how 
awesome ATT&CK is. It is awesome

5889
08:16:58,789 --> 08:17:01,158
but we have to be responsible. 
Threatened informed defense is 

5890
08:17:01,316 --> 08:17:06,509
taking ATT&CK and beyond and 
using that knowledge , 

5891
08:17:06,716 --> 08:17:08,716
dramatically, the keyword to 
understand and prioritize and 

5892
08:17:08,855 --> 08:17:10,855
define the defenses.

5893
08:17:14,632 --> 08:17:17,069
One of the interesting things if
you ask me where the primary use

5894
08:17:17,270 --> 08:17:20,322
case of attack, we can talk 
about coverage assessment, 

5895
08:17:21,287 --> 08:17:27,226
adversary emulation. Actually 
number one is communication.  I 

5896
08:17:27,427 --> 08:17:32,099
think ATT&CK fundamentally  is 
communication. It's a way of 

5897
08:17:32,299 --> 08:17:36,569
thinking about and describing, 
talking about what adversaries 

5898
08:17:36,770 --> 08:17:39,565
are doing, what you are doing 
and response, what a product can

5899
08:17:39,722 --> 08:17:45,515
do, what the blue team found, it
is such a simple idea, that's 

5900
08:17:45,705 --> 08:17:50,835
where the brilliance is. A 
brilliantly simple concept. And 

5901
08:17:50,997 --> 08:17:56,880
the size of this community, the 
acceleration of the adoption of 

5902
08:17:57,094 --> 08:18:00,544
the framework is testimony to 
the brilliance of the idea. That

5903
08:18:00,745 --> 08:18:06,634
was created here, just a few 
years ago. And so this is the 

5904
08:18:06,835 --> 08:18:14,959
point, the fact that I can color
a square. Pick a puzzle piece. I

5905
08:18:15,173 --> 08:18:21,673
hope you appreciate of the 
puzzle. And heaven unambiguous 

5906
08:18:22,075 --> 08:18:24,075
concrete tangible conversation.

5907
08:18:26,545 --> 08:18:30,197
A simple idea but really 
powerful. In this world of 

5908
08:18:30,399 --> 08:18:36,097
threatened informed can be 
meaningful to you, whatever 

5909
08:18:36,298 --> 08:18:38,298
context it is.

5910
08:18:41,378 --> 08:18:43,812
That is the other great thing 
about ATTACK, it can be used in 

5911
08:18:44,013 --> 08:18:47,063
so many different context  for 
so many different ways. Anytime 

5912
08:18:47,263 --> 08:18:52,549
you have a tool or an approach 
that can be repurposed, reused 

5913
08:18:52,750 --> 08:18:54,983
so many times, all of a sudden 
it becomes worth the investment.

5914
08:18:55,184 --> 08:18:58,031
That is the other thing we are 
seeing here,  ATTACK has proven 

5915
08:18:58,232 --> 08:19:00,667
to be a great investment for  
individuals and for 

5916
08:19:01,430 --> 08:19:05,910
organizations. 
>> So Shane,

5917
08:19:10,016 --> 08:19:12,016
Shane did an amazing thing

5918
08:19:15,099 --> 08:19:17,479
a number of years ago. He 
created a game. Basically 

5919
08:19:17,640 --> 08:19:22,203
modeled around ATTACK. When I 
saw this game, literally , I was

5920
08:19:22,405 --> 08:19:26,619
so blown away by it. That 
inspired me to start thinking 

5921
08:19:26,781 --> 08:19:32,104
about ATTACK is a game board . 
If I am an adversary, looking at

5922
08:19:32,269 --> 08:19:38,450
this ATTACK , from my 
perspective. Green means I can 

5923
08:19:38,664 --> 08:19:44,553
land on that spot. I can safely 
move from that spot, do what I 

5924
08:19:44,754 --> 08:19:48,607
want from that spot. I want to 
play this game. I want to play 

5925
08:19:48,821 --> 08:19:53,692
it every day. Because it's a 
low-cost, low risk, low 

5926
08:19:54,653 --> 08:20:00,395
uncertainty environment. And the
unfortunate reality is, this is 

5927
08:20:00,597 --> 08:20:06,285
the game adversary will play. 
I'm not sure none of your 

5928
08:20:06,485 --> 08:20:09,122
organizations are here, but in 
far too many places throughout 

5929
08:20:09,873 --> 08:20:11,873
critical infrastructure

5930
08:20:14,010 --> 08:20:16,010
and the supply chains, certainly
small and medium-size 

5931
08:20:16,191 --> 08:20:19,078
enterprises . even larger 
enterprises, this is the game 

5932
08:20:19,280 --> 08:20:23,760
board the adversary sees. Do you
want to play this game if you're

5933
08:20:24,523 --> 08:20:29,958
the adversary? So that is 
something that must change.

5934
08:20:34,933 --> 08:20:37,156
If we wonder why we are always 
playing catch-up as a community,

5935
08:20:37,369 --> 08:20:40,610
I would argue that is one of the
reasons. Because the adversary 

5936
08:20:40,825 --> 08:20:47,119
has so much room to move. So 
much freedom. And they get to 

5937
08:20:47,312 --> 08:20:50,476
choose the time and place, they 
get to move wherever they want.

5938
08:20:57,065 --> 08:20:59,065
So they recognize that must 
change. We should start thinking

5939
08:20:59,099 --> 08:21:04,789
about this as a game, we like to
play games, it's fun, not work. 

5940
08:21:04,985 --> 08:21:07,220
So how do we start as a 
community, if or already doing 

5941
08:21:07,985 --> 08:21:09,985
this today.

5942
08:21:14,340 --> 08:21:16,575
Adding focus to the reference, 
to begin to change the rules of 

5943
08:21:16,776 --> 08:21:19,010
this game. To take those safe 
landing spots off the game board

5944
08:21:19,211 --> 08:21:22,261
for the adversaries . it's not 
something we will do overnight. 

5945
08:21:22,663 --> 08:21:28,766
If any of you think you can do 
it overnight. It is something we

5946
08:21:28,965 --> 08:21:30,965
can and should do

5947
08:21:35,872 --> 08:21:37,905
, we must do that the 
imperative, the call to action 

5948
08:21:38,121 --> 08:21:40,742
is we must begin to remove the 
spots. We have to do it every 

5949
08:21:40,943 --> 08:21:43,377
week. We have to do it every 
month. Every quarter . we have 

5950
08:21:43,591 --> 08:21:46,628
to do it every year. We have to 
continuously be working to get 

5951
08:21:46,842 --> 08:21:52,316
to the point where that is all 
in red. Will we get there, 

5952
08:21:53,067 --> 08:21:57,599
probably not. But if you're an 
adversary do you want to play 

5953
08:21:58,363 --> 08:22:04,000
this game? Not nearly as much. 
Because this

5954
08:22:08,978 --> 08:22:10,609
cup from an adversary 
perspective, a high-cost, high 

5955
08:22:10,610 --> 08:22:12,610
risk, high uncertainty 
environment. Where most of the 

5956
08:22:12,745 --> 08:22:18,116
time the stuff we try doesn't 
work, and when it does work your

5957
08:22:18,317 --> 08:22:20,876
then beginning to question, did 
this work because the adversary,

5958
08:22:21,251 --> 08:22:26,146
because my victim wanted it to 
work? A deception environment

5959
08:22:29,288 --> 08:22:31,724
. You start to be able to play 
with the adversary, manage the 

5960
08:22:31,938 --> 08:22:34,773
adversary. That's the world we 
need to begin. That's the world 

5961
08:22:34,975 --> 08:22:40,059
I believe we can be in. If we 
continue the great work that 

5962
08:22:40,261 --> 08:22:42,695
this community has been doing, 
if we accelerate that work and 

5963
08:22:43,459 --> 08:22:45,459
provide focus.

5964
08:22:47,782 --> 08:22:50,214
Again I want to be clear, we 
will not get here tomorrow, not 

5965
08:22:50,415 --> 08:22:53,264
next year. But we can certainly 
all work to start to move in 

5966
08:22:53,665 --> 08:22:58,351
this direction. We must be as 
relentless as the adversary. 

5967
08:22:59,305 --> 08:23:03,420
Adversaries, they don't give up.
They are persistent. They 

5968
08:23:03,621 --> 08:23:08,647
represent a threat. And we have 
to be just as presents, 

5969
08:23:08,809 --> 08:23:15,005
persistent, persistent offenders
I guess. Please don't turn that 

5970
08:23:15,205 --> 08:23:22,714
into an acronym. That's a meme. 
But as important as it is for us

5971
08:23:22,914 --> 08:23:26,166
to be relentless, I think the 
more important point is that we 

5972
08:23:26,379 --> 08:23:32,466
have to do this together. And 
again the great news, is that 

5973
08:23:32,868 --> 08:23:37,949
this is a testimony to the fact 
we are already doing this as a 

5974
08:23:38,151 --> 08:23:40,802
community. I just came back as 
Katy mentioned, from Luxembourg 

5975
08:23:41,762 --> 08:23:46,906
at the workshop last Friday. It 
was a really great sort of 

5976
08:23:47,650 --> 08:23:49,650
similar idea

5977
08:23:52,782 --> 08:23:54,819
,  a group of community members,
all practitioners talking about 

5978
08:23:55,020 --> 08:23:59,287
how they are applying ATT&CK  in
their environment, using it to 

5979
08:23:59,488 --> 08:24:03,153
improve the state of their 
defenses on a daily basis. We 

5980
08:24:03,342 --> 08:24:06,126
are already doing this as a 
community, we just need to do 

5981
08:24:06,287 --> 08:24:09,388
more. The threat is real and the
adversaries are not going away. 

5982
08:24:09,540 --> 08:24:11,540
>>

5983
08:24:14,109 --> 08:24:18,176
So from my perspective we have 
an opportunity to bring the best

5984
08:24:18,377 --> 08:24:22,649
security team from around the 
world. You guys are great 

5985
08:24:22,850 --> 08:24:26,501
examples of the best security 
teams around the world. Maybe 

5986
08:24:26,702 --> 08:24:29,751
parts of a large financial 
institution. Healthcare concern,

5987
08:24:29,952 --> 08:24:36,052
IT security companies and or 
professional services firms. 

5988
08:24:36,259 --> 08:24:39,802
Whatever you are, you represent 
the tiptop of the pyramid.

5989
08:24:47,217 --> 08:24:49,048
Of organizations and individuals
who have the skills and 

5990
08:24:49,049 --> 08:24:50,266
insights, resources, 
sophistication to actually begin

5991
08:24:50,267 --> 08:24:54,686
to make a difference. And then 
it is no surprise that we are 

5992
08:24:54,849 --> 08:24:56,918
here at MITRE 

5993
08:25:01,841 --> 08:25:03,876
, which for over 60 years has 
been is trusted, independent, 

5994
08:25:04,077 --> 08:25:08,144
non-for profit place where 
thoughts are thunk and good 

5995
08:25:08,345 --> 08:25:12,611
things happen as a result. And 
we believe if we can bring the 

5996
08:25:12,813 --> 08:25:16,476
security teams from around the 
world, together with the kinds 

5997
08:25:16,677 --> 08:25:20,945
of folks you have been hearing 
from the last day and a half. 

5998
08:25:21,199 --> 08:25:23,739
That we can actually begin to 
execute on research and 

5999
08:25:23,891 --> 08:25:31,102
development, that will begin to 
develop impact and scale. So 

6000
08:25:31,503 --> 08:25:35,158
that is really what my focus has
been. How we take those 

6001
08:25:35,358 --> 08:25:39,429
community members with the 
ability and the resources, and 

6002
08:25:39,628 --> 08:25:41,628
the time and the expertise and 
the commitment

6003
08:25:45,117 --> 08:25:47,351
to the public interest, to focus
our efforts so we can deliver 

6004
08:25:47,552 --> 08:25:54,256
impact at scale. 
>> So. Threatened formed 

6005
08:25:54,458 --> 08:25:56,458
defense, where we go from here,

6006
08:26:08,064 --> 08:26:10,096
today I say stay tuned. 
Sometimes in the next few weeks,

6007
08:26:10,298 --> 08:26:12,331
you will hear more announcements
from us . the concrete actions 

6008
08:26:12,532 --> 08:26:14,532
we are taking to move this 
community forward. If you're 

6009
08:26:14,567 --> 08:26:16,802
interested in the meantime, come
find me later on. Shoot me an 

6010
08:26:17,004 --> 08:26:19,235
email. I want to leave you with 
this thought. We can actually 

6011
08:26:19,449 --> 08:26:21,472
change the game on the 
adversary. We can, I can foresee

6012
08:26:22,236 --> 08:26:26,504
a day, maybe not tomorrow, maybe
not next year, where we are 

6013
08:26:26,661 --> 08:26:28,661
actually

6014
08:26:30,209 --> 08:26:32,040
inside the adversary's decision,
where we are actually beginning 

6015
08:26:32,042 --> 08:26:36,100
to win the battles, if not the 
war. So let's all keep doing 

6016
08:26:36,301 --> 08:26:42,201
what you are doing. Let's keep 
this community going. And let's 

6017
08:26:42,402 --> 08:26:44,402
remember to be as relentless as 
our adversary. Thank you.

Thank you so much rich for the 
closing remarks. Great to pull 

6020
08:26:55,597 --> 08:26:59,865
us back strategically. Your last
comment struck me. Tony started 

6021
08:27:00,630 --> 08:27:05,437
the day talking about how we 
want to get into an adversary

6022
08:27:16,328 --> 08:27:19,159
loop. What a a call to action to
finish the day on. I would like 

6023
08:27:19,374 --> 08:27:21,374
to thank the amazing speakers 
today. You were wonderful, 

6024
08:27:21,393 --> 08:27:23,393
amazing content. Best practices,
what is working, hopefully a lot

6025
08:27:23,427 --> 08:27:25,427
of takeaways. Thank you to Jamie

6026
08:27:28,108 --> 08:27:30,543
