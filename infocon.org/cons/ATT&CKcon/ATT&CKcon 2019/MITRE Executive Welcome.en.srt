1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:04,302
- [Katie] Please join me
in welcoming Gary Gagnon.

2
00:00:04,302 --> 00:00:06,552
(clapping)

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:10,703
- Can you guys hear me?

4
00:00:10,703 --> 00:00:11,536
Is this turned on?

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:13,603
Okay.

6
00:00:13,603 --> 00:00:16,430
Yeah, so thank you, Katie,
that was incredible.

7
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,430
I can't believe I actually did all that.

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,410
So, I'm the Vice President in charge

9
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,700
of Cyber Strategy here at MITRE

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,930
and the Chief Security Officer

11
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,590
and we purposely line those two up

12
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,320
so we can actually eat our own dog food,

13
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,920
try things out ourselves

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,890
inside our own enterprise

15
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,705
to try concepts out that we
advise our government on.

16
00:00:33,705 --> 00:00:38,705
I've been at MITRE since
1986 in Cyber Security,

17
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,900
pretty much all that time.

18
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,205
I had a brief time where
I was outside of MITRE

19
00:00:44,205 --> 00:00:48,104
most recently as the CSqO for Amazon.

20
00:00:48,104 --> 00:00:50,640
It was the public service
mission that MITRE had

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,070
that brought me back here to MITRE.

22
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,743
I'm really excited that I'm back.

23
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,050
This year, the vibe in this
room has just been incredible.

24
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,440
There's been so much excitement.

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,777
The MITRE team coupled with

26
00:01:03,777 --> 00:01:05,080
what you guys are doing in a partnership

27
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,039
has really been just outstanding.

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,590
I never would have thought in 2015

29
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,560
when Blake presented the
ATT&CK framework to me

30
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,150
that we'd have this type of commitment

31
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,940
across the eco-system.

32
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,603
So I really appreciate all the enthusiasm.

33
00:01:23,338 --> 00:01:25,009
Instead of talking about ATT&CK,

34
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,963
'cause you're going to
hear a lot about ATT&CK...

35
00:01:26,963 --> 00:01:29,300
I think a lot of us should be thinking

36
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,369
to ourselves right now

37
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,860
what is it that we want to get

38
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,113
out of this time together today?

39
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,180
We're certainly building a partnership.

40
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,580
We're building a strong partnership

41
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,620
where we want to continue
to advance ATT&CK

42
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,307
and advance Threat-Informed
Defense at large.

43
00:01:44,307 --> 00:01:45,970
I think this is an opportunity for us

44
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,179
to network, socialize and
really get to know each other

45
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,480
and try to figure out
what we want to do next.

46
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,350
In 1999, when we released CVE,

47
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,160
who would've thought 20 years later

48
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,923
that would still be an industry standard?

49
00:02:02,787 --> 00:02:03,707
Just quick statistics:

50
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:07,479
143,000 named vulnerabilities now

51
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,250
and we have 109 CNAs--

52
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,610
CV numbering authorities

53
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:14,590
companies who've agreed

54
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,660
to release their
vulnerability information--

55
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,980
in 18 countries.

56
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,609
And so I think we're on
the same trajectory here

57
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,710
with what we're doing with ATT&CK.

58
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,840
I think we've got the
same type of momentum.

59
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,170
I really want to encourage us all

60
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,829
to continue the engagement

61
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,023
and work towards that.

62
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,770
So the idea behind
ATT&CK was formed out of

63
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,320
I'll call it frustration on my point.

64
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,790
I was watching the
security community doing

65
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,310
what I call "block and crouch".

66
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,820
We were vulnerability-based

67
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,653
we were blocking

68
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:45,486
and then we were crouching

69
00:02:45,486 --> 00:02:46,700
till we saw the next attack coming.

70
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,750
And hopefully we saw it

71
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,670
and then we blocked it again

72
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,510
and then we crouched waiting

73
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,870
for the next one to come in.

74
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,070
And it was not a proactive defense at all.

75
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,963
And so we decided we wanted
to try to change the game.

76
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,600
That simple high-level strategy

77
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,489
with a talented team underneath you,

78
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,380
you can actually do a lot of great things.

79
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,690
I think that's what's
happened here with us

80
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,963
and now with you guys.

81
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,310
Getting out of the vulnerability-based

82
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,630
block and crouch approach

83
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,380
to Threat-Informed Proactive Defense

84
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,390
is kind of the message

85
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,933
that I think we've been trying to deliver.

86
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,763
I just got my talking
point ten minutes ago.

87
00:03:28,217 --> 00:03:29,250
So, again I'd encourage us all

88
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,670
to continue to work together

89
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,600
and try to stay engaged.

90
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,150
I think Blake did a great job this morning

91
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,492
in laying out the framework

92
00:03:35,492 --> 00:03:37,530
in what the future's going to hold.

93
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,480
Rich Struse is going to do a
presentation later on today

94
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,191
on his vision for how he sees ATT&CK

95
00:03:42,192 --> 00:03:45,260
over the next few years.

96
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,859
We're looking for feedback in response

97
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,940
on what that could look like.

98
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,940
We've got some ideas

99
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,829
but we're really looking for the community

100
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,830
to help us shape it.

101
00:03:54,606 --> 00:03:57,810
Again, by numbers, we have
more than 5,000 people

102
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,258
who are attending this event

103
00:04:00,258 --> 00:04:04,690
both here, in our watch rooms and online.

104
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,540
So we've got a tremendous,
tremendous turnout

105
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,730
and again, that excitement,
I think we want to take

106
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,149
out of this conference into the future

107
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,090
in what we're trying to do with ATT&CK.

108
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,410
So, thanks again for all your support.

109
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,240
Thanks for coming out.

110
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,900
It's kind of interesting
I'm doing a welcome

111
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,750
a day and a half into a conference,

112
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,880
with a day and a half left.

113
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,070
But that's okay.

114
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,563
So, welcome and let's
keep up the momentum.

115
00:04:31,431 --> 00:04:32,282
Thanks.

116
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:35,381
(clapping)
