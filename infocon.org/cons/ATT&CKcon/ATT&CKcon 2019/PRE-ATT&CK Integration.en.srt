00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:02,110
- [Announcer] Please join me

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,939
in re-welcoming Adam Pennington.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,020
(clapping)

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,830
- And thank you to Katie for giving me

5
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,563
a second to switch gears there.

6
00:00:14,157 --> 00:00:14,990
So, I just

7
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:18,330
I know this is unfortunate
for our online audience,

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,180
but if I can get a quick show of hands for

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,960
how many of you are operationally

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,683
using PRE-Att&ck today?

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,670
Two?

12
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,780
Okay.

13
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,480
So, I was actually a little
curious how that would go.

14
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:36,650
So one of the things that we told

15
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,839
all of our speakers this week

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,830
was not to introduce Att&ck.

17
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,010
And we actually really appreciate

18
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,101
that people have been
pretty good about that,

19
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:46,210
between both the external speakers,

20
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,910
and the Att&ck updates
people have been doing.

21
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,169
But we know that not
everyone has actually worked

22
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,840
with PRE-Att&ck in the past,

23
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,050
so wanted to actually start there.

24
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,660
So most of what we've been saying

25
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:58,360
when we mean Att&ck this week

26
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,280
is Enterprise Att&ck.

27
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,170
Att&ck was originally created to

28
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,280
look at behaviors that adversaries do

29
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,180
after they've broken into an environment.

30
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,330
A separate team, a
couple years after that,

31
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,649
went to look at some of the adversary's

32
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,119
threat intelligence cycle,

33
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:17,830
and look at techniques for
what adversaries would do

34
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,829
before they broke into a system.

35
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,410
So this is, you know, the
graphic we've used for years,

36
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,360
where we're breaking up the kill chain

37
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,123
into PRE-Att&ck and Enterprise Att&ck.

38
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,920
So just about a year ago, we had an effort

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,120
to take the launch and
compromise techniques,

40
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,543
tactics from PRE-Att&ck,

41
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,030
cannibalize them,

42
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,620
and create the initial access tactic.

43
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,780
So this wasn't the same techniques,

44
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,840
but it did represent the same
coverage, the same space.

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,120
And so we started the process

46
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,667
of integrating PRE-Att&ck into Att&ck.

47
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:01,020
So if you remember back to
Blake's original beginning,

48
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,030
he talked about the idea of bringing

49
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,750
some of the different
Att&ck efforts together,

50
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,263
and just making it all
one big happy Att&ck.

51
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,230
And so rather than just go along

52
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,769
and continue to take Att&ck
trickers two at a time,

53
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,200
our plan is to rip the band aid off

54
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,893
and make PRE-Att&ck and
Att&ck all into one piece.

55
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,500
So this is the picture I started with,

56
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,440
and this is the picture we've
been briefing for years,

57
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,630
but it's not really quite accurate.

58
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,000
So really where the space looks like

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
is a little bit more like this.

60
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,320
So PRE-Att&ck covers a space

61
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,870
that actually comes before the kill chain,

62
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,710
that's off into the adversary's

63
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,160
intelligence planning cycles,

64
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,350
some of the budgeting and
resource management issues,

65
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,400
and so it's a bit left

66
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,033
of the kill chain.

67
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,940
So in looking at how we actually want to

68
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,760
take stuff from techniques,

69
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,019
from PRE-Att&ck, and looking
at some of that space

70
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,309
off into just intel,

71
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:06,230
we had to sit down and take a look at

72
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,239
how do we decide what we pull in

73
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,890
and what we don't.

74
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,339
So a member of our team, Ingrid Parker,

75
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,980
actually spent some time
taking a look at this,

76
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,840
where she went down and worked with us

77
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,220
and came up with a couple
of different things

78
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,620
in how to decide what goes in.

79
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,210
So first of all is that it's technical.

80
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,310
So it has something to do with, you know,

81
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,480
electronics, computers.

82
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,132
It isn't just a planning exercise.

83
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,800
It's visible to some defenders.

84
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,933
So the PRE-Att&ck space is different.

85
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,190
So with Att&ck we're mostly talking

86
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,079
about behaviors in your environment,

87
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,280
that if you did the exact right things,

88
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,421
you probably could see.

89
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:50,269
You know, you might not
want to alert on them,

90
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:52,730
but they're in the space that you control,

91
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,549
and have visibility into.

92
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,090
The PRE-Att&ck space is
a little bit different.

93
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,390
So what we mean by some defenders is that

94
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,130
maybe an ISP could see it,

95
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,310
a DNS provider.

96
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,430
Somebody up the chain actually has

97
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,113
visibility into it somewhere.

98
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,520
Evidence of adversary use.

99
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,500
So when PRE-Att&ck was originally written,

100
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,070
there really was not much out there

101
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,279
talking about things that
happened before intrusions.

102
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,529
So one of the things that's
helped the last couple years

103
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,829
is things like indictments.

104
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,700
There have been a number of reports out,

105
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,159
and other threat intelligence
companies as well,

106
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,140
that have talked a lot more
about adversary preparation

107
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,553
of getting ready for going into intrusion.

108
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:39,559
So I haven't actually shown
PRE-Att&ck matrix yet.

109
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:41,650
If so, you haven't seen PRE-Att&ck before,

110
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,070
it actually looks somewhat like Att&ck.

111
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,200
You know, it's got tactics across the top,

112
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,250
techniques down the side.

113
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,730
And so this yellow here

114
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,541
is that sort of intelligence space.

115
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:57,430
These are things like
priority definition planning,

116
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,443
thinking about getting
ready for an intrusion.

117
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,061
And so we think that those
don't really fall into

118
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:07,349
the three standards I just set down.

119
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,700
So looking across the rest of it,

120
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,010
we realized that it actually
divides up pretty nicely

121
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,080
into two different sections.

122
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,909
So you've got the green, and the blue.

123
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,410
So you've got this intelligence planning,

124
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,823
that we're calling Out of scope.

125
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,260
Reconnaissance, which we'd be making into

126
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,623
a new tactic in Enterprise Att&ck,

127
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,933
and Resource Development.

128
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,409
And so, give you an idea
what these look like.

129
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,520
So I couldn't put the word
draft on here many more times

130
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,603
and still have the slide render well.

131
00:05:42,678 --> 00:05:43,760
So I want to make sure that that shows up

132
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,200
in the background of your screen shots.

133
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,099
These are absolutely not
the final technique names,

134
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,288
they will change, not they might change.

135
00:05:53,288 --> 00:05:58,003
But so Reconnaissance is
very focused on the victim.

136
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,570
So it's focused on gathering information

137
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,330
on the victim itself,

138
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,780
gathering information on
individuals within the victim,

139
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,780
and sort of what everything around

140
00:06:09,781 --> 00:06:12,493
the victim's landscape looks like.

141
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,729
We also have Resource Development.

142
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:22,210
So Resource Development has two main types

143
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:24,090
of information on it.

144
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,489
We have Infrastructure and Capabilities.

145
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:31,891
So those of you who know threat
models that aren't Att&ck,

146
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,900
victim infrastructure and capabilities

147
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,469
might start sounding
a little bit familiar.

148
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:40,491
It's not completely an accident.

149
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:43,050
And so Resource Development
is the adversary

150
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,660
actually building up the
pieces that they need

151
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,660
in order to do their intrusion.

152
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,190
So building up like SSL
certificates they need,

153
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,763
getting a hold of any servers they want.

154
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,320
We're going to be doing both,

155
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,500
where they are actually
building it themselves,

156
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,930
that is different from

157
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,820
where they're acquiring it
through other mechanisms,

158
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,540
where it's already built.

159
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,340
But so this is the rough
shape of what we think

160
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,993
PRE-Att&ck is going to look like.

161
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,300
So you might notice that this doesn't

162
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,040
really look like current
Att&ck techniques,

163
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,773
these are sub-techniques.

164
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,940
And so this is not something
that we're going to see

165
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,870
in the next few weeks.

166
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,920
This isn't, you know,

167
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,100
a couple people have complained today

168
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,790
that we did a release last Thursday,

169
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,020
right before Att&ckcon.

170
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,969
People had to change up their slides.

171
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,900
This is actually going to be
a little bit longer coming,

172
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,049
we still have some white board sessions.

173
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,120
And I should say that the techniques,

174
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,953
and sub-techniques,

175
00:07:41,953 --> 00:07:43,000
you're actually seeing here today

176
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,760
are a process of a number
of white boarding sessions

177
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,300
between Katie Nichols and myself.

178
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,613
