1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,639
- Thank you Katie for that introduction,

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,720
and thank you for the Mitre
team for inviting me here today.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,180
I actually thought I was
gonna have to start my talk

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,730
by inviting everybody in from outside.

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,910
I didn't realize how big
the Mitre team had grown

6
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,560
when we were doing introductions.

7
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,930
It's really a testament to the work

8
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,500
that the ATT&CK team has done

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,610
and how central it's
become to this community

10
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,570
over the last two years
really in particular.

11
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:23,020
Although this efforts been
going for nearly five.

12
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,130
So a little bit about myself.

13
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,119
As Katie kind of mentioned,

14
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,690
I started as an all-source
intelligence analyst

15
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,960
working in the Department of Defense

16
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,160
where I was for almost 15 years.

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,069
I left government service
and went to ThreatConnect,

18
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,920
where I was the director of research.

19
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,310
So not only did I get to work with

20
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,870
som amazing researchers in house,

21
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,089
a big part of my job there

22
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,113
was working with threat
intelligence teams across industry.

23
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,343
As Katie mentioned,

24
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:50,530
I also taught at Georgetown.

25
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,700
A quick plug.

26
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,530
If you are interested in teaching,

27
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,360
there is a huge demand for
adjunct faculty members

28
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,210
who have practical
experience in this space.

29
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,405
It's an aggressive side
hustle on top of your day job,

30
00:01:03,405 --> 00:01:05,510
I will warn you that.

31
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,020
But it's a really compelling way

32
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,630
to both give back to the community

33
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,130
and it really helps you level up

34
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,860
because you think a lot about

35
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,960
how and why we do the work that we do

36
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,360
when you teach it to others.

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,957
And then this summer,

38
00:01:18,957 --> 00:01:20,979
I picked up from my DC roots

39
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,900
and moved across the country to California

40
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,010
to join Google's threat analysis group,

41
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,160
which as Katie mentioned,

42
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,070
is Google's in-house
threat intelligence team.

43
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,139
A very important disclaimer though.

44
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,804
This talk represents my personal views

45
00:01:32,804 --> 00:01:34,760
and not the views of Google or Alphabet.

46
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,093
So keep that in mind as we
progress through all these memes.

47
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,369
All right, so over the next two days,

48
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,300
we are going to see

49
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,090
a whole series of talks from practitioners

50
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,530
that are actually using
ATT&CK to improve security.

51
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,943
'Cause when I was thinking
about creating this talk,

52
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,960
I realized that we're gonna
get really detailed view,

53
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,600
lots of hands-on experience,

54
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,289
and best practices over
these next two days.

55
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,670
And so what I wanted to do
was start the conference

56
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,050
by kind of taking a step back,

57
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,609
and thinking a little bit
more about why we're here,

58
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,710
the problems that ATT&CK
enables teams to solve,

59
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,130
and some of the challenges
I've seen from teams

60
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,980
who are working to implement
ATT&CK in their environment.

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,080
So what brings us together today?

62
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,340
Matrices.

63
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,783
Matrices are what bring us together today.

64
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,940
So quick show of hands,

65
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,850
how many of you here in the audience

66
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,523
work in threat intelligence?

67
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,453
Lot of hands.

68
00:02:36,453 --> 00:02:38,563
How many of you work
in ops or as defenders?

69
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,290
Ooh, that's a pretty good split.

70
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,859
So for those of you watching at home,

71
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,070
the thousands of people

72
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,016
that Katie has told me are tuning in,

73
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:48,590
that's about a 50/50 split
here in the audience.

74
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,940
Which in and of itself,

75
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,750
I think is a really compelling reason

76
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,293
for why ATT&CK has been so successful.

77
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,150
There we go.

78
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,010
So this leads to a lot
of questions, right?

79
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,920
I've worked in intel my entire career.

80
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,470
And so I've always see this struggle

81
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,913
to make intel and ops
more effective together.

82
00:03:07,826 --> 00:03:10,190
And that leads to a lot of questions like

83
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,560
why do I need intel,

84
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,940
how do I make this work,

85
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,460
how much is enough?

86
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,910
I want to take an intel-driven defense,

87
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,900
but how do I actually do that?

88
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,500
And so this here is my answer

89
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,860
to the why of threat intelligence.

90
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,450
The purpose of intelligence

91
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,079
is to drive a decision advantage.

92
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,370
I thought about putting
out definitions here

93
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,160
from Gartner or Forrester,

94
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,475
even better the Joint Pub.

95
00:03:33,475 --> 00:03:34,460
But to be honest,

96
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,220
I kind of get lost in
all the dependent clauses

97
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,790
when I look at those longer definitions

98
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,679
of what intel is.

99
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,010
Plus I thought it was a
bit of bait and switch

100
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,120
to go from a Princess
Bride meme to doctrine.

101
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,763
So you're welcome.

102
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,180
So let's unpack that a little bit.

103
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,550
What does decision
advantage actually mean?

104
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,890
So this chart is from the
EU Cybersecurity Agency,

105
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:54,722
and it's busy.

106
00:03:54,723 --> 00:03:56,010
There's a lot going on here.

107
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,739
But I like it because

108
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,070
I think it helps us map out

109
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,790
what decision advantage might look like

110
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,867
in different organizations.

111
00:04:03,867 --> 00:04:06,130
So a couple of things come to mind here.

112
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,150
First,

113
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,220
now it's possible that
as a threat intel team

114
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,920
you actually serve this whole range

115
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,570
of customers and systems,

116
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:15,079
and your threat intel
is just radiating out

117
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,240
from the center of the company

118
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,322
to all of these wonderful places.

119
00:04:18,322 --> 00:04:20,800
But what's much more likely as a team

120
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,208
is that this is more of a
choose-your-own-adventure,

121
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,858
where you've got a couple
of these different pathways

122
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,780
that are the definitions
of who you're supporting

123
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,419
and what define your deliverables.

124
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,670
And then it's a painstaking
process over time

125
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,820
to establish new pathways
throughout the organization

126
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,803
as your intel team grows and matures.

127
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,219
The second point I'd like to draw out here

128
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,360
is that decision advantage

129
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,740
can come in a couple of different ways.

130
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,300
Our decisions can be made
by people and/or by systems.

131
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,760
And it's really important
for us as practitioners

132
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,563
to understand what the
requirements are for both.

133
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,589
So my time in the Department of Defense,

134
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:01,920
I was an all-source intelligence analyst

135
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,010
primarily focused on Afghanistan

136
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,680
and working in the Pentagon.

137
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,210
My world was overwhelmingly

138
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,400
what's in this top left
quadrant of the slide

139
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,828
and labeled "strategic".

140
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:14,410
My decision makers were people.

141
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,380
And the way they needed intelligence,

142
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,930
it had to be delivered cogently in writing

143
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,063
or on the spot in person.

144
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,120
So the way that you work as a team

145
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,700
when those are the
types of decision makers

146
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,650
you have to support

147
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,630
and that's the kind of
deliverable they need

148
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,963
is very different from a
different type of problem.

149
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,390
When I came to the private sector

150
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,650
and starting working with
enterprise security teams,

151
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,380
I saw something that was very different.

152
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,920
Here, enabling systems
to be more actionable

153
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,220
was a key deliverable.

154
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,570
Which makes a lot of sense.

155
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,930
However, one of the things
I really struggled with,

156
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,730
especially about four years ago
when I made this transition,

157
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,361
was that overwhelmingly

158
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:55,280
this was implemented as
indicators of compromise

159
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,820
being pumped into a device,

160
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,793
usually a sim.

161
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,070
And I'll be honest,

162
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,683
I didn't really understand that.

163
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,690
So I found that approach
to be very tactical,

164
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,050
that information is very perishable,

165
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,801
IOCs tend to have a very short shelf life,

166
00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:13,940
and it's such a high volume

167
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,600
that a small team could spend

168
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,450
pretty much their entire time and effort

169
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,740
managing and curating
these streams of data

170
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,253
for relatively little decision advantage.

171
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,400
So one of the things that I
really like about Mitre ATT&CK

172
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,539
is both that it allows us

173
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,011
to better support those
two types of decisions,

174
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:34,630
made by people and made by systems,

175
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,300
and that it really helps pull us up

176
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,373
from an overly tactical view
of what intelligence is.

177
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,210
And that's pretty clutch,

178
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,930
because the side that
learns the fastest wins.

179
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,160
So a quick show of hands,

180
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,410
how many of you are
familiar with OODA loops?

181
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,423
That is almost everybody.

182
00:06:52,423 --> 00:06:54,660
I get so excited. (laughs)

183
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,500
All right, so OODA loops,

184
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,600
this was a theory developed by John Boyd

185
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,360
who was an air force officer in the 1970s

186
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,580
thinking about aerial combat.

187
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,050
And what his theory is

188
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,730
is that decision making happens
in these iterative loops

189
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,830
where you observe,
orient, decide, and act.

190
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,663
That's our OODA.

191
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,219
And basically both you and your
adversary have these loops.

192
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,820
And so the one who learns the fastest,

193
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,440
who closes the loop the
fastest gains the advantage

194
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,240
and is more likely to be successful.

195
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,370
All right, so let's think
about this a little bit more.

196
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,370
That first O, observe,

197
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,277
is collecting the information around you

198
00:07:31,277 --> 00:07:33,240
and getting your bearings.

199
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,650
The O for orient,

200
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,979
this was something, it
took me a little while,

201
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,540
I had to think about a little bit more.

202
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,290
This is really how you analyze
and process that information.

203
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,860
Drawing on your past experiences,

204
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,740
your values, your cultural biases,

205
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,051
things like that.

206
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:50,070
So he's crafting this
theory thinking about

207
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,392
an individual fighter
pilot in a dog fight.

208
00:07:53,392 --> 00:07:56,290
But if we zoom out a little bit,

209
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,000
we can see how this would
also apply to organizations.

210
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,610
How many of us have been in a place

211
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,420
where we've taken the
same external set of data

212
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,970
and seen two teams run with it

213
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,280
in completely different directions?

214
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,940
The way they interpret and orient

215
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,180
is very much shaped by their
organizational culture.

216
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,860
And the way that they orient

217
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,300
is gonna have a huge impact

218
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,873
on how they decide and how they act.

219
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,490
Thinking, we're thinking.

220
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,890
There we go.

221
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,429
Okay, so we've talked about
how to think about OODA loops

222
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:36,227
as a way to sort of measure
this decision advantage.

223
00:08:36,227 --> 00:08:38,063
How do we know if it's working?

224
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,150
This is the purpose we have intelligence,

225
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,280
to make this better,

226
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,520
to do it faster.

227
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,689
How do we know if it's working?

228
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,070
What metrics can we use
to think about this?

229
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,860
There's kind of two
categories of metrics here.

230
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,740
Full disclosure,

231
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,640
this is an area I've done
a fair amount of work on

232
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,028
so there's more presentations
on this under the covers.

233
00:08:57,028 --> 00:08:59,100
But basically those metrics tend to fall

234
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,150
into two categories of things.

235
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,290
Measures of performance,

236
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,000
which is what most of us think about

237
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,510
when we think of metrics.

238
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,277
These are the things
that answer the questions

239
00:09:07,277 --> 00:09:09,500
"am I doing things right?"

240
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,370
They tend to be within
the control of the team

241
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,790
to measure things like

242
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,620
how many reports did I write this month,

243
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,450
how well are my systems working,

244
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,423
how do I make X more efficient?

245
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,170
What are we analyzing,

246
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,510
what are we finding?

247
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,340
And these type of metrics
absolutely have their place,

248
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,770
but they tend to be over-weighted

249
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,360
in how we think about the
effectiveness of intelligence.

250
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,320
This is also where

251
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,290
when a lot of us get
cynical about metrics,

252
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,430
it's because we're spending too much time

253
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,800
working towards this metric

254
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,599
and it doesn't really get
to the heart of the matter

255
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,599
of how effective we're being.

256
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:45,040
Pretty much all of us have

257
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,730
some sort of horror story or scar tissue

258
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,420
about a place that we worked
or a person that we know

259
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,396
where there was metric of

260
00:09:52,397 --> 00:09:55,300
"to be successful you will
write five reports a month".

261
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,420
Now as somebody who leads analysts,

262
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,939
I know if I set that as a criteria,

263
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,370
my analysts are gonna
write five reports a month.

264
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,140
Now whether or not those reports are good,

265
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,980
or whether writing five reports a month

266
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,660
is in fact the right
thing I want them to do

267
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,130
is a separate question.

268
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,270
So you have to be careful here

269
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,170
because while these types
of metrics are important

270
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,819
for keeping the team moving forward

271
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,500
and improving your processes,

272
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,510
if you're not careful

273
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,030
you can easily mis-incentivize
the type of behavior

274
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,630
you want your team to be taking.

275
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,770
So where we really want to be

276
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,500
is on the right side of the slide,

277
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,920
talking about measures of effectiveness.

278
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,410
These types of metrics capture,

279
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,319
excuse me, am I doing the right things?

280
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,800
And so here what we're
really talking about is

281
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,410
the output that the
intel team is creating,

282
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,640
is it actually changing

283
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,336
the organization's decisions or behavior.

284
00:10:46,336 --> 00:10:49,900
This is where we're really
trying to focus on that impact.

285
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,860
So these may be things like
countermeasures enacted

286
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,640
or new cases that have been
generated from threat intel,

287
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,949
where that output is
actually making a difference

288
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,073
in the way the security team works.

289
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,620
But guess what?

290
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,070
These types of metrics require

291
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,410
a really strong partnership

292
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,939
with the teams that we're enabling.

293
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,850
And that can be ops,

294
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,110
that can be incident response,

295
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,020
it could be the execs.

296
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,220
Whoever our key stakeholders are

297
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,070
from our choose-your-own-adventure
experience

298
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,123
a few slides ago,

299
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,370
the measures of effectiveness
are really gonna speak to

300
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,323
how well we're working together.

301
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:26,943
And that makes us really uncomfortable.

302
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,459
We know this in our bones.

303
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,690
The number of threat intel types

304
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,680
that I've seen leave an organization

305
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,329
because they felt their
work wasn't causing change,

306
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,960
too many to count.

307
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,570
But yet it makes us really,
really uncomfortable

308
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,970
to think that the true
measure of our effectiveness

309
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,320
is how well we are enabling others.

310
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,163
And that means it's not
entirely within our control.

311
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,479
So what holds us back from
being more effective then?

312
00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:57,880
I think there's a cultural
mismatch a lot of times

313
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,470
between threat intelligence and ops

314
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,720
that makes us both less effective.

315
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,130
And I don't want to overdo this point

316
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,310
because sometimes I think this
comes across as a caricature.

317
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,640
So it's not threat intel is from Mars

318
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,590
and ops is from Venus or vice versa.

319
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,057
It's not like that.

320
00:12:12,057 --> 00:12:13,760
But we have different frames

321
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,360
for the way that we consume information

322
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,690
and the timeline that we need
that information to be valid.

323
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:24,690
And so by absolutely no
malice or deliberate slight,

324
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,340
it's very easy for both of us

325
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,470
in trying to do our best

326
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:30,393
to not make the other side effective.

327
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,000
So what does that mean?

328
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,770
Intel is drawn to the novel,
to the unique, to the next.

329
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,230
What is the next big attack,

330
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,250
what happened here,

331
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,330
what does this portend

332
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,320
for the ATT&CK landscape moving forward?

333
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,780
We live in the details.

334
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,920
And because the details of
those attacks are gonna vary,

335
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,599
usually pretty substantially,

336
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,710
based off the environment
that they execute in,

337
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,410
we have to be there.

338
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,209
But if we're not careful,

339
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,690
it kind of puts us in the position

340
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,223
of being the "well, actually" people.

341
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,829
We'll all been there, I've been there.

342
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,370
You provide this information

343
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:08,530
and what comes back is
something that's so generalized

344
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,920
that you feel compelled
to say "Well, actually,"

345
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,632
and provide five caveats.

346
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,360
Because it's also very
important as intel practitioners

347
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,490
that our customers don't
take the wrong takeaways

348
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,270
and charge off in the wrong direction.

349
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,860
But if we overdo it,

350
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,593
we basically end up never
giving a clear point.

351
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,380
So I mentioned that we're
living in the details.

352
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,120
Most of the work that we're
doing on these attacks

353
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,000
and what we're publishing
is retrospective in nature.

354
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,820
So our work is highly descriptive
and highly explanatory,

355
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,190
but not necessarily super
predictive going forward.

356
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,830
And so there's actually,
believe it or not,

357
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,350
a theory about theories.

358
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,940
There's actually a whole bunch of them.

359
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,040
But what I want to point out here

360
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,839
is this tension when you think of a theory

361
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,410
between its diagnostic strength

362
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,310
and its prognostic strength.

363
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,640
So diagnostic theories

364
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,270
have a high amount of explanatory power

365
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,360
that are really good
applied to a specific case

366
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,820
or looking backwards.

367
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,293
But because they're so detailed,

368
00:14:06,293 --> 00:14:08,460
they are less generalizable going forward

369
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,173
and have less predictive strength.

370
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,900
I would put forth that for the most part,

371
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,410
threat intel tends to live

372
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,160
on the diagnostic end of the spectrum

373
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,372
in the work that we do.

374
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,240
And that contrasts I
think pretty significantly

375
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,310
with what operations needs
to be more effective.

376
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:29,589
Ops needs stability of signal
in order to do their work.

377
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,590
And speaking with a number of teams

378
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,270
that have worked to
implement Mitre ATT&CK,

379
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,255
one of the things that has struck out

380
00:14:35,255 --> 00:14:38,410
really to me quite vividly

381
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,420
is how long it takes the apps teams

382
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,333
to build and feel detections.

383
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,240
So identifying these techniques,

384
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,830
researching the detection,

385
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:49,970
building it, testing it, deploying it,

386
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,160
the average that I hear is closer to

387
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,563
one per quarter per analyst.

388
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,280
That is a completely different timeframe

389
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,819
than intel people live on.

390
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,510
I can't tell you basically
what happened last week,

391
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,783
let alone a quarter ago.

392
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,780
So when we think about this
and what we're reporting,

393
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,370
we're over here looking at
that new, novel, and next

394
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,257
and ops is over here trying to figure out,

395
00:15:11,257 --> 00:15:13,877
"You just gave me 15 new, novel, and next.

396
00:15:13,877 --> 00:15:15,507
"What is stable here

397
00:15:15,507 --> 00:15:17,406
"and is going to be worth the investment

398
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:20,767
"it's going to take for me
to build these detections?"

399
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,450
So basically in a nutshell,

400
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,190
they need intel to be more prognostic

401
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,103
whereas as our strength is
really being more diagnostic.

402
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,580
So I've highlighted here a couple of areas

403
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:40,230
where we want to get better
as intelligence practitioners.

404
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,680
What is it that ATT&CK
can help us with here

405
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,609
in creating that decision advantage

406
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,483
and working more effective as a team?

407
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,920
Now people think that
we're on to something here.

408
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,670
So this is a Google trends chart

409
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,670
for ATT&CK as a search term.

410
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,502
Going back from when

411
00:15:56,503 --> 00:16:00,010
the framework was first
introduced in May 2015 'til,

412
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,800
I'm not too proud to say it,

413
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,867
I made this slide last night.
(laughter)

414
00:16:04,867 --> 00:16:07,219
(laughs)

415
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,500
And what you can see here is that in 2018,

416
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,980
we really start to see
velocity take off for ATT&CK

417
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,330
and it just keeps going up.

418
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,140
Now in my defense,

419
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,319
I made this slide earlier in this month.

420
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,420
And at that point,

421
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,780
100, which is our Y axis here

422
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,860
and represents the peak popularity

423
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,370
for ATT&CK as a search term,

424
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:31,000
that 100 point was hit
this year in August,

425
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,210
basically coinciding with the time

426
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,520
that Katie and Ryan Kovar
gave a talk at Black Hat

427
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,643
entitled Play At Home.

428
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,520
And then I realized,

429
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,210
let me go check that data again,

430
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,700
and found that looks like

431
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,580
we are on track this
week with the conference

432
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,800
to create a new high.

433
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,502
So well done, everybody.

434
00:16:49,572 --> 00:16:51,080
(clapping)

435
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,490
Yes, you can clap for yourselves.

436
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,240
That's absolutely acceptable. (laughs)

437
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,520
So this trend tells us,

438
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,710
this trend chart tells us something

439
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,500
that I think we all pretty
much know intuitively.

440
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,630
When we go to security conferences now,

441
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,690
we're pretty much guaranteed

442
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,197
to get at least on talk on ATT&CK,

443
00:17:07,196 --> 00:17:08,959
and maybe from the Mitre team itself.

444
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,130
But oftentimes it's not.

445
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,500
It's from other practitioners,

446
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,943
which is really exciting and
compelling about this space.

447
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,329
But I got to say I think Patrick Gray,

448
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,649
who runs the Risky Business podcast

449
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,574
kind of said it best here.

450
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:24,980
"The ATT&CK framework is
now officially everywhere."

451
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,579
This episode was actually about ATT&CK IQ

452
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,629
and adversary emulation.

453
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,530
It's actually pretty interesting

454
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,879
if you haven't had a
chance to go check it out.

455
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,240
Okay.

456
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,260
So the value here,

457
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,370
point number one,

458
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,899
moving up from more tactical
threat intelligence.

459
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,600
So for those of you who had

460
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,429
first time to Pyramid of Pain reference

461
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,500
as about 16 minutes into the conference,

462
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,483
you win the pool.

463
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,189
And we'll probably see this
slide a couple more times

464
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,210
over the next two days,

465
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,560
and that's not a bad thing.

466
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,270
So the Pyramid of Pain was
developed by David Bianco

467
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,233
who's at Target,

468
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,730
basically to think about

469
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,610
the amount of pain caused to the adversary

470
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,100
when these various categories
are denied to them.

471
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,669
So earlier when I said

472
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,680
that threat intelligence tends to be,

473
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,610
the way it's been defined

474
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,510
and implemented largely in the market,

475
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,330
that use case has been

476
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,480
indicators of compromise into a device.

477
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,970
We're spending too much here

478
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,540
at the bottom levels of the pyramid

479
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,413
on activity that is trivial
for the adversary to change.

480
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:32,889
So what we want to do is move up to TTPs,

481
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,900
tactics, techniques, and procedures.

482
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,543
These are much more stable,

483
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,453
the stable signal that our operators need,

484
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,320
and it gives us the opportunity

485
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,260
to reframe the discussion.

486
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,080
So by working at this level,

487
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,389
we help intel come out of

488
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,120
that very tactical diagnistic focus,

489
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,139
diagnostic focus,

490
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,860
and give ops the stability
of signal they need

491
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,663
to do the work that they need
to do to build detections.

492
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,380
So what does that actually look like?

493
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,750
Also, first representation
of a matrix for the day.

494
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,740
So I just went and opened
up the ATT&CK navigator

495
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,190
and pulled the chart for APT-28.

496
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,780
So there's no extra sauce on this chart.

497
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,760
Just the special sauce

498
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,320
of what the community has
been able to bring together

499
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,120
in synthesizing a body of reporting,

500
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,173
which is pretty cool.

501
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,449
We can have a very different
discussion as a team

502
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,870
when we're starting from here

503
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,652
than from a handful of indicators.

504
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,459
I think that's a really important point,

505
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,560
because these types of matrices

506
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,139
are an important way for us
to start building consensus

507
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,540
on what is happening
and how that translates

508
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,623
to our own operational environment.

509
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,773
Now a point of caution,

510
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,860
it's easy to become too over-reliant

511
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,479
on things like a matrix.

512
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,240
And if we're not careful,

513
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,380
we introduce different sorts of bias.

514
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,460
So this can be a very powerful tool

515
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,170
for decreasing certain types of bias,

516
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:00,320
namely recency bias and anecdotal bias.

517
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,629
If it's very difficult for us
to pull up this information

518
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,320
and look at it over a period of time,

519
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,340
we're going to be overwhelmingly weighted

520
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,429
towards the most recent thing.

521
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,830
I don't know if HIPPO bias is a thing

522
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:11,810
but it probably should be,

523
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,929
or the highest paid person's opinion.

524
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,140
The way they define the problem

525
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,600
becomes the way that we
frame and talk about it.

526
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,370
This can be a very powerful corrective

527
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,253
to those types of group tendencies.

528
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,080
But like I said, it's not without risk.

529
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,439
Become too reliant on this,

530
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,450
we introduce other sources of bias.

531
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:29,663
Namely collection.

532
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,990
If your collection is skewed

533
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:34,010
towards being only being
able to see some things,

534
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,830
you're gonna have darker red
on this chart than others.

535
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,500
So the matrix represents what you know.

536
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,490
And the bigger the divergence

537
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,090
between what you know and reality is,

538
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,810
the less effective of
a tool it's gonna be.

539
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,340
But if we're thinking about it in that way

540
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,730
and we're careful to that,

541
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,090
it's a really powerful way

542
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,550
to bring different teams
and perspectives together

543
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,913
and have that conversation.

544
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,160
So that point might be
really obvious to me.

545
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,033
At the core of this is
a common nomenclature.

546
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,850
Why is it taking us so
long to get to this point

547
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,963
where we can do that?

548
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,210
I remember when I was at ThreatConnect

549
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,043
and we were thinking about

550
00:21:12,043 --> 00:21:16,149
how to incentivize teams to
do more TTP-level analysis.

551
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,590
We were having a really difficult time,

552
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,590
and again this was about four years ago,

553
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,223
with the standardization problem.

554
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:24,970
When we talked about TTPs,

555
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,610
it was too qualitative

556
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,030
and too subject to interpretation
by different analysts

557
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,280
for us to build a structured feature

558
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,590
that would enable both humans and systems

559
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:36,212
to consume that type of intelligence.

560
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:37,045
And this is the problem

561
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,690
that I think Mitre has solved
in a lot of ways for us,

562
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,070
that over the last two years,

563
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,520
we've really seen this
critical mass I would say

564
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,879
across the community

565
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,463
for this is how we're
going to talk about TTPs.

566
00:21:49,383 --> 00:21:51,780
Now if we contrast that

567
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,770
and think about how unique
and special that is,

568
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,370
let's think about
another part of our world

569
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:56,852
and that's adversary naming.

570
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,110
Adversary naming by contrast
is not standardized.

571
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,860
Each vendor or producer comes up with

572
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,780
their own codename or code word.

573
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:09,629
And sure someone's gonna say
there's good reasons for that,

574
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,860
like we have different visibility
and different collection,

575
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,453
and that may be true.

576
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,860
But one,

577
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,250
the conversations we don't have are about

578
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,070
how different APT-28 visibility
is versus Fancy Bear.

579
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,500
Those aren't the
conversations we really have

580
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,940
as the threat intel community.

581
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,440
We just jam them all together.

582
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:32,360
And it causes a lot of pain
and friction for everybody.

583
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,060
For the threat intel analysts themselves

584
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,860
and for everybody who's got
to consume this information.

585
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,140
Having just joined a new team at Google,

586
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,460
I now have yet another set
of acronyms and code words

587
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,720
that I have to layer
on to these other ones.

588
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,673
Super fun, guys, so much fun.

589
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,920
So here I think the dichotomy

590
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,200
between how we're seeing TTPs
evolve and adversary naming

591
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,500
is really a testament to
the work that Mitre does.

592
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,540
It's also a testament to the community

593
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,010
which is invested into this framework

594
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,320
to make it more usable

595
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,470
and help evolve it over
the last few years.

596
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,960
Forgot the animation.

597
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,920
There you go.

598
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,283
That's just a handful of
aliases for the same group.

599
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,072
Have fun constructing your
search queries around that.

600
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,330
All right, so a common
nomenclature here is so important

601
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:28,210
because it enables a
common operational picture.

602
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,450
I mentioned earlier

603
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,440
when we were talking
about the Pyramid of Pain

604
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,877
that if we think about our
OODA loop again in that frame,

605
00:23:33,877 --> 00:23:35,810
one of the reasons ATT&CK is so helpful

606
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,510
is on that first O, the observe,

607
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,690
it draws us up from the tactical.

608
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,700
Our observations are
at a much higher level

609
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,870
and that's a better starting
point for this next step,

610
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:44,882
which is orient.

611
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,200
These matrices are a really important way

612
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,490
to bring intel and ops together

613
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,520
because it allows us to
map adversary activity

614
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,710
and then translate that

615
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,463
into how we see this play
out on our own networks.

616
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,670
Again, sounds so simple,

617
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,360
but it's such a compelling step forward

618
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,360
for bringing both sides of this together.

619
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,120
And the way we orient together again

620
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,750
is what drives how we decide and act.

621
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,300
So one of the things I've noticed though

622
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,470
in looking at teams that
have had some false starts

623
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,303
or have struggled

624
00:24:15,303 --> 00:24:17,930
to get their ATT&CK
implementation off the ground

625
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,420
is that that orient phase

626
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,890
really requires both intel and ops.

627
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,270
If just one of them is
trying to drive that,

628
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,540
it's not gonna be successful

629
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,190
and it's gonna struggle to
stick in the organization.

630
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,793
But wait, there's even more.

631
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,963
So talked about OODA loops quite a bit.

632
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:45,330
ATT&CK's real Jedi mind
trick here I think is that

633
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,139
a framework that's ostensibly
about adversary behavior

634
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,193
really not allows you to know yourself.

635
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,439
And this is something
that I leep running into

636
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,650
over and over and over again,

637
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,160
every time that I work with a team

638
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,133
that is starting to implement ATT&CK.

639
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,080
So what does that actually mean?

640
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,510
So one of the first use cases here

641
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,690
is improving detection and visibility.

642
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:06,210
And this is that core use case

643
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,730
we've been talking about up to this point.

644
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:10,320
When we think about how
we're gonna use Mitre ATT&CK,

645
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,340
it's about improving operational defense

646
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,740
and helping to to get yourself out of

647
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,740
a sort of Schrodinger's breach situation

648
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,370
where you are both breached and not

649
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:19,620
because you can't see it.

650
00:25:20,474 --> 00:25:22,270
So improving visibility

651
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,040
is usually one of the first use cases

652
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,010
where you're gonna see value
from undertaking this activity,

653
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,903
and this is what we tend to think of

654
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:31,053
when we start thinking about ATT&CK.

655
00:25:33,962 --> 00:25:36,480
One of the most interesting
talks that I've seen this year

656
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,643
was from an analyst at ING

657
00:25:37,643 --> 00:25:39,810
that presented earlier at First CTI.

658
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:42,679
And this was about using
the Mitre framework

659
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,930
to map intel requirements.

660
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:47,060
This is something I never
even thought of doing.

661
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,980
This analyst took

662
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,210
the high-level requirements
from their executives

663
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,222
and broke that down into
the types of attacks

664
00:25:52,222 --> 00:25:54,530
that were most likely to create that

665
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:57,473
and mapped that into a matrix.

666
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,680
And so that gave this
analyst another layer

667
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,220
when they were having these conversations

668
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,030
about what adversary behavior is,

669
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,780
what our stakeholders want,

670
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:07,200
and what we see on our networks

671
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,010
to make better decisions.

672
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,660
I know this chart can
be a little hard to see,

673
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,360
so these different triangles
are stakeholder management,

674
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,490
source management,

675
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,460
and track and improving CTI maturity.

676
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,360
So having done that,

677
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,810
they got a another bonus out of it.

678
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,470
Which is all the work they were doing

679
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:26,240
to create intelligence
reports and analysis

680
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,950
and the work that the ops team was doing

681
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,800
to build these detections and
improve coverage on the map,

682
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,360
they were able to cleanly map that back

683
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,729
to program requirements.

684
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,563
Which is something else

685
00:26:35,563 --> 00:26:38,540
that we tend to struggle
with a lot in this space.

686
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,010
So I thought that was a pretty cool use

687
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:41,843
of the ATT&CK framework

688
00:26:41,843 --> 00:26:43,923
that I had never really
thought about before.

689
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,400
Here's another one.

690
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,680
Supporting your product evals.

691
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,090
So this is a talk that was presented here

692
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,209
at ATT&CK Con last year

693
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,350
by two analysts from General Electric.

694
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,959
Great talk,

695
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,310
where they really focused on

696
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,730
how they operationalized
ATT&CK in their organization.

697
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,090
So a lot of those early use
cases we were talking about

698
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,169
is the meat of it,

699
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:04,090
but they also talked about

700
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,100
how they were able to use that knowledge

701
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,429
of where their gaps were

702
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:10,570
to meaningfully change the
way they did product evals.

703
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,919
So now that I'm looking at
where I direct my budget,

704
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,990
where are my gaps,

705
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,290
and now I have another
basis for assessing,

706
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,480
does this tool that this
vendor is selling me

707
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,410
actually do the things it says it does

708
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,340
and that I need it to do?

709
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,173
What an idea.

710
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,440
All right, so you're probably thinking

711
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:32,177
"How did we get here?

712
00:27:32,177 --> 00:27:33,867
"You've just shown me some matrices.

713
00:27:33,867 --> 00:27:35,347
"What is the magical alchemy

714
00:27:35,347 --> 00:27:39,107
"that allows us to get from that chart

715
00:27:39,107 --> 00:27:40,670
"to these amazing outcomes?"

716
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:43,120
And to me what comes to
mind is this quote by,

717
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,310
attributed to President
Dwight D. Eisenhower,

718
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:48,450
that "Plans are worthless,
but planning is everything."

719
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,650
I say maybe because Eisenhower himself

720
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,090
attributed this quote to
something he heard in the army.

721
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,379
So I'm not really sure,

722
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,493
kind of urban legend who
the real owner of this is.

723
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,879
And let's be honest,

724
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,580
the guy that planned the D-Day invasion

725
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,689
gets to be a little bit
more flippant about plans

726
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,993
than the rest of us do.

727
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,963
But there's some real truth here.

728
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,820
And that is,

729
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,590
in some ways it's about the
process and the journey.

730
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,919
When you sit down to do planning,

731
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,900
you're identifying the problem,

732
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,110
you are identifying your assumptions,

733
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,080
you are thinking about

734
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,149
and weighing different courses of action.

735
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:23,100
And that work,

736
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,510
bringing people together to do that work,

737
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:28,683
is really the friends
we made along the way.

738
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:33,460
This is the point where
what you end up facing

739
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,560
is probably gonna look

740
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,110
pretty different from what you planned,

741
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,310
'cause the adversary has OODA loops too.

742
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:41,100
They get a vote in how this unfolds.

743
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,959
But this work leaves
everybody more resilient

744
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,610
and better able to respond
to what actually manifests.

745
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:49,213
Even if it doesn't up in the plan.

746
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:54,080
And so I think a very similar
thing can be said for ATT&CK.

747
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,250
We have these matrices and they are tools,

748
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,390
but it's the discussion

749
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,720
and the process that we're
building within the team,

750
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,640
how we communicate and
how we define the problem

751
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,610
that becomes such a powerful,

752
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,443
this work,

753
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:09,129
not only are we getting improvement
in that core proposition

754
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,030
of defending our enterprise,

755
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,160
we're actually able to drive
change across the security team

756
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,480
and how it operates.

757
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,143
And that is pretty cool.

758
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,160
All right, so sign me up.

759
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,410
I want to do all of these
amazing things with ATT&CK.

760
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:27,319
Full steam ahead, right?

761
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:29,100
Again, in interest,

762
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,939
I put this graphic in for Katie

763
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,890
because she's such a
huge Legally Blonde fan.

764
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,340
So what have we learned from Elle Woods

765
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,629
who thinks that getting into Harvard Law,

766
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,713
like what, it's hard?

767
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,830
Okay, so some of the challenges

768
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:43,399
I've seen teams struggle with

769
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,190
when they start to implement ATT&CK.

770
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,100
First and foremost is the complexity.

771
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:52,149
We are up to 266 techniques
in enterprise ATT&CK alone.

772
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:52,983
I didn't go through

773
00:29:52,983 --> 00:29:55,110
and look at mobile and
pre-ATT&CK, I'm sorry.

774
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,920
And many teams find themselves

775
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,820
extending that framework even further

776
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,250
to more appropriately fit

777
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,280
their environments and their use cases,

778
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,113
which is cool.

779
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,870
Now I've seen Katie tear
through and a report

780
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:08,959
and pull out techniques,

781
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,820
but for most of us mere mortals,

782
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,419
this takes a while.

783
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,170
The learning curve is pretty steep.

784
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:18,231
So I'm extremely excited
for Jackie and Sarah's talk,

785
00:30:18,231 --> 00:30:20,270
with what Mitre's been cooking up

786
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,929
to help reduce the complexity

787
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:25,040
and to improve adoption for new users

788
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,133
and more experienced ones of ATT&CK.

789
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,853
Time.

790
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,140
Done right,

791
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,460
implementing ATT&CK is
gonna change your inputs,

792
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,990
your processes, and your outputs.

793
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:41,010
Plan on this taking at
least six months to a year

794
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,590
of sustained investment

795
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,659
before you feel like

796
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,030
you're really starting
to get the hang of it.

797
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,480
So if you go in thinking that in a month

798
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,160
you're gonna have this licked,

799
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,760
you're probably not setting
yourself up for success.

800
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,260
Now a big part of this

801
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,730
is the weight of classifying
whole bunch of data

802
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,543
to make those matrices meaningful.

803
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,330
Now the ATT&CK team has done

804
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,120
a lot of work with the knowledge base

805
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,649
to give you a head start.

806
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,680
But most teams are gonna
need to build off of this

807
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,010
and layer on their own internal data.

808
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,430
Your premium sources,

809
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,700
your actually internally
produced intelligence,

810
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,730
your incidents,

811
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,350
and understanding of how your systems

812
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,840
map to these techniques.

813
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,100
That's a lot of leg work.

814
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:22,933
And one of the things

815
00:31:22,933 --> 00:31:24,370
that I think is getting very interesting

816
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:26,250
is that in this last two years,

817
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,350
as we as a community have decided

818
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:31,730
that the ATT&CK framework is
how we're gonna talk about TTPs

819
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:34,800
we're starting to see greater
pick up in the vendor space

820
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,649
for supporting ATT&CK.

821
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,110
And that's really important

822
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,409
because both it enables us

823
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:43,020
to auto classify data
more quickly and at scale

824
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,530
and consume that data more effectively.

825
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:48,000
So I'm very curious to
see over this next year

826
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,260
as that starts to gain more speed,

827
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,953
if this time to value here can be reduced.

828
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,669
The third bit in buy in.

829
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,404
I really enjoyed the Black Hat talk,

830
00:32:00,404 --> 00:32:02,170
the Play At Home edition

831
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,980
where Katie and Ryan
Kovar used the framework

832
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,350
of a very small team where
it's just one in each role

833
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:10,323
and how they could get
value out of ATT&CK.

834
00:32:10,324 --> 00:32:12,580
But most of us work in an organization

835
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,629
where more than two people

836
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:16,110
are gonna have to agree
that we want to do this.

837
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,030
So how do we build that buy in

838
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:20,913
and make it sustainable to
get the traction that we need?

839
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,610
So stab me if you've
heard this one before.

840
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,129
The senior threat intel analyst
doesn't want to use ATT&CK

841
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:30,050
because it feels like bolting
on a huge other layer of work

842
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,200
and it slows them down.

843
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,600
The ops lead kind of loses interest

844
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,699
after the first time they
step through this exercise

845
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,020
and they did all this work

846
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,360
just to get to the same decision

847
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,246
they knew they were gonna
make based off of intuition.

848
00:32:42,247 --> 00:32:43,650
"This was a lot of work

849
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:46,170
to get to the same point that
I thought I was gonna get to."

850
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,470
And then interest fizzles.

851
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,353
So

852
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,783
those concerns are valid.

853
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,290
But what we're trying to do here,

854
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,389
why do we put in all this work

855
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:59,220
to get to potentially
that initial same outcome

856
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,590
that I could have gotten too much faster

857
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:03,159
by just putting these two
people in a room together?

858
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,483
The answer is scale.

859
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,139
That senior threat intel analyst

860
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,780
and that ops lead don't scale.

861
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,280
There's a finite amount of decisions

862
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,399
the two of them can make,

863
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,320
and they don't scale across
that whole matrix of techniques.

864
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,360
If teams were actually
working effectively that way,

865
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,832
we would not need this.

866
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,300
So what happens is you get into this space

867
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,133
where let's say

868
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,133
your initial OODA loop
pre-ATT&CK is like this,

869
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:27,570
and you start going through
and doing all this work,

870
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:28,740
and as you're learning,

871
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,310
your OODA loop actually
kind of looks like this.

872
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,970
It's gonna slow you down
the first time you do this.

873
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,320
Sometimes painfully slow.

874
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,082
But what we want to get
to eventually is this.

875
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,660
And those two people can't get here.

876
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,560
You need the whole team participating

877
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,443
in order to get that much
smaller and tighter OODA loop.

878
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:49,440
And that means breaking down this problem

879
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,810
into more manageable chunks

880
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:53,840
and having a process that
allows the whole team

881
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,879
and not just the two seniors

882
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,950
who have enough institutional knowledge

883
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,550
to know where the bodies are buried

884
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,460
and what approaches we've
tried before hasn't worked.

885
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,340
This is a way to leverage the entire team

886
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,003
and bring them together
to make those decisions.

887
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,190
That's a pretty good sell.

888
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,389
I think it's a pretty
compelling value proposition

889
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,703
and a way to build buy in.

890
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:17,830
So if we focus on the "why" and the "how",

891
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:20,870
then the "what" becomes a lot easier.

892
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:23,509
But central to that is
managing those expectations.

893
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:26,400
So understanding how long it's
gonna take for us to do this

894
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,970
and where those learning
experiences are along the way

895
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:32,569
I think is really important to preventing

896
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,300
that false start or the
fizzling out of interest

897
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,500
that you sometimes see
with different teams.

898
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:42,362
And one way to do this
is to use the community.

899
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:45,592
This is a very vibrant community

900
00:34:45,592 --> 00:34:48,870
full of practitioners doing
really interesting things.

901
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:51,409
And a lot for this content is accessible.

902
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:54,500
The talks that I showed
earlier in the deck,

903
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,969
I've sent those to
probably dozens of people

904
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,680
who were struggling
with how to get started

905
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,513
or were thinking about

906
00:35:00,513 --> 00:35:02,900
a more interesting use case for ATT&CK.

907
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,920
So take notes these next two days,

908
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,140
meet each other,

909
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:10,650
because this is part of how
you help solidify that buy in.

910
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,270
Having a compelling vignette

911
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:14,460
from a peer team at another company

912
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,050
can be worth everything when
it comes to building buy in.

913
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,788
And this is a wonderful forum

914
00:35:19,788 --> 00:35:22,393
to get those stories
and meet those people.

915
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,090
So a few closing thoughts
as we head off unto

916
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:32,440
this two-day wonderful journey
full of amazing content.

917
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,030
We've talked a little bit today,

918
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,160
I've talked,

919
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,450
about why we're here.

920
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:40,210
The purpose of intel is to
create a decision advantage.

921
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,060
And that's not something
that intel can do alone.

922
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,190
It really requires a partnership

923
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,300
between intelligence and operations.

924
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,840
You need all of your
defenders working together.

925
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,900
And as we've seen,

926
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,570
sometimes we get there
on our own individually

927
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,840
but not consistently,

928
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,590
and there's some good reasons for that.

929
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:57,230
And so ATT&CK is a really,
really powerful tool

930
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,270
in our arsenal

931
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:01,800
to help drive that type of
change across the security team

932
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,280
by making us focused on the
same level of intelligence

933
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,340
that ops needs to its work,

934
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,500
by thinking about how we can use that

935
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,290
to drive other parts and
processes across a security team,

936
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,930
and thinking through some of the pitfalls

937
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,500
and challenges that we have.

938
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,480
It's a fair question with to
ask these other presenters

939
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,070
as we go through

940
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:21,220
what was your pain here,

941
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,740
how long did this take?

942
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,000
All of those things help
us manage our expectations

943
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,420
and build that buy in

944
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,060
so that the investment that we're making

945
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,023
is stable and pays off over time.

946
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,470
That's all I have for you today.

947
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,692
Thank you so much.
