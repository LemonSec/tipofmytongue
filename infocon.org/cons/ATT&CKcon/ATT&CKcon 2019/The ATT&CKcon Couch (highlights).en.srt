1
00:00:00,347 --> 00:00:02,770
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,880
- So Jamie Williams, my awesome teammate,

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,430
adversary emulation
engineer, here at Mitre,

4
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:09,750
is going to be chatting
with some of our speakers.

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,050
Some special guests, as well.

6
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,470
Talking to them on the ATT&CKcon couch.

7
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,200
So online folks, see you over there,

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,290
folks in McLean and online,

9
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:20,099
we'll see you back here at 11:00 o'clock,

10
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,460
over to you Jamie.

11
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,470
- Hello world, welcome
to the ATT&CKcon couch.

12
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,869
As Katie said earlier, I'm
your host Jamie Williams,

13
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,870
and I will be sitting down
with some of our speakers

14
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,870
and very interesting
guests in the morning,

15
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,130
lunch and afternoon breaks.

16
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,470
First thing that I wanna call out

17
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,170
is thank you for participating,

18
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,990
thank you for joining, we
really appreciate you joining

19
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:40,440
from all over the world.

20
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,120
We're watching the tweets, we love it,

21
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,199
the cat memes, videos, keep 'em coming.

22
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,620
Don't forget to download your
watch party selfie poster.

23
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:48,710
We wanna see pictures of you,

24
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,740
we wanna see where you are,

25
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,050
how you guys are getting together.

26
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,699
And like you said, close this community.

27
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,120
It's not just us here,
it's not just us at Mitre,

28
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,989
we really want this to be a world-wide,

29
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,120
we're all in this together, effort.

30
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,860
One note is, I am not just talking to you,

31
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,019
I wanna hear back.

32
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:04,852
If you have any questions

33
00:01:04,852 --> 00:01:06,110
you want me to project to the guest,

34
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,830
as well as anything you wanted
to talk about on this forum,

35
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:11,380
feel free to use the ATT&CKcon hashtag.

36
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,750
It's #attackcon to send messages our way.

37
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,340
With that, I'm gonna introduce,

38
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,600
you've already seen
her speak, our keynote,

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,690
wine aficionado and
former Georgetown Hoya,

40
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:23,523
and I guess, current.

41
00:01:23,523 --> 00:01:24,619
'Cause you're never really out of it.

42
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,453
- That's correct.

43
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:27,048
- Keynote speaker, Toni Gidwani.

44
00:01:27,048 --> 00:01:28,530
- Thank you.

45
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,520
- So, awesome talk, I really
love the keynote speech.

46
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,810
Like you said, I think one
of the hardest challenges

47
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,690
about doing a keynote is like you said,

48
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,110
setting the tone for the complete day.

49
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,860
I think you did that with the OODA Loop,

50
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,130
the importance of intel,
as well as pyramid pain,

51
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,220
you can't do attack--
- That's right.

52
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,100
- Without a pyramid of pain.

53
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,190
Fantastic talk.

54
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,440
How are you liking the conference so far?

55
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,289
- Oh, it's great!

56
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,970
Admittedly, it's been just
the keynote and kicking off

57
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,340
and seeing what Blake's had to
share on the state of ATT&CK.

58
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,420
It's a great crowd, though.

59
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,090
Seen a lot of familiar faces,
but also a lot of new ones.

60
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,410
And the range, in terms of how many people

61
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,310
are tuning in from all over the world,

62
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,050
I think is really impressive.

63
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,759
And a testament to how much ATT&CK

64
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,110
is growing and taking off.

65
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,693
(upbeat music)

66
00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:27,010
- As the host of the ATT&CKcon couch,

67
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,750
hopefully it's been good for you guys.

68
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,960
Been a pleasure for me to host you

69
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,173
and please enjoy the rest of ATT&CKcon.

70
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:34,756
(upbeat music)
