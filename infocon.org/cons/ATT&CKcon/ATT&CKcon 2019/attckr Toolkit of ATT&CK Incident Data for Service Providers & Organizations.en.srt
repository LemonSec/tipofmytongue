1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,301
- [Host] Please join me
in welcoming Bob Rudis.

2
00:00:03,301 --> 00:00:04,286
- Thank you.

3
00:00:04,286 --> 00:00:06,536
(applause)

4
00:00:08,477 --> 00:00:11,850
So this is a talk for, I
think it works for everyone

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,830
but it's kinda geared
toward service providers

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,610
and large organizations so if you're

7
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,689
in one of those two categories,
could you raise your hand?

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,100
Cool, hopefully as this package evolves

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,230
and maybe you might use R,
actually how many people

10
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,490
use R too cause this is
gonna be an R focused talk.

11
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:26,322
Good, there's, nice.

12
00:00:26,323 --> 00:00:28,370
There's a nice tiny focus here.

13
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,560
So this is, what I've
tried to do is take like

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,420
some of the practices we're
doing internally, open-source

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,770
them and give tools to
folks out there so we can

16
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,670
all make security better at organizations

17
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,370
like help organizations have
better security outcomes.

18
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,390
And, so just quickly about
me, for about 20 years

19
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,820
I had a real job like most of you

20
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,520
and then I did this thing called the

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,330
Data Breach Investigation's
Report for a couple years.

22
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,750
And now I'm chief data scientist at Rapid7

23
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,290
and I don't have a real job
cause I'm not actually out there

24
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,420
in the trenches having to
do hunts, having to actually

25
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,834
keep organizations safe every single day.

26
00:00:59,834 --> 00:01:02,610
I work at Rapid7 labs where
we do lots of research

27
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,760
and we do lots of reports
and I do lots of work work

28
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,060
but you guys are kind of the
unsung heroes of security.

29
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,700
There's a really old book
out about this stuff called

30
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,820
Data Driven Security,
it's like five years old,

31
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,580
I feel real old because of that.

32
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,230
And if you also would like
to play with some data,

33
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,730
opendata.rapid7.com, we
basically give away all of our

34
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,090
scan data, so if you want to
have at that it's all yours,

35
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,320
just sign up and go to
there and we'll do that.

36
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,869
And for folks that use R
and don't know my R stuff,

37
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,150
there's about 90 packages
out there that are related

38
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,820
to cyber security stuff.

39
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,779
So have at that as well
and keep out there.

40
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,395
And there's another one now.

41
00:01:36,395 --> 00:01:39,089
So is this like my obligatory
MITRE ATT&CK slide ache.

42
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,545
I've been talking about ATT&CK publicly

43
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:42,700
for about a year now.

44
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,690
Actually ATT&CK kind of
kept me in cyber security,

45
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,070
I was getting really down
about cyber for a while

46
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,250
and then when Attack came out
I got like really invigorated

47
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,500
again cause it was filling a
really missing gap everywhere.

48
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,840
And we've really embraced ATT&CK at Rapid7

49
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,820
especially within Rapid7 labs and our

50
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,919
manage detection and response
practice where we kind of

51
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,440
deal with a whole bunch of
organizations and dealing with

52
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,130
response for those folks.

53
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:07,039
And for a while we were hand
coding, I think everyone's

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,670
probably felt this pain,
hand coding our incidents

55
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:12,450
and the detections from
the environment and from

56
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,660
the hunts people did to
ATT&CK, starting in January

57
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,620
of this year, that is an automated process

58
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,080
very similar to the coupled
other automated processes

59
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,720
that you've heard of
here, so I love that theme

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,553
that I've heard today.

61
00:02:23,553 --> 00:02:25,430
Whoever organized this
again did an amazing job

62
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,020
cause like it cascades down really well.

63
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,780
You can do the automation,
it actually will work

64
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,280
and it's actually pretty cool.

65
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,610
I will show you some of
the results from that here.

66
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,170
If you wanna see ATT&CK based reports,

67
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,880
our quarterly threat reports
starting especially with

68
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,480
this quarter, are all basically
doing ATT&CK based metrics

69
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,090
and no other type of
metrics that are out there

70
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,580
except for the stuff that we see

71
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,925
at our global honeypot network.

72
00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:52,780
So ATT&CK is kind of used
mostly on red and blue teams

73
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,810
right now, at least that's the
way I've been seeing it used

74
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,550
as I talk to folks, you're
out there in the trenches,

75
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,550
you're doing the work or
defending, or you're in the

76
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,480
pentest team or the red team
and you're actually kinda

77
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,329
go out there and do things.

78
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,490
But you know, those are two
ways of actually using it,

79
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,810
but it actually, I don't
see ATT&CK being used at the

80
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,974
layer 8 team a whole lot.

81
00:03:09,974 --> 00:03:12,579
They're also not very
colorful at the layer 8 team.

82
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,290
And so my goal with
this one, and we do this

83
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,480
on a regular basis is to
try to use ATT&CK at a

84
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,170
macro level to convey what's
going on across all of our

85
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,750
customers and two each of
our individual customers

86
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,340
and at an industry level.

87
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,410
So we have the ability to
kind of give an idea of

88
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,630
what's happening, what's missing.

89
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,200
And I'll kinda go through
some of that right now.

90
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,410
So this is, all the slides are online,

91
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,829
I'm not a big github fan but
I think everybody else is,

92
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,450
so I stick myself everywhere
so that you're not locked into

93
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,310
a closed platform.

94
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,980
Sorry, I'm one of those guys, yeah.

95
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,790
So it's all out there and
all this stuff is out there

96
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,420
and you can grab it from
there but we'll give you a

97
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,269
high level view of it now
since we don't have a whole lot

98
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,260
of time to go into detail.

99
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,480
So why R, first of all?

100
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,700
It's why R, cause I like
R and I program in R,

101
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,730
I program in everything
but I kind of program in R.

102
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,090
So, but why am I doing this in R?

103
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,820
Why am I trying to get
you use R to do this?

104
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,530
So this is R, its open-source
just like all the other things

105
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,760
that you probably use, it's
mission-built for doing

106
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,140
data science type tasks
which include visualization

107
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,109
and other types of analysis.

108
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,560
In this particular case, it's
got a very rich ecosystem

109
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,440
for doing data visualization
and that's one of the things

110
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,070
I like to actually try to do with it.

111
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,290
And R isn't just R, much
like Python or other tools,

112
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,440
R can interface with lots
of everything so every one

113
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,810
of those lists up there plus the ellipses,

114
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,290
R can interface with pretty much any other

115
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,340
language out there and you
can use it really effectively

116
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,789
and a lot more effectively than
you can for those languages

117
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,623
from other languages.

118
00:04:30,623 --> 00:04:33,150
So if you haven't tried R, I
encourage you to give it a shot

119
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,310
but if you're gonna use R, you
really need to use R Studio.

120
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,180
And I'm doing this, like I'm
not even pimping R Studio,

121
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,170
it's a free product as well too.

122
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,770
And the reason why I'm saying
to use this one, it really

123
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,200
makes R kind of like, and this
is the way I kind of use it

124
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,539
and there's other folks that
use it this way, it's kind of

125
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,010
the best DFIR investigations
console ever made

126
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,260
and even though you don't know about it.

127
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,420
So you can do all sorts
of stuff within it, it's a

128
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,210
source code editor, you could
execute things line-by-line,

129
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,109
I'm gonna talk about notebooks
in a second so if you're

130
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,358
a notebook fan, you can use
stuff in a notebook format.

131
00:05:03,358 --> 00:05:06,580
And if you wanna use your
favorite language instead of R

132
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,580
in it, you can even in kind
of ripple format as well too.

133
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,460
So our studio is a great
environment for doing

134
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,210
all sorts of things, that
kind of wraps R up and kind of

135
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,810
gives it even more super
powers than it already has.

136
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,833
So more reasons for why I use R

137
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:20,960
so I can calm down a little bit now.

138
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,020
rmarkdown is one of the
main reasons why I think R

139
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,169
and doing things within R
context work really well.

140
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:30,180
rmarkdown, there's two flavors
of it, a notebook format

141
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,330
so if you're one of those
weird Jupyter notebook fans,

142
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,627
this is kind of like that.

143
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:35,070
I'm not a big notebook fan,

144
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,140
I think browsers are for
browsing and you know,

145
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,740
real things are for real things.

146
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,340
Just a little thing, that's all.

147
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,520
But you can also code up
reports that you can actually

148
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,250
write in here too, so one of
the things you actually get

149
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,070
with this which I'm gonna
show you, is like an already

150
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,330
pre-built canned report for
actually generating some

151
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,150
initial high level
visualizations that will get

152
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,770
expanded over time as
the package increases.

153
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,555
So rmarkdown is really cool
and it isn't limited to

154
00:05:58,555 --> 00:05:59,980
just the R language.

155
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,370
You can do Python stuff in it,
you can do Scala stuff in it.

156
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,130
You can do anything you want to in it.

157
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,219
It's very expandable and it kinda does

158
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,900
a whole lot of things.

159
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,710
It can also do application
building, it's a really really

160
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,354
simple application building
interface that ties code

161
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:16,500
and code logic and
presentation together in a very

162
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,850
straightforward way so that
you have the ability to

163
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,880
create interactive presentations,
and one of the goals

164
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,330
of this as you'll see towards the end is

165
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,580
I'm gonna help build an app
so that you can actually have

166
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,104
the ability to do this without coding.

167
00:06:27,105 --> 00:06:30,120
So like why, what's the purpose of attckr?

168
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,700
So some of the purposes of it
are to answer questions like

169
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,020
what does the distribution
of tactics and techniques

170
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,400
look like across my customer
base within a customer

171
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,960
in a particular industry,
however you wanna

172
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,645
slice up the categories.

173
00:06:41,645 --> 00:06:44,680
Where do we have technology
gaps, either as us, a provider,

174
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,480
or as organizations.

175
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,830
Where do we have workforce gaps?

176
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,289
And I'll talk about
that a little bit down.

177
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,230
Where should we invest our
limited budget in certain

178
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:56,190
defense technologies or
certain defense processes?

179
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,580
How does this thing
compare with that thing?

180
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,750
And that could be anything
like these tactics' usage

181
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,010
against these tactics' usage

182
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:07,010
or this attckr uses of
tactics or this attckr,

183
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,050
you can do all this because
we have the ability to kind of

184
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,813
put things into a particular format.

185
00:07:12,813 --> 00:07:14,760
And with what's the dwell
time trend as well too,

186
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,430
I'm a really big fan of dwell time.

187
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,008
In the DBIR we call that
the detection deficit,

188
00:07:20,008 --> 00:07:22,340
I have to call it dwell time
because we call it dwell time

189
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,580
at work, so that's what
I'm gonna do there.

190
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,330
So one of the things you get with this

191
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,330
is a kind of pre-built
set of things that make it

192
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,289
easier to use the CTI format.

193
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,380
I think as the previous
speaker just said, you can

194
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,520
stare at the CTI JSON,
it's like looking into

195
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,210
the heart of the TARDIS,
it's beautiful but it will

196
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,840
drive you mad.

197
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,292
And it's not very suited for
data science tasks at all.

198
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:44,950
As I was telling Katie before,
I'm really not a big fan

199
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,430
of excel but I'm a big
fan of rectangular data.

200
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,910
So I have rectangularized
a lot of the CTI data,

201
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,890
stuck it into here so you can use it.

202
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,330
Plus I provided other tools
and mechanisms for you

203
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,990
to take that data and enable
it to do other kind of

204
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:59,530
data science tasks with that
or visualization tasks on there

205
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,330
so I'm not gonna through those
all in here, I wanted to put

206
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,161
it here as like a teaser
for what you can do with it

207
00:08:03,161 --> 00:08:04,829
to have it out there.

208
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:08,150
But the thing about this
is every time MITRE updates

209
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,750
the CTI format this goes out, grabs it,

210
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,110
rebuilds the package,
re-tidies all the data

211
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,780
and puts it back out
there so you have no work

212
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,630
on your end to kind of do go do this.

213
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,720
So what I did for stuff
I'm gonna show you today

214
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,090
is we use like, we actually use MITRE,

215
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,669
the MITRE ATT&CK framework

216
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,150
and we code all of our
incidents in it like I said,

217
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,810
some of it's through
automation, some of it's through

218
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,578
the hunt data that the
folks actually do themselves

219
00:08:29,578 --> 00:08:30,739
for things.

220
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,440
This is a sample of JSON
that I'm using that's kinda

221
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,560
the foundation of the
data that I've got all the

222
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,459
visualizations based on here.

223
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,470
Don't get hung up on this
JSON, I'm gonna support using

224
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,303
whatever you guys want.

225
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:42,937
So whether it's the STIX
format or whether it's the new

226
00:08:42,937 --> 00:08:46,320
MITRE ATT&CK format for doing
like the sharing of these

227
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,970
things that's gonna be out there.

228
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,530
I'm hoping, I'm really hoping
that like Varisk and ATT&CK

229
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,990
have some kind of lovechild
that give us the ability

230
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,792
to have a really cool data
set that gives us this

231
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:59,440
macro view of these things as well.

232
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,329
So v2 of attckr or v0.2 of attckr is like,

233
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:03,900
well what do you get
out of the box one now,

234
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,990
and you're gonna get the
ability to analyze dwell time

235
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,380
metrics, produce ATT&CK
heatmaps in a way that I like to

236
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,560
produce them and I'm hoping
to convince you of this.

237
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,050
An awesome way to look
at what I like to call

238
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,829
Cumulative ATT&CK Tactics Distributions.

239
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,500
It's a fancy sounding thing that hopefully

240
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,110
won't be too complex.

241
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,210
The thing on the left
is one giant html page

242
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,680
that got generated through
an rmarkdown report.

243
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,780
What you see copied and
pasted across all over there

244
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,800
are some of the expanded
sections, so lets just go through

245
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,770
some of them instead of actually

246
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,800
trying to stare at that screen.

247
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,910
So this is all, you
basically load up you create,

248
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,730
this is all done by actually
just going into the package,

249
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,800
starting a new rmarkdown file
that's based on this template,

250
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,400
giving it your data and then it magically

251
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,069
makes all these charts for
you so you don't have to do

252
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,220
like literally any work except

253
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,370
get your data into the format.

254
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,170
So I took a sample of
all of our incidents,

255
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,747
I created, actually I
took all of our incidents,

256
00:09:49,747 --> 00:09:52,560
I created distribution based
upon all those incidents

257
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,550
and then I created a,
like I selected a sample

258
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,620
of that distribution for
putting into the package.

259
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,010
So you get real life incidents or at least

260
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,150
a picture of real life
incidents based on the

261
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,660
distribution of incidents
that we've actually seen

262
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,209
with me removing some
things so I could have

263
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,540
some talking points today.

264
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,010
So one of them, one of
the things you get to see

265
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,160
dwell time based upon
this incident data set.

266
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,319
And the cool thing about this
is like, the whole idea is

267
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,960
you wanna actually
reduce dwell time, right?

268
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,270
So like you get the ability
to show these reports,

269
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,689
have them available and
also look at them over time.

270
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,150
So this is looking at
those for the overall one,

271
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,730
this is looking at it by
quarter, and then it's looking at

272
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,910
the overall and it's a
little harder to see with the

273
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,839
colors but you basically
get the over time view

274
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,280
of how you're doing with the dwell time.

275
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,060
So you can communicate
that back to show how well

276
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,479
your technology is doing or
how well your folks are doing

277
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,410
kinda working at these things.

278
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,010
You can generate that in
a bunch of different ways

279
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:44,590
so there's a heatmap view
of the dwell time as well.

280
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,810
And then you can actually
look at it more specifically

281
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:47,949
and this is a better
view than the other one

282
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,240
to kind of look at dwell
time specifically by month

283
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,073
instead of by quarter.

284
00:10:51,073 --> 00:10:53,260
So it's lots of slicing it different ways.

285
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,270
If you want more views, submit an issue.

286
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,786
I don't care where in those repos you do

287
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:58,410
if you want to submit an
issue, I'll be glad to put it

288
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,140
out there, it's actually
not that much work.

289
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,645
It's also not that hard to
copy and paste the template

290
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:03,800
code to do it yourself.

291
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,160
So I love this heatmap versus
the ones that I've seen

292
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,800
generally produced which shows
the entire framework and then

293
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,439
you've got like little things
colored here and there.

294
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,460
So what I've done is created a way to

295
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,505
with one call to one R
function generate a heatmap

296
00:11:16,505 --> 00:11:21,106
that's sorted by the most
occurred technique within

297
00:11:21,106 --> 00:11:24,220
that particular tactic
and then put it out there.

298
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,150
You can do it proportion,
like this way you can do it

299
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,750
proportionally, you can do it over time.

300
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,060
I'm gonna go back to this one real quick.

301
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,939
So what I've also done on
here is I've deliberately

302
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,160
left out some things that
we had because you get to

303
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,020
immediately see gaps.

304
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,470
Right, so you know that this
is nowhere near as big as

305
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,500
the entire MITRE ATT&CK framework.

306
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,510
You also see that privilege
escalation discovery

307
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,340
and xfill are missing
from this particular one

308
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,830
and I did that on purpose.

309
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,710
I'll talk a little bit more
on why that's important

310
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:50,350
in a minute, but being able
to see where things aren't

311
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,720
there is almost as important
as seeing where things are

312
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,240
or what things are where
because you might have to deal

313
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,660
with what those gaps
actually are out there.

314
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,016
So you can see it over time
as well too, to see what

315
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:00,630
changed over a quarter.

316
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,670
And so I wanted to kind of go to this one

317
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,780
and almost land on this one.

318
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,196
So this is a cumulative
ATT&CK distribution and the

319
00:12:06,196 --> 00:12:08,370
number's a little harder to
see, it's probably easier

320
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,750
online, you can grab the
slides and look at it.

321
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,710
So what I've done is, it
accumulates all of the tactics

322
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,750
that have occurred, all the
techniques within a tactic

323
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,730
that have occurred and we
basically sum all those up,

324
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,600
we get the percentage of those
and we just add those over

325
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,910
since we actually have a
really nice open-source of...

326
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,512
I can do this.

327
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,780
A really nice opensource kill
chain that we can use to see

328
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,980
the things progress over to
each individual category.

329
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,740
So what you're seeing, and
I think there's a button...

330
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,240
So you can see there's gaps
and privilege escalation

331
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,650
and lateral movement, and
what we can do at work

332
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:42,069
which will eventually be in the package is

333
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:45,320
drill down into both what's
in each individual category,

334
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,420
so what are you finding versus
what aren't you finding.

335
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,930
But then you also get to
see like what isn't there.

336
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,400
So why isn't that stuff there?

337
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,819
And it's a great conversation
to have about maybe

338
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,170
your, the folks that
your customers might have

339
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,829
technology gaps, like they might
not have things that detect

340
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,510
things that are feeding
into your environment

341
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,980
to be able to find these things.

342
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,910
You may have gaps in your
log parsing for those things

343
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,900
or you may have incident
responders that don't like to

344
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,319
deal with those types of
types of events and just

345
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,720
kind of ignore them.

346
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,982
So this gives you a way to
identify those areas and see

347
00:13:11,982 --> 00:13:14,519
where they are and kinda
maybe have some like,

348
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,702
more tools at your disposal to investigate

349
00:13:16,702 --> 00:13:18,702
and dig into things a little bit better.

350
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,630
Then you can also do really
cool things like for us,

351
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,040
do it by industry, so again
it's a little harder to see

352
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,180
but this is basically a
combined cumulative graph

353
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,310
that shows how each individuals' industry

354
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,930
tactics and techniques
distribution looks compared

355
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:34,050
to each other, it's pretty
much like the others,

356
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,969
a similar pattern but some
of them look a little bit

357
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,730
differently, I did sort
of jury-rig this one

358
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,320
to make it look differently.

359
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,380
But this way you can see
what's happening across

360
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,180
all of those, have the
ability to do more stuff.

361
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,560
So what are we gonna do?

362
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,090
We're gonna add more
charts, we're gonna add more

363
00:13:48,091 --> 00:13:51,290
discrete timestamp
support, more functions,

364
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,510
hopefully get to the point where there's

365
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,100
zero coding skills
required and give you some

366
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,880
event stream analysis so
basically think MITRE ATT&CKs

367
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,230
with incidents and then do
clickstream analysis and that

368
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,820
to be able to do really
interesting distribution checks

369
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,650
against what might be
the most prevalent thing

370
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,063
in your environment and why.

371
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:08,323
And I got 30 seconds.

372
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,311
- Nailed it, well please
join me in thanking Bob.

373
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,561
(applause)
