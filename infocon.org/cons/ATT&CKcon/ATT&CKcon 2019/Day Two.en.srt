Wonderful community to be a part

consistently impressed with the 
quality of presentations I've 

25
00:10:56,074 --> 00:10:59,940
seen not just here but a 
conference is all throughout the

00:11:00,615 --> 00:11:05,128
year and the tech team itself 
but coming from the immunity

that community

and it's exciting to see the

companies come to the table and 
are willing to roll up their

sleeves and collaborate learn 
share and we hope we will have

Julian in the awesome media team
I think they probably

40
00:12:32,276 --> 00:12:34,276
did make the reception last 
night they were putting that 

41
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,889
video together so thank you to 
them and all of you who were 

42
00:12:37,097 --> 00:12:41,622
here yesterday to get great 
images for that video.  And now 

43
00:12:41,832 --> 00:12:44,543
I will start to kick things off 
I am talking about some of the 

44
00:12:44,749 --> 00:12:46,749
themes from what we heard 
yesterday. First when I heard 

45
00:12:46,912 --> 00:12:52,491
bookends of the day beginning in
and Tony talked about that and 

46
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,862
how we have to figure out our 
own loop to take action 

47
00:12:56,071 --> 00:13:00,298
eventually and Rich mentioned at
the end getting to the 

48
00:13:00,512 --> 00:13:06,227
adversaries Kudo loop add rhyme 
was watch online but it Kudo 

49
00:13:06,436 --> 00:13:10,416
loop fan and not here for the 
little loop -- --

50
00:13:15,138 --> 00:13:18,988
the idea of how do we prioritize
whether it is our [ 

51
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:26,507
Indiscernible - Poor Audio ] 
ores team of one David rocking 

52
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,964
first presentation talked about 
that as well so prioritizing in 

53
00:13:29,704 --> 00:13:34,174
next one like 30 times yesterday
the idea that

54
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:40,608
we are endless but that means we
are human and approach things 

55
00:13:40,814 --> 00:13:42,269
differently and have different 
perspectives and cognitive 

56
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:46,061
biases and how we educate those 
we heard a few common themes 

57
00:13:46,268 --> 00:13:49,598
working as a team, also using 
machines to help us out whether 

58
00:13:49,815 --> 00:13:53,966
it is tram or other data-driven 
approaches to hedge against 

59
00:13:54,187 --> 00:13:58,201
biases and heard false starts so
to speak and nationwide folks 

60
00:13:58,599 --> 00:14:01,852
but started out they almost 
threw it the tach out the door 

61
00:14:02,254 --> 00:14:04,859
it is not easy always to start 
and get tripped up

62
00:14:08,558 --> 00:14:10,781
have to persevere and throughout
all of those and throughout the 

63
00:14:10,992 --> 00:14:13,338
day I think that video just 
showed us we have to work 

64
00:14:13,544 --> 00:14:16,079
together if we will gain that 
intelligence advantage as Tony 

65
00:14:16,285 --> 00:14:18,385
talked about in our awesome 
keynote we have to work together

66
00:14:18,914 --> 00:14:21,976
about community.  That was a 
serious side and maybe not so 

67
00:14:22,725 --> 00:14:28,453
serious side but really 
important in Microsoft Excel, is

68
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:33,267
it a great tool or the best tool
ever? The debate on Twitter was 

69
00:14:33,478 --> 00:14:38,372
spirited.  First up Dan call is 
here today and some things he 

70
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:43,349
uses spreadsheets for and what 
side you think he falls on 

71
00:14:43,558 --> 00:14:45,558
figuring out what food

72
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:50,760
is diaper first is important 
rocketship cookie experiment and

73
00:14:50,761 --> 00:14:52,972
also check it aficionado and 
Baker and appreciated that one 

74
00:14:53,181 --> 00:14:57,666
and also noting that a follow-up
gave a shout out to Excel 

75
00:14:57,877 --> 00:15:02,736
certainly one more spreadsheet 
of doom a good Excel reference 

76
00:15:02,946 --> 00:15:09,514
from love this one on Twitter 
found a lot presentation Excel 

77
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:15,203
at attack on using Excel and the
pun theme and great for sharing 

78
00:15:15,411 --> 00:15:20,973
data been worked on and original
raw source and maybe not so much

79
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:24,272
and starting to get some debate 
and at the center of debate Mark

80
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:29,800
chimed in as well 15 spreadsheet
my team must look at 

81
00:15:30,214 --> 00:15:34,488
ineffectiveness of using Excel 
Mark and I were kindred spirits 

82
00:15:35,242 --> 00:15:40,781
here and in full set goat was on
the anti-Excel training and hope

83
00:15:40,988 --> 00:15:47,686
we get them brought back in 
unpopular opinion is good idea 

84
00:15:47,895 --> 00:15:51,948
of dissent and Intel is 
important keeps us sharp.  A 

85
00:15:52,173 --> 00:15:57,852
couple more tweets about that so
goat they give the spreadsheet 

86
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:03,730
to create this beer and wine and
liquor influence version of 

87
00:16:04,484 --> 00:16:11,441
attack maybe using methodology 
and this is why navigator so 

88
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:16,260
much better than Excel so that 
is why and we will see if the 

89
00:16:16,464 --> 00:16:22,775
Excel debates range on today 
also yesterday morning I said [

I don't always get called on to 

97
00:16:58,234 --> 00:17:00,534
solve problems for safer world 
but when I do I always start 

98
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:03,862
with the MITRE attack framework 
and if you interview at MITRE 

99
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,320
bring that hand it over doing 
during the interview and more 

100
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:18,503
important and all the cat memes 
and botnets and shout out to CIS

101
00:17:18,712 --> 00:17:21,731
with control so thanks Chris for
that are other kind of meme 

102
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:29,256
experts Axel who I think is 
actually here and ask him to 

103
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:34,070
come up and receive his prize 
that adversaries classic meme 

104
00:17:34,278 --> 00:17:39,769
here, so many good ones, my 
favorite one though,

105
00:17:44,678 --> 00:17:51,224

112
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:28,357
we realize it's tough because 
Jamie has awesome interviews 

113
00:18:28,563 --> 00:18:30,878
during break and when you get 
your copy for the online folks 

114
00:18:31,082 --> 00:18:33,498
these are good problems to have 
my friends but we appreciate and

115
00:18:33,984 --> 00:18:40,339
the feed, this was our favorite 
so Jacob if you're listening 

116
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:47,243
send us a DM I was laughing for 
a good 10 minutes about this,

this is the ultimate so thanks 
to Jacob for that.  Lot of fun 

119
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:04,312
yesterday on Twitter keep 
tweeting and hashtag and Seymour

120

watch party's round the world 
talk to you from Virginia Beach 

121
00:19:07,827 --> 00:19:12,601
someone from India keep tweeting
today it is fun for us.  And 

122

Ishmael

123
00:19:16,512 --> 00:19:20,175
didn't have any ninja cats in 
his closing remarks so we got 

124
00:19:20,384 --> 00:19:25,599
Jedi turtles light sabers and 
ninja cats for you on day two

125
00:19:31,366 --> 00:19:33,693
on a slightly more serious note 
some tweeds to call out I 

126
00:19:33,916 --> 00:19:36,452
mentioned this as well Bryce 
calling out the importance of 

127
00:19:36,664 --> 00:19:38,290
diversity diversity a strength 
and security different 

128
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:43,601
perspectives make us better and 
talked about biases we have as 

129
00:19:43,811 --> 00:19:48,678
humans different perspectives 
help us hedge against Ed and 

130
00:19:48,891 --> 00:19:53,119
Bryce acknowledged all of 
photographer love and we have 

131
00:19:53,534 --> 00:19:55,534
making amazing graphics as 
result and

132
00:19:59,428 --> 00:20:01,428
photographer appreciate at that 
as well and Brian Neely could 

133
00:20:01,517 --> 00:20:04,666
not be here today and but a 
comment I feel like summarized 

134
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:08,991
yesterday something John Wunder 
said MITRE is not providing the 

135
00:20:09,206 --> 00:20:14,228
value the community is.  We 
maintain this attack theme but 

136
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,419
you make it real you all use it 
every day and and I felt that 

137
00:20:17,636 --> 00:20:20,939
was a great way to summarize our
day one and thanks to all of you

138
00:20:21,149 --> 00:20:23,149
for

139
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:27,546
tweeting here in person also 
great conversations and look 

140
00:20:27,547 --> 00:20:30,568
forward to continuing that 
through our day to.  Now we will

141
00:20:30,775 --> 00:20:35,999
officially kick off the first 
speaker ask her time I know they

142
00:20:36,215 --> 00:20:39,724
have interesting stories to 
tell.  My pleasure to introduce 

143
00:20:39,935 --> 00:20:44,381
her neck speaker Sarah Jane and 
John Gray and community was 

144
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:48,062
excited to get the submission 
because we often get questions 

145
00:20:48,273 --> 00:20:56,185
from folks about can you create 
toaster oven and have you seen 

146
00:20:56,499 --> 00:20:59,061
and they want intro and her 
during updates a lot on the 

147
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:02,441
plate we can't do everything and
chosen to scope it more narrowly

148
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,292
that doesn't mean you can't take
our methodology take our 

149

150
00:21:10,817 --> 00:21:15,096
explaining why and what and how 
behind the path and awesome take

151
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:19,799
that and apply it to new domains
and Arctic speakers have done 

152
00:21:20,006 --> 00:21:22,043
that on the domain of 
misinformation this is a huge 

153
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:25,286
topic on our minds election 
coming up in the United States 

154
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:30,804
and we were pleased to have this
talk kicking off our day to and 

155
00:21:31,017 --> 00:21:36,706
Sarah and John will talk about 
how they took attack methodology

156
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,920
and applied it to this 
information lease join me in 

157
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:43,494
welcoming Sarah Jane Turk and 
John Gray.  [ Applause ]

We took your baby and did things
to it and there is now three 

160
00:22:00,393 --> 00:22:03,969
layers of [ Indiscernible] [

162
00:22:12,239 --> 00:22:15,441
>> Background I'm sure all of 
you know what the coalition is 

163
00:22:15,652 --> 00:22:24,407
so we are research community 
startup 2017 info con event and 

164
00:22:25,004 --> 00:22:31,158
researchers ultimately people 
got together that care about 

165
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,607
quality and credibility of 
online information and believe 

166
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:40,907
it's pretty important to have 
simple society.  So ultimately 

167
00:22:41,658 --> 00:22:46,352
it's really both trading 
standards and again credibility 

168
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:51,423
and fortunate the credibility 
coalition has incubated this 

169
00:22:51,627 --> 00:22:56,937
project --
>> [ Indiscernible] 

170
00:22:56,939 --> 00:23:04,714
>> Knock on doors and move her 
way through them and there are 

171
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,925
six different working groups 
which we are one

172
00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:12,077
currently supported by the 
credibility coalition as well 

173
00:23:12,078 --> 00:23:14,951
part of our project I think we 
got a give little shout out to 

174
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:17,296
the New York foundation for 
funding that helped us move this

175
00:23:17,503 --> 00:23:20,993
thing along and in terms of 
people involved we have to 

176
00:23:21,205 --> 00:23:25,588
acknowledge some folks that 
supported us as much as last 

177
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:29,744
year myself and having a blend 
of people from academic 

178
00:23:29,952 --> 00:23:34,193
government others and a few of 
us from other house the 

179
00:23:34,406 --> 00:23:40,440
companies we also run and [ 
Indiscernible] overall our big 

180
00:23:40,648 --> 00:23:44,178
challenge in terms of how we 
approach this is thinking 

181
00:23:44,911 --> 00:23:49,494
through it creating a framework 
and working to understand this 

182
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:53,320
notion of how communities are 
organizing a tax being 

183
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:57,381
information-based attacks this 
information misinformation 

184
00:23:57,587 --> 00:23:59,587
Network propaganda and

185
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,691
a big part of this was exercise 
rigor and try to classify a 

186
00:24:05,907 --> 00:24:08,156
number of these issues. 
>>  [ Indiscernible] [ 

187
00:24:08,366 --> 00:24:13,416
Indiscernible - Participant too 
far from mic ] this is not --

188
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:26,843
started way back 2016 or 17 
talking about Fake News people 

189
00:24:27,607 --> 00:24:35,513
typing things putting those out 
it's not that.  The [ 

190
00:24:35,718 --> 00:24:39,384
Indiscernible] disinformation 
looking at specifically

191
00:24:44,712 --> 00:24:53,388
we are looking at the content 
map -- MIP and video

192
00:24:55,883 --> 00:24:57,883
comes under the umbrella

193
00:25:02,788 --> 00:25:10,517
it may be in attribution may be 
in groups and maybe botnet is 

194
00:25:10,722 --> 00:25:18,841
coming to that and also the way 
the types of account set up is 

195
00:25:19,597 --> 00:25:25,738
changing from really clearing 
easy to find bots and botnet on 

196
00:25:25,952 --> 00:25:30,977
all the time and connect for the
hashtag and starting to go

197
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,130
get across communities

198
00:25:43,015 --> 00:25:50,051
>> The problems we talked about 
yesterday techniques adversaries

199
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,513
we try to look at this through 
the lens of asking questions 

200
00:26:00,721 --> 00:26:06,506
social cognitive factors through
key actions tactics strategies 

201
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:11,278
involved and I will spring 
through how we are and how we 

202
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:16,993
got here mainly because SJ and 
some other folks have done a lot

203
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:23,987
of works and see how we built it
and looking at the time her.  So

204
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,936
we do have a few objectives and 
one of the things we are working

205
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:37,859
for and how we are describing 
the techniques and tactics we 

206
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,665
and moving forward where we are 
at is

207
00:26:45,576 --> 00:26:47,576
essentially of gone through this
red team exercise and now 

208
00:26:47,811 --> 00:26:52,096
working towards the blue team 
side of things looking to the 

209
00:26:52,305 --> 00:26:55,195
techniques we identified in what
are going to be some counters 

210
00:26:55,879 --> 00:27:03,250
and that's on the agenda.  
Really quickly is SJ noted 

211
00:27:03,651 --> 00:27:08,337
personal some others in space 
for some time now feel like a 

212
00:27:09,081 --> 00:27:12,440
latecomer but sort of a timeline
about working group

213
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:23,107
and time pulled in that just a 
timeline the work we've done and

214
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:27,422
really what it boiled down to 
for us is we have this been a 

215
00:27:27,626 --> 00:27:31,124
lot of admiration about the 
problem but not enough action 

216
00:27:31,327 --> 00:27:37,172
being taken and we don't think 
in essence the erosion the 

217
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:40,878
attack on democracy which we 
think about the problem through 

218
00:27:41,084 --> 00:27:43,614
the lens of actors in the 
processes and we don't think 

219
00:27:43,827 --> 00:27:47,601
democracy based on 27 years to 
wait for framework to wait for 

220
00:27:48,129 --> 00:27:54,793
proper process and we endeavor 
to do so borrowing from her 

221
00:27:55,001 --> 00:28:00,010
startup and sat down a group of 
us worked hard to try to get 

222
00:28:00,254 --> 00:28:03,884
stuff done and we deliver 
numerous papers and done 

223
00:28:04,536 --> 00:28:10,638
numerous talks and share stories
for ZIP Codes and license plate

224
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:22,209
this is our timeline.  And a 
couple weeks we will do our 

225
00:28:22,418 --> 00:28:25,244
Workshop and continue to refine 
things as we move through and 

226
00:28:25,849 --> 00:28:29,987
all fairness a lot of this has 
been done as a volunteer project

227
00:28:30,196 --> 00:28:34,447
a lot of our teammates people 
been behind it and doing this 

228
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:42,413
while having jobs and doing 
out-of-pocket doing it because 

229
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:48,688
they care and the first six 
months ultimately we open 

230
00:28:48,891 --> 00:28:52,884
sourced out and documented what 
we identified as 63 different 

231
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:55,090
campaigns

232
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,684
and will talk about developing 
sticks format and really the 

233
00:29:02,888 --> 00:29:07,352
first six months has been 
grading salvation and August we 

234
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:14,074
to GitHub and we have this 
moving forward and ill be in 

235
00:29:14,314 --> 00:29:18,959
evolution I think about what I 
heard yesterday a lot of you 

236
00:29:19,281 --> 00:29:22,177
have been in the space for a 
long time and have a real head 

237
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:27,311
start look at what we call info 
set the intersection of 

238
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:32,133
misinformation in information 
security and let's say we've got

239
00:29:32,344 --> 00:29:35,336
to move quickly and got to keep 
evolving and also see this 

240
00:29:35,581 --> 00:29:42,897
definitely a function community.
To move through the next slide, 

241
00:29:43,312 --> 00:29:45,312
a big part of this

242
00:29:48,796 --> 00:29:50,593
impressed hearing this yesterday
obviously issue having common 

243
00:29:50,594 --> 00:29:53,062
language across communities 
thinking through better 

244
00:29:54,019 --> 00:29:58,333
defending treating creating 
better tools and ultimately 

245
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:03,573
looking at this through the lens
of a problem happening in scale.

246
00:30:06,468 --> 00:30:11,428
SJ noted the machine learning 
and AI issues will continue to 

247
00:30:11,634 --> 00:30:17,242
drive this problem I hate to say
it on bullish on the career 

248
00:30:17,453 --> 00:30:25,557
sadly to say and we've taken 
multidisciplinary approach to 

249
00:30:25,768 --> 00:30:28,378
things that we had to look at it
through a number of different 

250
00:30:28,592 --> 00:30:30,592
points of view in terms of 
misinformation community 

251
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,712
information security information
operation and recognizing a name

252
00:30:35,457 --> 00:30:39,545
or two information security 
folks looking at it through the 

253
00:30:39,748 --> 00:30:44,246
lens of conflict and then again 
I think arguably this happened 

254
00:30:45,003 --> 00:30:49,864
well before the online space 
before 2016 but obviously since 

255
00:30:50,066 --> 00:30:55,153
2016 events of 2016 being looked
at the social problem and one is

256
00:30:56,169 --> 00:31:03,345
information space full of 
pollution and ultimately a lot 

257
00:31:03,547 --> 00:31:06,337
is going to scale SJ will take 
it away.

258
00:31:06,545 --> 00:31:13,694
>>  We got a problem.  We've got
less coordinated misinformation 

259
00:31:14,108 --> 00:31:19,806
it looks very similar to earlier
attacks I said at the beginning 

260
00:31:20,015 --> 00:31:23,576
of last year we are pretty much 
at the next stage of development

261
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:28,319
of this and that point of view I
think we've gone past and 

262
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:34,180
heading over to virus checkers 
but we don't have time to create

263
00:31:34,823 --> 00:31:44,773
an entire new response field -- 
we've got a large-scale problem 

264
00:31:45,725 --> 00:31:53,742
it is level system response we 
need to do it at speed and scale

265
00:31:54,053 --> 00:31:56,053
and endpoints human beings human
communities who have all sorts 

266
00:31:56,152 --> 00:31:58,152
of things like

267
00:32:00,614 --> 00:32:02,848
we have about 200 all individual
vulnerabilities each of which we

268
00:32:03,061 --> 00:32:09,709
can it in different ways so we 
got them many scales.  So

269
00:32:13,215 --> 00:32:15,635
we are looking at the system and
didn't have the framework you 

270
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:24,186
need to go we need -- we needed 
to combine and we created an 

271
00:32:24,395 --> 00:32:29,841
info set working group and we 
found everybody we could was 

272
00:32:30,421 --> 00:32:36,141
working on info sack in one 
place talking to each other 

273
00:32:36,735 --> 00:32:44,033
Internet organization part of 
that as well looking at how we 

274
00:32:44,244 --> 00:32:46,244
can human communities

275
00:32:56,277 --> 00:32:58,458
you probably haven't heard of it
yet and

276
00:33:06,576 --> 00:33:13,129
and need some messaging format 
but we need to connect different

277
00:33:13,348 --> 00:33:18,210
groups in some way and get 
talking the same language so one

278
00:33:18,418 --> 00:33:23,918
of the problems we have or had 
when we started looking at how 

279
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:26,264
we connect together what we 
needed to put together was we 

280
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:34,263
had no threats and big list of 
-- built then we realized we 

281
00:33:34,474 --> 00:33:39,285
were looking at different views 
and had attacker view and the

282
00:33:43,551 --> 00:33:47,877
space and what they see 
eventually looking at talked 

283
00:33:48,636 --> 00:33:55,944
about and trying to work out 
what an attack as a time-limited

284
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:00,699
thing and we discovered there 
was different places and for 

285
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:07,912
since 2016 election, [ 
Indiscernible] two years long 

286
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:11,573
different to something like

287
00:34:15,295 --> 00:34:21,116
a favorite example so decided [ 
Indiscernible - Poor Audio ]

288
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:32,960
as human beings base themselves 
on stories narratives and 

289
00:34:33,913 --> 00:34:41,831
belonging on base sense of in 
groups are groups who we are now

290
00:34:42,661 --> 00:34:44,661
--

291
00:34:46,364 --> 00:34:49,146
what is happening now a 
narrative tracking and look at 

292
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:56,543
and on the Internet tracking 
through this and I spent a lot 

293
00:34:57,289 --> 00:35:05,870
of time -- use the artifacts 
messages and use the users [ 

294
00:35:06,073 --> 00:35:08,073
Indiscernible] [ Indiscernible -
Poor Audio ]

295
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,926
a bunch of stuff at the bottom 
you have to work your way back 

296
00:35:17,136 --> 00:35:24,962
is it a incident campaign this 
is one of the important -- track

297
00:35:25,172 --> 00:35:29,850
at the level fight it narrative 
level the basically get stuff at

298
00:35:30,054 --> 00:35:33,632
the artifact level if we are 
lucky get intelligence 

299
00:35:33,842 --> 00:35:37,914
information information at the 
campaign level so stuff we built

300
00:35:38,117 --> 00:35:40,117
an

301
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:50,354
-- looked at models for 
marketing marketing models 

302
00:35:50,757 --> 00:35:54,770
really useful for things like 
extremism and

303
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:00,979
turns out a sales conversion 
model is exactly what you need 

304
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,960
when you're looking at how to do
extremist conversion and we 

305
00:36:04,723 --> 00:36:10,006
looked at models information 
security models operations 

306
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:19,963
models so run campaigns can we 
use these two --

307
00:36:25,691 --> 00:36:33,006
Justice Department had a lovely 
one -- and looked at information

308
00:36:33,217 --> 00:36:43,176
security models and looked at 
cyclic models and adored the -- 

309
00:36:43,573 --> 00:36:49,460
attack a love the idea of having
the stages and breakdown -- 

310
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,738
that's what we needed.  You 
actually have what we needed.  

311
00:36:53,939 --> 00:37:00,678
And we tried really really hard 
to get this information to the 

312
00:37:00,887 --> 00:37:03,492
attack framework as it existed 
could not make it work and so we

313
00:37:03,699 --> 00:37:07,570
tried we really tried and we 
think actually ultimately we'll 

314
00:37:07,773 --> 00:37:13,436
end up with branches doing our 
thing your thing and of doing 

315
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:19,481
hierarchical things and -- for 
the moment we are different so 

316
00:37:19,686 --> 00:37:21,686
we --

317
00:37:25,419 --> 00:37:30,502
we didn't have these catalogs 
and there were pieces of 

318
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:36,797
catalogs over the world and have
one nobody had a standard for 

319
00:37:37,003 --> 00:37:39,003
and we built a standard

320
00:37:43,288 --> 00:37:45,288
we put in extensions and

321
00:37:49,536 --> 00:37:51,536
and

322
00:38:06,045 --> 00:38:08,045
this is one of them

323
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:20,126

have a lot of luck anyway in

>> There was no fire, we've been
seeing these 

336
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:44,486
since 2010. Kate at the 
University of Washington has 

337
00:39:44,487 --> 00:39:46,487
been 

338
00:39:49,169 --> 00:39:52,821
tracking those. We started 
looking at techniques. This is 

339
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:55,023
one of 

340
00:39:57,491 --> 00:40:02,160
the techniques. We brought all 
this together to head forward 

341
00:40:02,373 --> 00:40:05,412
because of time. We built this. 
This is 

342
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,148
our baby. It's not as big as a 
text because he bolted off 22 

343
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,416
different incidences. There were

344
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:26,534
all in there were an awful lot 
of post-its on the wall. He 

345
00:40:26,749 --> 00:40:29,180
pulled out tactics and 
techniques from 20 incidences, 

346
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:32,018
we posted it, we 

347
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:37,301
grouped them, we went through 
stages. Then we looked at all 

348
00:40:37,516 --> 00:40:40,153
the other that existed including
attack. We went and said to 

349
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:47,865
these things. This one may help 
more, these are the stages we 

350
00:40:48,065 --> 00:40:54,168
have. The big purple and red, 
those are phases. While we were 

351
00:40:54,369 --> 00:41:01,688
looking, we realized there are 
other pieces, models we could 

352
00:41:01,888 --> 00:41:05,942
include. The planning stages 
came from psi ops. The 

353
00:41:06,143 --> 00:41:08,143
evaluation 

354
00:41:10,623 --> 00:41:12,623
came from 

355
00:41:15,834 --> 00:41:18,546
advertising miles. If you have 
an incident that part of the 

356
00:41:18,747 --> 00:41:20,982
campaign, you will run it but 
you also check what works to 

357
00:41:21,182 --> 00:41:25,850
feed into the next incident. 
This is not pretty but near the 

358
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:31,949
blue line. The tactics, the 
techniques, I will give you the 

359
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,150
address at 

360
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:39,362
the end.

361
00:41:49,618 --> 00:41:52,467
I suspect some of you will 
probably go back and think we 

362
00:41:52,669 --> 00:41:55,507
can do this too. That will 

363
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:04,846
be awesome. This is where we are
at the moment. We've already had

364
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,509
people starting to use this, 
starting to pick out techniques,

365
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,710
starting to share 

366
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:16,599
techniques used. The next thing 
we 

367
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:20,487
started doing is the next part 
of this. 

368
00:42:20,488 --> 00:42:22,488
>> We did the mapping 

369
00:42:25,371 --> 00:42:27,371
between misinformation and 
AMITT.  

370
00:42:30,444 --> 00:42:32,444
We got almost a one-to-one 
between the two. We can 

371
00:42:35,326 --> 00:42:38,778
carry misinformation as long as 
we put the incidents into sets 

372
00:42:42,233 --> 00:42:47,103
of narratives. The diagram I 
have put up, it would be nicer 

373
00:42:47,303 --> 00:42:50,551
to have two separate objects 
instead 

374
00:42:55,553 --> 00:43:00,705
of narrative. It works, it's 
beautiful. We can match that and

375
00:43:04,372 --> 00:43:10,259
also means we can match the data
science to the work and we can 

376
00:43:10,459 --> 00:43:12,459
talk to 

377
00:43:15,661 --> 00:43:21,632
each other. We can do this, we 
can talk about threat actors, 

378
00:43:21,832 --> 00:43:23,832
finally, we can 

379
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:29,551
do this. We can start doing the 
science. It just 

380
00:43:34,551 --> 00:43:38,899
becomes cleaner. At the moment 
there are email reports going 

381
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,100
out 

382
00:43:42,754 --> 00:43:44,754
on misinformation. Now we can 
start doing the 

383
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,292
real-time fees. 
>> This is where we are going 

384
00:43:51,492 --> 00:43:53,727
next. We have a blue team 
workshop coming up. Just as you 

385
00:43:53,927 --> 00:43:57,581
were picking off all those 
techniques, one by one we are 

386
00:43:57,797 --> 00:43:59,797
doing one by one technique 
counters, 

387
00:44:03,482 --> 00:44:06,734
tactic level, process procedure 
and anything that's interesting 

388
00:44:06,934 --> 00:44:13,838
or weird on top of that. Would 
like AMITT or some form to be  

389
00:44:14,038 --> 00:44:18,306
in the misinformation response 
centers. We've been talking not 

390
00:44:18,507 --> 00:44:21,359
just in this country but to 
other bodies as well. We would 

391
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:27,243
like to start testing. We have 
been so busy wrapped up interest

392
00:44:27,444 --> 00:44:29,444
trying to get a 

393
00:44:33,065 --> 00:44:35,065
standard going.

394
00:44:40,649 --> 00:44:42,649
Find the response populations, 
and the people who can 

395
00:44:47,148 --> 00:44:50,398
use this. It's one of the group 
sites has a page in their, 

396
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:58,064
there's a get help the repo.

398
00:45:10,511 --> 00:45:13,148
I talked a little faster than I 
thought so you got loads of time

399
00:45:14,768 --> 00:45:16,768
for questions. 
>>> Questions for 

400

our presenters?

401
00:45:25,941 --> 00:45:33,055
I forgot to think I forgot to 
thank Roger. You have been doing

402
00:45:33,256 --> 00:45:35,256
great work 

403
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,953
for us. 
>> I think it's great you're 

404
00:45:39,154 --> 00:45:44,054
using lessons learned and apply 
towards this important problem. 

405
00:45:44,254 --> 00:45:46,290
One of the lessons learned 

406
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:53,292
early on

407
00:45:55,025 --> 00:45:57,025
was on the paper call 

408
00:46:00,846 --> 00:46:03,558
trusting trust. Using web 
security as 

409
00:46:06,605 --> 00:46:08,605
an example, 

410
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:13,819
we found

411
00:46:15,946 --> 00:46:17,979
we came up with the certificate 
transparency. What you think are

412
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:20,616
the equivalents of establishing 
trust and things like 

413
00:46:20,818 --> 00:46:22,818
certificate transparency for 

414
00:46:24,887 --> 00:46:26,706
this problem? 
>> That would be the other half 

415
00:46:26,707 --> 00:46:32,194
of my life. I work on the global
disinformation indexed. I'm 

416
00:46:32,396 --> 00:46:34,396
working on trust certification 

417
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:40,496
for pages. 

418
00:46:43,706 --> 00:46:47,836
Some discussion, I don't notice 
much difference if we can pull 

419
00:46:48,047 --> 00:46:50,047
this into 

420
00:46:51,701 --> 00:46:54,949
the community. And we use the 
things that already exists. 

421
00:46:54,950 --> 00:47:00,221
>> We have an interesting trust 
problem. What we work on is all 

422
00:47:00,437 --> 00:47:06,323
about humans and hacking, it's 
social engineering at scale. 

423
00:47:06,524 --> 00:47:09,574
That makes life more 
interesting. I don't think it's 

424
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:16,582
that different.

425
00:47:27,443 --> 00:47:29,878
>> One thing that hit my mind as
you were talking, stunning work 

426
00:47:30,093 --> 00:47:35,980
first of all, I talked used 
yesterday but this blew me away.

427
00:47:36,181 --> 00:47:41,867
One thing I want to ask, have 
you looked at creating something

428
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:47,353
similar to a system. Last year, 
at the elastic con 

429
00:47:50,604 --> 00:47:54,658
in LA, a company showed how they
were utilizing elastic to 

430
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:56,873
conduct an 

431
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:03,197
influencer company. Where they 
were basically, the slogan was 

432
00:48:03,398 --> 00:48:05,834
is there is an influencer for 
that. I can imagine you look at 

433
00:48:06,035 --> 00:48:09,084
influencers. 
>> Oh yeah. I'm 

434
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:16,604
also volunteering. I think that 
may be the next step of adopting

435
00:48:16,804 --> 00:48:18,804
the info Secretary 

436
00:48:21,476 --> 00:48:23,710
model , going into having an 
analytical tool that can start 

437
00:48:23,911 --> 00:48:25,911
aggregating, playing with 

438
00:48:27,577 --> 00:48:29,597
your data. I was wondering if 
you would be interested in 

439
00:48:29,812 --> 00:48:32,647
something like that? 
>> Please. Please. We also need 

440
00:48:32,849 --> 00:48:34,849
an aggregator connector 

441

Emily Fry, we want to make sure 
we are connected to you. We lead

450
00:49:17,333 --> 00:49:19,333
the election integrity 

451
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:25,836
initiative here. We've done a 
great deal of work that 

452
00:49:25,869 --> 00:49:30,340
logically should be connected to
your intellectual capital and we

453
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,540
would love to talk 

454
00:49:36,164 --> 00:49:38,164
to you.

455
00:49:47,128 --> 00:49:49,128
>>

456
00:49:55,722 --> 00:49:57,353
>> Thanks so much for 
presenting. It's fascinating 

457
00:49:57,354 --> 00:49:59,354
work. My question to you, 

458
00:50:03,242 --> 00:50:05,073
not everyone works fighting 
nationstates for their day job. 

459
00:50:05,074 --> 00:50:07,074
A lot of this 

460
00:50:08,727 --> 00:50:10,727
is regular operations within 
companies. How can we 

461
00:50:14,827 --> 00:50:16,827
contribute information 

462
00:50:19,898 --> 00:50:22,132
through something, what sort of 
information and channels are 

463
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:27,217
available to contribute back. 
>> We are working on that with 

464
00:50:27,417 --> 00:50:29,417
the 

465
00:50:32,428 --> 00:50:34,924
ISACs.  This isn't just a 
nationstate problem, we have 

466
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,557
party sentencing misinformation 
text against organizations let's

467
00:50:36,558 --> 00:50:38,558
hitting 

468
00:50:40,009 --> 00:50:42,009
for you and fast. It will become
your problem 

469
00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:53,418
very soon. 
>> We currently live in a world 

470
00:50:53,619 --> 00:50:55,651
where there's lots of news 
outlets in the narrative is very

471
00:50:55,851 --> 00:50:59,921
difficult to control. We are 
coming from a world where there 

472
00:51:00,122 --> 00:51:02,555
are very few in the narrative 
was very easy to control. How is

473
00:51:04,174 --> 00:51:08,240
this worse. 
>> We have a whole talk on that 

474
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:12,509
as well. It's completely 
different because the channel is

475
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:19,519
completely different. The 
Westphalian contract is 

476
00:51:21,243 --> 00:51:24,093
completely broken. Principle 
interference between nations is 

477
00:51:24,293 --> 00:51:28,559
broken, individuals can outdo 
that level of inter-Terrence. We

478
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,395
are in a new world. We have a 
whole bunch of new worlds and 

479
00:51:31,609 --> 00:51:36,276
new rules to start building. 
>> When you think about the an 

480
00:51:36,477 --> 00:51:41,759
amount of anonymity, one thing I
look at is replication of a 

481
00:51:41,961 --> 00:51:43,961
certain state 

482
00:51:45,212 --> 00:51:47,043
broadcasters contents that gets 
no attribution, that gets spun 

483
00:51:47,044 --> 00:51:49,679
out on imposter sites. There's 

484
00:51:53,547 --> 00:51:55,367
semi-different issues, the 
supply side of this thing is 

485
00:51:55,368 --> 00:51:57,368
dramatically 

486
00:51:58,419 --> 00:52:00,037
changed. 
>> The two people who track on 

487
00:52:00,038 --> 00:52:02,038
this, Pablo Brewer has done a 
lot 

488
00:52:06,479 --> 00:52:08,479
of work.

489
00:52:15,821 --> 00:52:18,317
>> I have an offer. This is 
interesting a great work. I know

490
00:52:18,518 --> 00:52:22,997
couple people who know something
about STIX,  if you need help 

491
00:52:23,198 --> 00:52:25,634
from the STIX community, is like
you're doing a lot of great work

492
00:52:25,835 --> 00:52:27,835
. We would love to see some 
enhancement proposals around 

493
00:52:29,087 --> 00:52:31,087
this work to get it 

494
00:52:34,911 --> 00:52:36,911
operationalized. 
>>

495
00:52:57,725 --> 00:53:00,362
>> This is more of a thank you 
for the work you are doing. 

496
00:53:00,575 --> 00:53:04,027
Speaking on behalf of the team, 
we wish we could do more to 

497
00:53:09,035 --> 00:53:11,035
help you.

498
00:53:15,801 --> 00:53:22,045
>> On that note, please join me 
in thanking our speakers. [ 

499
00:53:26,913 --> 00:53:30,433
Applause ] 
>> What a great talk to kick off

500
00:53:30,634 --> 00:53:32,634
the morning. I heard some names 
that even 

501
00:53:35,105 --> 00:53:36,522
across different domains and 
industries we have 

502
00:53:36,523 --> 00:53:38,354
commonalities. I love the 
metaphor that they've gone 

503
00:53:38,355 --> 00:53:45,659
beyond cuckoo's egg and how info
Secretary  can have overlap on 

504
00:53:45,873 --> 00:53:51,762
domains and research. One thing 
John said, there's a lot of 

505
00:53:51,963 --> 00:53:54,598
admiration but not enough 
action. That is also 

506
00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:01,305
a commonality. One thing that's 
exciting about us here, we will 

507
00:54:01,506 --> 00:54:03,506
leave and take action on what we

508
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:09,427
have learned. I want to give a 
call out, we have folks joining 

509
00:54:09,628 --> 00:54:12,879
us online, Barry Anderson said 
it's night, he is in Australia, 

510
00:54:13,094 --> 00:54:16,333
Mumbai confirmed they have 
checked in on Twitter and 

511
00:54:19,786 --> 00:54:21,819
another Australian, good day 

512
00:54:26,831 --> 00:54:30,958
from Australia. It's always 
exciting to see. Moving on to 

513
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:35,641
our next speaker, we talk about 
diversity, it's not just race or

514
00:54:35,842 --> 00:54:37,876
gender or socioeconomic status 
it's also diversity of 

515
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:40,710
backgrounds. We were so excited 
when they got this next 

516
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:43,346
submission for more of an 
academic perspective. Chris is a

517
00:54:43,561 --> 00:54:47,214
CTA lead with a government 
agency in the Netherlands. 

518
00:54:47,415 --> 00:54:52,083
This'll talk about how he 
brought his academic perspective

519
00:54:52,284 --> 00:54:54,284
and applied it to the practice 
of understanding 

520
00:54:57,369 --> 00:54:59,403
malware behavior. One thing that
caught our eye was looking at 

521
00:54:59,604 --> 00:55:06,712
950, over 950 unique families as
part of this project, a review 

522
00:55:06,913 --> 00:55:08,913
of over 15 years of 

523
00:55:11,797 --> 00:55:13,838
malware evolution. Kind of a 
massive sample. Not easy to get 

524
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:18,296
that many much less do research 
on all of them. Very excited for

525
00:55:18,497 --> 00:55:23,981
this talk. Please join me in 
welcoming our speaker. 

526
00:55:23,982 --> 00:55:25,982
>> [ 

527
00:55:27,433 --> 00:55:30,886
Applause ] Basically, I 
investigate 

528
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,574
Windows malware and planted the 
results and this gives you a 

529
00:55:36,775 --> 00:55:38,775
very good impression of how 

530
00:55:41,045 --> 00:55:43,045
to prioritize in your 

531
00:55:46,659 --> 00:55:50,787
mitigation. 
>> I did all of this is part of 

532
00:55:50,988 --> 00:55:59,321
a cyber threat lab. In daily 
life I'm an analyst on 

533
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:02,172
intelligence which is the 
largest public-sector provider 

534
00:56:05,209 --> 00:56:07,209
of credible 

535
00:56:10,411 --> 00:56:12,411
critical infrastructure.

536
00:56:21,466 --> 00:56:23,901
A quick index, before going the 
results I would like to give you

537
00:56:24,102 --> 00:56:25,935
some background on the 
organization I am working for. 

538
00:56:25,936 --> 00:56:27,936
This is heavily affected how 
this research came about. The 

539
00:56:27,957 --> 00:56:32,426
Dutch have been living below sea
level for hundreds of years. 

540
00:56:32,628 --> 00:56:37,710
Most, Amsterdam is four meters 
below sea level, some parts are 

541
00:56:38,525 --> 00:56:40,558
even six. As you can imagine the
risk is 

542
00:56:45,566 --> 00:56:47,566
immensely high.

543
00:56:50,098 --> 00:56:52,098
With an overflow, I don't mean 

544
00:56:55,384 --> 00:56:58,636
a buffer. As a form of risk 
mitigation, we have built the 

545
00:57:01,474 --> 00:57:04,524
Delta works. We have decreased 
the risk of a 

546
00:57:09,028 --> 00:57:11,263
flood striking. You may ask why 
am I telling this? Because if 

547
00:57:15,735 --> 00:57:17,967
you work in an organization like
this on a daily basis, this 

548
00:57:18,167 --> 00:57:20,400
affects how you look at cyber 
defense. These Delta works, 

549
00:57:21,619 --> 00:57:27,505
basically, it's a physical form 
of perimeter defense. As we 

550
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:29,719
would like to 

551
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:33,159
call it, a physical kill 

552
00:57:35,438 --> 00:57:37,438
chain against 

553
00:57:40,647 --> 00:57:50,058
a threat. This is the Lockheed 
Martin cyber kill chain. When 

554
00:57:52,493 --> 00:57:55,540
I start, I saw this model is 
gaining a lot of traction and a 

555
00:57:55,742 --> 00:57:57,742
lot of attention within 
academia. 

556
00:58:01,448 --> 00:58:03,680
In contrast, the framework Ft. I
didn't see that much coverage, 

557
00:58:03,881 --> 00:58:09,769
I'm not going to compare this to
the technical area today. I 

558
00:58:09,983 --> 00:58:15,469
decided to give the academic 
attention it deserves or at 

559
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:17,670
least make a 

560
00:58:19,521 --> 00:58:22,169
decent start. Unfortunately, you
cannot just go about writing a 

561
00:58:22,972 --> 00:58:24,972
paper saying adopt this belief, 

562
00:58:29,073 --> 00:58:31,073
it's great. You should do 
something with it. Long story 

563
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:40,647
short, I studied, analyzed the 
Windows malware and indicated 

564
00:58:40,847 --> 00:58:44,916
results in a research paper, 
using the uniform language 

565
00:58:45,117 --> 00:58:49,383
offered by the framer. 
>> Our methodology, we got our 

566
00:58:51,216 --> 00:58:54,265
data sample which is 

567
00:58:59,281 --> 00:59:01,281
repository meant for the 
institute. This is a curated 

568
00:59:01,373 --> 00:59:06,645
data set which means it provides
several quality assurances over 

569
00:59:06,858 --> 00:59:08,858
randomly picking 

570
00:59:10,715 --> 00:59:13,964
your samples. It is label data 
set which means it provides 

571
00:59:14,165 --> 00:59:16,165
metadata from 

572
00:59:19,367 --> 00:59:21,367
our families.

573
00:59:25,134 --> 00:59:30,207
Offers for most Mauer families 
are offered multiple samples. We

574
00:59:30,422 --> 00:59:36,308
ran the samples offered by this 
repository to select the most 

575
00:59:36,509 --> 00:59:38,509
recent for each. Then we ran 

576
00:59:41,381 --> 00:59:43,415
that sample through a sandbox 
those offered to us 

577
00:59:48,285 --> 00:59:50,285
by security. They have an online
sample for automated malware 

578
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:53,166
analysis which can be regarded 
quite repetitive for most of the

579
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,177
current market

580
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:10,028
. We also developed manual 
plotting of all the activity on 

581
01:00:10,229 --> 01:00:18,149
the attack framework. If you do 
all of that, you will get this. 

582
01:00:20,384 --> 01:00:24,848
This is the matrix of the 
framework as it was before the 

583
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:32,776
April update. Timelines in 
academia are quite long. I know 

584
01:00:32,977 --> 01:00:37,045
most of this will be difficult 
to read for most of you. This is

585
01:00:37,246 --> 01:00:42,117
available in the published paper
available for download and also 

586
01:00:42,318 --> 01:00:44,318
available as a separate 

587
01:00:46,785 --> 01:00:48,785
file. 
>> What I will do now, I will 

588
01:00:49,232 --> 01:00:52,884
quickly go to the most relevant 
results of the paper. There is 

589
01:00:53,085 --> 01:00:56,949
more in the full paper but this 
might give you a good impression

590
01:00:57,150 --> 01:01:03,452
of the direction in which 
certain techniques are heading. 

591
01:01:03,652 --> 01:01:05,652
This may inform 

592
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:12,174
your mitigation. With the slide 
format, the down arrow indicates

593
01:01:12,389 --> 01:01:14,623
a decrease in use of the 
technique in the 

594
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:20,274
data set covered by the 

595
01:01:23,759 --> 01:01:27,210
time frame. In the green apparel
is the opposite. 

596
01:01:27,211 --> 01:01:31,890
>> The techniques used, the most
observed technique in our data 

597
01:01:32,494 --> 01:01:34,494
set 

598
01:01:37,495 --> 01:01:39,495
was execution.

599
01:01:44,281 --> 01:01:46,299
While this is the most observed 
technique, it is also decreasing

600
01:01:46,515 --> 01:01:49,350
of time which means it is 
getting replaced by other 

601
01:01:49,552 --> 01:01:51,552
techniques used in the 

602
01:01:55,175 --> 01:01:57,175
execution tactic.

603
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:06,412
One of the other techniques 
gaining traction is the factor 

604
01:02:06,612 --> 01:02:09,061
that shouldn't be surprising to 
you of course. What we 

605
01:02:14,074 --> 01:02:18,608
found interesting ever see the 
first coverage around 2017 and 

606
01:02:18,808 --> 01:02:22,460
this is also the first year 
which is also observed in the 

607
01:02:22,661 --> 01:02:24,661
data 

608
01:02:27,662 --> 01:02:29,365
set. 
>> There are basically five 

609
01:02:29,366 --> 01:02:34,047
techniques released out here 
with significant increase for 

610
01:02:34,247 --> 01:02:36,247
sideloading 

611
01:02:38,717 --> 01:02:40,717
everything years. And then 
discovery. Discovery 

612
01:02:42,769 --> 01:02:44,769
is interesting. Most malware 
does some form of discovery 

613
01:02:47,652 --> 01:02:51,305
just like most benign 
applications. As you can see in 

614
01:02:51,506 --> 01:02:53,942
the registry technique. This is 

615
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:00,207
interesting because in daily 
practice this means it can be 

616
01:03:00,241 --> 01:03:05,323
pretty difficult to distinguish 
malicious discovery from benign.

617
01:03:05,524 --> 01:03:09,589
It relies mostly on native 
operating system functions. What

618
01:03:10,406 --> 01:03:12,839
we saw is a significant increase
in 

619
01:03:17,847 --> 01:03:23,403
malware using security software.
This includes looking for 

620
01:03:23,604 --> 01:03:28,473
viruses, looking for local rules
but also more advanced 

621
01:03:33,487 --> 01:03:38,024
and verticalization. This is 
some frame in which this could 

622
01:03:43,036 --> 01:03:47,983
be inferred. Command control is 
typically one of those 

623
01:03:48,183 --> 01:03:50,217
techniques that can be difficult

624
01:03:53,467 --> 01:03:59,551
to observe. This reflects in our
results. I would like to discuss

625
01:03:59,766 --> 01:04:04,431
today is specific implementation
which we saw applied 

626
01:04:07,482 --> 01:04:09,482
for control. Are you 

627
01:04:11,134 --> 01:04:13,134
still awake? You 

628
01:04:14,588 --> 01:04:18,643
probably say that the technique 
primarily being used in the 

629
01:04:18,857 --> 01:04:24,743
escalation and defense 
technique. If you look this up, 

630
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:27,591
you will see they refer to a 

631
01:04:32,264 --> 01:04:34,900
specific invitation mainly these
uptimes being used 

632
01:04:39,913 --> 01:04:41,913
for control.

633
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,838
We found this 

634
01:04:48,304 --> 01:04:50,304
is true. What we found is 

635
01:04:53,176 --> 01:04:57,240
this technique is applied by 
more sophisticated samples 

636
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,240
of malware

637
01:05:05,577 --> 01:05:07,577
. 

638
01:05:08,816 --> 01:05:12,482
After 2015, it is adopted by 
what you could call 

639
01:05:16,336 --> 01:05:19,183
commodity moat and quickly 
dropped the sophisticated 

640
01:05:22,637 --> 01:05:24,871
ones. 
>> You might ask how can you say

641
01:05:25,072 --> 01:05:32,178
this? Data sets are label data 
sets. It is attribution based on

642
01:05:33,194 --> 01:05:39,094
reporting so for most families 
they refer to five or six 

643
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:43,730
open-source reports. Based on 
that data we are able to 

644
01:05:45,384 --> 01:05:50,253
attribute malware that only to 
actors but also to categories of

645
01:05:50,468 --> 01:05:52,901
actors. Based on this, we are 
able to see this pattern. 

646
01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:00,419
There are several theories which
might explain this but for us it

647
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:03,669
was interesting as its proving 
the hypothesis that more taxis 

648
01:06:07,938 --> 01:06:09,938
are brought in the conflict 

649
01:06:11,792 --> 01:06:13,792
quickly 

650
01:06:16,801 --> 01:06:19,511
adopted. 
>> As we move towards the end, 

651
01:06:19,712 --> 01:06:23,779
this is what I would like to 
leave you with. And has already 

652
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,980
been set during 

653
01:06:27,432 --> 01:06:29,432
this conference that attack is 
great for 

654
01:06:32,515 --> 01:06:34,533
CTI. Undeniably. Is perhaps this
reason you see more and more 

655
01:06:34,751 --> 01:06:36,751
vendors in the 

656
01:06:38,599 --> 01:06:40,599
market 

657
01:06:41,649 --> 01:06:47,739
implementing automated matrices 
within the product like we did 

658
01:06:47,953 --> 01:06:52,006
manually. I would like to argue 
here today that tech is great 

659
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,840
but using it in this form does 
not make 

660
01:06:59,122 --> 01:07:05,421
it CDI. Was such an automated 
area may come across as a 

661
01:07:10,431 --> 01:07:12,926
trustworthy verdict of what this
is capable of, there are 

662
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:16,391
limitations and we call these 
biases. These tools can only see

663
01:07:16,791 --> 01:07:20,856
so much in their are biased 
towards that in the presentation

664
01:07:21,056 --> 01:07:23,692
of their results. This goes 

665
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:28,975
for anything in threat 
intelligence, results depend on 

666
01:07:28,976 --> 01:07:30,976
the capabilities of 

667
01:07:34,264 --> 01:07:36,264
the resource. You need to 
account for each of these 

668
01:07:40,149 --> 01:07:41,979
biases. Otherwise you will get 
mistreated further down the 

669
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,398
road. 
>> Very important. Look at what 

670
01:07:43,399 --> 01:07:50,515
something in tell you but above 
all, what they cannot tell you. 

671
01:07:50,716 --> 01:07:57,005
Basically, we figured automated 
analysis is great for CTI but 

672
01:07:57,218 --> 01:07:59,218
unsuited as a source for CTI 

673
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:05,342
by itself. Stay safe, stay 
critical and be aware of your 

674
01:08:06,357 --> 01:08:10,623
own biases, also the biases of 
your toolkit.

01:10:09,883 --> 01:10:12,181
is good. Good to see everyone 
here. I had the pleasure of 

695
01:10:12,396 --> 01:10:14,416
speaking last year and this year
everything has grown. Hats off 

696

to the TAC team.  I cannot 
believe what you get away with. 

697
01:10:18,887 --> 01:10:20,887
It 

698
01:10:23,898 --> 01:10:26,406
is amazing two point really 
means let's take risks and go 

699
01:10:26,607 --> 01:10:28,607
twice 

700
01:10:31,077 --> 01:10:34,931
as big let's really blow this up
because I represent the 

701
01:10:38,182 --> 01:10:40,182
salty guy that keynote speakers 
were 

702
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:46,105
talking about I am the guy who 
has been doing this a long time 

703
01:10:46,306 --> 01:10:50,978
with my head in the trenches. 
How I talk about that and be 

704
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:53,180
critical and you see the 
Dungeons 

705
01:10:55,446 --> 01:10:59,313
& Dragons reference. I will turn
it into a game. It is a crazy 

706
01:10:59,514 --> 01:11:02,965
idea but I think security needs 
crazy ideas. Don't be afraid of 

707
01:11:03,166 --> 01:11:06,015
trying something crazy 
sometimes. Quick disclaimer 

708
01:11:06,215 --> 01:11:08,215
before 

709
01:11:11,231 --> 01:11:13,231
I start.

710
01:11:17,385 --> 01:11:21,855
I think I am a level 8 security 
guy now. If I put on 

711
01:11:26,856 --> 01:11:31,813
the Cape -- hold on, do you not 
believe me? I have a medal for 

712
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:34,648
cyber security excellence. Now 
that my credibility is 

713
01:11:34,649 --> 01:11:38,716
established. [ Laughter ] , do 
not call me Bobo the 

714
01:11:42,371 --> 01:11:46,838
cyber clown so, what am I going 
to do? My perspective is a 

715
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:50,494
little bit different than your 
CTI folks.  I have been under 

716
01:11:55,509 --> 01:11:57,509
the surface

717
01:12:01,064 --> 01:12:03,299
and every once in a while I come
up and go everything 

718
01:12:08,311 --> 01:12:10,311
is changed.

719
01:12:13,044 --> 01:12:17,108
It makes for a socially awkward 
weirdo but Halloween is tomorrow

720
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:19,310
so I am allowed to 

721
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:24,180
do this. So, 

722
01:12:26,045 --> 01:12:28,481
who is security guy? He likes to
think he is James Bond Sean

free time in analog measures, it

727
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:49,605
is okay I have tools for that. I
can process analog and digital 

728
01:12:49,806 --> 01:12:54,272
and when I take my day off I 
will camp in my tiny house. You 

729
01:12:54,486 --> 01:12:58,753
can come to me there and asked 
questions. How to actually 

730
01:13:01,790 --> 01:13:03,790
see myself? I am Mr. 

731
01:13:06,673 --> 01:13:08,673
Bean sometimes, driving the car 
and disasters happening 

732
01:13:11,544 --> 01:13:17,030
around me. It is almost like 
fear maybe some people share 

733
01:13:17,231 --> 01:13:19,231
this. I get up on top of

about ATTACK, it gives  you 

737

something to start with for a 
guy like me to talk to, a person

01:15:19,102 --> 01:15:22,769
loads in chrome because 
apparently Firefox is a 

756
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:29,780
modern browser.

757
01:15:32,723 --> 01:15:35,157
Kudos to USENET. As I am waiting
for stock imagery to load this 

758
01:15:35,358 --> 01:15:39,625
is the tempest up I am doing. I 
am looking at the JavaScript in 

759
01:15:39,826 --> 01:15:42,060
the things I used to do I am 
looking and that stream 

760
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:49,060
looks like

761
01:15:52,426 --> 01:15:54,649
64 encoding or non-encoding or a
hash or a squirrel ADD mentality

762
01:15:54,863 --> 01:15:57,096
because when you fight fires for
15 years you get dropped into 

763
01:15:57,297 --> 01:15:59,297
different situations. It is 
almost instinct to do 

764
01:16:03,732 --> 01:16:08,878
this stuff. What am I going to 
do? You remember the old 

765
01:16:09,078 --> 01:16:11,513
screenshot capture fold folders?
That is me in VR. I do have some

766
01:16:11,714 --> 01:16:16,599
type of audience. If you see 
here and you can get what I'm 

767
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,139
talking about there are dozens 
of us. [ Laughter ] this came up

768
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:22,291
on a tweet. Language makes 

769
01:16:26,139 --> 01:16:28,139
us God's. I'm always worried 
about getting takeout of context

770
01:16:28,174 --> 01:16:34,463
when I do so I go to the point 
of markups and disclaimers but 

771
01:16:34,664 --> 01:16:36,664
sometimes you have 

772
01:16:38,129 --> 01:16:40,151
to speak your mind. But you have
the audience, it is 

773
01:16:45,165 --> 01:16:47,873
three point your mind. But you 
have the audience, it is 3.2 

774
01:16:48,074 --> 01:16:49,804
million subscribers to MITRE. 
Maybe they could hire [ 

775
01:16:49,806 --> 01:16:51,806
Indiscernible ]  so what is the 
point of 

776
01:16:56,133 --> 01:16:58,133
my talk?

777
01:17:10,427 --> 01:17:14,480
That is the type of thing that 
happens to you when you are 

778
01:17:17,328 --> 01:17:19,328
eight Celtic proclaimed 
technical fire fired. People 

779
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:25,555
make excuses.

780
01:17:28,902 --> 01:17:30,534
People talk about cognitive 
environment and you said 

781
01:17:30,535 --> 01:17:32,353
yourself is not muscle fault 
because things are complicated, 

782
01:17:32,354 --> 01:17:34,589
really what's the point? When 
you look and ask me about AMITT 

783
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,440
trend  MITRE ATTACK attack 
charts it is 

784
01:17:42,312 --> 01:17:44,949
not.  If you want to pay me 
money my motivation is going to 

785
01:17:45,150 --> 01:17:48,602
light up green. I'm going to do 
it even if I took myself into 

786
01:17:53,289 --> 01:17:55,718
doing it. I'm going to do it. 
Here I regularly Google stuff to

787
01:17:55,919 --> 01:17:57,919
see what it means to 

788
01:18:01,745 --> 01:18:06,073
regular people. So I googled 
cyber security 

789
01:18:11,087 --> 01:18:13,087
heat map

790
01:18:14,405 --> 01:18:18,473
. The bottom is a blog post from
2010 defending the risk matrix. 

791
01:18:18,673 --> 01:18:21,308
This is not a new conversation 
I'm having. It has 

792
01:18:24,558 --> 01:18:26,558
been forever. This is how people
think of algorithms. 

793
01:18:31,063 --> 01:18:33,298
I look up algorithm on stock 
photo which is awesome. This is 

794
01:18:33,498 --> 01:18:36,335
what comes up. People think 
about the matrix in that movie 

795
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:38,550
came out in 1999. I 

796
01:18:41,221 --> 01:18:44,871
think of algorithms completely 
differently than you might is my

797
01:18:45,073 --> 01:18:47,073
point. Tribe 

798
01:18:50,275 --> 01:18:52,275
role-playing is

799
01:18:55,845 --> 01:18:57,845
character. Rolling dice critical
strike I hit you with this 

800
01:18:57,879 --> 01:18:59,879
technique what is that mean to 
you? Communicate with people. 

801
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:02,133
Don't be afraid to write a 
unicorn and stop to talk about 

802
01:19:07,134 --> 01:19:09,653
stupid things. What changed in 

803
01:19:14,664 --> 01:19:16,973
my life to give me these 
perspectives and things like 

804
01:19:17,175 --> 01:19:19,608
that? A lot of it to me 
personally is listening 

805
01:19:22,658 --> 01:19:26,110
to audible. I started doing that
on my commute years ago. It has 

806
01:19:26,311 --> 01:19:32,804
been five or six years and then 
you look at your library and you

807
01:19:33,019 --> 01:19:35,019
read 

808
01:19:37,071 --> 01:19:40,122
200 400 I don't know because it 
is 15 at a time and I have 20 

809
01:19:40,323 --> 01:19:42,771
pages. Not to brag about how 
many books I read that is not 

810
01:19:42,971 --> 01:19:48,458
the point, sorry I did not read 
it I listened to it. People who 

811
01:19:48,615 --> 01:19:52,712
get upset about that but these 
are the types of people 

812
01:19:57,382 --> 01:19:59,415
who answer questions that I 
have. So, if you are having 

813
01:19:59,629 --> 01:20:01,629
these questions about what do I 
do 

814
01:20:05,857 --> 01:20:07,857
to communicate

815
01:20:11,004 --> 01:20:13,440
and how do I apply the ATTACK 
framework do not go into crisis 

816
01:20:13,641 --> 01:20:15,874
and start blabbering on stage 
with the wig on because that is 

817
01:20:16,075 --> 01:20:18,075
what you end up 

818
01:20:21,698 --> 01:20:23,698
doing. 

819
01:20:25,212 --> 01:20:27,212
Today apparel, anyone who 

820
01:20:30,836 --> 01:20:32,836
he is?

821
01:20:37,403 --> 01:20:43,493
I got a PhD in my other one came
from stack overflow. He is a 

822
01:20:43,707 --> 01:20:45,707
awesome guy credited 

823
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:50,780
with coining the toy and 
Bayesian network. So when he 

824
01:20:50,813 --> 01:20:52,813
writes a book I 

825
01:20:56,415 --> 01:20:59,949
read it. He is a Holocaust 
driver still doing this at 90. I

826
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:02,999
will be on the farm by then. 
Based versus Fisher. I often 

827
01:21:04,017 --> 01:21:06,017
looked at 

828
01:21:07,469 --> 01:21:13,356
heat maps and go, why don't I 
like this? Look at the history 

829
01:21:18,369 --> 01:21:21,478
of tobacco Sir Ronald Fisher, he
is 

830
01:21:24,931 --> 01:21:30,416
a genus or was that Rev. Thomas 
pays combat days go back to 

831
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:36,316
the 1600. 
>> Jordan Ellenberg also 

832
01:21:36,317 --> 01:21:39,768
fantastic book. My point? My 
point is the perspective outside

833
01:21:40,371 --> 01:21:42,371
of just our 

834
01:21:46,473 --> 01:21:52,148
niche industry. Cyber security, 
security, but really information

835
01:21:52,362 --> 01:21:54,997
theory. There are mathematics 
behind these things. I am not 

836
01:21:55,197 --> 01:21:57,197
the guy to teach 

837
01:22:00,813 --> 01:22:04,337
you demand math but maybe if you
talk to me about ideas in a way 

838
01:22:04,538 --> 01:22:06,538
that is accessible then we can 
come to a system 

839
01:22:11,382 --> 01:22:13,382
that works.

840
01:22:38,871 --> 01:22:43,340
Questions? I know it is typical 
to ask questions on. What is 

841
01:22:43,540 --> 01:22:48,624
happening? [ Laughter ] back 
that's a good question. We will 

842
01:22:48,825 --> 01:22:51,675
do Ivan and then avid 

843
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,571
Adam. 
>> Somehow I have been 

844
01:22:58,572 --> 01:23:00,572
extensively talking to you this 
weekend 

845
01:23:04,271 --> 01:23:05,887
week and -- 
>> It is called social 

846
01:23:05,888 --> 01:23:10,556
engineering. [ Laughter ] back 
what I wanted to ask 

847
01:23:10,557 --> 01:23:15,442
>> Answer my first question but 
what I wanted to ask 

848
01:23:20,452 --> 01:23:22,452
was careerwise,

849
01:23:25,179 --> 01:23:27,010
would you suggest someone 
specialize in something or would

850
01:23:27,011 --> 01:23:30,263
you suggest they try to take a 
multitask? I was talking to you 

851
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:33,112
earlier, I have that problem 
where we are seeing 

852
01:23:36,148 --> 01:23:40,215
the trend toward specialization 
and some of us like the outside 

853
01:23:40,415 --> 01:23:43,667
and also like doing and tell in.
I was wondering what your 

854
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:50,680
perspective is?

855
01:23:55,246 --> 01:23:57,246
>> For me with how I have 
learned the 

856
01:24:01,885 --> 01:24:03,885
worst is

857
01:24:05,605 --> 01:24:07,436
most is put myself in 
uncomfortable positions. I see 

858
01:24:07,437 --> 01:24:09,873
myself as an ambulance chaser. I
go to where the problems are in 

859
01:24:10,075 --> 01:24:13,126
trying to fix them. To be on one
of the biggest lessons I have 

860
01:24:13,327 --> 01:24:17,797
learned is you cannot do that 
forever. You may be able to but 

861
01:24:17,997 --> 01:24:19,997
I cannot do it forever. When you

862
01:24:22,463 --> 01:24:24,498
are specializing it is fine, you
have so many resources available

863
01:24:24,698 --> 01:24:29,176
to you today. Every once in a 
while I will watch YouTube live 

864
01:24:29,377 --> 01:24:32,211
overflow. Dude is teaching me 
how to reverse engineer x86 

865
01:24:33,844 --> 01:24:35,844
while playing a 

866
01:24:40,477 --> 01:24:43,186
videogame. What? How do you do 
this stuff? There is so much 

867
01:24:43,387 --> 01:24:45,821
information available today 
which goes back to the other 

868
01:24:46,035 --> 01:24:49,075
talk, the bar is lower which is 
important so keep doing what you

869
01:24:49,276 --> 01:24:52,731
like to do but don't stop taking
care 

870
01:24:57,732 --> 01:25:02,490
of yourself. 
>> Great note to end on. Please 

871
01:25:02,686 --> 01:25:04,686
join me in thanking James. [

the audience a little bit. 

875

Walter on twitter said if you 
are 

876

not watching right now you are 
missing a great talk and he

own round. Thank you to James 
working but my pleasure to 

884
01:26:09,513 --> 01:26:11,513
introduce Otis Apple Alexander 

885
01:26:15,001 --> 01:26:19,871
a leave security engineer here 
at Sunday. He ton and I said 

886
01:26:20,267 --> 01:26:22,307
yes.  ATT&CKcon team is out 
there we so often get the 

887
01:26:25,558 --> 01:26:28,207
question,  when is ATT&CKcon for
ICS coming out I say you have to

888
01:26:28,408 --> 01:26:35,926
talk  to Otis. I am excited for 
him to give us up AIDS, 

889
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:39,522
challenges and please join me 
welcoming Otis Alexander. [

Applause ] 
>> I am going to really consider

891
01:26:46,681 --> 01:26:50,547
getting a wig for my next 
presentation. It might help with

892
01:26:51,563 --> 01:26:57,659
my confidence. Not this time. 
Either way, I'm going to give a 

893
01:26:57,860 --> 01:26:59,860
quick 

894
01:27:00,899 --> 01:27:02,899
update about ATT&CKcon for ICS. 
I will  cover some 

895
01:27:07,731 --> 01:27:09,731
of the

896
01:27:11,671 --> 01:27:13,671
typical things I get asked 
about. Why ATT&CKcon for ICS? 

897
01:27:13,703 --> 01:27:15,736
How does that fit into 
frameworks? And when is it going

898
01:27:15,937 --> 01:27:19,188
to be available?  Why ATT&CKcon 
for ICS?  We can think about it 

899
01:27:19,388 --> 01:27:21,388
from a couple of 

900
01:27:23,858 --> 01:27:25,275
different perspectives, ICS 
industrial control systems are 

901
01:27:25,276 --> 01:27:27,276
behind some of the world was 
critical 

902
01:27:29,746 --> 01:27:31,979
in production. That is a reason 
in itself to look at how 

903
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:36,589
adversaries are affecting the 
systems. The other thing is, as 

904
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:38,896
some news and then do want to 
have a deep knowledge about 

905
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:44,950
how adversaries are affecting 
the systems. They want to know 

906
01:27:44,984 --> 01:27:46,984
about the 

907
01:27:48,636 --> 01:27:50,636
trade calf craft, technologies, 
and use that to help improve 

908
01:27:55,477 --> 01:27:57,477
the printers.

909
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:05,093
Another thing is apples have 
behaviors in these environments.

910
01:28:05,094 --> 01:28:07,127
The environmental unique in 
themselves and I will go over a 

911
01:28:07,327 --> 01:28:09,360
couple of the things that we 
have to consider adversary goes.

912
01:28:09,561 --> 01:28:12,402
One of the things AB is trying 
to do in this area are trying to

913
01:28:12,612 --> 01:28:14,612
disrupt some delivery of 
services in conjunction with the

914
01:28:19,248 --> 01:28:21,549
industrial process. They may 
also try to cause physical 

915
01:28:21,751 --> 01:28:23,751
damage to pieces of equipment 

916
01:28:27,554 --> 01:28:32,106
and close -- that is important 
as well. Some of the things we 

917
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:34,307
do not want to happen are the 
catastrophic failures. Things 

918
01:28:34,341 --> 01:28:36,341
that affect property or 

919
01:28:39,964 --> 01:28:42,879
human life. Another thing we 
have to consider is the 

920
01:28:43,079 --> 01:28:45,079
technological differences 
between ICS and traditional 

921
01:28:48,362 --> 01:28:50,796
IT systems. While IT is present 
in ICS we also have things like 

922
01:28:50,997 --> 01:28:52,627
controllers interfacing directly
with pieces of equipment that 

923
01:28:52,628 --> 01:28:58,915
run the process. We also have 
specialized applications and 

924
01:28:59,128 --> 01:29:02,165
protocols. These things are 
taken into account at any point 

925
01:29:04,816 --> 01:29:08,871
in time and allow us to make 
changes to the system. These are

926
01:29:09,073 --> 01:29:11,723
important things we have to take
into consideration. There are 

927
01:29:11,924 --> 01:29:15,177
different ways of defending 
these systems. We are less 

928
01:29:15,378 --> 01:29:18,014
mature in these areas. What are 
the data sources 

929
01:29:21,878 --> 01:29:24,112
we need in order to defend the 
systems? Where do we collect 

930
01:29:28,981 --> 01:29:30,813
them from? If we are dealing 
with low-level embedded 

931
01:29:30,814 --> 01:29:32,814
controllers they do not have the
same interfaces to collect 

932
01:29:32,848 --> 01:29:34,848
information. We also have to 
think about 

933
01:29:39,074 --> 01:29:41,074
the protocols.

934
01:29:45,028 --> 01:29:47,063
The last thing I want to 
highlight is if we're thinking 

935
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:49,298
about mitigations or security 
controls we do not want them to 

936
01:29:49,498 --> 01:29:52,134
affect safety. We do not want to
be a part of the problem. These 

937
01:29:52,336 --> 01:29:54,336
are a lot of unique 
considerations we have. I think 

938
01:29:58,039 --> 01:30:00,269
is why we want ATT&CKcon for 
ICS. And when I went about 

939
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:02,704
control systems we have to think
about the  asset owner or 

940
01:30:02,904 --> 01:30:05,743
operator's perspective and what 
their complete system looks 

941
01:30:06,012 --> 01:30:08,012
like. Representation of the 

942
01:30:11,559 --> 01:30:13,559
functional levels

943
01:30:18,347 --> 01:30:20,347
of a asset owner system. This 
includes you will traditionally 

944
01:30:20,369 --> 01:30:22,369
call headquarters or something 
like that. A enterprise system 

945
01:30:27,009 --> 01:30:27,888
high-level applications. 
Operational technology 

946
01:30:27,889 --> 01:30:29,889
industrial consortium where 

947
01:30:33,292 --> 01:30:37,230
you have supervisory control. A 
way to look into the system and 

948
01:30:37,431 --> 01:30:39,263
control the system. And local 
control that directly interfaces

949
01:30:39,264 --> 01:30:42,514
with these pieces of equipment. 
So, looking at the traditional 

950
01:30:42,715 --> 01:30:45,352
adversary behavior it ranges 
along the 

951
01:30:50,353 --> 01:30:54,088
whole model. It is not like 
adversaries are always just 

952
01:30:54,289 --> 01:30:57,552
getting into supervisory control
or low-level systems. Most of 

953
01:30:57,753 --> 01:30:59,753
the time they are making their 
way through the enterprise 

954
01:30:59,774 --> 01:31:03,440
systems and down. IT, literally 
spans the 

955
01:31:08,447 --> 01:31:11,763
whole model. It spans from 
enterprise systems all the way 

956
01:31:11,963 --> 01:31:13,996
down to basic control where you 
have embedded windows and things

957
01:31:14,198 --> 01:31:18,063
like that. That is where 
enterprise ATT&CKcon comes into 

958
01:31:18,464 --> 01:31:20,464
play it 

959
01:31:21,913 --> 01:31:23,913
explains the entry points for 
adversaries coming into IT or 

960
01:31:23,948 --> 01:31:25,948
enterprise systems. It also 
explains 

961
01:31:29,773 --> 01:31:32,886
the conduit they leverage to get
up into basic control or the 

962
01:31:33,087 --> 01:31:35,123
area they need to be in the 
industrial control systems. We 

963
01:31:35,738 --> 01:31:38,373
cannot forget about the special 
goals that adversaries have at 

964
01:31:38,574 --> 01:31:40,574
the 

965
01:31:41,625 --> 01:31:43,625
low levels. We cannot forget 
there are protocols that 

966
01:31:47,510 --> 01:31:49,510
are unique and unique platforms 
in the embedded systems that 

967
01:31:49,545 --> 01:31:51,545
interface with 

968
01:31:53,611 --> 01:31:55,430
the equipment. We cannot forget 
that there are specialized 

969
01:31:55,431 --> 01:31:57,431
applications that 

970
01:32:00,633 --> 01:32:02,633
operators use.

971
01:32:05,998 --> 01:32:08,031
That is the focus, to complete 
the story of the adversary 

972
01:32:08,232 --> 01:32:10,232
behavior from enterprise all the
way down to the low-level 

973
01:32:10,267 --> 01:32:12,267
systems. What we're doing is 
trying to 

974
01:32:14,938 --> 01:32:16,969
figure out the interface between
the two models. We do have 

975
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:23,980
some solutions

976
01:32:26,724 --> 01:32:29,160
and you get the full gamut of 
the systems. What are some of 

977
01:32:29,361 --> 01:32:31,361
our use cases? 
>> Will have current ones we are

978
01:32:31,395 --> 01:32:33,214
currently working on and 
utilizing and we also have 

979
01:32:33,215 --> 01:32:37,282
future ones we want to look at. 
In general we utilized a lot of 

980
01:32:42,289 --> 01:32:46,621
the same cases as enterprise. 
One of the big one was 

981
01:32:46,821 --> 01:32:48,251
standardized information 
reporting. We have so many 

982
01:32:48,253 --> 01:32:51,092
reports for the same incident 
that reports in different ways. 

983
01:32:51,289 --> 01:32:56,375
Sometimes it is hard to get a 
sense of what people missed and 

984
01:32:56,576 --> 01:32:58,576
what is common. A standard 
language for looking at these 

985
01:32:58,613 --> 01:33:00,613
reports 

986
01:33:03,619 --> 01:33:08,351
or if security practitioners use
standard language to report out 

987
01:33:08,566 --> 01:33:11,001
it may help the community. A lot
of these cases center around the

988
01:33:11,202 --> 01:33:13,436
analyst. Enabling the analyst to
do their job better is still a 

989
01:33:17,502 --> 01:33:20,139
new area. When we talk about OT 
socks and they are having a hard

990
01:33:20,339 --> 01:33:22,374
time finding people who have the
expertise in this area. Attack 

991
01:33:22,574 --> 01:33:26,442
can help them in their jobs. One
thing is hunt incident response 

992
01:33:26,643 --> 01:33:31,312
and playbooks, analytic 
development, analyst training, 

993
01:33:31,512 --> 01:33:33,512
and utilizing 

994
01:33:36,395 --> 01:33:37,611
adversary innovation. Testbed 
environments to better 

995
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:39,612
understand what the artifacts 
are left 

996
01:33:42,281 --> 01:33:44,281
by adversaries. To understand 
how well our defenses are doing 

997
01:33:44,317 --> 01:33:46,952
and things like that. And other 
use cases 

998
01:33:51,018 --> 01:33:52,838
criticality analysis. When we're
looking at a industrial control 

999
01:33:52,839 --> 01:33:55,026
system we can better understand 
how assets, functions and [ 

1000
01:33:57,923 --> 01:33:59,742
Indiscernible ] linkup to the 
mission and how a adversary 

1001
01:33:59,743 --> 01:34:01,743
utilizing certain technic 

1002
01:34:06,386 --> 01:34:11,117
tactics technic and procedures 
to better utilize that. Too bad 

1003
01:34:11,331 --> 01:34:13,769
it gives students a what we need
to focus on in the environment 

1004
01:34:13,970 --> 01:34:15,970
that affects submission. A 
future use case that we are 

1005
01:34:16,002 --> 01:34:20,270
really interesting in his 
modeling at the design phase. We

1006
01:34:20,471 --> 01:34:22,471
have been talking to device 

1007
01:34:24,526 --> 01:34:26,559
manufacturers and one of the 
critical needs in one of the 

1008
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:28,760
things they have been using 

1009
01:34:32,586 --> 01:34:36,112
ATT&CKcon  for ICS for is to 
help untrained engineers 

1010
01:34:36,313 --> 01:34:37,731
understand what the 
ramifications are for adding 

1011
01:34:37,732 --> 01:34:39,351
features at the design process 
for low-level embedded 

1012
01:34:39,352 --> 01:34:42,403
controllers. So they can 
understand what vectors are 

1013
01:34:42,603 --> 01:34:44,603
opening 

1014
01:34:47,284 --> 01:34:49,284
up and TTP's associated with 
that. And what mitigations can 

1015
01:34:49,305 --> 01:34:51,305
be used to address those 

1016
01:34:53,989 --> 01:34:55,605
things. 
>> Challenges. We have had a lot

1017
01:34:55,606 --> 01:34:57,840
of challenges in terms of 
working with this framework and 

1018
01:34:58,042 --> 01:35:01,910
building this framework. One of 
them is a lack of real word 

1019
01:35:02,110 --> 01:35:06,580
data. There is really good stuff
out there there is detailed 

1020
01:35:06,781 --> 01:35:09,417
information we are able to 
capitalize on for this framework

1021
01:35:09,618 --> 01:35:13,888
but, in general, our lights on 
we do 

1022
01:35:18,899 --> 01:35:20,899
not have

1023
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:25,878
water and generally it seems 
stable so it does not seem like 

1024
01:35:26,079 --> 01:35:28,513
a lot going on. That could be a 
number of reasons. Maybe nothing

1025
01:35:28,713 --> 01:35:30,749
is happening. Maybe we have no 
visibility. We don't know what's

1026
01:35:30,950 --> 01:35:32,950
happening. Maybe we are bad at 
root 

1027
01:35:37,181 --> 01:35:42,125
cause analysis. Or maybe we are 
bad at 

1028
01:35:47,132 --> 01:35:49,632
information sharing. We are 
hoping the ATT&CKcon model for 

1029
01:35:49,847 --> 01:35:52,282
ICS will help get people talking
more about what they are seeing 

1030
01:35:52,484 --> 01:35:54,484
in 

1031
01:35:55,524 --> 01:35:57,524
their environment. Also to start
thinking about visibility so we 

1032
01:35:57,557 --> 01:35:59,557
do catch what is going on. 

1033
01:36:02,228 --> 01:36:04,464
A big and use the proper level 
of abstraction when dealing with

1034
01:36:04,877 --> 01:36:06,877
multiple domains. We look at 
electric power, 

1035
01:36:10,351 --> 01:36:14,824
water systems, oil and gas, what
level should the techniques be 

1036
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:17,040
at to best explain adversary 
behavior over a broad set 

1037
01:36:21,856 --> 01:36:25,396
of demesnes and then a diverse 
set of protocols and vendors? 

1038
01:36:25,595 --> 01:36:27,627
How do we find the proper 
extraction layer? We have been 

1039
01:36:28,004 --> 01:36:32,298
getting feedback to help with 
that. And then, scope, do we 

1040
01:36:32,499 --> 01:36:36,154
focus on adversaries and what 
they have done to certain 

1041
01:36:36,354 --> 01:36:40,421
domains. Do we expand that to 
ink about how it affects 

1042
01:36:44,274 --> 01:36:46,307
different domains? Do we look at
the whole cyber physical system 

1043
01:36:46,515 --> 01:36:49,560
domain in general? Any cyber 
element that 

1044
01:36:54,573 --> 01:36:56,573
affects physical

1045
01:37:00,322 --> 01:37:03,172
-- the physical world, is that 
how far we want to go or do we 

1046
01:37:03,372 --> 01:37:05,607
scope it and be more refined? 
These are all challenges that we

1047
01:37:05,808 --> 01:37:07,641
have thought about and are 
addressing with the framework. 

1048
01:37:07,642 --> 01:37:10,077
We have gotten a lot of good 
feedback that has helped us in 

1049
01:37:10,284 --> 01:37:12,284
terms of our 

1050
01:37:15,705 --> 01:37:20,836
tap development categories we 
think are important to 

1051
01:37:21,051 --> 01:37:23,351
describing adversary behavior. 
Initial access 

1052
01:37:27,945 --> 01:37:30,393
is one. We want to know how the 
adversaries are making their way

1053
01:37:30,594 --> 01:37:34,449
into OT environments. We want to
know how they are inhibiting 

1054
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,915
response functions that deals 
with safety, protection, and 

1055
01:37:43,183 --> 01:37:45,183
quality assurance. Those are 
mechanisms that should be 

1056
01:37:49,605 --> 01:37:51,605
in place

disable and appealing physical 

1058
01:38:00,650 --> 01:38:02,482

impact like loss of control, 

1059
01:38:02,483 --> 01:38:04,717
loss of you and loss of revenue 
or productivity these are all 

1060
01:38:04,918 --> 01:38:06,918
things we are considering. 

1061
01:38:09,389 --> 01:38:11,422
We've updated the attack matrix 
to reflect some of these new 

1062
01:38:11,623 --> 01:38:14,675
tactics and we have added 
techniques to address how 

1063
01:38:14,876 --> 01:38:18,930
adversaries are accomplishing 
these goals. So, some things 

1064
01:38:19,145 --> 01:38:21,379
people ask me first, I will 
address 

1065
01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:27,232
it now. What is the status 

1066
01:38:31,257 --> 01:38:33,257
of 

1067
01:38:34,774 --> 01:38:36,774
ATT&CKcon for ICS? We are 
currently in our third major 

1068
01:38:36,809 --> 01:38:38,643
division. Was trying to 
highlight changes  made we 

1069
01:38:38,644 --> 01:38:40,644
actually 

1070
01:38:43,315 --> 01:38:44,934
have individuals from 29 
organizations who have early 

1071
01:38:44,936 --> 01:38:46,936
review or ask us to give us 
initial feedback about 

1072
01:38:51,778 --> 01:38:54,275
the model before we get three 
public release. These 

1073
01:38:54,489 --> 01:38:57,942
organizations range over private
and public entities. We are 

1074
01:38:58,143 --> 01:39:00,578
getting a lot of different use 
cases and feedback from a lot of

1075
01:39:01,395 --> 01:39:03,395
different people. We are 
planning for release December of

1076
01:39:04,233 --> 01:39:06,233
this year. It is available to 
the larger community to 

1077
01:39:09,516 --> 01:39:11,516
collect feedback. We want to do 
a independent release where 

1078
01:39:11,550 --> 01:39:15,721
we're not on in a [ 
Indiscernible ] just to help 

1079
01:39:15,878 --> 01:39:17,878
facilitate rapid response to 
feedback we 

1080
01:39:20,891 --> 01:39:22,924
anticipate getting. If you want 
access before that time we are 

1081

currently 

1082
01:39:27,181 --> 01:39:29,218
allowing that via MDA. If you 
have any questions please let 

1083
01:39:33,273 --> 01:39:35,922
me know. We are excited to get 
this out to the public so that 

1084
01:39:36,123 --> 01:39:38,355
you can start using it and start
providing feedback and we can 

1085
01:39:38,556 --> 01:39:41,004
mature and refine it. Do I have 
time for 

1086
01:39:45,461 --> 01:39:46,893
questions? 
>> Please join me in thanking

Otis Alexander. We will push 
questions into the break. [ 

1088
01:39:53,718 --> 01:39:58,472
Applause ] this is not a easy 
space as Bryson chimed in. ICS 

1089
01:39:58,672 --> 01:40:00,672
is inherently different than IT.
I see ICS 

1090
01:40:05,092 --> 01:40:07,397
folks nodding. If that is your 
area of expertise talk to Otis, 

1091
01:40:07,612 --> 01:40:10,047
Ree and others, we are here to 
chat about that. Now that leads

you anticipating

1101
01:41:49,574 --> 01:41:51,605
in ATT&CKcon. Sitting with our 
first figures in the morning. I 

1102
01:41:51,806 --> 01:41:54,244
was about to get a copy and the 
daughter watching your talk and 

1103
01:41:54,445 --> 01:41:56,893
it was all the caffeine I 
needed.  It resonates with a lot

1104
01:41:57,093 --> 01:41:59,093
of us. Sarah and John from 

1105

you feel?

>> I had only just formed coffee
myself. 

1107
01:42:05,512 --> 01:42:08,469
>> I did too but I had to 
refrain from the third. A chance

1108
01:42:08,669 --> 01:42:12,735
to kick things off in share 
something that is important but 

1109
01:42:12,936 --> 01:42:15,987
a little different take compared
to what went down on day 

1110
01:42:20,999 --> 01:42:23,293
one. 
>> The title was misinformation 

1111
01:42:23,494 --> 01:42:25,494
threat sharing. One of the first
things you introduced that 

1112
01:42:25,528 --> 01:42:27,963
resonates with a lot of us that 
maybe you have not heard that 

1113
01:42:28,164 --> 01:42:31,830
term, cognitive security. Do you
want to go into a little more 

1114
01:42:32,031 --> 01:42:33,911
detail about what it is for the 
audience? 

1115
01:42:33,912 --> 01:42:35,912
>> That term comes from 

1116
01:42:37,922 --> 01:42:39,750
Ryan Waltman. We have been 
talking about misinformation and

1117
01:42:39,752 --> 01:42:44,021
disinformation in the idea of 
take information in the idea of 

1118
01:42:44,219 --> 01:42:46,219
large-scale coordinated attacks 

1119
01:42:49,621 --> 01:42:53,974
using information. We say it a 
lot because we want people to 

1120
01:42:54,174 --> 01:42:58,230
focus on the thing you want to 
protect. We were talking about 

1121
01:42:58,431 --> 01:43:01,481
setting up the cognitive 
security eyes out and originally

1122
01:43:01,681 --> 01:43:03,513
the people talked about 
misinformation. You do not want 

1123
01:43:03,514 --> 01:43:09,000
to name an ice out for the bad 
thing you want you name it for 

1124
01:43:09,201 --> 01:43:11,201
the thing you want to preserve. 
The 

1125
01:43:15,431 --> 01:43:17,431
idea of

1126
01:43:33,984 --> 01:43:35,984
you have cyber security and 
physical security in the idea 

1127
01:43:40,804 --> 01:43:43,726
of cognitive. Looking at 
people's belief 

1128
01:43:48,726 --> 01:43:52,063
systems and belief systems as 
the community to be the 

1129
01:43:52,264 --> 01:43:54,264
endpoint. Not just band PCs 

1130
01:43:57,349 --> 01:43:58,967
and networks. 
>> We are familiar with trust 

1131
01:43:58,968 --> 01:44:01,404
and social engineering. We call 
it level a and do not go into 

1132
01:44:01,604 --> 01:44:03,604
more detail. Really bridging the
gap. The mysterious world we 

1133
01:44:03,638 --> 01:44:05,638
never really 

1134
01:44:08,306 --> 01:44:10,339
talk about. On that theme you 
are talking about making this 

1135
01:44:10,539 --> 01:44:14,839
practical and bring it back into
the community. You mentioned red

1136
01:44:15,028 --> 01:44:19,089
teaming and bleaching. What are 
the exercises like in your 

1137
01:44:19,306 --> 01:44:21,745
space? I am actually curious how
that would work. 

1138
01:44:21,747 --> 01:44:26,429
>> It would mess with a lot of 
people's brains. 

1139
01:44:26,430 --> 01:44:28,255
>> You want to talk about the 
red team? 

1140
01:44:28,256 --> 01:44:30,256
>> We did a workshop in 

1141
01:44:33,759 --> 01:44:35,797
Atlanta and got some people 
together and as SJ referenced in

1142
01:44:35,999 --> 01:44:38,240
the presentation if there was an
award given out for the most 

1143
01:44:38,443 --> 01:44:40,443
thinking is 

1144
01:44:43,655 --> 01:44:48,833
given out sticky notes put up on
the wall. A process of all the 

1145
01:44:49,034 --> 01:44:51,273
campaigns and incidents we have 
worked on and documented. We 

1146
01:44:51,474 --> 01:44:55,551
were still down to 22 in terms 
of the data information we 

1147
01:44:59,012 --> 01:45:01,249
had. Then come down to what we 
identified as all the different 

1148
01:45:01,449 --> 01:45:03,449
technique. 

1149
01:45:05,125 --> 01:45:07,163
There would there was a process 
of matching the techniques with 

1150
01:45:07,365 --> 01:45:10,411
different phases and stages. It 
was a 

1151
01:45:14,689 --> 01:45:16,930
good exercise to go from this 
campaign to these are the things

1152
01:45:17,131 --> 01:45:20,605
we have seen. 
>> What we're trying to do 

1153
01:45:25,630 --> 01:45:29,565
is match what the person running
the misinformation campaign is 

1154
01:45:29,766 --> 01:45:31,806
doing. What are they doing in 
terms of planning the campaign 

1155
01:45:32,006 --> 01:45:34,247
or running the camping all the 
way through to wrapping up and 

1156
01:45:34,448 --> 01:45:36,688
learning from it. Blue team is 
what you doing in terms of 

1157
01:45:36,889 --> 01:45:39,962
defending against us? What are 
we doing next? Ways to defend 

1158
01:45:40,966 --> 01:45:42,966
against misinformation. Both at 
the 

1159
01:45:44,831 --> 01:45:47,271
technical level. To defend 
against an 

1160
01:45:52,286 --> 01:45:54,286
entire campaign.

1161
01:45:57,462 --> 01:45:59,502
>> Speaking of these campaigns 
and going a step back you 

1162
01:45:59,704 --> 01:46:03,768
mentioned a big target of these 
spaces. Democracy and extremism,

1163
01:46:03,983 --> 01:46:06,007
do you think it will hold true 
overtime? 

1164
01:46:06,008 --> 01:46:08,008
>> 

1165
01:46:09,268 --> 01:46:11,268
Totally evolving. Not 

1166
01:46:14,704 --> 01:46:18,644
just the destabilization but 
attacking the democratic process

1167
01:46:18,846 --> 01:46:20,846
itself. You are attacking 
systems. We also seen business 

1168
01:46:25,482 --> 01:46:27,390
being attacked. We are seeing 
misinformation attacks against 

1169
01:46:27,391 --> 01:46:29,431
individual organizations and 
misinformation as part of hybrid

1170
01:46:29,632 --> 01:46:31,668
attacks. We are seeing combined 
cyber misinformation attacks 

1171
01:46:31,883 --> 01:46:34,724
becoming part of the attack it 

1172
01:46:39,738 --> 01:46:41,852
has. 
>> I appreciate what you didn't 

1173

1177
01:47:03,373 --> 01:47:06,902

stop putting information into

and building things. We 

1187
01:48:02,722 --> 01:48:05,365
think that we would be able to 
use all of the tool bag on

misinformation so go wild.

a strong solid set of data. You 
ran into your algorithm and 

1204
01:51:52,426 --> 01:51:54,460
downtrends, do you want to speak
more about them? There was 

1205
01:51:54,660 --> 01:51:56,092
interesting to about execution, 
discovery and malware. 

1206
01:51:56,093 --> 01:52:00,905
>> Basically the tactics of the 
ATT&CKcon framework  archers are

1207
01:52:05,772 --> 01:52:07,772
dropping techniques

1208
01:52:11,737 --> 01:52:13,737
. These 

1209
01:52:15,386 --> 01:52:17,386
new techniques proved to be more
efficient about other tactics 

1210
01:52:17,421 --> 01:52:20,459
the techniques were anesthetic. 
Like discovery at 

1211
01:52:24,529 --> 01:52:26,347
talk about. 
>> There are only so many ways 

1212
01:52:26,348 --> 01:52:28,348
you can do it. 
>> Yes and it overlaps with 

1213
01:52:31,838 --> 01:52:33,838
benign activity. So basically to
stay with the big 

1214
01:52:38,139 --> 01:52:39,755
same capabilities. 
>> Do you think this innovations

1215
01:52:39,756 --> 01:52:43,005
and changes are based on 
offenders or is it like a 

1216
01:52:46,673 --> 01:52:49,309
hybrid ballpark of this is how 
the world is and this is how the

1217
01:52:49,509 --> 01:52:52,147
world grows? 
>> I think it is a cat and 

1218
01:52:57,148 --> 01:52:59,466
mouse game. This is not the 
presentation but you what you 

1219
01:52:59,666 --> 01:53:01,666
can see is the adoption of some 
techniques goes hand-in-hand 

1220
01:53:01,699 --> 01:53:08,806
with the leaks in certain 
malware. When state-sponsored to

1221
01:53:09,012 --> 01:53:13,074
act or what we think are 
state-sponsored actors than it 

1222
01:53:13,274 --> 01:53:17,742
is quickly adopted by others. 
This may be one of the reasons 

1223
01:53:17,943 --> 01:53:24,246
for which this happens. It will 
showed in the presentation. 

1224
01:53:24,247 --> 01:53:26,285
>> Of the 900 samples did you 
map that out and 

1225
01:53:31,290 --> 01:53:35,621
the timeline and put significant
cyber events like code releases 

1226
01:53:35,822 --> 01:53:37,856
or major cyber breaches? How 
widespread is the sample size of

1227
01:53:38,057 --> 01:53:40,291
data? 
>> It is quite spread. It ranges

1228
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:49,429
from first-year coverage 2003 
and the last year being 2018. 

1229
01:53:49,630 --> 01:53:51,630
The coverage is a 

1230
01:53:53,698 --> 01:53:55,698
bit thinner 

1231
01:53:58,914 --> 01:54:00,914
in 2003 than 2008 but in 2003 
there were 

1232
01:54:05,603 --> 01:54:07,603
less viruses. 
>> 

1233
01:54:10,959 --> 01:54:15,026
Speaking of like you said, your 
work, you mentioned overcoming 

1234
01:54:15,227 --> 01:54:17,459
biases. From 2003 2018 we saw a 
much different platform 

1235
01:54:22,461 --> 01:54:24,979
and arena. As producers of the 
community how can we enable more

1236
01:54:25,179 --> 01:54:27,179
research on 

1237
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:31,481
your end? You depend on the 
really strong data set to get 

1238
01:54:31,682 --> 01:54:34,317
what you needed to do but what 
can we do to help that research?

1239
01:54:34,531 --> 01:54:36,531
Watching twitter everyone loved 
your research and we would love 

1240
01:54:36,551 --> 01:54:38,583
to do more data your way and 
learn more of your 

1241
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:45,584
methods. 
>>

1242
01:54:50,170 --> 01:54:52,606
If you want to do research like 
I did it was representative of 

1243
01:54:52,807 --> 01:54:54,807
the last 15 or 20 years. It will
stay difficult 

1244
01:54:59,108 --> 01:55:01,946
to find malware that is 20 years
old. If you have it it will be 

1245
01:55:02,149 --> 01:55:04,149
more difficult to 

1246
01:55:06,012 --> 01:55:07,451
for example [ Indiscernible ] 
because the infrastructure is 

1247
01:55:07,452 --> 01:55:12,099
out of date. It is a difficult 
problem to solve but sampling 

1248
01:55:13,317 --> 01:55:18,802
malware is basically a big 
challenge. Most sources where 

1249
01:55:19,016 --> 01:55:21,016
you get your malware from 

1250
01:55:23,482 --> 01:55:27,949
our bias. We talked to certain 
vendors willing to offer samples

1251
01:55:28,150 --> 01:55:30,581
to us but some of them have a 

1252
01:55:35,583 --> 01:55:38,516
customer based to a getting 
North America and not the rest 

1253
01:55:38,716 --> 01:55:42,369
of the world. These are 
difficult problems to solve as a

1254
01:55:42,570 --> 01:55:44,570
researcher. You wanted to be 
representative for the 

1255
01:55:49,412 --> 01:55:51,412
whole ecosystem. 

1256
01:55:55,579 --> 01:56:00,650
>> These are biases, they are 
okay but you have to be aware 

1257
01:56:00,859 --> 01:56:02,859
otherwise [ 

1258
01:56:05,850 --> 01:56:07,850
Indiscernible ] 

1259
01:56:15,484 --> 01:56:17,720
>> What is next? Any big 
takeaways you were not able to 

1260
01:56:17,921 --> 01:56:19,921
inject into the talk 

1261
01:56:22,591 --> 01:56:24,591
or opportunities you want to 
challenge the community to pick 

1262
01:56:24,623 --> 01:56:26,656
up in your work? 
>> There are lots of stuff to 

1263
01:56:26,857 --> 01:56:28,857
pick 

1264
01:56:31,867 --> 01:56:34,975
up on. There are some many 
parties happy to be involved in 

1265
01:56:35,176 --> 01:56:37,423
the follow-up of this research. 
I think it will take next week 

1266
01:56:37,623 --> 01:56:41,879
to look at all the endeavors. 
>> You mentioned in 

1267
01:56:46,881 --> 01:56:52,652
the beginning there was in 
December Mac how or what about 

1268
01:56:52,853 --> 01:56:54,853
ATT&CKcon  made 

1269
01:56:58,955 --> 01:57:00,955
it 

1270
01:57:03,968 --> 01:57:05,247
work? 
>> Is starting from a 

1271
01:57:05,248 --> 01:57:07,281
practitioner point of view. I 
was already using ATT&CKcon at  

1272
01:57:09,101 --> 01:57:11,334
the organization. I was apprised
to see you did not receive that 

1273
01:57:11,535 --> 01:57:15,401
much covered in academia so 
basic basically academia is a 

1274
01:57:15,601 --> 01:57:17,601
few years past 

1275
01:57:22,020 --> 01:57:24,020
practitioner research.

1276
01:57:26,366 --> 01:57:29,216
I was apprised and did not get 
that much coverage. Moving on I 

1277
01:57:29,417 --> 01:57:31,417
would like to give tech more 

1278
01:57:34,693 --> 01:57:36,123
coverage. 
>> As always feel free to 

1279
01:57:36,124 --> 01:57:38,124
contribute and send your data 
in. We 

1280
01:57:40,792 --> 01:57:43,427
love trends. We do not have a 
lot of time or resources in the 

1281
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:46,478
data to do that type of work. 
Anytime you can send it back is 

1282
01:57:49,113 --> 01:57:51,349
greatly appreciated. We will 
transition to James Leroux a fan

1283
01:57:51,563 --> 01:57:53,563
favorite 

1284
01:57:56,578 --> 01:57:58,578
and self

1285
01:58:00,699 --> 01:58:02,530
proclaimed bubble the cyber 
clown. In the meantime, keep 

1286
01:58:02,531 --> 01:58:04,551
tweeting, we are loving the cat 
meme's, it is almost Halloween. 

1287
01:58:04,765 --> 01:58:06,765
Anyone have any spicy Halloween 
meme's we 

1288
01:58:10,994 --> 01:58:14,709
appreciate it. Special guest 
actually, this is a surprise. 

1289
01:58:14,910 --> 01:58:16,910
>> My 

1290
01:58:18,579 --> 01:58:21,016
name is Katie Nichols. It is a 
pleasure to meet you. I figure 

1291
01:58:21,217 --> 01:58:23,217
we 

1292
01:58:25,885 --> 01:58:28,318
have been talking to jet across 
cameras so I wanted to come say 

1293
01:58:28,532 --> 01:58:30,970
hi and you are doing a great 
job. When you going to start 

1294
01:58:31,170 --> 01:58:35,023
your talkshow at night? 
>> Tonight. Right after the 

1295
01:58:35,224 --> 01:58:37,873
nationals game seven. Me and 
Alan were talking. I was I am a 

1296
01:58:38,889 --> 01:58:40,889
brave fan so was hard 

1297
01:58:43,156 --> 01:58:45,591
to watch. I tried to hide the 
fact from the community but deep

1298
01:58:45,792 --> 01:58:47,826
in the heart Atlanta Braves. 
>> What has been your favorite 

1299
01:58:48,026 --> 01:58:50,026
part of ATT&CKcon 

1300
01:58:52,095 --> 01:58:53,511
? 
>> All of that. All the 

1301
01:58:53,512 --> 01:58:56,561
different perspectives, learning
things, the list goes on. It 

1302
01:58:56,762 --> 01:58:59,799
sounds sentimental and cheesy 
but I have had a good time. 

1303
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:01,800
>> It has been fun. Jamie and I 
worked 

1304
01:59:04,482 --> 01:59:06,482
together on ATT&CKcon and 
ATT&CKcon emails and now we work

1305
01:59:06,515 --> 01:59:08,750
together hosting people on the 
couch and upfront . It has been 

1306
01:59:08,951 --> 01:59:10,951
a lot 

1307
01:59:14,160 --> 01:59:17,675
of fun. I wanted to give a 
shadow to you in the awesome 

1308
01:59:17,890 --> 01:59:20,729
work you are doing. It has been 
a great time and keep it up. We 

1309
01:59:20,929 --> 01:59:23,781
are almost dumb with day to. I 
wanted to get out to the rest of

1310
01:59:23,981 --> 01:59:26,419
the team, thank you to the folks
doing work fine the students. I 

1311
01:59:26,620 --> 01:59:30,279
just wanted to sit down and say 
hello. 

1312
01:59:30,280 --> 01:59:36,168
>> The Countess company, 
>> Was coming? 

1313
01:59:36,169 --> 01:59:38,169
>> I just got Lacroix 

1314
01:59:42,195 --> 01:59:46,522
to. 
>> I'm not checking you it would

1315
01:59:47,337 --> 01:59:51,806
go badly. You may be familiar 
with their recon they make them 

1316
01:59:52,007 --> 01:59:55,258
drink warm Smirnov ice. Adam and

1317
01:59:58,508 --> 02:00:02,575
I are introducing for ATT&CKcon 
2.8  Lacroix and people. That 

1318
02:00:02,776 --> 02:00:07,648
may pop up later. 
>> As long as I can get a I 

1319
02:00:08,263 --> 02:00:11,313
think amen. 
>> You will regret saying that. 

1320
02:00:11,515 --> 02:00:13,515
>> Good 

1321
02:00:16,187 --> 02:00:19,026
luck. 
>> Our final speaker, obviously 

1322
02:00:19,224 --> 02:00:21,224
a fan 

1323
02:00:24,446 --> 02:00:25,927
favorite. 
>> No pressure. 

1324
02:00:25,928 --> 02:00:28,376
>> Great job. I appreciate the 
change of pace. The different 

1325
02:00:28,577 --> 02:00:30,577
perspective on things. Life on 

1326
02:00:34,265 --> 02:00:35,881
the farm. 
>> You live changes over time 

1327
02:00:35,882 --> 02:00:38,115
and sometimes it is good to 
reflect. That is what I was 

1328
02:00:38,330 --> 02:00:42,184
trying to get out of the top. It
is hard to convince someone of 

1329
02:00:42,385 --> 02:00:44,385
something in 

1330
02:00:45,642 --> 02:00:49,092
10 minutes. I myself in horrible
places. Hopefully I am spied 

1331
02:00:50,107 --> 02:00:53,757
someone. 
>> I think you did. Checking 

1332
02:00:53,958 --> 02:00:55,958
Twitter I think people resonated
with what you 

1333
02:01:00,397 --> 02:01:03,514
are saying. Especially in 

1334
02:01:08,382 --> 02:01:16,302
the trenches, I am an optimist. 
It is easy to be the fault of 

1335
02:01:16,515 --> 02:01:18,515
the people before us. The 

1336
02:01:22,520 --> 02:01:26,457
reality is if you are not doing 
something are not keeping up 

1337
02:01:26,672 --> 02:01:29,504
because the field is not keeping
up I do not 

1338
02:01:34,520 --> 02:01:36,520
like that

1339
02:01:42,913 --> 02:01:44,913
. It has not gotten any better. 
>> Speaking 

1340
02:01:49,557 --> 02:01:53,679
of evolution, the education and 
the value of that. Do you want 

1341
02:01:53,881 --> 02:01:55,914
to speak on bringing new people 
into the field? As practitioners

1342
02:01:56,114 --> 02:01:58,352
we think we have been doing it 
for years but obviously learning

1343
02:02:01,200 --> 02:02:04,853
never stops. 
>> There are people from all 

1344
02:02:05,468 --> 02:02:07,468
walks of life that would make 
great 

1345
02:02:12,288 --> 02:02:14,288
cyber people.

1346
02:02:18,259 --> 02:02:20,292
Everyone has a story. It doesn't
really matter but it matters 

1347
02:02:24,964 --> 02:02:26,797
moving forward to put yourself 
in challenging situations. That 

1348
02:02:26,798 --> 02:02:29,031
is what I do and where I learned
the most. If I 

1349
02:02:33,084 --> 02:02:36,135
go somewhere and everything is 
fine queuing alerts and 

1350
02:02:36,336 --> 02:02:41,217
reporting, if you get complacent
it is time to shake it up and 

1351
02:02:41,418 --> 02:02:44,255
figure out what is next. 
>> That lines up with what 

1352
02:02:44,470 --> 02:02:48,725
Richard said yesterday. You have
to identify problems and 

1353
02:02:49,942 --> 02:02:52,591
relentlessly attack. Some of our
goals may not be achievable but 

1354
02:02:52,792 --> 02:02:57,257
if we keep pushing it we get to 
the point to where we are better

1355
02:02:57,873 --> 02:02:59,289
off. 
>> Absolutely, if you live that 

1356
02:02:59,290 --> 02:03:01,290
sort of lifestyle you can 

1357
02:03:04,775 --> 02:03:09,251
almost cringe when people say 
lean, agile, [ Indiscernible ] 

1358
02:03:09,403 --> 02:03:11,403
because if you stay in 

1359
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:19,807
long enough you see things go in
circles. It is all a little bit 

1360
02:03:20,008 --> 02:03:22,008
of history 

1361
02:03:25,906 --> 02:03:27,526
repeating. 
>> In my career it is always 

1362
02:03:27,527 --> 02:03:29,963
been we don't have enough data 
and now we finally get to the 

1363
02:03:30,163 --> 02:03:33,012
point of wow, what do we do with
all the data? Any ideas? Look at

1364
02:03:33,213 --> 02:03:35,213
what we did five 

1365
02:03:37,279 --> 02:03:40,114
years ago. I encourage anyone 
interested to grind away and 

1366
02:03:40,329 --> 02:03:43,367
learn. Put yourself in those 
difficult positions. You are 

1367
02:03:43,569 --> 02:03:49,669
going to fail but failing is 
something that happened. 

1368
02:03:49,670 --> 02:03:53,324
>> Fell hard fail fast. 
>> I am still on stage doing 

1369
02:03:58,332 --> 02:04:00,227
dumb stuffed after years and 
years. 

1370
02:04:00,228 --> 02:04:02,467
>> Where do you see the field 
going? Evolution and taking on 

1371
02:04:02,666 --> 02:04:04,666
heart problems? 
>> I think it will be a societal

1372
02:04:04,699 --> 02:04:08,150
change to some extent. We are 
building upon a utility we do 

1373
02:04:08,351 --> 02:04:10,351
not understand very well. We 
understand in 

1374
02:04:12,818 --> 02:04:14,818
some ways but the freedom of 
information, if you 

1375
02:04:19,122 --> 02:04:21,557
look at the printing press and 
how that changed the world, I am

1376
02:04:21,757 --> 02:04:24,806
sure many smarter people have 
talked about this but we are 

1377
02:04:25,007 --> 02:04:30,291
playing 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon
and as time goes on we are two 

1378
02:04:30,489 --> 02:04:34,958
and 3 degrees of Kevin Bacon. 
Humans are not quite used to 

1379
02:04:35,173 --> 02:04:41,059
that. Maybe societally or maybe 
societies are much better like 

1380
02:04:41,261 --> 02:04:43,261
Estonia that was birthed in a 
digital age 

1381
02:04:46,332 --> 02:04:48,332
for inspiration. Sometimes you 
have to look outside of your 

1382
02:04:51,821 --> 02:04:53,237
Bible. 
>> You said that level of 

1383
02:04:53,238 --> 02:04:55,238
building society around 
technology and 

1384
02:04:58,722 --> 02:05:01,561
getting crippled. 
>> There are so many names. 

1385
02:05:01,717 --> 02:05:06,242
Sometimes I feel like a living 
meme. Definitely, I fixed it and

1386
02:05:06,443 --> 02:05:08,443
now everything is on fire 

1387
02:05:12,130 --> 02:05:14,130
around you. I definitely thought
that. Anyone in the industry 

1388
02:05:14,163 --> 02:05:16,163
that is passionate has 

1389
02:05:19,787 --> 02:05:23,303
felt it and you can feel like 
Cybertek people it is not a us 

1390
02:05:23,504 --> 02:05:27,976
versus them but a lot of times 
people are more organized and 

1391
02:05:28,177 --> 02:05:31,638
articulate or maybe more 
outgoing. I am a introvert. I 

1392
02:05:31,839 --> 02:05:33,839
force myself to do it. 
>> Great 

1393
02:05:36,923 --> 02:05:38,923
perspective. 
>> 

1394
02:05:40,376 --> 02:05:42,376
Circling back to ATT&CKcon, this
worldly very  

1395
02:05:46,806 --> 02:05:48,806
view

1396
02:05:51,949 --> 02:05:53,949
where do you see ATT&CKcon 
growing? How can we, as 

1397
02:05:53,981 --> 02:05:55,981
ATT&CKcon adjust these problems?
>> Last year I did a 

1398
02:06:00,687 --> 02:06:03,126
talk  on a great hybrid analysis
trying to figure out how they 

1399
02:06:03,324 --> 02:06:05,324
were attacking things. I was 
interested in doing the same 

1400
02:06:05,356 --> 02:06:07,793
thing. My talk may have come 
across is criticizing them. I 

1401
02:06:07,993 --> 02:06:10,629
really was not I was just trying
to see how people are perching 

1402
02:06:10,844 --> 02:06:16,117
them. You do that stuff in a 
bubble and are guilty of it but 

1403
02:06:16,318 --> 02:06:20,182
I think the great thing about 
ATT&CKcon is  it is community 

1404
02:06:20,488 --> 02:06:26,681
driven. Miter owns it somewhat 
not really but it will get the 

1405
02:06:26,881 --> 02:06:28,881
attack 

1406
02:06:31,882 --> 02:06:34,603
we deserve. Sometimes you need 
all the ideas to converge and we

1407
02:06:34,805 --> 02:06:36,805
will find out the 

1408
02:06:39,879 --> 02:06:42,114
right way but let's not be 
afraid to pursue ideas when they

1409
02:06:42,329 --> 02:06:44,763
do not necessarily match how we 
used to do business. The way we 

1410
02:06:44,964 --> 02:06:47,199
use to do business frankly 
hasn't worked. 

1411
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:52,279
>> That aligns with the keynote 
last year. If you want to go 

1412
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:55,116
fast go alone but if you want to
write good together. I may have 

1413
02:06:56,332 --> 02:06:57,961
botched that. 
>> I think he did Jupiter

last year. Use pandas instead of
Excel war what are you 

1416
02:07:11,085 --> 02:07:15,225
doing? 
>> Thank you for your time. That

1417
02:07:15,425 --> 02:07:17,672
is the only time we have before 
the next session of ATT&CKcon.

1424
02:10:09,352 --> 02:10:11,352
online had a chance to grab 
coffee.  Superuser on twitter

said she is an alternate

and looking and listening in 
from Germany. All around the

world folks are listening online
as well as here in McLean. 

1428
02:10:19,866 --> 02:10:22,513
Hopefully you all enjoyed that 
break. Thank you for 

1429
02:10:27,521 --> 02:10:30,630
Cisco map. A bunch of more 
figures and great content. It is

1430
02:10:30,832 --> 02:10:32,864
fun for me to introduce the next
figures who return from 

1431
02:10:37,132 --> 02:10:39,364
last year. As I was chatting 
with José that was his first 

1432
02:10:39,579 --> 02:10:43,846
ever public talk. That launched 
him on a year-long speaking 

1433
02:10:44,046 --> 02:10:46,046
career to 

1434
02:10:49,260 --> 02:10:52,978
Poland and becoming a 
internationally recognized 

1435
02:10:53,178 --> 02:10:55,211
speaker. One challenge we often 
have is getting access to the 

1436
02:10:55,411 --> 02:10:57,648
right data as we are trying to 
create analytics. Play and 7 

1437
02:10:57,848 --> 02:11:04,349
have done a lot of work on this.
Roberto is now at Amazon so

Virginia community college and 
has a background in business and

1441
02:11:23,769 --> 02:11:25,769
data science.

1442
02:11:28,535 --> 02:11:29,947
Which brings in different 
perspective across different 

1443
02:11:29,949 --> 02:11:31,949
fields. He is active in Twitter 
and open-source communities. It 

1444
02:11:31,981 --> 02:11:33,981
is my job to introduce Roberto 
and José 

1445

lot of projects you see over 
there and 

1453
02:12:13,818 --> 02:12:15,850
we created an open organization 
to put everything in and start 

1454
02:12:16,051 --> 02:12:19,917
building a community. Today we 
have a lot to talk about. A lot

>> We would like to start our 

1460
02:12:42,875 --> 02:12:48,349
talk given you an idea on how to
query all the information we 

1461
02:12:48,562 --> 02:12:53,432
have in ATT&CK . The way we 
would like to do this is using 

1462
02:12:54,250 --> 02:12:56,250
the server that 

1463
02:12:57,702 --> 02:12:59,724
attack has with all the 

1464
02:13:04,739 --> 02:13:06,739
information available

ATT&CK  

1466
02:13:18,334 --> 02:13:22,480
CTI.  It is the two libraries 
center created. If you want to 

1467
02:13:22,682 --> 02:13:24,715
install it you can do it 
directly from the source. Also, 

1468
02:13:24,915 --> 02:13:27,763
if you want to learn more from 
the library you can go to the 

1469
02:13:27,964 --> 02:13:34,667
link that is below. There will 
be a lot of resources to help 

1470
02:13:34,867 --> 02:13:36,867
you start understanding the 
library and using it to query 

1471
02:13:36,901 --> 02:13:38,901
the 

1472
02:13:40,356 --> 02:13:41,773
information. 
>> This are some of the 

1473
02:13:41,774 --> 02:13:45,841
functions you can find in the 
library. If you want more

information about each function 
you can go to the lead below.

Basically we need to import our 

1479
02:14:17,521 --> 02:14:19,521
library and [ Indiscernible ] to
allow us to start working with 

1480
02:14:20,985 --> 02:14:23,420
some options. Techniques that 
will give us all the techniques 

1481
02:14:23,621 --> 02:14:25,621
and 

1482
02:14:27,476 --> 02:14:29,709
ATT&CK . We have 535 techniques 
and before we continue we need 

1483
02:14:31,141 --> 02:14:33,141
to remove 

1484
02:14:36,010 --> 02:14:38,101
all the techniques so we have [ 
Indiscernible ] and at the end 

1485
02:14:38,253 --> 02:14:41,094
will start work and start 
explaining more about 

1486
02:14:46,101 --> 02:14:50,633
ATT&CK . Something else you can 
do the library is follow the 

1487
02:14:53,884 --> 02:14:55,884
same steps to import the 
libraries and start working with

1488
02:14:56,531 --> 02:14:58,531
the information. This is the 

1489
02:15:02,005 --> 02:15:04,201
first time we are translating 
the framework to Spanish. [

you things we

do not. 49% of the techniques do
not have data sources. If we

02:15:49,547 --> 02:15:51,580
display this information by 
matrix you can see that in the 

1500
02:15:51,781 --> 02:15:53,781
enterprise matrix we have one 
technique without data sources. 

1501
02:15:55,032 --> 02:15:57,032
Last year we had four techniques
so 

1502
02:16:01,458 --> 02:16:03,458
that means

1503
02:16:07,007 --> 02:16:09,442
[ Indiscernible ] attack and now
we have a more . Expect you can 

1504
02:16:09,656 --> 02:16:12,090
go back this weekend and started
working on that loan if you want

1505
02:16:12,290 --> 02:16:14,126
to contribute. Right there is 
the one you need. 

1506
02:16:14,127 --> 02:16:15,885
>> From a data source 
perspective [ Indiscernible ] [ 

1507
02:16:15,886 --> 02:16:17,886
Indiscernible - heavy accent ] 
is still our data 

1508
02:16:22,790 --> 02:16:24,790
sources that

1509
02:16:28,948 --> 02:16:30,948
core 

1510
02:16:32,602 --> 02:16:36,671
the framework. When we presented
the methodology to Matt ATT&CK 

1511
02:16:36,871 --> 02:16:40,523
data sources all the way to the 
event loss  for modeling data 

1512
02:16:40,938 --> 02:16:42,938
and 

1513
02:16:44,175 --> 02:16:46,175
documenting events we 

1514
02:16:49,598 --> 02:16:53,112
find relationships between a DAC
data sources and event logs and 

1515
02:16:53,327 --> 02:16:55,327
we start to call these 
relationship sub 

1516
02:16:58,401 --> 02:17:00,401
data sources. This allows us to 
start building 

1517
02:17:04,700 --> 02:17:06,700
a document which is a 

1518
02:17:08,554 --> 02:17:10,554
Google doc where we 

1519
02:17:13,428 --> 02:17:15,428
start documenting and modeling 
every event log we collected in 

1520
02:17:20,129 --> 02:17:22,579
our environment. You want to get
the file and learn more about it

1521
02:17:22,780 --> 02:17:24,780
you can find it at the 

1522
02:17:28,807 --> 02:17:33,743
link low. 
>> There is a lot more to do 

1523
02:17:33,943 --> 02:17:35,943
which is something we 

1524
02:17:38,617 --> 02:17:40,650
started noticing. Now we wanted 
to know what is triggering all 

1525
02:17:40,850 --> 02:17:42,884
of these events? What are the 
things we can do to 

1526
02:17:47,897 --> 02:17:49,897
start mapping

1527
02:17:58,526 --> 02:18:01,162
things to an event? Not just an 
event back to a data source but 

1528
02:18:01,362 --> 02:18:03,362
back to API. From a security 
perspective we started doing 

1529
02:18:03,397 --> 02:18:05,431
this graph where we would have 
events mapped to specific APIs 

1530
02:18:05,632 --> 02:18:07,663
which is cool to start thinking 
about data sources we are 

1531
02:18:07,865 --> 02:18:09,900
collecting after the simulation 
or how we can plan A potential 

1532
02:18:10,102 --> 02:18:12,132
simulation. This project started
the API to even project as part 

1533
02:18:12,333 --> 02:18:14,164
of the [ Indiscernible ] 
project. This does not cover 

1534
02:18:14,165 --> 02:18:16,165
everything but some APIs map 

1535
02:18:19,455 --> 02:18:26,155
to the Sysmon events. It was 
also cool to start 

1536
02:18:30,626 --> 02:18:32,243
mapping other events. 
>> Last year we started 

1537
02:18:32,244 --> 02:18:36,914
documenting and analyzing all 
the data from ATT&CK . We found 

1538
02:18:37,114 --> 02:18:39,114
a few opportunities to 
contribute back to the ATT&CK  

1539
02:18:42,003 --> 02:18:46,054
team since data sources are 
covered by other data sources to

1540
02:18:46,254 --> 02:18:49,306
the validation of event IDs 
recommended for ATT&CK data 

1541
02:18:52,156 --> 02:18:54,156
source.  What do we 

1542
02:18:57,025 --> 02:18:59,025
mean with the data sources 
covered by other 

1543
02:19:01,494 --> 02:19:05,579
data sources? This example you 
can see the 

1544
02:19:10,588 --> 02:19:12,588
technique. You

1545
02:22:04,929 --> 02:22:09,599
>> Next question, what do we do 
to validate the 

1546
02:22:14,600 --> 02:22:17,532
recommended sources? We can 
start doing simulations to map a

1547
02:22:17,733 --> 02:22:21,183
couple of things that get 
generated back to the data 

1548
02:22:21,384 --> 02:22:23,384
sources. We go beyond 

1549
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,508
this testing your ABR 
triggering. We are talking about

1550
02:22:29,708 --> 02:22:31,743
learning about the adversary and
trying to map data sources to 

1551
02:22:31,943 --> 02:22:33,943
specific actions and 

1552
02:22:37,367 --> 02:22:39,367
to validate the analytics you 
are already paying for or 

1553
02:22:39,465 --> 02:22:41,465
getting automatically. This 
might be familiar for some 

1554
02:22:45,882 --> 02:22:47,882
of you.

1555
02:22:51,239 --> 02:22:54,293
Got away into youth accountable 
documenting what it is that 

1556
02:22:54,621 --> 02:22:56,621
happened. If we apply this on 
registry 

1557
02:22:59,779 --> 02:23:01,597
for example MITRE ATT&CK 
provides a lot of information 

1558
02:23:01,598 --> 02:23:03,598
you can start using to getting 

1559
02:23:07,616 --> 02:23:10,535
prepared.  There is a lot of 
things you need to do besides 

1560
02:23:10,749 --> 02:23:12,985
that. The policies you need to 
enable to make sure you have 

1561
02:23:13,182 --> 02:23:15,182
settings enabled as well. And if
you're talking about Windows 

1562
02:23:15,216 --> 02:23:17,035
registry especially in security 
event logs you cannot just 

1563
02:23:17,036 --> 02:23:19,887
enable him expect every registry
to trigger. You have to create 

1564
02:23:20,088 --> 02:23:22,123
auto rules for everything you're

1565
02:23:27,131 --> 02:23:29,431
interested in. What it is we are
looking for credentials in 

1566
02:23:29,633 --> 02:23:37,555
registry. Let's focus on the 
default automatic logon where 

1567
02:23:37,760 --> 02:23:39,760
you use three commands 

1568
02:23:41,823 --> 02:23:43,823
to enable a user with specific 
credentials to automatically log

1569
02:23:43,856 --> 02:23:49,133
on to your system. How do you 
save a auto rule for this? There

1570
02:23:49,334 --> 02:23:51,334
is a project we've 

1571
02:23:54,418 --> 02:23:56,854
been together. Use these data on
a roll function to set up the 

1572
02:23:57,054 --> 02:23:59,054
monetary 

1573
02:24:01,726 --> 02:24:03,556
rule for a query for that 
specific register. Commands, 

1574
02:24:03,557 --> 02:24:07,011
this was straight from the MITRE
ATT&CK framework . You have 

1575
02:24:07,212 --> 02:24:12,292
people telling you to cover more
of that. We need to have at 

1576
02:24:17,303 --> 02:24:21,634
least three. If you feel you're 
being advanced let's do she's 

1577
02:24:21,835 --> 02:24:27,737
sharp and Python. A does not 
change the behavior but market 

1578
02:24:32,741 --> 02:24:37,311
as variation. We are ready? Not 
yet we have to standardize 

1579
02:24:37,479 --> 02:24:39,479
undocumented. If you do it it 
will 

1580
02:24:43,568 --> 02:24:45,568
not have [ 

1581
02:24:47,022 --> 02:24:49,022
Indiscernible ] you generated 
and ready to start 

1582
02:24:53,241 --> 02:25:00,233
validating analytics. Then you 
start freaking out. The reality 

1583
02:25:00,433 --> 02:25:05,307
is the process will have 
specific events that show up. If

1584
02:25:05,508 --> 02:25:07,544
it does not matter if it is 
Python, 

1585
02:25:10,797 --> 02:25:14,048
or commands it will pretty much 
generate a lot of the data 

1586
02:25:14,249 --> 02:25:17,266
sources that MITRE ATT&CK  

1587
02:25:21,894 --> 02:25:23,894
recommends.

1588
02:25:28,260 --> 02:25:31,099
If we can start validating but 
it is the technique is 

1589
02:25:31,313 --> 02:25:33,313
recommending 

1590
02:25:34,552 --> 02:25:37,401
for us, it does a great job of 
telling you that you need 

1591
02:25:37,602 --> 02:25:39,602
Windows 

1592
02:25:41,053 --> 02:25:43,286
registry but MITRE is also 
something you can do on top of 

1593
02:25:43,500 --> 02:25:45,735
that to start validating  what 
you need from a Windows registry

1594
02:25:45,883 --> 02:25:47,883
[ 

1595
02:25:49,991 --> 02:25:51,006
Indiscernible ] 
>> We started finding 

1596
02:25:51,007 --> 02:25:53,007
opportunities where there is a 
lot of things we need 

1597
02:25:56,697 --> 02:25:59,131
to do. At the end of the day we 
are generating similar data. 

1598
02:25:59,332 --> 02:26:03,399
There is a lot of people doing 
this in the world. A lot of 

1599
02:26:03,600 --> 02:26:05,600
teams. Everyone doing the 

1600
02:26:08,069 --> 02:26:10,305
same things. There are a lot of 
things happening but we keep 

1601
02:26:10,507 --> 02:26:12,507
generating the 

1602
02:26:13,959 --> 02:26:17,824
same data. Right, so what if we 
can share our data sets? Grab it

1603
02:26:17,993 --> 02:26:22,083
and share with anyone else, at 
the end of the day we can take a

1604
02:26:22,297 --> 02:26:28,184
lot of teams that do not have 
people that have the expertise 

1605
02:26:28,384 --> 02:26:33,004
and ready to jump in data 
analysis so you can do [ 

1606
02:26:37,867 --> 02:26:39,867
Indiscernible ] 

1607
02:26:50,122 --> 02:26:52,122
everything comes with a lot 

1608
02:26:54,791 --> 02:26:57,225
of documentation. I believe this
is key. I want you to know why 

1609
02:26:57,426 --> 02:27:00,077
certain events trigger. I just 
want to give you a document and 

1610
02:27:00,277 --> 02:27:02,277
say 

1611
02:27:04,950 --> 02:27:07,183
good luck. There is actually a 
lot going on that you need 

1612
02:27:12,196 --> 02:27:14,196
to understand

1613
02:27:34,607 --> 02:27:37,041
we take all this data and send 
it to a collector and collect 

1614
02:27:37,242 --> 02:27:41,311
the data and send it back and we
can use the start to collect the

1615
02:27:43,332 --> 02:27:45,332
data online. We have 

1616
02:27:48,963 --> 02:27:50,963
nether environment

1617
02:27:56,544 --> 02:28:01,828
thank you, Ruben, you can tell 
the implant input. They 

1618
02:28:05,682 --> 02:28:09,135
enable providers and they 
subscribe to those providers and

1619
02:28:09,335 --> 02:28:11,335
then 

1620
02:28:12,587 --> 02:28:14,587
a collects in your writing 

1621
02:28:18,416 --> 02:28:22,748
me Tom. The specific channels 
for log is pretty much not set 

1622
02:28:22,949 --> 02:28:25,185
up and not meant to practically 
send events to the 

1623
02:28:29,655 --> 02:28:31,891
event log. We apply the same 
concept here. You may be asking 

1624
02:28:32,092 --> 02:28:34,092
yourself how do we collect 

1625
02:28:35,944 --> 02:28:37,978
the data? We use [ Indiscernible
] as a tool to import and 

1626
02:28:38,180 --> 02:28:40,180
extract data and send data back 
to 

1627
02:28:43,053 --> 02:28:45,902
a server. If you want to take a 
snapshot are you have to do is 

1628
02:28:46,103 --> 02:28:48,103
follow 

1629
02:28:49,356 --> 02:28:52,193
these commands. C is for 
consumer mode and batch ON is 

1630
02:28:56,259 --> 02:28:58,497
start collecting and I will show
you a video on how that 

1631
02:29:02,765 --> 02:29:04,765
actually happens. Several making
up everything to 

1632
02:29:07,836 --> 02:29:10,071
a file it is already putting 
everything to a file at the 

1633
02:29:10,271 --> 02:29:12,271
bottom. I just run 

1634
02:29:15,554 --> 02:29:17,588
a command, my credentials in 
registry command and at the end 

1635
02:29:17,788 --> 02:29:19,788
I can start validating that it 
would generate data 

1636
02:29:23,676 --> 02:29:26,124
as well. Now I can see the 
password in there. That is a 

1637
02:29:26,325 --> 02:29:29,777
successful testing of my 
specific simulation. If you go 

1638
02:29:29,977 --> 02:29:31,977
to 

1639
02:29:33,028 --> 02:29:35,028
the Mordor documentation you may
ask yourself 

1640
02:29:39,256 --> 02:29:41,256
is winning.

1641
02:29:45,221 --> 02:29:47,856
Gustaf is my dog and when he is 
his girlfriend. That is it. How 

1642
02:29:48,057 --> 02:29:51,115
do you get data back? Run a 
similar command with 

1643
02:29:54,145 --> 02:29:56,145
a -P four producer and 

1644
02:30:00,395 --> 02:30:05,318
a -L. Run these three commands 
and you will get every data set 

1645
02:30:05,531 --> 02:30:07,552
and it is a file format in your 
system. Simple 

1646
02:30:12,553 --> 02:30:16,084
as that. At the end of the day 
we went from spending a lot of 

1647
02:30:16,285 --> 02:30:18,520
time producing the data all the 
way to start analyzing the data 

1648
02:30:20,151 --> 02:30:22,151
and start validating our 
analytics. That is as 

1649
02:30:25,633 --> 02:30:29,905
easy it so you may be asking 
yourself what we do with this? I

1650
02:30:30,105 --> 02:30:32,743
have a lot of data and I'm 
anxious and I do not want know 

1651
02:30:32,945 --> 02:30:38,632
what to do. Mordor and Carlo 
together a little bit. You have 

1652
02:30:38,833 --> 02:30:40,833
specific analytics 

1653
02:30:43,916 --> 02:30:45,748
this one provided by Tony 
Lambert. You can start 

1654
02:30:45,749 --> 02:30:47,749
interactively using test manager
to get 

1655
02:30:50,013 --> 02:30:51,832
the memory contents of [ 
Indiscernible ] . You may ask 

1656
02:30:51,833 --> 02:30:53,833
yourself how you 

1657
02:30:57,255 --> 02:30:59,255
some light

1658
02:31:10,726 --> 02:31:14,390
. I did the minister logon and 
first I will check that I am in 

1659
02:31:14,591 --> 02:31:16,591
a RPT section and then I will 

1660
02:31:21,010 --> 02:31:24,748
start doing some opening of the 
task manager. I am very slow, 

1661
02:31:24,952 --> 02:31:30,437
sorry. I will right-click and 
dump file and that is pretty 

1662
02:31:35,451 --> 02:31:37,451
much it.

1663
02:31:55,823 --> 02:31:57,823
Car analytics gives you some 
analytics that you can start 

1664
02:31:57,856 --> 02:31:59,856
playing with. They provided 
these for 

1665
02:32:03,879 --> 02:32:05,879
file creation

1666
02:32:09,230 --> 02:32:13,899
? I love to use Jupiter 
notebooks. Just think about 

1667
02:32:14,099 --> 02:32:18,980
Jupiter notebooks as a file to 
save input output visualizations

1668
02:32:19,181 --> 02:32:23,249
and the notes. It will tell a 
story about 

1669
02:32:27,915 --> 02:32:30,351
your analytics. The way it works
is it has the kernel and client 

1670
02:32:30,551 --> 02:32:32,583
infrastructures where it gets 
input, evaluates the impact, and

1671
02:32:32,799 --> 02:32:36,036
get your data back. This is what
will look at as 

1672
02:32:41,037 --> 02:32:43,959
an architecture. The building 
about Jupiter is the kernel is 

1673
02:32:44,160 --> 02:32:46,405
not a rating system kernel it is
pretty much the analytics piece 

1674
02:32:46,607 --> 02:32:49,043
that will execute things. The 
beauty is you can 

1675
02:32:53,914 --> 02:32:55,948
have anything. It is just 
amazing. Why don't we take this 

1676
02:32:56,148 --> 02:33:00,214
and put it into a Jupiter 
notebook on the hunter's 

1677
02:33:00,416 --> 02:33:03,051
playbook. That is my dog by the 
way. I love 

1678
02:33:06,515 --> 02:33:09,350
my dog. We're going to use a 
library created by José that 

1679
02:33:09,552 --> 02:33:11,552
will allow 

1680
02:33:12,802 --> 02:33:14,802
statistical analysis. Just to 
let you know why we're using 

1681
02:33:14,836 --> 02:33:18,089
that in there, and the way it 
works is we will grab this 

1682
02:33:23,089 --> 02:33:25,089
specific notebook

1683
02:33:27,226 --> 02:33:29,226
. We have some tags and 
descriptions about the specific 

1684
02:33:29,260 --> 02:33:31,260
analytic that I would like to 
document. I want a 

1685
02:33:35,351 --> 02:33:37,383
specific format to tell you 
about the story of my analytic. 

1686
02:33:37,592 --> 02:33:39,617
Some data sources and data sets 
from Mordor I'm using to 

1687
02:33:39,818 --> 02:33:41,818
validate the analytic and the 
star now process processing the 

1688
02:33:41,852 --> 02:33:43,852
data set. You will have this 
notebook 

1689
02:33:46,733 --> 02:33:49,368
as well. Grab the data and put 
it in a way to start running 

1690
02:33:49,568 --> 02:33:53,837
queries. How I do this is I make

1691
02:33:58,849 --> 02:34:00,849
data now

1692
02:34:15,083 --> 02:34:19,021
. I have more analytics I can 
start running for example. 

1693
02:34:19,234 --> 02:34:21,234
Starting to do 

1694
02:34:24,646 --> 02:34:29,187
processing where I'm looking for
specific DLLs where the APIs 

1695
02:34:32,843 --> 02:34:34,843
are used. Pretty 

1696
02:34:38,254 --> 02:34:40,254
simple stuff.

1697
02:34:41,981 --> 02:34:43,981
You have extra to three 
analytics in the notebook where 

1698
02:34:44,015 --> 02:34:46,036
I can look for an example 
without task manager. Show me 

1699
02:34:47,872 --> 02:34:50,971
any binary it is actually 
affects. And I can join stuff.

1702
02:35:21,827 --> 02:35:24,785
>> I can actually see that 
someone is running an RDP 

1703
02:35:25,039 --> 02:35:31,233
session map to a process 
accessing with specific data. We

1704
02:35:31,468 --> 02:35:34,977
can see the results in there. So
this is cool. We 

1705
02:35:39,835 --> 02:35:42,482
took a dataset and started 
playing with it. We are building

1706
02:35:42,719 --> 02:35:45,935
a community around this. This is
the public channel that you can 

1707
02:35:46,175 --> 02:35:50,311
access and get a free and fight.
Something that I am doing is 

1708
02:35:50,545 --> 02:35:54,931
actually giving you a modern 
dataset and 

1709
02:35:59,738 --> 02:36:01,738
a notebook.

1710
02:36:11,184 --> 02:36:13,845
This is a project called binder.
It allows you to put together 

1711
02:36:14,080 --> 02:36:17,425
all of the services that at the 
end of the day what it does is 

1712
02:36:17,670 --> 02:36:19,842
creates an open infrastructure 
for you to use with Jupyter 

1713
02:36:20,076 --> 02:36:22,838
Notebook.  You can take the 
playbook and that is going to 

1714
02:36:23,081 --> 02:36:25,081
pretty much create your own 
Jupyter Notebook server and 

1715
02:36:25,271 --> 02:36:29,160
binder and you can use it.  We 
can pretty much do something 

1716
02:36:29,398 --> 02:36:33,811
like this. If you are streaming 
this right now, go to the 

1717
02:36:34,047 --> 02:36:36,653
playbook and scroll down and the
video starts. There 

1718
02:36:41,580 --> 02:36:43,580
you go.

1719
02:36:50,994 --> 02:36:57,896
Anyway, just go to the specific 
link in here and I don't see the

1720
02:36:58,135 --> 02:37:02,815
play. There will be a binder 
link and you click on it and it 

1721
02:37:03,052 --> 02:37:06,507
will pretty much stand up. And 
Jupyter  server,  Jupyter 

1722
02:37:06,742 --> 02:37:10,731
Notebook as well  and Mark the 
specific analytics mapped 

1723
02:37:14,758 --> 02:37:18,068
to attack. They will extend the 
analytics portion of that. You 

1724
02:37:18,309 --> 02:37:20,966
will be able to run all that 
together and pretty much a 

1725
02:37:21,218 --> 02:37:26,814
Jupyter Notebook  in the club. 
You can use them for free and 

1726
02:37:27,057 --> 02:37:30,410
the threat Hunter playbook has 
that. If you are live streaming 

1727
02:37:30,650 --> 02:37:36,199
click on it and you might break 
binder because her is a lot of 

1728
02:37:36,439 --> 02:37:40,915
people in there. We are doing 
this for the community. We love 

1729
02:37:41,152 --> 02:37:46,897
to empower the community. We 
want to do it together. All of 

1730
02:37:47,135 --> 02:37:49,973
the things that we build our 
open source. We will give it to 

1731
02:37:50,210 --> 02:37:54,134
people do it that don't have 

1732
02:37:58,972 --> 02:38:01,987
the resources. You can get all 
of these data sources and stuff 

1733
02:38:02,224 --> 02:38:04,224
going on for free through 

1734
02:38:07,307 --> 02:38:10,876
your browser. I can actually 
reach out to any part of the 

1735
02:38:11,121 --> 02:38:13,527
world to write the analytics and
validate what we are building 

1736
02:38:14,471 --> 02:38:16,916
with real-time queries and also 
data sources we build as well. 

1737
02:38:17,180 --> 02:38:19,358
These are all the references 
that we have. And before 

1738
02:38:19,594 --> 02:38:24,937
anything, thank you very much,

awesome slides. Awesome 

1753
02:39:27,189 --> 02:39:33,701
tweak here. They got me started 
with ATT&CK a couple years ago. 

1754
02:39:34,178 --> 02:39:37,152
They do some of the most 
interesting work. Super exciting

1755
02:39:37,391 --> 02:39:44,911
talk at ATT&CK.con . Lots of 
love on twitter for those folks.

1756
02:39:45,147 --> 02:39:48,083
As we continue with this theme, 
how do we write these analytics 

1757
02:39:48,326 --> 02:39:50,475
if we do not have all the data 
we wish 

1758
02:39:54,413 --> 02:39:57,299
we had? None of us have perfect 
visibility. If you look at the 

1759
02:39:57,536 --> 02:40:00,351
data sources you do have, you 
can start to prioritize. How do 

1760
02:40:00,599 --> 02:40:05,058
I get something for my buck? 
Going back to that theme of 

1761
02:40:05,305 --> 02:40:09,660
prioritization weather threat 
Intel or data sources that 

1762
02:40:09,896 --> 02:40:14,720
prioritization theme that we 
keep hearing. Please join me in

right. Thank 

1765
02:40:28,132 --> 02:40:31,183
you well. Thank you very much to
the entire team for having us 

1766
02:40:31,426 --> 02:40:33,426
here. It has been a super 

1767
02:40:36,455 --> 02:40:39,121
fun events just getting to know 
folks over the last couple of 

1768
02:40:39,363 --> 02:40:43,231
days and having good 
discussions. Following the last 

1769
02:40:43,470 --> 02:40:46,409
talk, this will be effectively 
like your freshman level 

1770
02:40:46,653 --> 02:40:53,322
introduction to data sources. 
The stuff you just saw will 

1771
02:40:53,708 --> 02:40:56,343
definitely be super useful for 
digging into a lot of things you

1772
02:40:56,583 --> 02:40:58,583
encounter and the really hard 
operational challenges that 

1773
02:40:58,715 --> 02:41:00,715
relate to 

1774
02:41:03,816 --> 02:41:05,816
data sources.

1775
02:41:10,989 --> 02:41:12,989
So, I'm Keith and nice to meet 

1776
02:41:17,222 --> 02:41:20,449
you all. By way of background 
introduction I've been at this 

1777
02:41:20,691 --> 02:41:22,691
for about 20 years in the 

1778
02:41:26,229 --> 02:41:28,550
security industry. As I was 
preparing for my talk this 

1779
02:41:28,790 --> 02:41:31,174
morning which means I was 
reading twitter, I came across a

1780
02:41:31,419 --> 02:41:34,086
tweet from Jeremiah Grossman who
is more useful to follow than I 

1781
02:41:34,324 --> 02:41:38,001
am or pretty much anyone else. 
He posed the question this 

1782
02:41:41,467 --> 02:41:43,867
morning which literally as I 
pulled up the app sitting there 

1783
02:41:44,108 --> 02:41:49,045
in front of me and it really 
resonated. He asked if there was

1784
02:41:49,293 --> 02:41:52,184
one thing you wish you knew like
a piece of advice and I'm 

1785
02:41:52,429 --> 02:41:54,429
paraphrasing, what 

1786
02:41:56,092 --> 02:41:59,431
was it? And he provided a couple
of answers of his own. One of 

1787
02:42:00,561 --> 02:42:04,775
those was to focus a little bit 
less on what is possible and 

1788
02:42:05,048 --> 02:42:09,085
really think through what is 
probable. And that really 

1789
02:42:09,469 --> 02:42:12,976
resonated. It is really easy 
particularly if you've done work

1790
02:42:13,212 --> 02:42:15,212
for the government or other 
places 

1791
02:42:19,369 --> 02:42:22,382
like that. You know what is 
possible. A lot of these things 

1792
02:42:22,622 --> 02:42:24,622
have become public knowledge 
now. We have a great 

1793
02:42:24,791 --> 02:42:27,366
appreciation for what really 
high again adversary tools and 

1794
02:42:27,602 --> 02:42:33,707
techniques look like. It is 
really easy to get mired in like

1795
02:42:33,951 --> 02:42:35,951
okay, if I go do 

1796
02:42:38,136 --> 02:42:40,793
these things, there is someone 
that will still beat me. If that

1797
02:42:41,167 --> 02:42:43,685
is your threat model, you can 
rest assured that someone will 

1798
02:42:43,926 --> 02:42:47,073
always beat you. Just tried to 
think through how to get 

1799
02:42:47,318 --> 02:42:51,586
started. When I thought about 
what we are here to talk about 

1800
02:42:51,823 --> 02:42:55,809
and learn and share, a lot of it
just for the 

1801
02:42:59,074 --> 02:43:01,828
little bit of context as we've 
gone through the last couple of 

1802
02:43:02,088 --> 02:43:05,809
years trying to build a 
community around 

1803
02:43:09,628 --> 02:43:15,591
ATT&CK.  Trying to think through
how do we take this massive body

1804
02:43:15,829 --> 02:43:18,902
of knowledge and make it 
approachable for people. How do 

1805
02:43:19,137 --> 02:43:23,767
we figure out how to get 
started? More so than anything 

1806
02:43:24,028 --> 02:43:27,884
else the subtext behind this and
I think the point of the next 20

1807
02:43:28,121 --> 02:43:34,411
or so minutes, it is for people 
trying to figure out how to get 

1808
02:43:34,649 --> 02:43:37,061
started. How do you take this 
body of knowledge we have 

1809
02:43:37,299 --> 02:43:44,282
compiled like describing things 
that ATT&CK want  and how do you

1810
02:43:44,532 --> 02:43:49,294
dip your toe in and what is one 
of the first things you can do. 

1811
02:43:49,533 --> 02:43:53,539
Thinking through this in the 
context of the text 

1812
02:43:56,548 --> 02:44:00,495
in engineering which is not the 
focus of the talk, but is an 

1813
02:44:00,733 --> 02:44:06,342
interesting way to think through
how you go from data sources to 

1814
02:44:06,577 --> 02:44:10,375
protection. You have three 
things you need to do. Make sure

1815
02:44:10,926 --> 02:44:13,338
you are collecting the right 
data. Having worked for many of 

1816
02:44:14,221 --> 02:44:16,524
these decades for a couple of 
decades now alongside folks 

1817
02:44:16,760 --> 02:44:20,120
doing really great forensics 
work in addition to security 

1818
02:44:20,359 --> 02:44:22,359
operations and 

1819
02:44:25,533 --> 02:44:30,424
other things like a principal or
a phrase that is stuck with me 

1820
02:44:30,660 --> 02:44:33,285
is, you cannot go back in town 
to collect evidence. I see 

1821
02:44:33,523 --> 02:44:36,576
Richard sitting out here who is 
a pioneer of thinking. Not 

1822
02:44:36,818 --> 02:44:40,704
waiting until you need data to 
go and try to find it. Collect 

1823
02:44:40,945 --> 02:44:44,342
as much as you can as early as 
you can. There is a balance you 

1824
02:44:44,583 --> 02:44:49,471
have to strike. Once you collect
the data you need to ask the 

1825
02:44:51,601 --> 02:44:53,979
right questions. This is the 
work we are doing inside of 

1826
02:44:54,220 --> 02:44:58,072
ATT&CK and it is valuable.  What
questions might I need to ask. 

1827
02:44:58,348 --> 02:45:03,693
What are the things that 
adversaries are going to do so I

1828
02:45:03,928 --> 02:45:06,222
can formulate questions for my 
dataset and then answer those 

1829
02:45:06,461 --> 02:45:08,461
questions. If you 

1830
02:45:10,904 --> 02:45:14,461
ever purchased a product in turn
the detection to 11 and then you

1831
02:45:14,697 --> 02:45:16,697
turn on the 

1832
02:45:18,955 --> 02:45:20,955
MITRE 

1833
02:45:23,697 --> 02:45:25,641
ATT&CK feed, you've got 
exceptional visibility but now 

1834
02:45:25,642 --> 02:45:28,296
you've got 10,000 questions that
you need to go answer. For most 

1835
02:45:29,057 --> 02:45:31,057
teams that's not achievable 
either.  So striking some 

1836
02:45:31,240 --> 02:45:34,317
balance,  what does this have to
do with ATT&CK?  Heat maps, 

1837
02:45:34,551 --> 02:45:36,551
there's a lot of fixation on 

1838
02:45:40,286 --> 02:45:43,240
measuring detection if we have 
proved anything in the industry 

1839
02:45:43,478 --> 02:45:46,038
at least for as long as I've 
been in there, objectively 

1840
02:45:46,285 --> 02:45:48,860
measuring detection protection 
prevention or however you want 

1841
02:45:49,098 --> 02:45:51,098
to think about it is 

1842
02:45:54,706 --> 02:45:56,785
exceptionally difficult. These 
things are very context based 

1843
02:45:57,036 --> 02:45:59,288
and detecting a thing or 
observing a thing or one 

1844
02:45:59,527 --> 02:46:01,600
environment doesn't correlate in
terms of scope impact severity 

1845
02:46:01,836 --> 02:46:06,385
when you look across the whole 
bunch of them. We love to fixate

1846
02:46:06,630 --> 02:46:08,630
on building heat maps and things

1847
02:46:13,174 --> 02:46:19,192
like that and they are valuable 
for some purposes. It is easy to

1848
02:46:19,430 --> 02:46:21,851
skip over the fundamentals like 
am I collecting the right data. 

1849
02:46:22,106 --> 02:46:24,163
Especially if you're just 
getting started. Whether it is 

1850
02:46:24,419 --> 02:46:27,422
because you were new to the 
industry or because you are a 

1851
02:46:27,935 --> 02:46:29,935
team 

1852
02:46:32,291 --> 02:46:36,301
of one trying to build a 
security program and a company 

1853
02:46:36,545 --> 02:46:39,625
that doesn't have one and trying
to take that first step can be 

1854
02:46:43,659 --> 02:46:45,659
daunting. So

1855
02:46:49,822 --> 02:46:51,959
we cannot detect things that we 
cannot see. Observability comes 

1856
02:46:52,201 --> 02:46:54,623
before everything else. If you 
ask questions of your data and 

1857
02:46:54,873 --> 02:46:57,505
you answer those questions, if 
you don't have the right data to

1858
02:46:57,741 --> 02:46:59,741
begin with, everything else is 
moot. So these 

1859
02:47:02,957 --> 02:47:06,186
are useful for a couple of 
particular things. I think the 

1860
02:47:06,425 --> 02:47:09,321
two that I always come back to 
our being able to assign value 

1861
02:47:09,567 --> 02:47:11,567
objectively to data and 
therefore tools and solutions 

1862
02:47:11,758 --> 02:47:13,758
you implement. And then 
measuring progress 

1863
02:47:17,787 --> 02:47:23,765
and coverage. If there is one 
heat map to rule them all that I

1864
02:47:24,007 --> 02:47:26,617
think is exceptionally useful as
a way for people to think about 

1865
02:47:26,872 --> 02:47:29,190
how they are making progress in 
their program and whether 

1866
02:47:29,435 --> 02:47:31,340
they're spending money on 
solution implementation tools it

1867
02:47:31,341 --> 02:47:33,341
is that you want to 

1868
02:47:35,724 --> 02:47:40,430
make sure above all else 
coverage continues to improve in

1869
02:47:40,666 --> 02:47:43,106
a thoughtful way. Asking 
questions of data and 

1870
02:47:43,342 --> 02:47:45,342
operationalizing 

1871
02:47:47,910 --> 02:47:49,910
that coverage. It can be 
challenging to various degrees 

1872
02:47:50,081 --> 02:47:52,081
and at various points 

1873
02:47:55,346 --> 02:47:57,346
in time.

1874
02:47:59,085 --> 02:48:01,144
But making sure that you are 
thoughtfully collecting the 

1875
02:48:01,380 --> 02:48:03,817
right data and that you 
understand that cost and you 

1876
02:48:04,053 --> 02:48:06,011
understand those trade-offs 
first and foremost is very 

1877
02:48:06,012 --> 02:48:08,669
valuable. A couple of obligatory
nods. I will start with the ones

1878
02:48:08,907 --> 02:48:12,696
not listed. Tire team at red 
Canary who do most of the great 

1879
02:48:12,944 --> 02:48:17,403
work that guides my thinking. 
Olaf and the Rodriguez brothers.

1880
02:48:17,644 --> 02:48:22,857
A couple of things I have used 
like resources, people I have 

1881
02:48:23,223 --> 02:48:26,342
followed in work that I have 
enjoyed following overtime. 

1882
02:48:26,580 --> 02:48:31,634
Things that I used to help think
through other ways to look at or

1883
02:48:31,880 --> 02:48:35,455
value data sources. Obviously 
the ATT&CK 

1884
02:48:38,494 --> 02:48:42,627
team  for putting this all 
together. 

1885
02:48:42,628 --> 02:48:47,222
>> This seemed like a neat idea 
coming up with the title for 

1886
02:48:47,462 --> 02:48:53,983
this talk months ago. I am back 
to having to find this thing. 

1887
02:48:54,220 --> 02:48:59,001
This is an open ended concept. 
This is not the point of the 

1888
02:48:59,278 --> 02:49:01,908
talk. Going back to how you get 
started and the context of 

1889
02:49:02,143 --> 02:49:05,800
Jeremiahs question and the 
answer he provided this morning,

1890
02:49:06,172 --> 02:49:10,986
it is being in opposition to 
detect most threats most of the 

1891
02:49:11,235 --> 02:49:14,769
time. This is not where your 
program wants to wind up. I am 

1892
02:49:15,029 --> 02:49:18,814
not suggesting you go try to 
figure out how to detect things 

1893
02:49:19,103 --> 02:49:23,753
and then declare victory. This 
is a really useful way to get 

1894
02:49:23,994 --> 02:49:25,994
started. It is 

1895
02:49:28,260 --> 02:49:30,551
a useful forcing function for 
building a solid foundation for 

1896
02:49:33,545 --> 02:49:35,545
your program. Extending that a 
little bit like a 

1897
02:49:40,176 --> 02:49:43,442
few principals I wanted to lay 
out as we talk through some of 

1898
02:49:43,683 --> 02:49:45,871
the more mechanical pieces of 
this these three things are 

1899
02:49:50,126 --> 02:49:54,270
the guides that I keep in my 
brain all the time and the words

1900
02:49:54,508 --> 02:49:57,701
I try to remind myself as I am 
thinking through. We need to go 

1901
02:49:57,949 --> 02:50:02,341
off and do this thing. It does, 
does it maximize coverage? 

1902
02:50:02,578 --> 02:50:05,465
Thinking through the one heat 
map I come back to in my brain, 

1903
02:50:05,725 --> 02:50:09,650
do I have visibility into a 
greater percentage of techniques

1904
02:50:09,894 --> 02:50:13,533
than I did yesterday from an 
engineering perspective? 

1905
02:50:18,366 --> 02:50:23,487
Minimize complexity. This is 
probably not the talk for those 

1906
02:50:23,857 --> 02:50:26,721
of you working at an institution
that has a huge team and 100 

1907
02:50:26,976 --> 02:50:29,856
tools. This is the talk for 
those of you who have a small 

1908
02:50:30,094 --> 02:50:32,731
team, you're under resourced and
trying to figure out how to take

1909
02:50:32,969 --> 02:50:37,726
that first step and build a 
solid foundation and built great

1910
02:50:37,963 --> 02:50:41,378
momentum. And optimize for 
answers. At every step along the

1911
02:50:41,620 --> 02:50:43,620
way as you are starting to hoard

1912
02:50:46,264 --> 02:50:48,817
more data that is awesome. As 
you formulate analytics to apply

1913
02:50:49,060 --> 02:50:54,386
to that data which is a great 
exercise to go through, at the 

1914
02:50:54,625 --> 02:50:57,397
end of the day if there's a huge
gap between great analytic 

1915
02:50:57,635 --> 02:51:00,587
coverage and doing detection. 
You need to figure out which of 

1916
02:51:00,825 --> 02:51:03,346
those questions you have asked 
and those in guesstimate of 

1917
02:51:06,982 --> 02:51:09,570
leads you've which of those 
matter? There might be 100 that 

1918
02:51:09,823 --> 02:51:11,823
matter and 10 

1919
02:51:14,632 --> 02:51:16,632
of that

1920
02:51:18,554 --> 02:51:21,220
matter more than the rest. You 
had better get good at figuring 

1921
02:51:21,462 --> 02:51:24,829
out how to get from point a to 
point B if you want to achieve 

1922
02:51:25,062 --> 02:51:27,062
good outcomes. So keep these 

1923
02:51:29,846 --> 02:51:33,122
in mind. So we have glanced over
the slide and think about the 

1924
02:51:33,361 --> 02:51:35,361
data sources as the linchpin. 
Without these, everything else 

1925
02:51:35,575 --> 02:51:37,921
we want to do is kind of like a 

1926
02:51:42,863 --> 02:51:44,863
secondary discussion.

1927
02:51:49,388 --> 02:51:52,324
I had to jam these in at the 
last minute and these continue 

1928
02:51:52,560 --> 02:51:54,930
to change every time as the 
Rodriguez brothers were giving 

1929
02:51:55,168 --> 02:51:58,119
their talk I had a moment of 
panic that I got the numbers 

1930
02:51:58,358 --> 02:52:01,509
wrong. It turns out today I'm 
only up I want. 48 hours or 72 

1931
02:52:01,748 --> 02:52:05,270
hours old. The numbers aside, 
there is great tools for going 

1932
02:52:05,513 --> 02:52:10,487
and interrogating this data. 59 
data sources and this is just an

1933
02:52:10,965 --> 02:52:15,366
enterprise attack that spanned 
the 266 tech makes I'm assuming 

1934
02:52:15,605 --> 02:52:19,052
the website is right and I'm 
not. Useful for understanding 

1935
02:52:19,290 --> 02:52:25,184
how we observe a given tech make
is the purpose. There 

1936
02:52:29,237 --> 02:52:31,237
are some once you get into this 

1937
02:52:35,482 --> 02:52:39,911
fantastic tools you can see in 
places like that are extremely 

1938
02:52:40,146 --> 02:52:43,077
useful. I was watching that talk
and those are the ways you want 

1939
02:52:43,316 --> 02:52:46,097
to address these once you get 
into operation. Do you need one 

1940
02:52:46,343 --> 02:52:48,764
or all data sources to properly 
observe the tech make? Windows 

1941
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
event logs are 

1942
02:52:53,753 --> 02:52:57,154
good examples. You may only need
one of the 10 data sources 

1943
02:52:57,387 --> 02:53:01,482
inside of your environment to 
observe that tech make in a way 

1944
02:53:01,725 --> 02:53:04,353
that informs you well enough to 
develop an analytic and get to 

1945
02:53:04,591 --> 02:53:07,066
an answer and perform detection.
They are not clearly defined. 

1946
02:53:07,305 --> 02:53:09,305
One of 

1947
02:53:12,428 --> 02:53:15,079
the principles is to minimize 
complexity and when you look at 

1948
02:53:15,315 --> 02:53:18,113
all of the work that goes into 
ATT&CK  refining and continuing 

1949
02:53:18,392 --> 02:53:23,059
to evolve this matrix M body of 
knowledge it is not super 

1950
02:53:23,297 --> 02:53:28,011
important we have these things 
perfectly defined. It is 

1951
02:53:28,247 --> 02:53:30,639
important that they are there 
and we think about them. Let's 

1952
02:53:30,879 --> 02:53:34,804
talk about where we start. There
are four ways, a progression 

1953
02:53:38,102 --> 02:53:43,010
I think I have at least gone say
which is been my mental journey 

1954
02:53:43,248 --> 02:53:46,591
and I know many folks on my team
and a few others I've talked to 

1955
02:53:47,451 --> 02:53:49,787
this week. These are the four 
steps that are high-level. 

1956
02:53:52,321 --> 02:53:54,836
Understand prevalent. Which 
things occur most often. Focus 

1957
02:53:55,081 --> 02:54:00,894
on the class of data or product.
If you're just getting started, 

1958
02:54:01,132 --> 02:54:05,724
maybe the decision is easier 
once you get further into your 

1959
02:54:05,960 --> 02:54:07,960
program. Now you were trying to 

1960
02:54:10,807 --> 02:54:13,357
close gaps. Your decision the 
first time you go through this 

1961
02:54:13,600 --> 02:54:15,600
process may be completely 
different from the decision are 

1962
02:54:15,759 --> 02:54:18,927
the conclusions are the waiting 
you assigned to these data 

1963
02:54:19,169 --> 02:54:24,900
sources the third or fourth 
time. That you differentiate and

1964
02:54:25,145 --> 02:54:28,343
you will overlay what we know 
and things we have heard and 

1965
02:54:28,579 --> 02:54:34,178
skip over the Intel parts of 
this. We have done a good job of

1966
02:54:34,682 --> 02:54:38,491
helping everyone understand why 
it is important we share 

1967
02:54:38,729 --> 02:54:42,655
operational data and insights so
whether you're just getting 

1968
02:54:42,898 --> 02:54:45,279
started are trying to close 
those gaps and go from 80% 

1969
02:54:50,143 --> 02:54:55,692
to 100%, where ever you are it's
important to overlay operational

1970
02:54:55,926 --> 02:54:58,319
context and understand how and 
why these things happen in the 

1971
02:54:59,142 --> 02:55:01,142
real world. Understanding 
prevalence 

1972
02:55:03,008 --> 02:55:08,090
is simple. This would not be a 
con talk if there wasn't a 

1973
02:55:12,357 --> 02:55:15,310
typo. So hunters forge. This is 
a little more superhero than it 

1974
02:55:15,545 --> 02:55:21,191
is Lord of the rings. At any 
rate, this tool is only 

1975
02:55:21,430 --> 02:55:26,062
providing this because it was a 
tool like came up with some 

1976
02:55:30,227 --> 02:55:32,900
time ago to answer some of these
questions for myself. I'm not 

1977
02:55:33,137 --> 02:55:36,756
going to spend any time on it. I
use it to make numbers. You need

1978
02:55:37,001 --> 02:55:43,506
to re-create those numbers. Top 
data sources by prevalence. I 

1979
02:55:43,749 --> 02:55:46,339
think there has already been a 
good bit of discussion about 

1980
02:55:46,585 --> 02:55:50,497
this but this is it. These are 
the top 10 data sources in the 

1981
02:55:53,178 --> 02:55:59,986
ATT&CK  dataset as it exists 
today or 72 hours ago. I am 

1982
02:56:00,227 --> 02:56:03,436
assuming they haven't changed 
much in that time. That is 

1983
02:56:07,192 --> 02:56:09,558
pretty straightforward. Let's 
think about how we take that and

1984
02:56:09,801 --> 02:56:12,525
focus on data or product. I 
tried to group these data 

1985
02:56:12,760 --> 02:56:15,350
sources based on the types 

1986
02:56:18,776 --> 02:56:21,116
of devices collection platforms 
that they will come from. You've

1987
02:56:24,863 --> 02:56:27,266
got some end point, network, 
some things that can come from 

1988
02:56:27,508 --> 02:56:32,383
either like net flow and stuff 
like that and that is down to 

1989
02:56:32,627 --> 02:56:37,869
what type of coverage hereafter.
We have cloud as of a few days 

1990
02:56:38,112 --> 02:56:40,989
ago which is now screwing up all
the numbers I put together for 

1991
02:56:43,352 --> 02:56:46,281
this deck. So then you have mail
server logs and Web server log 

1992
02:56:46,523 --> 02:56:48,609
specific to types of 
applications and they are 

1993
02:56:50,054 --> 02:56:52,054
materially useful depending on 
the techniques you 

1994
02:56:56,282 --> 02:56:58,282
care about.

1995
02:57:01,631 --> 02:57:04,246
Taking those in understanding at
a high level what types of 

1996
02:57:04,498 --> 02:57:07,729
things am I going to collect 
data from so that I know what 

1997
02:57:07,998 --> 02:57:10,695
solutions I need to move this 
needle for work. If you just 

1998
02:57:10,938 --> 02:57:14,254
take that top 10 that I showed 
you and look at where those come

1999
02:57:14,497 --> 02:57:19,722
from now it becomes a little bit
more clear. It will come as no 

2000
02:57:19,956 --> 02:57:22,796
surprise to any of you although 
having spent most of my career 

2001
02:57:23,059 --> 02:57:25,747
like packet monkey went most of 
my time working with them 

2002
02:57:29,052 --> 02:57:31,447
point data. This is not a 
suggestion that you should do 

2003
02:57:31,705 --> 02:57:34,571
one or the other. Again thinking
through how you start to make 

2004
02:57:34,810 --> 02:57:39,551
the next step forward. Let's 
assume for sake of argument that

2005
02:57:39,790 --> 02:57:41,790
you are digging in to closing 

2006
02:57:45,425 --> 02:57:49,411
this 80%. Now you've got to 
differentiate within a class of 

2007
02:57:49,660 --> 02:57:52,080
product and this is where things
get interesting. You need some 

2008
02:57:52,328 --> 02:57:57,493
data from your end points and 
what the heck do you do? You've 

2009
02:57:57,731 --> 02:57:59,731
got a couple of 

2010
02:58:01,764 --> 02:58:04,198
solutions here. This is always 
like a super interesting 

2011
02:58:04,437 --> 02:58:07,649
conversation to have with folks 
that are trying to implement an 

2012
02:58:07,891 --> 02:58:12,787
endpoint for the first time. 
Which of the things available to

2013
02:58:13,031 --> 02:58:16,787
you do you start with? There are
tons of choices. Open source 

2014
02:58:17,040 --> 02:58:23,918
stuff, you've got all of these 
providers and you've got a 

2015
02:58:24,159 --> 02:58:27,467
variety of ways. And then you've
got commercial products. In 

2016
02:58:29,992 --> 02:58:32,524
thinking through how to process 
that for purposes of making an 

2017
02:58:37,439 --> 02:58:40,093
initial decision, you have found
it useful to bucket them into 

2018
02:58:40,335 --> 02:58:45,026
one of two categories. There are
solutions that are visibility 

2019
02:58:45,268 --> 02:58:47,664
first meeting that they are 
optimized for collecting data 

2020
02:58:47,902 --> 02:58:52,589
consistently and these data 
types filled in are optimized 

2021
02:58:52,830 --> 02:58:54,830
for collecting that data all 

2022
02:58:57,218 --> 02:59:01,073
the time. On the other side of 
that you have protection for 

2023
02:59:01,309 --> 02:59:04,119
solutions. These are things that
their first job is to defend the

2024
02:59:04,357 --> 02:59:08,197
endpoint and they also try to 
accounts for collection of data 

2025
02:59:08,436 --> 02:59:11,226
that's useful for hunting an 
investigation and things like 

2026
02:59:11,996 --> 02:59:13,996
that. Their 

2027
02:59:16,628 --> 02:59:20,238
primary purpose is to prevent 
bad things from happening first 

2028
02:59:20,481 --> 02:59:23,002
and foremost and then they are 
fulfilling these investigative 

2029
02:59:23,371 --> 02:59:25,371
detection use cases secondarily.

2030
02:59:30,256 --> 02:59:32,256
And so,

2031
02:59:34,284 --> 02:59:36,980
that is cute. It is a neat 
picture. You've got to figure 

2032
02:59:37,217 --> 02:59:39,866
out that the point of this is 
putting some data behind this. 

2033
02:59:40,104 --> 02:59:43,556
To give you a basis for making a
decision. The way I ended up 

2034
02:59:43,798 --> 02:59:47,883
doing this was just to say for a
visibility solution which could 

2035
02:59:48,155 --> 02:59:50,155
be a commercial solution or 

2036
02:59:52,464 --> 02:59:55,282
something like where you take 
the thing you already have in a 

2037
02:59:55,518 --> 02:59:59,026
Windows environment and flip it 
on. Enumerate the datatypes that

2038
02:59:59,366 --> 03:00:01,366
are 

2039
03:00:02,618 --> 03:00:06,700
collected always from most of 
the products or solutions in 

2040
03:00:06,941 --> 03:00:11,020
those buckets. You can see here 
for visibility solutions open 

2041
03:00:11,264 --> 03:00:16,151
source or commercial these tend 
to be the datatypes that you're 

2042
03:00:16,395 --> 03:00:21,262
going to get very consistently 
assuming you do not monkey with 

2043
03:00:21,506 --> 03:00:23,858
the configuration. On the 
protection side, if you 

2044
03:00:28,739 --> 03:00:30,739
think about

2045
03:00:33,892 --> 03:00:36,524
the data sources at the top of 
the list, they very clearly 

2046
03:00:36,770 --> 03:00:39,820
optimize for collecting those 
all of the time and you will get

2047
03:00:40,063 --> 03:00:43,512
other types of data from them 
but you will get it selectively.

2048
03:00:43,751 --> 03:00:46,381
Those agents will try to decide 
when a process or behavior is 

2049
03:00:46,619 --> 03:00:48,792
interesting and then provide you
with additional data in those 

2050
03:00:49,030 --> 03:00:54,076
cases. This tool makes it easy 
to measure this in some way. If 

2051
03:00:54,314 --> 03:00:56,645
you take those sources 
effectively for protection 

2052
03:01:00,312 --> 03:01:04,766
meaning effectively any product 
to purchase to do endpoint 

2053
03:01:05,011 --> 03:01:07,409
protection that also does data 
collection is going to give you 

2054
03:01:07,655 --> 03:01:09,734
process monitoring and 
commandline monitoring. Those 

2055
03:01:09,975 --> 03:01:16,287
are the two elements and that 
gets you 70%. That is pretty 

2056
03:01:16,532 --> 03:01:21,698
good from going from nothing to 
something and being able to 

2057
03:01:21,958 --> 03:01:25,127
cover down on 70% just by 
throwing almost any product out 

2058
03:01:25,360 --> 03:01:29,549
there that attempts to meet 
these use cases is super 

2059
03:01:29,784 --> 03:01:33,993
valuable. This is not product 
talk but it gets you up over 80 

2060
03:01:34,234 --> 03:01:40,228
and that is awesome. For the 
first time a few days ago I 

2061
03:01:40,462 --> 03:01:44,889
thought I would take a look at 
the modular in the data sources 

2062
03:01:45,132 --> 03:01:47,132
are provides consistently which 
is 

2063
03:01:49,869 --> 03:01:52,799
85% almost. For something that 
will cost you nothing. Other 

2064
03:01:53,046 --> 03:01:55,046
than just your time to turn 

2065
03:01:57,789 --> 03:01:59,961
it on and again we're not 
talking about building analytics

2066
03:02:00,423 --> 03:02:03,252
or operations or the in state of
detection. We are trying to 

2067
03:02:04,491 --> 03:02:06,491
figure out what moves the needle
on 

2068
03:02:10,990 --> 03:02:14,684
collecting data that the attack 
matrix says might be useful. 

2069
03:02:15,080 --> 03:02:17,020
Observations and putting 
ourselves in a position to 

2070
03:02:17,021 --> 03:02:23,967
observe the things that matter. 
So again, we are three quarters 

2071
03:02:24,201 --> 03:02:28,456
of the way through this. The 
last piece you have heard a lot 

2072
03:02:28,700 --> 03:02:30,700
about. That is overlaying the 

2073
03:02:33,743 --> 03:02:36,354
operational context. While it is
need to build a great foundation

2074
03:02:36,598 --> 03:02:40,272
and now you are collecting the 
right data and while it is neat 

2075
03:02:40,520 --> 03:02:43,556
to have some objective basis for
assigning value to that data or 

2076
03:02:43,793 --> 03:02:48,604
make an implementation decision,
now you've got to take advantage

2077
03:02:48,852 --> 03:02:51,021
of the things that we have 
learned from putting this 

2078
03:02:55,186 --> 03:02:59,652
into practice and for the folks 
that are built analytics on top 

2079
03:02:59,890 --> 03:03:02,366
of this and have gone from 
asking thousands of questions of

2080
03:03:02,603 --> 03:03:04,777
this dataset to finding a 
handful of things that matter 

2081
03:03:05,012 --> 03:03:08,705
and you need to respond to. Like
taking that operational context 

2082
03:03:08,940 --> 03:03:10,940
and overlaying it. 

2083
03:03:13,549 --> 03:03:15,969
This is the top 10 from a report
last year. It 

2084
03:03:20,783 --> 03:03:25,660
is showing having a team that 
has built thousands of analytics

2085
03:03:25,902 --> 03:03:28,102
and looking at those things and 
answering those questions. It's 

2086
03:03:28,342 --> 03:03:31,753
a bad? Is it not? And escalating
it to an enterprise where they 

2087
03:03:31,996 --> 03:03:36,607
can respond. These are the top 
10 based on prevalence. When you

2088
03:03:36,841 --> 03:03:39,886
apply this you take it and 
overlaying it with the data 

2089
03:03:40,124 --> 03:03:44,684
source prevalence information. 
You can start to make some of 

2090
03:03:44,927 --> 03:03:47,270
those hard decisions with 
respect to features or 

2091
03:03:47,525 --> 03:03:54,372
functionality of tools. Because 
you can't afford to collect 

2092
03:03:54,761 --> 03:03:57,179
everything. Not everyone could 
just turn it on and assume you 

2093
03:03:57,417 --> 03:04:01,975
can operationalize that. You are
going to make trade-offs. 

2094
03:04:02,221 --> 03:04:05,987
Security and risk management 
welcome to a career of making 

2095
03:04:06,234 --> 03:04:11,724
trade-offs. Super exciting and a
great thought exercise. Again, 

2096
03:04:11,962 --> 03:04:13,962
just taking 

2097
03:04:16,107 --> 03:04:18,954
this stuff and thinking through 
how and when you would overlay 

2098
03:04:19,198 --> 03:04:23,673
that in your decision-making 
process. You can look at trends 

2099
03:04:23,919 --> 03:04:26,570
I think it was asked indirectly 
ever doing that again and of 

2100
03:04:26,953 --> 03:04:30,740
course we are. This is an 
interesting way to think about 

2101
03:04:30,975 --> 03:04:33,847
those and more so than anything 
else now that MITRE 

2102
03:04:38,045 --> 03:04:40,368
is  collecting sightings that at
this is why this 

2103
03:04:44,888 --> 03:04:46,888
becomes critical. Like 
prioritizing data sources and 

2104
03:04:46,973 --> 03:04:48,973
practice will be different for 

2105
03:04:52,474 --> 03:04:55,064
every enterprise. And how those 
trends change over time is going

2106
03:04:55,300 --> 03:04:57,300
to be different as an industry, 
enterprise, industry verticals 

2107
03:04:57,451 --> 03:05:02,063
and things like that. Power 
shows across the board. We 

2108
03:05:02,301 --> 03:05:07,818
continue to see that. And then 
you look at stuff like this 

2109
03:05:08,053 --> 03:05:10,184
which is interesting when you 
think about the implications of 

2110
03:05:10,428 --> 03:05:13,975
what you collect and how you use
it. Windows admin shares and 

2111
03:05:14,240 --> 03:05:18,336
remote file copy in the last 12 
months just like this. Does 

2112
03:05:18,571 --> 03:05:20,571
anybody know who to thank 

2113
03:05:23,139 --> 03:05:27,466
for that? It is the great 
destroyer of enterprise in the 

2114
03:05:27,719 --> 03:05:32,375
last 12 months. When you think 
about data sources and 

2115
03:05:33,292 --> 03:05:35,292
operationalizing those and 
prioritizing how 

2116
03:05:37,560 --> 03:05:40,107
you respond, these are the 
things that once you get over 

2117
03:05:40,349 --> 03:05:43,661
the hump of collecting the data 
you want, now you can start to 

2118
03:05:43,900 --> 03:05:47,927
take data from the community 
whether it's from reports from 

2119
03:05:48,328 --> 03:05:50,328
whomever but 

2120
03:05:53,339 --> 03:05:55,500
more importantly things that you
learn inside of these 

2121
03:05:55,736 --> 03:05:57,733
communities and by sharing 
information with one another 

2122
03:05:57,734 --> 03:06:03,562
here and elsewhere and applying 
that context. I walk into pretty

2123
03:06:03,822 --> 03:06:05,822
much every threat intelligence 
discussion with the position 

2124
03:06:06,209 --> 03:06:08,209
it's always 

2125
03:06:10,875 --> 03:06:12,875
phishing . Thousand attack 
techniques. How 

2126
03:06:16,160 --> 03:06:18,793
breaches happen and it is always
phishing which I realizing  I'm 

2127
03:06:23,401 --> 03:06:29,794
oversimplifies in. The important
take away is again reinforcing 

2128
03:06:30,048 --> 03:06:32,048
what you've heard. Everyone here

2129
03:06:35,792 --> 03:06:37,792
be thinking

2130
03:06:43,985 --> 03:06:46,481
whether it's on an individual 
basis in a slack community or 

2131
03:06:46,721 --> 03:06:48,860
wherever. If you are a large 
enterprise in a building 

2132
03:06:49,098 --> 03:06:51,729
analytics and have this data and
this resource and if you're a 

2133
03:06:51,965 --> 03:06:54,833
service provider very much like 
net MITRE, they have a way to do

2134
03:06:55,073 --> 03:06:59,019
this and maybe for the first 
time ever  we have a way to 

2135
03:06:59,254 --> 03:07:01,644
share useful threat intelligence
in a way that scales and does 

2136
03:07:01,881 --> 03:07:04,279
not betray privacy and things 
like that and concerns we have 

2137
03:07:04,545 --> 03:07:08,548
had when we try to 
overcomplicate share domains. 

2138
03:07:08,788 --> 03:07:10,788
Everyone be thinking about how 
you 

2139
03:07:13,231 --> 03:07:15,408
can contribute whether it is 
thinking about new ways to 

2140
03:07:15,649 --> 03:07:17,649
prioritize 

2141
03:07:19,931 --> 03:07:21,986
data sources, assign value, 
getting into the details of 

2142
03:07:22,231 --> 03:07:24,231
implementing a particular data 
source and the attribute of 

2143
03:07:24,420 --> 03:07:28,235
those that are interesting. 
Arches sharing operational data 

2144
03:07:28,473 --> 03:07:33,214
at a high level. What outcomes 
did you actually achieve? And 

2145
03:07:33,453 --> 03:07:35,881
getting back to principals and 
keeping 

2146
03:07:40,793 --> 03:07:42,793
the spirit

2147
03:07:44,921 --> 03:07:46,921
of this is maximizing coverage 
and minimize complexity when 

2148
03:07:47,071 --> 03:07:49,071
ever 

2149
03:07:51,761 --> 03:07:57,107
you can and keep optimizing for 
answers. A lot of the stuff 

2150
03:07:57,353 --> 03:07:59,985
you've seen over the course of 
the last few days and hopefully 

2151
03:08:00,221 --> 03:08:02,519
you can think about data 
collection and the value we 

2152
03:08:02,764 --> 03:08:05,670
assign to the data we collect is
a useful first step. That's it. 

2153
03:08:05,907 --> 03:08:08,115
Thank you very much. I 
appreciate it. 

2154
03:08:08,116 --> 03:08:11,942
>> [ Applause ] 
>> Awesome. Thank you so much, 

2155
03:08:12,184 --> 03:08:16,578
Keith. I'm sure Keith will stick
around at lunch shortly. Thank 

2156
03:08:16,819 --> 03:08:21,930
you so much for that talk. I was
struck by a lot of themes there.

2157
03:08:22,193 --> 03:08:27,914
We have been trying to help 
folks try to figure that out and

2158
03:08:28,163 --> 03:08:30,325
I appreciate the throw back to 
yesterday and the ATT&CK 

2159
03:08:30,561 --> 03:08:32,561
sightings we talked 

2160
03:08:35,841 --> 03:08:39,658
about . Folks on twitter 
appreciating the talk. A quarter

2161
03:08:39,895 --> 03:08:41,895
I 

2162
03:08:44,775 --> 03:08:48,985
really liked,  don't think about
what is possible, think about 

2163
03:08:49,222 --> 03:08:52,097
what is probable and that is the
focus the ATT&CK takes.  Folks 

2164
03:08:52,967 --> 03:08:54,967
on twitter, folks in Poland 

2165
03:08:58,795 --> 03:09:01,571
are watching live it is here. 
And Casey Smith are showing 

2166
03:09:01,811 --> 03:09:03,962
support for his friend Keith 
summarizing key points from that

2167
03:09:04,200 --> 03:09:06,200
talk. 

2168
03:09:08,603 --> 03:09:10,900
Minimize complexity what data do
you need to answer questions 

2169
03:09:11,149 --> 03:09:13,792
that are interesting to you and 
your team which to me sounds 

2170
03:09:14,030 --> 03:09:17,463
like Intel requirements. Thank 
you so much to Keith for that 

2171
03:09:17,700 --> 03:09:21,442
back to basics talk. It's my 
pleasure to introduce another 

2172
03:09:21,678 --> 03:09:23,678
one of the ATT&CK team 

2173
03:09:27,301 --> 03:09:29,696
members  who goes back to her 
theme from yesterday talking 

2174
03:09:29,935 --> 03:09:31,935
about controls with RCI 

2175
03:09:35,151 --> 03:09:37,792
yes talk. We focus on adversary 
emulation and he has a 

2176
03:09:42,462 --> 03:09:45,241
military background and will 
talk about the work he is done 

2177
03:09:45,482 --> 03:09:47,883
and community members to talk to
about taking these controls or 

2178
03:09:48,117 --> 03:09:52,398
mitigations and map that to 
these attack techniques. It is 

2179
03:09:52,631 --> 03:09:55,163
not always easy. A lot of 
different folks are doing this 

2180
03:09:55,408 --> 03:09:57,590
sometimes separately. So that 
they met brigade people who word

2181
03:09:57,831 --> 03:09:59,831
doing things in disparate 

2182
03:10:03,395 --> 03:10:05,395
ways together. Join me in 
introducing Mike 

2183
03:10:09,135 --> 03:10:10,345
long. 
>> [ Applause ] 

2184
03:10:10,346 --> 03:10:12,346
>> I will go ahead and 

2185
03:10:16,180 --> 03:10:18,730
get started. Thank you for the 
warm introduction. For everybody

2186
03:10:18,964 --> 03:10:21,110
else I'm grateful to be here and
share this information 

2187
03:10:24,370 --> 03:10:27,907
with you. Today I'm going to 
share an update on one of the 

2188
03:10:28,142 --> 03:10:30,780
many projects the ATT&CK team is
working on and supporting.  It 

2189
03:10:31,020 --> 03:10:32,443
involves mapping various 
information security control 

2190
03:10:32,444 --> 03:10:34,444
frameworks to ATT&CK tech  
exhibit 

2191
03:10:37,508 --> 03:10:42,976
gave years. We will provide an 
overview of this project and 

2192
03:10:43,221 --> 03:10:45,371
talk about specific challenges 
we are trying to address and 

2193
03:10:45,604 --> 03:10:48,271
share prototypes we've created 
and then show you some future 

2194
03:10:48,524 --> 03:10:52,812
goals and plans basically how we
want this project to go going 

2195
03:10:53,080 --> 03:10:56,432
forward. As I look at the clock 
it's not lost on me that I the 

2196
03:10:56,684 --> 03:10:59,431
last thing standing between you 
and a great lunch. I will keep 

2197
03:11:02,766 --> 03:11:04,476
this moving. 
>> Fundamentally what kick this 

2198
03:11:04,478 --> 03:11:07,153
off is the fact that many of the
organizations we support are 

2199
03:11:07,395 --> 03:11:12,959
required by policy, law or best 
practice to select and implement

2200
03:11:13,197 --> 03:11:15,197
information security controls 
documented in 

2201
03:11:18,807 --> 03:11:20,807
various publications. PCI, DSS, 
and 

2202
03:11:24,823 --> 03:11:27,493
of course our CIS controls. 
We've got all of these different

2203
03:11:27,760 --> 03:11:30,589
controls to provide guidance and
one of the commonalities is the 

2204
03:11:30,833 --> 03:11:35,045
mindset that when we are picking
controls or deciding how to 

2205
03:11:35,285 --> 03:11:37,285
configure and 

2206
03:11:39,327 --> 03:11:41,633
implement them, those decisions 
should be driven by knowledge of

2207
03:11:41,882 --> 03:11:43,305
the threats targeting our 
organizations and 

2208
03:11:43,306 --> 03:11:46,675
vulnerabilities found within. We
will talk about examples where 

2209
03:11:46,914 --> 03:11:48,914
ATT&CK can 

2210
03:11:52,043 --> 03:11:54,947
help.  Many organizations still 
experience similar challenges. 

2211
03:11:55,193 --> 03:11:58,884
Some of them are vast in scope. 
Estate hundred 53 would you 

2212
03:11:59,118 --> 03:12:01,118
expand 

2213
03:12:03,824 --> 03:12:05,824
the controls

2214
03:12:07,965 --> 03:12:09,874
implementations and enhancements
you're left with thousands of 

2215
03:12:09,875 --> 03:12:12,547
controls. It is easy for people 
to ask which control should I 

2216
03:12:12,782 --> 03:12:15,286
select and wife. I have seen 
organizations that elect for the

2217
03:12:19,476 --> 03:12:21,476
brute force

2218
03:12:23,204 --> 03:12:25,735
method. They are fortified but 
at what cost? We have other 

2219
03:12:25,977 --> 03:12:28,457
organizations that have been 
dealing with these controls long

2220
03:12:28,695 --> 03:12:31,092
before ATT&CK existed . They are
wondering how do we better 

2221
03:12:31,326 --> 03:12:35,845
integrate ATT&CK to processes 
and technologies.  These are 

2222
03:12:36,082 --> 03:12:38,934
problems we have been focusing 
on and we have talked to a lot 

2223
03:12:39,173 --> 03:12:41,173
of organizations taking the 
initiative and they are making 

2224
03:12:41,368 --> 03:12:43,529
their own attack control 
mappings. We will show you some 

2225
03:12:43,773 --> 03:12:47,381
of the cool use cases you can 
derive from 

2226
03:12:51,961 --> 03:12:54,998
these mappings. The questions 
for us as the ATT&CK team is how

2227
03:12:55,233 --> 03:12:58,277
we curate these mappings so we 
can make them available  to the 

2228
03:12:58,514 --> 03:13:02,703
Global cyber security community?
That is the premise behind this 

2229
03:13:02,938 --> 03:13:07,713
project and we will show you 
different prototype mappings we 

2230
03:13:07,961 --> 03:13:10,096
have made along the way and 
challenges we have encountered 

2231
03:13:10,338 --> 03:13:12,464
and how we hope to address them 
going forward. 

2232
03:13:12,465 --> 03:13:15,105
>> We will start by showing an 
example. We talked about these 

2233
03:13:16,822 --> 03:13:20,476
mappings but what do they look 
like and how might they be 

2234
03:13:20,712 --> 03:13:22,872
helpful? This is an excerpt 
taken from a prototype mapping 

2235
03:13:23,726 --> 03:13:25,726
we mad, made for strategies to 

2236
03:13:28,407 --> 03:13:30,688
attack tactics. You will notice 
the mapping values were derived 

2237
03:13:33,894 --> 03:13:35,894
from 

2238
03:13:37,948 --> 03:13:42,407
the nest. We can make useful 
analysis. You might start by 

2239
03:13:42,643 --> 03:13:46,519
saying which of these controls 
can help met a great, 

2240
03:13:51,493 --> 03:13:53,493
mitigate threats.

2241
03:13:55,825 --> 03:13:57,715
Many organizations have an 
abundance of protective controls

2242
03:13:57,716 --> 03:14:03,210
but they might be asking what is
our effectiveness? We take a 

2243
03:14:03,458 --> 03:14:05,618
mapping like this and we can 
walk down and ask 

2244
03:14:09,024 --> 03:14:10,702
thought-provoking questions. I 
we continuously looking for 

2245
03:14:10,703 --> 03:14:15,892
network intrusions? I we working
with their defenses? As you go 

2246
03:14:16,131 --> 03:14:19,635
through this workflow you will 
likely identify capability gaps 

2247
03:14:19,873 --> 03:14:22,024
which can help inform your 

2248
03:14:25,690 --> 03:14:27,764
roadmaps. Likewise they will 
give you an understanding of 

2249
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:31,257
your current coverage and that 
can be useful for building 

2250
03:14:33,197 --> 03:14:35,197
follow-up assessments. Measuring
the effectiveness of your 

2251
03:14:39,428 --> 03:14:43,256
existing controls. In the grand 
scheme of things these are a 

2252
03:14:43,496 --> 03:14:46,153
tool we can leverage in order to
improve our understanding of our

2253
03:14:47,419 --> 03:14:49,335
cybersecurity effectiveness. I 
will share with you another 

2254
03:14:49,336 --> 03:14:51,382
prototype mapping that was 
developed in response to a 

2255
03:14:51,622 --> 03:14:53,864
strong community request showing
how attack maps to the 

2256
03:14:58,189 --> 03:15:05,160
controls in NIST 800-53. We made
a lot of different prototypes. 

2257
03:15:05,399 --> 03:15:07,399
Through this process we have 
identified a number 

2258
03:15:11,713 --> 03:15:15,604
of challenges. I will share one 
of the prototypes we created and

2259
03:15:15,841 --> 03:15:18,479
talk about how it works and what
kind of limitations are present 

2260
03:15:18,730 --> 03:15:20,904
like most products we started 
with the spreadsheet. On the 

2261
03:15:21,149 --> 03:15:25,607
left-hand side we have our 
ATT&CK tactics  organized by 

2262
03:15:25,857 --> 03:15:27,857
tactic and on the top side we 

2263
03:15:30,691 --> 03:15:35,533
have our NIST controls.  One of 
the immediate challenges that 

2264
03:15:38,208 --> 03:15:41,529
the spreadsheet is extremely 
large about 244 cells making 

2265
03:15:41,768 --> 03:15:46,730
this a little bit unwieldy at 
times. Scrolling down we have 

2266
03:15:46,974 --> 03:15:48,974
266 ATT&CK 

2267
03:15:51,198 --> 03:15:53,836
techniques.  So how do we deal 
with the fact these frameworks 

2268
03:15:54,073 --> 03:15:56,073
are going to continue to grow 

2269
03:15:59,649 --> 03:16:04,089
and expand? Another approach was
dividing this by control family.

2270
03:16:04,336 --> 03:16:07,588
It is a little bit smaller and 
easier to cope with it at this 

2271
03:16:07,839 --> 03:16:10,978
point it is an Excel spreadsheet
and we need to find a better way

2272
03:16:11,238 --> 03:16:16,849
to cope with the scale. That 
brings us to the challenges we 

2273
03:16:17,087 --> 03:16:19,087
derived by creating these 

2274
03:16:22,215 --> 03:16:24,215
different prototypes.

2275
03:16:28,170 --> 03:16:30,557
If you have made these mappings 
I suspect you have experienced 

2276
03:16:30,799 --> 03:16:33,425
similar challenges and this is 
the basis for the solutions we 

2277
03:16:33,660 --> 03:16:36,094
plan on developing for the 
future. So we mapped to the 

2278
03:16:36,334 --> 03:16:38,334
different functions of the NIST 
security 

2279
03:16:40,902 --> 03:16:42,902
framework. 

2280
03:16:46,856 --> 03:16:50,017
We want to have criteria that is
very clear and there are defined

2281
03:16:50,260 --> 03:16:53,280
conventions so if we are sharing
this it's easy to jump in and 

2282
03:16:53,520 --> 03:16:55,180
make contributions following 
known standards. We recognize 

2283
03:16:55,181 --> 03:16:59,061
the fact that both ATT&CK and 
different frameworks will 

2284
03:16:59,304 --> 03:17:02,055
continue to grow and expand. It 
might not be enough to grow 

2285
03:17:02,295 --> 03:17:04,917
these in an Excel spreadsheet . 
We might need a structured data 

2286
03:17:05,152 --> 03:17:07,562
solution that can keep up with 
the changing nature's of these 

2287
03:17:09,813 --> 03:17:12,637
control frameworks. And then 
there is scale. Hundreds if not 

2288
03:17:12,870 --> 03:17:15,249
thousands of controls. We need 
to find a programmatic way to 

2289
03:17:15,484 --> 03:17:20,763
deal with that. And then the 
last thing I will share as we 

2290
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:23,904
have seen many organizations 
with mappings and window they 

2291
03:17:24,140 --> 03:17:26,801
are probably of great value to 
the community. The challenge is 

2292
03:17:31,678 --> 03:17:34,212
sharing it. You're talking about
your security posture and there 

2293
03:17:34,446 --> 03:17:39,066
might be sensitive data you 
don't want to reveal to the 

2294
03:17:39,321 --> 03:17:41,740
public. Going forward we want to
find a way where organizations 

2295
03:17:41,992 --> 03:17:46,167
can share these mappings and we 
can make it available and 

2296
03:17:46,428 --> 03:17:48,428
perhaps MITRE can be the curator
to make that 

2297
03:17:51,650 --> 03:17:54,168
happen . We talked about some of
the different challenges and 

2298
03:17:54,405 --> 03:17:57,072
showed some of the prototypes. 
Were going to talk about what we

2299
03:17:57,315 --> 03:18:01,480
can do to get this into your 
hands in a timely manner. Our 

2300
03:18:01,718 --> 03:18:04,250
in-state is we want to provide a
curated source of trusted 

2301
03:18:04,485 --> 03:18:06,485
mappings that 

2302
03:18:09,039 --> 03:18:13,109
can support.  In many ways 
ATT&CK has been a success 

2303
03:18:13,354 --> 03:18:18,009
because it is driven by the 
people who use it . Beyond that 

2304
03:18:18,246 --> 03:18:21,118
as far as the technical approach
as we go forward we will develop

2305
03:18:21,921 --> 03:18:24,666
a flexible structure and I look 
to some of the other structures 

2306
03:18:28,625 --> 03:18:31,275
we've seen. We can take a large 
body of different criteria and 

2307
03:18:31,520 --> 03:18:34,595
put it in a structured format. 
If we have that it should be 

2308
03:18:34,831 --> 03:18:36,831
more scalable than an Excel 
spreadsheet 

2309
03:18:40,726 --> 03:18:46,583
of doom. And we have this format
that should be easier to make 

2310
03:18:46,819 --> 03:18:48,735
that data accessible in a 
user-friendly application. That 

2311
03:18:48,737 --> 03:18:51,127
would be the ATT&CK navigator.  
It could be a separate 

2312
03:18:55,774 --> 03:18:59,266
entity but we want to get these 
mappings to you and we wanted to

2313
03:18:59,505 --> 03:19:03,965
be an easy process to use them. 
That brings us to our 

2314
03:19:04,216 --> 03:19:06,747
conclusion. The first thing I 
will point out is that this 

2315
03:19:06,989 --> 03:19:10,741
project is in its early stages. 
This is the perfect time to 

2316
03:19:10,977 --> 03:19:12,977
offer your input, ideas, 

2317
03:19:16,494 --> 03:19:19,065
and perspectives. This is a 
subject that people have strong 

2318
03:19:21,438 --> 03:19:23,591
ideas about. If there is 
specific mappings you want, let 

2319
03:19:23,830 --> 03:19:27,334
us know and why and that will 
put us in a 

2320
03:19:31,933 --> 03:19:33,933
better position

2321
03:19:35,859 --> 03:19:38,889
to try and make that a reality. 
If you are one of these 

2322
03:19:39,135 --> 03:19:41,823
organizations that has taken the
initiative and made a great 

2323
03:19:42,061 --> 03:19:44,962
mapping and you want to share 
it, reach out. We are happy to 

2324
03:19:45,196 --> 03:19:48,241
figure out how to get it out 
there. And this underscores a 

2325
03:19:48,486 --> 03:19:52,003
common theme at ATT&CK.con. But 
we were together we gain 

2326
03:19:52,273 --> 03:19:54,592
advantages over our adversaries 
. Only by working together can 

2327
03:19:54,830 --> 03:20:00,337
we make this a reality. So let 
us know if you want to help our 

2328
03:20:00,580 --> 03:20:02,717
happy to have a discussion about
how to make that 

2329
03:20:06,319 --> 03:20:09,618
a reality. That was the controls
mapping update. I'd like to open

2330
03:20:09,855 --> 03:20:13,073
up the floor and answer any 
questions you may have. 

2331
03:20:13,074 --> 03:20:17,145
>> The most common question is 
what are they serving for lunch?

2332
03:20:17,383 --> 03:20:20,375
>> I know this is something a 
lot of folks have looked into. 

2333
03:20:20,617 --> 03:20:24,486
Are there any questions for 
Mike. 

2334
03:20:24,487 --> 03:20:26,487
>> If the wrong questions now I 
will 

2335
03:20:30,840 --> 03:20:35,105
be around. Please reach out to 
me and I will be on-site and 

2336
03:20:35,339 --> 03:20:37,727
likewise if you have any further
questions or requests feel free 

2337
03:20:37,965 --> 03:20:42,040
to reach out to us at the 
information below. 

2338
03:20:42,041 --> 03:20:44,420
>> You mentioned the challenges 
slide but can you talk more 

2339
03:20:44,664 --> 03:20:49,485
about the challenge of a want to
many thing but the challenge of 

2340
03:20:49,722 --> 03:20:53,317
the fact that it depends on how 
you implement a control. What 

2341
03:20:53,555 --> 03:20:55,555
were you finding as you were 
trying to map 

2342
03:21:00,089 --> 03:21:03,808
these controls? 
>> That is one of the big 

2343
03:21:04,043 --> 03:21:06,645
challenges. It is easy to look 
at an Excel spreadsheet and say 

2344
03:21:06,886 --> 03:21:08,886
if we have malicious code 
protection that would lock 

2345
03:21:09,048 --> 03:21:11,048
spearfishing attacks. It really 
depends on the specific 

2346
03:21:11,159 --> 03:21:13,159
implementation and a lot 

2347
03:21:16,751 --> 03:21:20,709
of variables. We want to offer 
guidance to help organizations 

2348
03:21:20,953 --> 03:21:25,377
and respect the fact that the 
effectiveness of these controls 

2349
03:21:25,619 --> 03:21:28,689
depends on your implementation. 
At the end of the day this is a 

2350
03:21:28,926 --> 03:21:30,880
starting point to understand 
your environment recognizing it 

2351
03:21:30,881 --> 03:21:33,706
does require deeper examination 
to understand the effectiveness.

2352
03:21:33,950 --> 03:21:35,950
>> 

2353
03:21:38,868 --> 03:21:42,846
Well said. I appreciate you 
bringing that into perspective. 

2354
03:21:43,083 --> 03:21:46,722
I don't know if this is actually
going to work maybe not so much.

2355
03:21:46,970 --> 03:21:48,970
That's another theme we have 

2356
03:21:51,141 --> 03:21:55,207
talked about. A false sense of 
security and that is a risk 

2357
03:21:55,443 --> 03:22:00,717
here. A risk of doing the 
controls mapping that as we as a

2358
03:22:00,957 --> 03:22:02,957
community look at this and keep 
that 

2359
03:22:05,563 --> 03:22:07,729
in mind it's important and 
hopefully we can strengthen this

2360
03:22:08,041 --> 03:22:10,668
to move on together. Please join
me in thanking Mike Long. 

2361

>> [ Applause ] 
>> Excellent. Some love from 

2362
03:22:15,573 --> 03:22:17,573
twitter. Here's a screenshot on 
how to 

2363
03:22:22,006 --> 03:22:23,958
map attack to improve the 
understanding of our 

2364
03:22:23,960 --> 03:22:28,213
cybersecurity program 
effectiveness. Also my covering 

2365
03:22:28,447 --> 03:22:30,447
the 

2366
03:22:32,373 --> 03:22:34,373
critical topic and most of 
controls are autofocus for 

2367
03:22:35,424 --> 03:22:38,062
regulatory reasons. We know that
doesn't always equal security so

2368
03:22:38,295 --> 03:22:46,068
that we should map ATT&CK to 
them . Bring together different 

2369
03:22:46,323 --> 03:22:50,817
communities here at ATT&CK.con. 
That brings us 

2370
03:22:55,663 --> 03:22:58,525
to lunch. Thanks for sponsoring 
that and we encourage you to 

2371
03:22:58,758 --> 03:23:01,149
keep talking to each other and 
visit our exhibitors and of 

2372
03:23:01,384 --> 03:23:05,926
course, folks online, he's back.
I will send it over to Jamie 

2373
03:23:06,166 --> 03:23:11,836

lunch. We will come back at 1:15

2374
03:23:12,071 --> 03:23:14,071
eastern. See you all 

2375
03:23:18,819 --> 03:23:20,819
soon. 
>>

2376
03:23:37,378 --> 03:23:39,378
>> Welcome back to the 

2377
03:23:43,061 --> 03:23:45,723
attack on couch. I am here with 
the proud father and probably 

2378
03:23:45,964 --> 03:23:48,591
still a great artisan great 
photography who 

2379
03:23:53,350 --> 03:23:55,350
spoke about ATT&CK coverage. 

2380
03:23:58,093 --> 03:24:01,324
>>  I'm getting a lot of new 
ideas in the training on Monday 

2381
03:24:04,798 --> 03:24:07,421
was excellent. It is great to 
see so many people are looking 

2382
03:24:07,677 --> 03:24:12,267
at ATT&CK  from all these 
different ways. And also to 

2383
03:24:12,505 --> 03:24:15,711
think of new ideas on how to 
apply a properly and help my 

2384
03:24:15,945 --> 03:24:19,230
clients and other people in the 
community. 

2385
03:24:19,231 --> 03:24:21,985
>> It is an honor for you to be 
here. So CTI 

2386
03:24:25,306 --> 03:24:27,306
and data. Your talk was 
interesting because you flip 

2387
03:24:30,991 --> 03:24:33,549
the script and let's not talk 
about our adversaries but look 

2388
03:24:33,787 --> 03:24:36,421
at ourselves and understand 
ourselves. What is the 

2389
03:24:36,657 --> 03:24:39,108
importance of understanding the 
data you have internally? 

2390
03:24:39,110 --> 03:24:42,742
>> It is super important. Like 
he's highlighted where people 

2391
03:24:44,609 --> 03:24:49,109
are always rushing and I need to
cover this but in order to cover

2392
03:24:49,348 --> 03:24:54,944
it properly you need to learn 
first how it applies to you and 

2393
03:24:55,192 --> 03:24:57,749
what kind of data you already 
have and what you 

2394
03:25:00,855 --> 03:25:02,855
can utilize. 

2395
03:25:06,070 --> 03:25:09,105
And also knowing in your own 
environment is totally different

2396
03:25:09,351 --> 03:25:11,762
than probably every report that 
you read out there. It applies 

2397
03:25:11,998 --> 03:25:14,493
to base standards differently 
and there is a best practice but

2398
03:25:14,730 --> 03:25:16,730
hardly anybody 

2399
03:25:19,341 --> 03:25:21,713
adapts that. It is really 
important to know yourself first

2400
03:25:21,950 --> 03:25:26,777
before you start looking at what
is out there.  

2401
03:25:26,778 --> 03:25:28,778
>> Excellent perspective. ATT&CK
is something we build and 

2402
03:25:32,954 --> 03:25:36,009
maintain.  Really tease out all 
of the values. One of the really

2403
03:25:36,289 --> 03:25:38,711
interesting and novel things you
did was take data sources and 

2404
03:25:39,258 --> 03:25:43,633
apply weight. ISA behavior has 
like 40% this and can you speak 

2405
03:25:43,880 --> 03:25:46,770
towards that process and how you
came to 

2406
03:25:51,559 --> 03:25:53,795
that conclusion? 
>> Some of them are 

2407
03:25:54,037 --> 03:25:56,037
guesstimates. I don't see all of
them 

2408
03:25:58,748 --> 03:26:01,689
being applied. Basically how me 
and my team and what I see and 

2409
03:26:01,924 --> 03:26:07,273
tight reports prevalence of the 
data and where I see the most 

2410
03:26:07,522 --> 03:26:10,182
value in terms of being able to 
detect or have a probability 

2411
03:26:10,423 --> 03:26:13,431
rating. So where you would be 
most likely to 

2412
03:26:17,031 --> 03:26:22,754
find this. As I said it's not an
exact science so there might be 

2413
03:26:22,994 --> 03:26:24,994
some points that might 

2414
03:26:27,999 --> 03:26:29,999
differ. 
>> Even if it's 

2415
03:26:33,483 --> 03:26:35,483
not perfect, it is a step 
towards understanding yourself 

2416
03:26:35,635 --> 03:26:40,769
and really knowing that I'm in a
better place than I was before. 

2417
03:26:41,007 --> 03:26:43,190
But in that same vein three 
interesting metrics you called 

2418
03:26:43,434 --> 03:26:46,519
out was completely runs, 
availability and timeliness. 

2419
03:26:46,753 --> 03:26:50,776
What do you mean by those? 
>> Sure. Basically 

2420
03:26:53,797 --> 03:26:56,240
the timeliness for instance you 
have an environment with a lot 

2421
03:26:56,632 --> 03:26:59,550
of laptops and they go abroad 
and they come back and all of 

2422
03:27:00,298 --> 03:27:03,285
the data flows into your 
environment. Most of your 

2423
03:27:03,749 --> 03:27:09,030
detection logic is based on the 
last 15 minutes of the last 

2424
03:27:09,297 --> 03:27:13,804
hour. It looks at the generated 
timestamp and not necessarily at

2425
03:27:14,043 --> 03:27:17,904
the adjusted rent. If it's been 
generated an hour ago you're 

2426
03:27:20,603 --> 03:27:25,166
still good. If it was generated 
last week while your colleague 

2427
03:27:25,402 --> 03:27:29,708
was in Africa or wherever, you 
won't see it anymore. So that is

2428
03:27:29,950 --> 03:27:36,765
why I factor that in. And the 
same goes for the availability. 

2429
03:27:37,017 --> 03:27:39,017
Do you store 

2430
03:27:40,721 --> 03:27:44,775
it locally and the coverages 
mostly how many systems do you 

2431
03:27:45,026 --> 03:27:49,657
cover and how good is the 
quality that the data provides 

2432
03:27:49,898 --> 03:27:52,664
you. Is it usable? Is it one 

2433
03:27:56,971 --> 03:27:59,578
big blob and you can't really do
anything with it? 

2434
03:27:59,579 --> 03:28:03,587
>> We have all been there. 
>> Out of curiosity, have you 

2435
03:28:03,824 --> 03:28:08,529
introduced any other metrics are
those encompassing? 

2436
03:28:08,530 --> 03:28:10,914
>> I probably would ask or would
add 

2437
03:28:15,788 --> 03:28:19,065
some more depth scores. I wanted
to keep it as usable as possible

2438
03:28:19,304 --> 03:28:21,949
for everybody out there. Having 
to fill those metrics may be 

2439
03:28:22,188 --> 03:28:26,830
cumbersome for the ones that are
there. If you really do that for

2440
03:28:27,070 --> 03:28:29,070
everyone and for every one 

2441
03:28:32,852 --> 03:28:36,300
of them, it might not be a 
usable tool anymore. I welcome 

2442
03:28:36,574 --> 03:28:39,905
people to add to it if they see 
value in it like parsing and all

2443
03:28:41,648 --> 03:28:45,175
of that, but I want to keep it 
as flexible and easy to use as 

2444
03:28:46,128 --> 03:28:48,128
possible. 
>> We definitely see you as a 

2445
03:28:52,558 --> 03:28:56,200
thought leader. What is next for
you? I think you mentioned graph

2446
03:28:56,436 --> 03:28:58,436
model assessments. 
>> I will continue work on the 

2447
03:28:58,617 --> 03:29:00,617
threatening 

2448
03:29:02,775 --> 03:29:06,285
app and I see a lot of value and
I get so much amazing feedback 

2449
03:29:06,522 --> 03:29:08,713
from people that I will 
definitely work on that. And 

2450
03:29:08,951 --> 03:29:12,853
also the graph model. I got 
inspired by a colleague who 

2451
03:29:13,344 --> 03:29:15,344
started this entry basically 

2452
03:29:19,570 --> 03:29:22,456
and also the [ Indiscernible ] 
guys they've done an amazing job

2453
03:29:22,699 --> 03:29:26,310
with that application and I want
to see if I can combine that 

2454
03:29:26,556 --> 03:29:29,761
into an application where a red 
team or a blue team can put in 

2455
03:29:30,001 --> 03:29:35,286
small metrics and see how ATT&CK
can help them in defending  the 

2456
03:29:35,520 --> 03:29:39,018
network or protecting it. 
>> Anything we can do one art 

2457
03:29:39,252 --> 03:29:42,128
end we would be honored to help 
contribute 

2458
03:29:45,433 --> 03:29:48,184
to that. Are there any plans for
Halloween or costume ideas? 

2459
03:29:48,185 --> 03:29:53,527
>> I will be on the plane on 
Halloween. I don't think they'd 

2460
03:29:53,765 --> 03:29:59,073
appreciate me going to TSA with 
a. Last year I was in Vegas and 

2461
03:29:59,311 --> 03:30:02,573
it was a crazy party. We have 
the equivalent called 

2462
03:30:07,511 --> 03:30:10,775
Saint Maarten. It is next 
Monday. I will take the kids out

2463
03:30:11,010 --> 03:30:13,199
and get some candy. 
>> Thank you for your time, 

2464
03:30:13,435 --> 03:30:16,712
Olaf. We will bring in our next 
presenter talked about 

2465
03:30:17,000 --> 03:30:22,399
prioritizing data sources. Thank
you for joining me, Keith. Very 

2466
03:30:22,634 --> 03:30:24,634
humbling. A 100 

2467
03:30:28,023 --> 03:30:30,023
level talk.

2468
03:30:32,562 --> 03:30:36,181
It is a hard problem that we see
a lot of people come to us with.

2469
03:30:36,422 --> 03:30:38,831
I'd like to give you the 
opportunity to talk about the 

2470
03:30:39,069 --> 03:30:41,515
importance, there's all these 
great ideas, but making sure 

2471
03:30:41,760 --> 03:30:45,782
that foundation is solid. 
>> I think it is one of the 

2472
03:30:46,026 --> 03:30:51,158
things that we've learned, we've
done all of these things over 

2473
03:30:51,649 --> 03:30:57,346
the years and some of them are 
really complex. Data operations 

2474
03:30:57,589 --> 03:31:02,690
problems but most of them at the
end of the day, I know you 

2475
03:31:02,928 --> 03:31:06,724
figured something out so, 

2476
03:31:10,749 --> 03:31:14,056
it is, especially the principles
of trying to keep things like 

2477
03:31:14,294 --> 03:31:19,284
minimize complexity wherever you
can. A general problem-solving 

2478
03:31:19,519 --> 03:31:21,519
approach. And I have had, 

2479
03:31:25,164 --> 03:31:29,430
I'm sorry. 
>> Start over? 

2480
03:31:29,431 --> 03:31:31,431
>> 

2481
03:31:34,444 --> 03:31:38,534
Cool. 
>> The importance of making sure

2482
03:31:38,786 --> 03:31:42,920
your foundation is solid and you
have solid footing and embrace 

2483
03:31:43,162 --> 03:31:44,548
those follow one innovative 
ideas. 

2484
03:31:44,549 --> 03:31:46,549
>> 

2485
03:31:48,122 --> 03:31:52,389
The approach is trying to 
simplify things as much as 

2486
03:31:52,631 --> 03:31:55,283
possible. Take it down to the 
small number of things you need 

2487
03:31:55,524 --> 03:31:59,582
to understand really well so 
that you can build a bunch of 

2488
03:31:59,825 --> 03:32:02,224
complex things on top of them. 
That is a challenge. As 

2489
03:32:02,461 --> 03:32:04,461
engineers and 

2490
03:32:07,542 --> 03:32:11,827
security people we love to dig 
into our problems and dig into 

2491
03:32:12,073 --> 03:32:15,981
data and there is absolutely a 
place for all of that stuff. 

2492
03:32:16,215 --> 03:32:18,231
Like I mentioned in the 
beginning the feedback we've 

2493
03:32:18,468 --> 03:32:21,011
gotten as we have done community
events and talking openly with 

2494
03:32:21,246 --> 03:32:23,246
other people around 

2495
03:32:25,091 --> 03:32:27,700
the conference.  What is the 
most interesting to you and what

2496
03:32:27,966 --> 03:32:32,753
you want to learn about ATT&CK? 
What do I do first? Do I make 

2497
03:32:32,990 --> 03:32:35,624
the red green chart for my 
manager who wants to know I 

2498
03:32:35,868 --> 03:32:37,868
recovered if this thing 

2499
03:32:41,465 --> 03:32:43,806
happens? Or, is it just 
understanding from a security 

2500
03:32:44,042 --> 03:32:47,652
architecture and engineering 
perspective do we have the data 

2501
03:32:47,893 --> 03:32:50,818
that we need to do any of this 
stuff really well? You can 

2502
03:32:51,059 --> 03:32:53,558
overlay threat models and make 
that as complex as you 

2503
03:32:58,117 --> 03:33:00,720
need to. It seems like most 
folks have a pretty firm 

2504
03:33:00,960 --> 03:33:03,026
appetite for understanding that 
first step I can take. 

2505
03:33:07,075 --> 03:33:09,643
>> Absolutely. One of the 
interesting things, once you get

2506
03:33:09,881 --> 03:33:12,019
that foundation and you think 
you're ready for that second 

2507
03:33:12,266 --> 03:33:16,023
step, when do you know is a good
step to take? Is it a leap of 

2508
03:33:16,258 --> 03:33:21,148
faith are how can you 
understand, I have sought the 

2509
03:33:21,393 --> 03:33:26,096
simple yet complex problems and 
I'm ready to move on. 

2510
03:33:26,097 --> 03:33:28,980
>> That is a tough question. 
Maybe the answer is that all of 

2511
03:33:29,217 --> 03:33:32,361
this stuff is iterative. I think
it comes up 

2512
03:33:36,189 --> 03:33:38,742
in almost every talk respect 
about the topic. None of this 

2513
03:33:38,984 --> 03:33:41,615
stuff is ever done. You are 
always making trade-offs. Do I 

2514
03:33:41,856 --> 03:33:43,907
do this next or this 

2515
03:33:48,917 --> 03:33:51,877
next? Effectively setting really
clear milestones. If milestone 

2516
03:33:52,125 --> 03:33:57,591
one is put in place of coverage 
and just achieve visibility into

2517
03:33:57,833 --> 03:34:02,790
the things that are most likely 
to happen. That is your first 

2518
03:34:03,028 --> 03:34:05,784
milestone. You don't have to get
super hung up on the operations 

2519
03:34:06,022 --> 03:34:08,022
side 

2520
03:34:09,290 --> 03:34:13,792
of that. That is your first 
milestone and now figure out, 

2521
03:34:14,030 --> 03:34:16,891
what do I look at and how do I 
understand of these techniques 

2522
03:34:17,135 --> 03:34:19,135
maybe I just picked 10 

2523
03:34:22,435 --> 03:34:25,454
of those. Let's go break that 
off and put in place detection 

2524
03:34:25,724 --> 03:34:28,044
and make sure analysts 
understand the context and 

2525
03:34:28,282 --> 03:34:30,948
that's it. That is your next 
milestone and move on to the 

2526
03:34:31,192 --> 03:34:35,783
next one. At every stage along 
the way where there's a 

2527
03:34:36,024 --> 03:34:38,675
trade-off, do I build it on top 
of something over source or 

2528
03:34:38,921 --> 03:34:43,138
purchase a product? Do I build 
the team or do 

2529
03:34:46,259 --> 03:34:49,293
it myself? Do I do this with a 
partner or a service provider. 

2530
03:34:49,532 --> 03:34:51,538
Once you get beyond that now you
are 

2531
03:34:56,555 --> 03:34:58,181
in forensics. Really simple 
milestones. 

2532
03:34:58,182 --> 03:35:00,182
>> I think I really appreciate 
what you 

2533
03:35:04,141 --> 03:35:06,541
said about don't just do things 
but do that very thoughtfully. 

2534
03:35:06,775 --> 03:35:08,775
There are trade-offs in 
complexity and a 

2535
03:35:11,656 --> 03:35:14,130
big problem is not just moving 
forward but tracking progress. 

2536
03:35:14,366 --> 03:35:17,731
The milestone approach enables 
you to not just look forward, 

2537
03:35:17,972 --> 03:35:20,297
but check backwards and make 
sure you have maintained and 

2538
03:35:20,542 --> 03:35:24,857
solidified everything behind us.
>> Yes, I do not know, it is 

2539
03:35:25,100 --> 03:35:27,100
tough. It's a super interesting 

2540
03:35:31,556 --> 03:35:34,084
general concept or thing to 
think about all of the time. 

2541
03:35:34,324 --> 03:35:38,643
Even in the context of even if 
you take things like ATT&CK out 

2542
03:35:38,878 --> 03:35:42,201
of it and everyone loves to  
back on things like old school [

2543
03:35:42,445 --> 03:35:46,387
Indiscernible ] and when you 
think about building a good 

2544
03:35:46,647 --> 03:35:49,031
foundation and nothing you can 
build upon and the thing that 

2545
03:35:49,268 --> 03:35:51,268
enables you to solve 

2546
03:35:53,907 --> 03:35:56,489
hard problems even that is an 
interesting tangent to go down 

2547
03:35:56,727 --> 03:35:58,727
and a 

2548
03:36:00,609 --> 03:36:03,002
thought exercise. Maybe it is a 
particular solution is a great 

2549
03:36:03,237 --> 03:36:06,734
for detecting a lot of the 
things we worry about today but 

2550
03:36:06,981 --> 03:36:09,824
there is 20 or 30 years of 
things we don't have to worry 

2551
03:36:10,068 --> 03:36:13,197
about because they are handled. 
And then data sources is another

2552
03:36:13,438 --> 03:36:19,594
way to think about that. Build 
that solid foundation. Part of 

2553
03:36:19,832 --> 03:36:24,411
it is having confidence that you
are doing things thoughtfully 

2554
03:36:24,663 --> 03:36:30,057
and you don't have to have a 
perfect plan. Having a plan 

2555
03:36:30,304 --> 03:36:32,304
helps. And you 

2556
03:36:34,126 --> 03:36:37,383
can continue if you're going to 
be making trade-offs and hard 

2557
03:36:37,752 --> 03:36:40,142
decisions and the landscape is 
going to change in the things 

2558
03:36:40,390 --> 03:36:43,743
you're trying to detect, they 
will all change over time. You 

2559
03:36:43,982 --> 03:36:47,733
want to have confidence to have 
a plan and don't over complicate

2560
03:36:48,104 --> 03:36:50,104
things. Free 

2561
03:36:53,016 --> 03:36:55,192
your ability to constantly make 
forward progress. Do not get 

2562
03:36:55,439 --> 03:36:58,488
hung up on where you think you 
should be. Is today better than 

2563
03:36:59,719 --> 03:37:01,719
yesterday? 
>> You are where you are for a 

2564
03:37:01,882 --> 03:37:04,424
reason. No one wants to get 
burned like 

2565
03:37:08,253 --> 03:37:11,071
Mimi Katz. I think this is my 
last question for you. You 

2566
03:37:11,310 --> 03:37:13,310
mentioned data sources 

2567
03:37:17,511 --> 03:37:20,170
and definitions. Any other 
opportunities that we from the 

2568
03:37:20,409 --> 03:37:22,797
ATT&CK side to enable the first 
step  in building the 

2569
03:37:23,685 --> 03:37:25,378
foundation? 
>> That is a really good 

2570
03:37:25,380 --> 03:37:27,764
question. I never thought 
through what we would ask ATT&CK

2571
03:37:28,004 --> 03:37:30,004
to 

2572
03:37:32,765 --> 03:37:37,440
do.  There is a tough balance 
there. And maybe the answer is 

2573
03:37:37,680 --> 03:37:39,841
the thing that you were doing 
with product assessments and 

2574
03:37:40,078 --> 03:37:42,499
maybe that is actually the best 
way to answer those questions. 

2575
03:37:42,735 --> 03:37:44,735
They are 

2576
03:37:46,022 --> 03:37:47,481
very environmentally 
independent. Technics matter for

2577
03:37:47,482 --> 03:37:53,038
different reasons and they have 
different weight. I appreciate 

2578
03:37:55,374 --> 03:37:58,899
the level of abstraction that 
exists in the data sources. They

2579
03:37:59,135 --> 03:38:06,541
are really simple and if you 
peel down into it the process 

2580
03:38:06,934 --> 03:38:09,572
monitoring, it is fun and gives 
you a small number of consistent

2581
03:38:10,406 --> 03:38:12,406
data points when a process 

2582
03:38:15,889 --> 03:38:18,186
is started. If you look at 
visibility products, that might 

2583
03:38:18,420 --> 03:38:20,420
be more expansive. It is 

2584
03:38:22,991 --> 03:38:25,840
really different. In most cases 
for instance if you look at the 

2585
03:38:26,080 --> 03:38:29,770
way processes and process 
command lines rollup. Most 

2586
03:38:30,006 --> 03:38:32,006
products just jam 

2587
03:38:34,172 --> 03:38:35,605
those together. From an 
implementation perspective 

2588
03:38:35,606 --> 03:38:37,606
process monitoring and 
commandline monitoring are the 

2589
03:38:38,840 --> 03:38:42,933
same thing. You can go down 
those rabbit holes all day long.

2590
03:38:43,172 --> 03:38:45,303
For the sake of simplicity keep 
it really simple and 

2591
03:38:49,947 --> 03:38:52,967
high level. The level of detail 
that's in there now is good 

2592
03:38:53,207 --> 03:38:55,834
enough to get people thinking 
about it which is what you want.

2593
03:38:56,076 --> 03:38:59,524
Don't just fixate on the 
technique. You have to 

2594
03:38:59,759 --> 03:39:02,275
understand how I observed this 
thing in the first place. If 

2595
03:39:02,511 --> 03:39:05,119
nothing else as an attention 
grabber. 

2596
03:39:05,120 --> 03:39:11,949
>> A big difference, completely 
different roles but process 

2597
03:39:12,190 --> 03:39:16,292
monitoring. Thank you for your 
time. 

2598
03:39:16,293 --> 03:39:19,163
>> We're going to take a quick 
break as we transition our next 

2599
03:39:19,400 --> 03:39:25,358
guest José and Roberto onto the 
couch. We will be back in one 

2600
03:39:25,594 --> 03:39:27,594
moment. 

2601
03:40:57,166 --> 03:40:59,166
>> 

2602
03:41:00,214 --> 03:41:04,884
Welcome back. I am here with the
dynamic duo. Roberto and José 

2603
03:41:05,659 --> 03:41:09,264
Rodriguez. First comment, we 
have known Roberto for a 

2604
03:41:13,417 --> 03:41:15,956
long time. Recently you have 
introduced us to José. What's it

2605
03:41:16,193 --> 03:41:20,149
like working together? 
>> I came to the states last 

2606
03:41:20,391 --> 03:41:22,391
year and I had to change all 

2607
03:41:25,815 --> 03:41:28,243
of my career from data science 
to cybersecurity and working 

2608
03:41:28,614 --> 03:41:33,100
with Roberto has been a really 
good experience. He's my brother

2609
03:41:33,340 --> 03:41:37,710
and my coach. 
>> He brings a lot of the data 

2610
03:41:38,608 --> 03:41:42,301
analytics side and beyond the 
basic query stuff. He likes to 

2611
03:41:42,545 --> 03:41:48,558
go to the statistical analysis 
portion of what we do as 

2612
03:41:48,796 --> 03:41:52,447
practitioners. That is where my 
expertise and his expertise 

2613
03:41:52,684 --> 03:42:00,139
lends in very well and we can 
come up with a lot of projects 

2614
03:42:00,530 --> 03:42:03,447
together. He is not just my 
brother but a friend also. We 

2615
03:42:03,681 --> 03:42:10,125
work on a lot of projects. 
>> It keeps you on your game. 

2616
03:42:10,363 --> 03:42:14,251
>> One of the things you can't 
mentioning, first off we have 

2617
03:42:14,486 --> 03:42:17,408
been keeping a tally on Excel 
being good or bad. You guys 

2618
03:42:22,419 --> 03:42:24,474
are pro-tran08. 
>> We love them because they 

2619
03:42:24,714 --> 03:42:26,714
give this the freedom because 
when we try to 

2620
03:42:31,146 --> 03:42:33,146
analyze data

2621
03:42:40,148 --> 03:42:42,148
. Just basic filtering Excel 

2622
03:42:45,977 --> 03:42:47,977
is great

2623
03:42:50,102 --> 03:42:53,102
but once you get into, get this 
data source and this data source

2624
03:42:53,343 --> 03:42:55,494
and do some compound analytics 
and back in for statistical 

2625
03:42:55,737 --> 03:43:00,847
analysis, it's a little complex.
That's why it's,  Jupyter 

2626
03:43:01,087 --> 03:43:02,992
Notebook is been so flexible for
us . 

2627
03:43:02,993 --> 03:43:04,993
>> And then 

2628
03:43:06,960 --> 03:43:08,960
macro syntax. 
>> One of the things I really 

2629
03:43:09,129 --> 03:43:11,422
appreciate especially that 
session you guys did a great job

2630
03:43:11,659 --> 03:43:16,675
on the data. I appreciate what 
your talk was. Looking at all 

2631
03:43:19,556 --> 03:43:22,123
that content and taking the 
metadata and taking it to be 

2632
03:43:24,428 --> 03:43:27,515
more specific. Can we go a step 
beyond ATT&CK ? 

2633
03:43:27,516 --> 03:43:29,516
>> Well, actually, 

2634
03:43:34,319 --> 03:43:36,847
when your validating a specific 
technique you're not looking for

2635
03:43:37,089 --> 03:43:41,741
just the technique but a 
variation. When you 

2636
03:43:44,750 --> 03:43:49,001
are researching about a specific
variation you need to start 

2637
03:43:49,238 --> 03:43:53,965
asking yourself, okay, what data
do I need for the specific 

2638
03:43:54,202 --> 03:43:57,238
behavior I'm looking for and 
when you go and check at what 

2639
03:43:57,480 --> 03:44:01,056
are the data sources I need 
based on the behavior of the 

2640
03:44:01,808 --> 03:44:05,221
attack. 
>> For example, trying to go 

2641
03:44:05,606 --> 03:44:11,563
deeper I think we open a lot of 
doors out there. For example we 

2642
03:44:11,797 --> 03:44:20,335
see friends of mine like new 
ways to try to do a specific 

2643
03:44:20,574 --> 03:44:24,132
technique. If you take that 
technique back to the data 

2644
03:44:24,369 --> 03:44:26,369
source and see 

2645
03:44:29,570 --> 03:44:34,418
where certain, doesn't trigger 
data sources and sometimes 

2646
03:44:34,653 --> 03:44:38,400
that's an interesting way to 
start thinking about data. Every

2647
03:44:38,635 --> 03:44:41,095
tech meet is not that way all 

2648
03:44:44,460 --> 03:44:46,651
the time. The changes depending 
on the variation. It's amazing 

2649
03:44:47,309 --> 03:44:53,664
to see how it drives those nude 
data sources you need. Some of 

2650
03:44:53,905 --> 03:44:57,060
those noisy events that will 
come up even though it's very 

2651
03:44:57,301 --> 03:44:59,301
advanced from a 

2652
03:45:02,662 --> 03:45:05,046
writing perspective. It is 
pretty cool that you are 

2653
03:45:05,295 --> 03:45:07,833
enabling more data sources to 
start looking for you and that 

2654
03:45:08,082 --> 03:45:10,822
is a value I see into getting 
detail and the data source 

2655
03:45:11,684 --> 03:45:13,684
aspect of ATT&CK. 
>>  

2656
03:45:17,709 --> 03:45:21,158
From the ATT&CK team, you guys 
are empowering people  and we 

2657
03:45:24,074 --> 03:45:28,341
appreciate that. I think I 
counted 50 during your talk. 

2658
03:45:28,726 --> 03:45:31,433
Validation. Can you speak to the
importance of that? 

2659
03:45:31,434 --> 03:45:33,434
>> That to me 

2660
03:45:36,993 --> 03:45:39,483
is something that is very 
interesting. As practitioners 

2661
03:45:39,727 --> 03:45:41,727
when you talk 

2662
03:45:44,711 --> 03:45:47,829
to people that are starting in 
the industry and see all of 

2663
03:45:48,069 --> 03:45:50,069
these codes and tweets about 
specific techniques and 

2664
03:45:50,202 --> 03:45:54,539
analytics it is fun to run the 
query and try to find specific 

2665
03:45:54,800 --> 03:45:57,760
things. When you come down to do
it for an organization and your 

2666
03:45:58,011 --> 03:46:00,618
program itself you need to 
validate what you were doing and

2667
03:46:00,858 --> 03:46:04,918
how it's impacting even your 
technology. So all of these 

2668
03:46:05,160 --> 03:46:08,914
different things play it big 
role from validating what it is 

2669
03:46:09,157 --> 03:46:11,157
you're 

2670
03:46:12,627 --> 03:46:15,056
doing and will definitely 
justify a lot of things you do 

2671
03:46:15,295 --> 03:46:17,736
and allow you to think about 
other ways to approach the 

2672
03:46:17,979 --> 03:46:22,697
analytic as well. You identify 
if it works. I might need this 

2673
03:46:23,387 --> 03:46:25,387
extra context. It is easy 

2674
03:46:28,470 --> 03:46:31,643
to go with the specific rule and
apply it and say I'm good. When 

2675
03:46:32,019 --> 03:46:34,019
you 

2676
03:46:36,306 --> 03:46:40,082
go deeper you start enabling a 
lot more of that context then 

2677
03:46:40,324 --> 03:46:42,324
what you're 

2678
03:46:44,307 --> 03:46:46,197
missing. 
>> That really brings in the 

2679
03:46:46,198 --> 03:46:50,420
research peace. 
>> It is based on we need to add

2680
03:46:51,820 --> 03:46:53,820
more context 

2681
03:46:55,070 --> 03:47:00,958
to validate, how can we say 
this, how can we confirm the 

2682
03:47:01,200 --> 03:47:06,415
behavior in your environment. 
>> You never really know. 

2683
03:47:06,416 --> 03:47:08,416
>> You would 

2684
03:47:10,913 --> 03:47:15,391
rather know, that is awesome. A 
question from Twitter. Naming 

2685
03:47:15,642 --> 03:47:17,642
convention. Lord of 

2686
03:47:19,859 --> 03:47:24,328
the rings. Is a flavor of the 
day or did you guys sit down? 

2687
03:47:24,572 --> 03:47:28,479
>> He's really famous in the 
community. 

2688
03:47:28,480 --> 03:47:31,518
>> We love Lord of the rings. 
Since we 

2689
03:47:36,103 --> 03:47:39,053
were younger we watch that a lot
in Peru and that is something 

2690
03:47:40,570 --> 03:47:44,800
where rate try to put a personal
touch in there. It brings me 

2691
03:47:45,047 --> 03:47:47,515
back to my memories with my 
brother. Those couple of things 

2692
03:47:47,760 --> 03:47:52,526
play a role with names of my dog
and stuff like that. I love my 

2693
03:47:52,768 --> 03:48:00,486
dog sent to me his name is Pedro
and he is so famous a 

2694
03:48:05,498 --> 03:48:08,722
different demo. Every motivator 
said you will find my dogs and 

2695
03:48:08,963 --> 03:48:14,428
that's the goal. Make the dogs 
part of the community as well. 

2696
03:48:14,677 --> 03:48:17,779
Who knows he might have his own 
twitter soon. 

2697
03:48:17,781 --> 03:48:21,395
>> Actually is really funny. 
When we were preparing 

2698
03:48:24,646 --> 03:48:27,623
the presentation and going over 
something specific, we remember 

2699
03:48:27,867 --> 03:48:35,058
the scene from the movie so it's
really funny. 

2700
03:48:35,059 --> 03:48:41,715
>> We remember the Lord of the 
rings stuff. It is actually very

2701
03:48:41,960 --> 03:48:45,559
interesting how we put our own 
personal stuff in there to share

2702
03:48:45,800 --> 03:48:48,707
with our community and make a 
real. 

2703
03:48:48,709 --> 03:48:53,161
>> We really appreciate you 
empowering us. You plugged us 

2704
03:48:53,409 --> 03:48:57,987
contributing back to you. I 
think you mentioned binder and 

2705
03:48:58,365 --> 03:49:02,835
slack. 
>> I think one of the first 

2706
03:49:03,077 --> 03:49:08,661
things with this last channel we
posted with the link, one is to 

2707
03:49:08,905 --> 03:49:12,057
actually start conversations 
about open source projects. I 

2708
03:49:12,302 --> 03:49:14,302
have joined a couple of 

2709
03:49:16,456 --> 03:49:19,095
channels before and it turns 
into let's talk about what we're

2710
03:49:19,338 --> 03:49:23,561
doing today and things like that
but we want to also pay 

2711
03:49:23,814 --> 03:49:25,814
attention to this amazing 
initiatives in 

2712
03:49:28,634 --> 03:49:31,500
the community. Like back to you 
guys, how do we empower the 

2713
03:49:31,749 --> 03:49:35,337
attack team. There are a lot of 
good initiatives and a lot of 

2714
03:49:35,580 --> 03:49:38,010
things that as a community we 
can build in a 

2715
03:49:42,773 --> 03:49:44,960
better way. 
>> I would say going through 

2716
03:49:45,206 --> 03:49:47,909
some of the things we have out 
there and seeing where things 

2717
03:49:48,152 --> 03:49:51,076
fit with the mission of attack 
and it would be great to hear 

2718
03:49:51,330 --> 03:49:56,459
from you guys and say we could 
actually work together and who 

2719
03:49:56,703 --> 03:49:58,703
knows maybe we can move it 
directly to 

2720
03:50:03,492 --> 03:50:09,962
ATT&CK.  It started as a little 
thing and now we see him doing 

2721
03:50:12,714 --> 03:50:15,178
his training and that is 
amazing. We can collaborate a 

2722
03:50:15,421 --> 03:50:19,389
lot of that. From the binder 
perspective it's something I 

2723
03:50:19,634 --> 03:50:23,424
talked a little bit about that 
is pretty much trying to empower

2724
03:50:23,675 --> 03:50:26,132
others that don't have the 
resources and might not have the

2725
03:50:26,376 --> 03:50:30,828
expertise to build a Jupyter 
Notebook from a dock or file . 

2726
03:50:31,082 --> 03:50:34,464
Not everybody is an engineer. 
That is pretty much 

2727
03:50:39,256 --> 03:50:42,688
the reality. So our goal is to 
say, this is 

2728
03:50:47,445 --> 03:50:50,771
a way how binder allows you to 
share your work as long as is 

2729
03:50:51,061 --> 03:50:53,503
open source and free. You can 
use the infrastructure to start 

2730
03:50:53,746 --> 03:50:55,746
running 

2731
03:50:57,400 --> 03:50:59,400
things like Jupyter Notebook and
validate your analytics. The 

2732
03:50:59,604 --> 03:51:02,421
beauty of that is that you can 
have  interactive queries being 

2733
03:51:02,672 --> 03:51:07,368
run through the binder and 
Jupyter Notebook  and the beauty

2734
03:51:07,610 --> 03:51:10,420
of that is because we come up 
with analytics and our data 

2735
03:51:10,663 --> 03:51:15,797
sources are not just giving you 
two or three events we select 

2736
03:51:20,490 --> 03:51:22,490
we believe

2737
03:51:24,418 --> 03:51:27,351
where you use that technique. We
give you a snapshot of data and 

2738
03:51:27,594 --> 03:51:30,297
analytics say look for this but 
there might be other things we 

2739
03:51:30,544 --> 03:51:33,385
didn't think about. And that to 
me has been powerful. Every time

2740
03:51:33,628 --> 03:51:36,076
I talk about a technique and an 
analytic, sometimes we're having

2741
03:51:36,320 --> 03:51:40,963
dinner or lunch and I'm like, 
man, this would be awesome if we

2742
03:51:41,354 --> 03:51:46,795
joined this and this and that. 
We go back to that specific note

2743
03:51:47,040 --> 03:51:50,008
book and update the analytics. 
That is what we want from the 

2744
03:51:50,250 --> 03:51:52,592
community. Check the work out 
there and the analytics and 

2745
03:51:57,053 --> 03:52:01,588
tell us. This could be better. 
This could be extra context. And

2746
03:52:01,966 --> 03:52:04,663
that is what we want from the 
community. Every data source is 

2747
03:52:04,905 --> 03:52:06,905
not only specific events we are 
collecting. It 

2748
03:52:09,715 --> 03:52:11,715
is everything. Only three or 

2749
03:52:15,543 --> 03:52:18,472
four events. If people from the 
community find a different way 

2750
03:52:18,722 --> 03:52:21,195
or something that we've missed, 
let us know. We can contribute 

2751
03:52:21,497 --> 03:52:23,973
to that. 
>> The power of the community. 

2752
03:52:24,214 --> 03:52:26,214
You never 

2753
03:52:28,601 --> 03:52:31,482
stop learning. Roberto, José, I 
will let you guys go get some 

2754
03:52:31,732 --> 03:52:36,781
lunch. It's okay to be slow. 
>> Thank you very much. 

2755
03:52:36,782 --> 03:52:39,167
>> We will 

2756
03:52:43,438 --> 03:52:46,394
return and stay tuned. We will 
be back in a moment with our 

2757
03:52:46,638 --> 03:52:48,638
final 

2758
03:52:51,087 --> 03:52:53,087
guest.

03:54:29,264 --> 03:54:31,264
>> 

2760
03:54:32,916 --> 03:54:39,015
Welcome back. Alan Thompson from
yesterday. A great talk by the 

2761
03:54:39,400 --> 03:54:41,380
way. 
>> It has been awesome. The 

2762
03:54:41,381 --> 03:54:45,424
first year I've been here. The 
audience was great. The fact 

2763
03:54:45,661 --> 03:54:50,791
that your streaming it for a 
broader audience is a great 

2764
03:54:51,047 --> 03:54:54,491
idea. 
>> We get a lot of love online. 

2765
03:54:54,750 --> 03:54:59,335
One of the interesting things, 
unfortunately there were two 

2766
03:54:59,581 --> 03:55:01,581
tactics 

2767
03:55:04,338 --> 03:55:07,642
exclusively network. Network 
data is underappreciated and 

2768
03:55:07,884 --> 03:55:11,903
your talk is a great example of 
how relevant it is. There is a 

2769
03:55:12,151 --> 03:55:14,123
bunch of opportunities for it is
very applicable. 

2770
03:55:14,124 --> 03:55:16,124
>> 

2771
03:55:17,810 --> 03:55:20,010
For sure. Even if the [ 
Indiscernible ] are encrypted 

2772
03:55:20,251 --> 03:55:23,497
you can learn a lot about them. 
We have seen for example how 

2773
03:55:28,497 --> 03:55:32,555
seek can provide visibility to 
certificate use and see people 

2774
03:55:32,806 --> 03:55:36,298
scanning behaviors and initial 
attempts to do East West 

2775
03:55:36,543 --> 03:55:38,543
pivoting. It is a vital part 

2776
03:55:41,784 --> 03:55:44,123
to combining up with what's 
going on with the application 

2777
03:55:44,365 --> 03:55:46,703
and provides additional 
visibility. 

2778
03:55:46,704 --> 03:55:50,027
>> What is a computer without 
the networking. It is 

2779
03:55:50,317 --> 03:55:54,735
unfortunate we end up doing 
that. What is your favorite 

2780
03:55:54,983 --> 03:55:56,983
attack 

2781
03:55:58,027 --> 03:56:00,027
technique? 
>> I 

2782
03:56:04,445 --> 03:56:08,997
think ultimately what is most 
challenging to find is not one 

2783
03:56:09,238 --> 03:56:11,238
particular technique but how 
they're chained together. One of

2784
03:56:11,444 --> 03:56:13,444
the things 

2785
03:56:17,460 --> 03:56:20,167
that seek, how can you start to 
understand behaviors across 

2786
03:56:20,405 --> 03:56:22,405
multiple techniques and how are 
they 

2787
03:56:25,455 --> 03:56:28,375
put together. That particular 
sequence is understood by her 

2788
03:56:28,625 --> 03:56:34,634
they're trying to they will 
pivot. What don't they know 

2789
03:56:34,884 --> 03:56:40,690
about how I do my business. 
Understanding behavior and 

2790
03:56:40,937 --> 03:56:42,937
identify patterns 

2791
03:56:46,365 --> 03:56:54,085
of behavior it can help. 
>> One of the things from your 

2792
03:56:54,326 --> 03:56:58,148
slide, we have some diagrams. 
Your ideal deployment. It seems 

2793
03:56:58,389 --> 03:57:05,101
like it's really complex. Egress
opportunities, host to host 

2794
03:57:05,883 --> 03:57:07,883
opportunities and do you have 
any 

2795
03:57:10,346 --> 03:57:12,965
tips? It's interesting capturing
this but there is a lot of 

2796
03:57:13,205 --> 03:57:18,745
networking like why file anyway 
to address those problems? 

2797
03:57:18,746 --> 03:57:20,746
>> I would say 

2798
03:57:23,957 --> 03:57:26,280
step one most organizations 
should be looking at how they 

2799
03:57:26,524 --> 03:57:31,965
monitor their environment. 
Firewalls, IPS is exists. I 

2800
03:57:36,867 --> 03:57:40,868
would say ATT&CK is a good way 
of identifying where are the 

2801
03:57:41,108 --> 03:57:44,589
gaps of my visibility . If you 
do not have visibility inside 

2802
03:57:45,126 --> 03:57:48,806
your perimeter, that might be an
area to look at using 

2803
03:57:52,188 --> 03:57:54,634
Zeek.  So instead of initially 
replacing some of these things 

2804
03:57:54,875 --> 03:57:56,875
you can 

2805
03:58:00,445 --> 03:58:04,869
actually use Zeek to complement 
those technologies and build up 

2806
03:58:06,192 --> 03:58:08,192
your visibility . 

2807
03:58:15,875 --> 03:58:20,983
And if that goes well, start to 
look at how can I think combined

2808
03:58:21,230 --> 03:58:22,484
these capabilities down the 
line. 

2809
03:58:22,485 --> 03:58:24,929
>> Speaking of gaps, what are 
the common pitfalls when you're 

2810
03:58:25,178 --> 03:58:27,068
trying to collect this network 
data? 

2811
03:58:27,069 --> 03:58:30,558
>> I think one of the pitfalls 
of collecting data is if you 

2812
03:58:30,811 --> 03:58:34,035
collect a summary of data that 
is often times not a good use 

2813
03:58:34,279 --> 03:58:37,377
for security purposes. It can be
useful for things like 

2814
03:58:37,630 --> 03:58:41,804
application performance 
monitoring so you know how much 

2815
03:58:42,053 --> 03:58:44,511
your network is being used. From
a security perspective you need 

2816
03:58:44,748 --> 03:58:49,728
all of it. And so that 
immediately says how am I going 

2817
03:58:49,968 --> 03:58:53,157
to collect all of that and where
am I going to send it and 

2818
03:58:56,574 --> 03:58:58,923
store it? 
>> You are opening up a can of 

2819
03:58:59,162 --> 03:59:03,506
worms. Oh my God, where do I 
start? What is the most relevant

2820
03:59:03,744 --> 03:59:06,370
data to capture and what types 
of information is important. 

2821
03:59:06,621 --> 03:59:08,621
Things like communications, 

2822
03:59:10,991 --> 03:59:12,991
connections, initiation. Also 
being able to 

2823
03:59:16,679 --> 03:59:18,779
understand sessions. It is 
insufficient to have just one 

2824
03:59:19,022 --> 03:59:23,905
pocket. Understand the session 
and entire exchange. How do you 

2825
03:59:24,163 --> 03:59:26,479
collect that and then process 
it? 

2826
03:59:26,480 --> 03:59:28,480
>> What from the ATT&CK team 

2827
03:59:30,904 --> 03:59:33,742
side,  it seems like you were 
deep into drinking the ATT&CK 

2828
03:59:33,981 --> 03:59:35,981
Kool-Aid.  What can we do to 
help all 

2829
03:59:39,237 --> 03:59:41,237
those complexities? 
>> I made a 

2830
03:59:45,241 --> 03:59:47,241
joke yesterday.

2831
03:59:49,184 --> 03:59:54,867
Just simple things like 
identifying the specific attack 

2832
03:59:55,110 --> 03:59:57,110
pattern. 

2833
04:00:00,091 --> 04:00:05,227
We actually, you have connected 
to our data and easily find 

2834
04:00:05,479 --> 04:00:08,760
that. If you've got a database 
or if you're pulling it down and

2835
04:00:09,006 --> 04:00:12,590
you've got it on your desk, 
finding those attacks relevant 

2836
04:00:12,839 --> 04:00:14,839
to the name of the tack in 

2837
04:00:18,031 --> 04:00:20,761
our data. That was actually a 
little harder than it should be.

2838
04:00:21,140 --> 04:00:23,564
Another thing I would say is 
unfortunately because of the 

2839
04:00:23,805 --> 04:00:25,805
time allotted to 

2840
04:00:27,365 --> 04:00:29,589
the presentation, I didn't get 
to talk about prioritization and

2841
04:00:29,847 --> 04:00:31,847
how do you choose which tactics 
are 

2842
04:00:34,685 --> 04:00:36,955
more relevant in one of the 
things we actually experimented 

2843
04:00:37,195 --> 04:00:40,857
with was how do you prioritize 
and score attack patterns? I 

2844
04:00:41,989 --> 04:00:43,989
think the 

2845
04:00:47,216 --> 04:00:49,216
MITRE  

2846
04:00:52,350 --> 04:00:54,350
ATT&CK  frame is, being able to 

2847
04:00:58,038 --> 04:01:00,798
enrich it with not just how 
serious something is but is it 

2848
04:01:01,047 --> 04:01:03,249
relevant to my environment? 
Multiple layers of that's going 

2849
04:01:03,496 --> 04:01:10,021
capabilities is very need to go.
>> That is a great path the 

2850
04:01:10,269 --> 04:01:12,491
beyond. For those in the 
communities where this might be 

2851
04:01:12,739 --> 04:01:15,601
the first time they've heard of 
Zeek  do you have any 

2852
04:01:15,853 --> 04:01:17,853
recommendations for resources? 

2853
04:01:21,106 --> 04:01:23,106
>> 

2854
04:01:25,263 --> 04:01:29,021
Yes. zeek.arc Has a lot that you
can download. 

2855
04:01:29,022 --> 04:01:32,227
>> Thank you for your time, 
Alan. Thank you for joining us 

2856
04:01:32,472 --> 04:01:34,472
for the 

2857
04:01:37,381 --> 04:01:40,510
ATT&CK.con  session. We will be 
back and a little bit with great

2858
04:01:40,753 --> 04:01:43,209
afternoon talks. ATT&CK.con will
be back after we all get some 

2859
04:01:43,463 --> 04:01:45,463
food . Let's do 

2860
04:01:49,957 --> 04:01:51,957
it. 
>>

2861
04:22:31,647 --> 04:22:35,563
We will be getting started in a 
few minutes. Please find your 

2862
04:22:35,863 --> 04:22:37,863
seats.

2863
04:24:27,426 --> 04:24:30,196
We continue. Please give a warm 
welcome to Katie Nicholas. 

2864
04:24:30,197 --> 04:24:32,197
>> [ Applause ] 
>>

2865
04:24:36,367 --> 04:24:39,862
Thank you all. I hope you had a 
great lunch, thank you for 

2866
04:24:40,147 --> 04:24:42,666
sponsoring that for us. You're 
not going to regret sticking 

2867
04:24:42,937 --> 04:24:46,573
around I know your little tired 
but get some caffeine because 

2868
04:24:46,847 --> 04:24:52,312
there are some great talks 
coming up. I want to start off 

2869
04:24:52,599 --> 04:24:57,779
after lunch with a splash, the 
next speaker is [ Indiscernible 

2870
04:24:58,217 --> 04:25:00,704
] who is a Senior Malware 
Researcher, ESET. Many companies

2871
04:25:00,980 --> 04:25:04,314
who started to map  to attack 
and that's been awesome to see 

2872
04:25:04,592 --> 04:25:09,058
that they have been contributors
sending us different group 

2873
04:25:09,329 --> 04:25:12,644
software technique ideas but all
of that so Robert is going to be

2874
04:25:12,921 --> 04:25:15,689
talking about why they use 
attack in the first place and 

2875
04:25:15,968 --> 04:25:18,273
giving you examples. Those 
tactics techniques and 

2876
04:25:18,713 --> 04:25:20,912
procedures were was love those 
juicy details about how 

2877
04:25:21,192 --> 04:25:23,436
adversaries using those 
techniques. Please join me in 

2878
04:25:23,712 --> 04:25:28,395
welcoming Robert Lipovsky. 
>> Thank you.

2879
04:25:33,486 --> 04:25:35,989
Hello everyone. Thank you for 
the introduction. It is a 

2880
04:25:36,272 --> 04:25:40,955
pleasure to be here. The talk is
going to be about the most 

2881
04:25:41,229 --> 04:25:43,912
interesting techniques of two 
infamous APD groups that need no

2882
04:25:44,200 --> 04:25:50,722
introduction. Over the 12 years 
that I have been working in 

2883
04:25:50,997 --> 04:25:53,568
malware research I have the 
privilege of working with some 

2884
04:25:53,841 --> 04:25:55,935
of the most skilled reverse 
engineers and threat 

2885
04:25:56,222 --> 04:26:00,521
researchers, so credit goes to 
them for some of the discoveries

2886
04:26:00,804 --> 04:26:04,579
that I will be talking about. 
Before we get to the main scope 

2887
04:26:04,858 --> 04:26:11,714
of the ATT&CK an introduction 
about  how we use it, we started

2888
04:26:11,991 --> 04:26:14,490
augmenting our threat reports 
not only with Ayers sees but 

2889
04:26:14,935 --> 04:26:17,260
also ATT&CK mappings .

2890
04:26:26,295 --> 04:26:29,330
This is just a snippet for the 
example. The list is much 

2891
04:26:29,603 --> 04:26:32,929
longer, but you can get an idea 
so there's the technique and a 

2892
04:26:33,214 --> 04:26:35,214
description of how the 
particular malware uses that 

2893
04:26:35,430 --> 04:26:40,992
technique. Also for similar 
reasons, and in a similar way, 

2894
04:26:41,269 --> 04:26:44,905
we are not being ATT&CK in our 
solution 

2895
04:26:50,467 --> 04:26:52,962
whenever that was feasible and 
possible because there are very 

2896
04:26:53,248 --> 04:26:56,767
level of granularity for that. 
Those were the external uses,

2897
04:27:03,692 --> 04:27:07,315
leveraging the common text on 
any aspect of

2898
04:27:12,376 --> 04:27:15,632
ATT&CK but using it internally 
is one of the gods for enhancing

2899
04:27:15,905 --> 04:27:18,451
enterprise inspector and 
improving the analytics , but I 

2900
04:27:18,732 --> 04:27:21,222
won't go into the details 
because that we've been hearing 

2901
04:27:21,503 --> 04:27:24,435
all about those things at this 
conference. You might have read 

2902
04:27:24,711 --> 04:27:29,442
and grade log post on the 
subject. Let's get to those 

2903
04:27:29,843 --> 04:27:33,605
APD's and the interesting 
techniques. This is not going to

2904
04:27:33,879 --> 04:27:37,893
be a comprehensive listing at 
all that will make for much 

2905
04:27:38,174 --> 04:27:41,634
longer presentation. Just some 
highlights which I thought were 

2906
04:27:41,936 --> 04:27:43,936
really interesting and 
noteworthy. The first group and 

2907
04:27:44,180 --> 04:27:46,180
because

2908
04:27:48,386 --> 04:27:51,215
of the lack of time, I selected 
one particular software that 

2909
04:27:51,489 --> 04:27:53,489
they were using. That was APD 
28.

2910
04:27:57,062 --> 04:28:03,160
Last year we found out that they
used the first kit in the wild. 

2911
04:28:03,434 --> 04:28:06,429
This was a pretty significant 
deal, running code

2912
04:28:10,317 --> 04:28:13,357
from the SPI flash memory. The 
first thing that runs when you 

2913
04:28:13,633 --> 04:28:17,579
start up your computer, before 
Windows is loaded, before 

2914
04:28:17,859 --> 04:28:20,788
software has a chance to learn, 
that's a very powerful mechanism

2915
04:28:21,847 --> 04:28:25,453
and gives the attackers an 
ability to withstand not only 

2916
04:28:25,728 --> 04:28:30,255
complete life of the system but 
a hard drive replacement. They 

2917
04:28:30,696 --> 04:28:37,439
use this against attacks, and 
attacks against targets in 

2918
04:28:37,716 --> 04:28:44,877
Europe. You can read all of the 
details in the paper. I will 

2919
04:28:45,149 --> 04:28:47,412
just mention that they drew 
their inspiration from [ 

2920
04:28:47,695 --> 04:28:50,293
Indiscernible ] which was 
legitimate piece of antitheft 

2921
04:28:51,036 --> 04:28:53,894
solution. And

2922
04:28:58,215 --> 04:29:00,215
in the solution this powerful 
persistence mechanism makes 

2923
04:29:00,432 --> 04:29:04,849
sense. If a thief was able to 
get rid of the solution it 

2924
04:29:05,122 --> 04:29:08,099
wouldn't be a very good 
antitheft tool. It is featured 

2925
04:29:08,378 --> 04:29:14,738
in ATT&CK are listed under the 
system  firmware technique. 

2926
04:29:15,018 --> 04:29:18,672
There are some other examples of
the bear. Basically before no 

2927
04:29:18,944 --> 04:29:25,805
jacks unify work in the realm of
theoretical proof of concept. Or

2928
04:29:26,076 --> 04:29:30,714
reported according to leaks 
reported functionality of 

2929
04:29:30,990 --> 04:29:36,378
government agencies or the 
hacking software. Let's move on 

2930
04:29:36,658 --> 04:29:39,696
to the second group where we 
will spend more time looking at 

2931
04:29:39,977 --> 04:29:42,505
their techniques. They are under
the umbrella term as

2932
04:29:45,947 --> 04:29:50,413
sand warm. We go into a little 
bit lower level of granularity. 

2933
04:29:50,815 --> 04:29:55,294
Which stems from the way we were
tracking them. The first threat 

2934
04:29:55,695 --> 04:30:01,378
cluster and activities related 
to that was black energy. It 

2935
04:30:01,658 --> 04:30:07,591
facilitated the most infamous 
campaign was that it facilitated

2936
04:30:08,241 --> 04:30:12,509
the first-ever power grade 
blackouts called by a cyber 

2937
04:30:12,962 --> 04:30:20,064
attack. Then there was [ 
Indiscernible ] referred to [ 

2938
04:30:20,340 --> 04:30:23,140
Indiscernible ]. This was I 
would say one of the most 

2939
04:30:23,415 --> 04:30:26,184
cunning pieces of malware we 
ever revealed. And the reason is

2940
04:30:26,460 --> 04:30:28,460
that not just

2941
04:30:31,254 --> 04:30:33,918
, it is able to communicate with
industrial control systems 

2942
04:30:34,194 --> 04:30:38,791
hardware using their very own 
language. It had an 

2943
04:30:39,066 --> 04:30:41,066
implementation of four different
industrial

2944
04:30:44,687 --> 04:30:46,896
protocol so effectively this 
model was bridging the gap 

2945
04:30:47,167 --> 04:30:50,213
between IT and OT attacks. We 
also saw a shift from black 

2946
04:30:50,490 --> 04:30:55,815
energy to what we call [ 
Indiscernible ]. There were a 

2947
04:30:56,089 --> 04:31:01,466
lot of things in common like 
shared infrastructure, but the 

2948
04:31:01,740 --> 04:31:04,493
malware was different. The 
reason why we call it that was 

2949
04:31:04,771 --> 04:31:06,889
because they were using the 
telegram API for 

2950
04:31:07,198 --> 04:31:09,132
command-and-control 
communication. And not only the 

2951
04:31:09,133 --> 04:31:14,226
tools change but the focus, so 
it is hard to conclusively say 

2952
04:31:14,507 --> 04:31:17,926
that they are exactly the same 
people, the same group behind 

2953
04:31:18,208 --> 04:31:20,208
it. And

2954
04:31:23,450 --> 04:31:25,685
the focus shifted from critical 
infrastructure in the energy 

2955
04:31:25,966 --> 04:31:28,627
sector toward the financial 
sector. The most famous attack 

2956
04:31:28,902 --> 04:31:31,930
which spread beyond the borders 
of Ukraine were [ Indiscernible 

2957
04:31:32,212 --> 04:31:34,212
].

2958
04:31:35,634 --> 04:31:39,085
In parallel to the [ 
Indiscernible ], there was also 

2959
04:31:39,500 --> 04:31:42,825
energy which we consider the 
successor of BlackEnergy staying

2960
04:31:43,103 --> 04:31:46,293
with that original focus of 
critical  infrastructure and 

2961
04:31:46,578 --> 04:31:51,143
energy companies and still 
active until today. There was 

2962
04:31:51,419 --> 04:31:55,349
just a quick overview of that 
group. Let's take a look at the 

2963
04:31:55,625 --> 04:31:59,138
techniques they were using. For 
initial access, they were mostly

2964
04:31:59,756 --> 04:32:01,867
using spearfishing that is not 
surprising.

2965
04:32:05,496 --> 04:32:08,168
With various methods of gaining 
execution whether it was Pierce 

2966
04:32:08,440 --> 04:32:12,072
social engineering are also 
using exploits even zero-based. 

2967
04:32:12,346 --> 04:32:18,946
This get to the more interesting
and not that common stuff. They 

2968
04:32:19,249 --> 04:32:21,249
didn't supply chain compromises.

2969
04:32:25,815 --> 04:32:28,417
Starting off from the infection 
of [ Indiscernible ].

2970
04:32:32,348 --> 04:32:37,347
There were also other cases. 
Another interesting technique 

2971
04:32:37,626 --> 04:32:43,526
was used by great energy, that 
was exploiting a public facing 

2972
04:32:43,818 --> 04:32:46,608
application pacifically it was 
trying to gain entry inside the 

2973
04:32:46,887 --> 04:32:52,043
network via vulnerable Web 
server. A couple of other 

2974
04:32:52,324 --> 04:32:56,111
interesting notable techniques 
by this group, there were black 

2975
04:32:56,393 --> 04:32:59,479
energy plug-ins [ Indiscernible 
]. Targeting specific versions 

2976
04:32:59,753 --> 04:33:06,836
of chain of the settings, to 
enable backdoor and remote 

2977
04:33:07,261 --> 04:33:09,261
unintended access to that 
effective machine even so 

2978
04:33:09,485 --> 04:33:14,719
basically the ability to gain 
regain entry even after all of 

2979
04:33:15,004 --> 04:33:17,861
the other tools were detected 
and cleaned up the system.

2980
04:33:24,963 --> 04:33:27,517
Another black energy plug-in 
which acted out of parasitic 

2981
04:33:27,800 --> 04:33:30,078
infector. This was really 
interesting because we don't see

2982
04:33:30,360 --> 04:33:33,408
a lot of these viruslike malware
nowadays. We saw some [ 

2983
04:33:33,685 --> 04:33:37,520
Indiscernible ] circulating that
were infected by this plug-in. 

2984
04:33:37,920 --> 04:33:42,536
The third example I want to 
mention I guess the people in 

2985
04:33:42,815 --> 04:33:44,815
the room will recognize this,

2986
04:33:48,116 --> 04:33:50,596
that was execution via HMI but 
in this particular example 

2987
04:33:50,871 --> 04:33:54,526
commit was targeting somatic 
simplicity HMI. There were also 

2988
04:33:54,814 --> 04:33:58,650
others that were targeted such 
as [ Indiscernible ]. That

2989
04:34:02,903 --> 04:34:05,978
would be launched by simplicity 
in this case and it would run 

2990
04:34:06,253 --> 04:34:09,520
the first stage of black energy.
The details about this are

2991
04:34:13,471 --> 04:34:18,217
this advisory so you can go 
there and check it out. This is 

2992
04:34:18,502 --> 04:34:21,472
interesting because this was one
of the first indicators that 

2993
04:34:22,153 --> 04:34:27,802
this group had an interest in 
critical infrastructure in ICS 

2994
04:34:28,079 --> 04:34:33,173
this was of course before the 
blackouts happen. Speaking of, 

2995
04:34:33,574 --> 04:34:40,284
let's talk about impact, because
if I was to describe this group 

2996
04:34:40,562 --> 04:34:43,932
with just one word I would call 
it impactful. For the havoc they

2997
04:34:44,215 --> 04:34:50,579
caused in Ukraine, whether it 
was with blackouts, which left 

2998
04:34:50,857 --> 04:34:54,568
hundreds of thousands of people 
without electricity. Or with the

2999
04:34:54,843 --> 04:34:57,619
pseudo-route somewhere going 
beyond the borders and affecting

3000
04:34:57,892 --> 04:35:01,418
some of the world's largest 
corporations. This take a look 

3001
04:35:01,696 --> 04:35:06,702
at the in destroyer impact. The 
primary one of course was the 

3002
04:35:06,986 --> 04:35:13,873
ability to deenergize that 
substation. It was doing that as

3003
04:35:14,147 --> 04:35:16,684
I already mentioned by sending 
commands to these types of 

3004
04:35:16,961 --> 04:35:23,453
devices. Opening celebrities and
speaking the language of these 

3005
04:35:23,739 --> 04:35:26,526
devices. That's an important 
thing to say, there were no 

3006
04:35:26,806 --> 04:35:29,839
exploits, there were no software
vulnerabilities involving this. 

3007
04:35:30,255 --> 04:35:35,938
Full abilities however were 
involved in the second type. It 

3008
04:35:36,211 --> 04:35:40,376
affected the operations that the
workstation that was carried out

3009
04:35:40,651 --> 04:35:45,036
by the [ Indiscernible ]. This 
also went after the protection 

3010
04:35:45,314 --> 04:35:48,753
relays, and it was abusing a 
fault that was

3011
04:35:55,885 --> 04:35:58,145
using vulnerability. Not in 
those particular cases, and it 

3012
04:35:58,425 --> 04:36:01,484
rendered the protection relays 
and responsive. The third impact

3013
04:36:03,355 --> 04:36:05,825
although if we were to consider 
the ICS

3014
04:36:11,086 --> 04:36:13,585
attack it would be classified 
little bit differently in a 

3015
04:36:13,860 --> 04:36:16,076
different level of granularity 
that basically the third way 

3016
04:36:16,530 --> 04:36:19,152
that in destroyer affected the 
operation of an electrical 

3017
04:36:19,426 --> 04:36:21,426
substation was by the data

3018
04:36:24,685 --> 04:36:27,915
component so that one did not go
after the protection relays but 

3019
04:36:28,190 --> 04:36:31,271
after the HMI's used the control
and monitor them, and the 

3020
04:36:31,554 --> 04:36:34,606
purpose of that was to amplify 
the impact. To make recovery 

3021
04:36:34,881 --> 04:36:41,149
from the attack more difficult. 
Wipers, these disruptive 

3022
04:36:41,422 --> 04:36:46,374
components are signature thing. 
We observed an evolution of this

3023
04:36:46,647 --> 04:36:51,224
through the years that we were 
tracking them from the black 

3024
04:36:51,499 --> 04:36:53,499
energy plug-ins through 
standalone components.

3025
04:36:57,802 --> 04:37:01,453
We had filed encryptors 
masquerading as rent somewhere 

3026
04:37:01,866 --> 04:37:04,685
reasonably [ Indiscernible ] but
also others before that that had

3027
04:37:05,252 --> 04:37:12,181
the same basic idea. And, they 
even in some cases they even 

3028
04:37:12,455 --> 04:37:17,732
through a little bit of a prank 
intended to intimidate the 

3029
04:37:18,008 --> 04:37:22,257
victim so any [ Indiscernible ] 
fancier, you will probably 

3030
04:37:22,544 --> 04:37:25,342
recognize this. To finish off 
the talk, it is great that

3031
04:37:31,570 --> 04:37:34,769
ATT&CK is evolving, Weaver 
started using  the one impact, 

3032
04:37:35,053 --> 04:37:41,077
the one tactic that there was 
missing was impact and we are 

3033
04:37:41,351 --> 04:37:45,983
happy that that was added. If I 
was to predict the future 

3034
04:37:46,258 --> 04:37:50,084
expansion I would say that we 
can probably expect even more 

3035
04:37:50,363 --> 04:37:54,182
criminal types of impact being 
added. We are already seeing the

3036
04:37:54,625 --> 04:37:58,022
boundaries between threat types 
of motivations already becoming 

3037
04:37:58,295 --> 04:38:02,414
the regular. With that, I thank 
you for listening,

3038
04:38:07,067 --> 04:38:08,718
use ATT&CK and contribute. Thank
you.

She is watching from Missouri.

3043
04:38:51,810 --> 04:38:53,810
This individual has been 
tweeting and has consistently 

3044
04:38:54,035 --> 04:38:57,347
been I showed some of his tweets
earlier this morning. Honestly 

3045
04:38:57,669 --> 04:39:00,447
this one became up with a 
drinking game. You can reply 

3046

with your own take a shot for 
privatization, biases, reading 

3047
04:39:05,027 --> 04:39:07,536
an awesome tree, spreadsheets 
are Excel, Jupiter notebooks and

3048

requirements of presenter wears

a costume. We will have to see 
if we hit any of those. Please

>> Thank you. 

3053
04:39:29,994 --> 04:39:34,326
>> Robert talked about threaded 
talent that pivots very nicely 

3054
04:39:34,622 --> 04:39:36,841
into the next talk which focuses
on purple teaming.

3055
04:39:43,353 --> 04:39:46,872
The red team are still go off 
and do crazy cool things, they 

3056
04:39:47,150 --> 04:39:49,920
do things that real adversaries 
are doing. That is the idea 

3057
04:39:50,201 --> 04:39:52,707
behind adversary. The next 
presenter will cover purple team

3058
04:39:53,307 --> 04:39:55,971
where the red and blue come 
together and is appropriate 

3059
04:39:56,247 --> 04:39:58,247
because of how it started.

3060
04:40:05,730 --> 04:40:08,777
We will be talking about how the
Intel can help drive successful 

3061
04:40:09,053 --> 04:40:12,099
purple teaming and we will hear 
from the success story one thing

3062
04:40:12,374 --> 04:40:14,879
that I love about these 
dissenters that come from two 

3063
04:40:15,151 --> 04:40:16,991
different organizations bringing
together two different 

3064
04:40:16,992 --> 04:40:20,251
perspectives. Please join me in 
welcoming Daniel [ Indiscernible

3065
04:40:20,534 --> 04:40:23,013
] and [ Indiscernible ].

3067
04:40:34,574 --> 04:40:39,659
I am Matt, I work on the 
security team at Priceline.

3068
04:40:45,146 --> 04:40:47,909
You may or may not know 
Priceline is a pretty small 

3069
04:40:48,185 --> 04:40:50,687
company which means we have an 
extremely powerful but also 

3070
04:40:50,966 --> 04:40:53,771
pretty small security team. Sort
of definitionally we are all 

3071
04:40:54,048 --> 04:40:57,541
generalists, and that means we 
skew more blue than red. Of 

3072
04:40:57,824 --> 04:41:00,913
course we see the value in 
adversarial testing, but we have

3073
04:41:01,187 --> 04:41:07,174
some problems with rent and 
repeats third-party red team. 

3074
04:41:07,450 --> 04:41:10,309
For the last year we have been 
doing purple team simulations.

3075
04:41:17,240 --> 04:41:20,309
We found that to be a super 
successful way to work together 

3076
04:41:20,582 --> 04:41:23,907
to level up both teams, and the 
purple teams that we run are 

3077
04:41:24,179 --> 04:41:27,523
structured around the framework.
We are part of a holding company

3078
04:41:35,676 --> 04:41:38,987
, we own kayak, booking.com, 
open table, and I have seen the 

3079
04:41:39,260 --> 04:41:41,791
outcome of similar purple team 
operations repeated at all of 

3080
04:41:42,069 --> 04:41:45,377
those brands. So we have learned
more from what they have done. 

3081
04:41:45,661 --> 04:41:49,769
Just to be definitional for us, 
when I say a purple team I mean 

3082
04:41:50,060 --> 04:41:52,060
third-party adversaries working 
with my in-house defenders for 

3083
04:41:52,275 --> 04:41:57,209
about a week, working through 
what we can and cannot do. 

3084
04:41:57,610 --> 04:42:00,796
That's the point of this talk is
what went well and the 

3085
04:42:01,068 --> 04:42:03,561
exercises, where we have 
improved and what we will do 

3086
04:42:03,841 --> 04:42:05,797
next. 
>> I am Daniel and [ 

3087
04:42:05,798 --> 04:42:11,644
Indiscernible ]. We will get 
into it. What are the problems 

3088
04:42:11,917 --> 04:42:14,615
we are seeing? Security

3089
04:42:18,505 --> 04:42:20,505
going up astronomically 
especially the detection space 

3090
04:42:20,611 --> 04:42:25,112
that in terms of metrics and how
you can track prior to attack 

3091
04:42:25,385 --> 04:42:30,516
you don't see sort of strong 
ways to measure how well that [ 

3092
04:42:31,328 --> 04:42:33,328
Indiscernible ].

3093
04:42:38,430 --> 04:42:41,709
The other thing we are seeing is
the red blue confrontation often

3094
04:42:41,986 --> 04:42:44,473
times we see teams have 
different metrics that drive the

3095
04:42:44,747 --> 04:42:47,523
success. Of the ones that are 
opposed to each other. 

3096
04:42:47,795 --> 04:42:50,172
Impossible to share information 
and [ Indiscernible ].

3097
04:42:54,488 --> 04:42:56,933
We are seeing some symptoms [ 
Indiscernible ].

3098
04:43:02,646 --> 04:43:08,652
We would just do a traditional 
penetration test and have some 

3099
04:43:09,062 --> 04:43:11,062
awkward discussions.

04:43:13,416 --> 04:43:17,437
We will get into a whole bunch 
of what-ifs and we realized they

3101
04:43:17,711 --> 04:43:20,464
were doing a substitution where 
they were trying to answer hard 

3102
04:43:20,741 --> 04:43:22,741
question [ Indiscernible ].

3103
04:43:29,633 --> 04:43:33,402
>> I often said those things to 
make sure you noted the report 

3104
04:43:33,678 --> 04:43:37,278
the strong detection so when my 
boss reads it in as we are not 

3105
04:43:37,562 --> 04:43:40,781
complete. I think we had some of
the same problems with red 

3106
04:43:41,055 --> 04:43:43,878
teaming, one of the things that 
frustrated me the most was 

3107
04:43:44,154 --> 04:43:46,945
repeat findings. Test over 
tests, you know, [ Indiscernible

3108
04:43:47,226 --> 04:43:51,281
] I feel like there is one 
sitting up there on my network. 

3109
04:43:51,558 --> 04:43:56,035
And I think part of the reason 
we have those repeat findings, 

3110
04:43:56,436 --> 04:43:59,755
because the red team would run, 
take a week to write a report, 

3111
04:44:00,027 --> 04:44:03,250
said the report, read through 
it, that time it's been a month 

3112
04:44:03,526 --> 04:44:06,597
and the locks have rolled and 
the memory has gotten stale and 

3113
04:44:06,872 --> 04:44:13,502
we didn't know if we saw this. 
The loop was taking too long to 

3114
04:44:13,790 --> 04:44:16,549
feed back into the team to do 
something actionable with the 

3115
04:44:16,826 --> 04:44:18,826
test that we wanted to do.

3116
04:44:22,651 --> 04:44:26,428
>> This is our slide about why 
we chose during an attack.

3117
04:44:31,585 --> 04:44:35,100
When we were doing a purple team
before attack we would base it 

3118
04:44:35,383 --> 04:44:39,263
off of a good thing. With the 
talk we were able to establish [

3119
04:44:39,536 --> 04:44:42,516
Indiscernible ] this also to 
align with industry to 

3120
04:44:42,915 --> 04:44:44,915
communicate standards.

3121
04:44:47,836 --> 04:44:51,296
That helps provide a live 
defensibility for why the test 

3122
04:44:51,569 --> 04:44:53,988
is and what the completions are.
[ Indiscernible ].

3123
04:45:06,921 --> 04:45:09,876
>> As part of that holding 
company we are competitive.

3124
04:45:14,651 --> 04:45:18,432
With the kayak team and the open
table team. We want to see how 

3125
04:45:18,709 --> 04:45:21,741
our coverage maps to theirs. We 
have taken findings from these 

3126
04:45:22,016 --> 04:45:25,334
with the idea of going to the 
vendors, and saying we bought 

3127
04:45:25,608 --> 04:45:29,117
this product from you we feel 
like you should cover the 

3128
04:45:29,389 --> 04:45:32,142
specific things here's something
that can trigger it why aren't 

3129
04:45:32,421 --> 04:45:34,421
you helping us? And we

3130
04:45:41,104 --> 04:45:43,341
function a lot by dashboards, 
burned-out lists, and having 

3131
04:45:43,623 --> 04:45:46,417
done these exercises three 
times, we know what we want to 

3132
04:45:46,693 --> 04:45:50,612
do, what we want to get to and 
it is easy for us to visualize 

3133
04:45:50,897 --> 04:45:54,459
and so bite sized for progress.
>> What are our objectives? We 

3134
04:45:54,730 --> 04:45:58,608
have four key was the first is 
to improve the detection 

3135
04:45:58,892 --> 04:46:01,858
capabilities to the target 
emulation. The key word is I 

3136
04:46:02,132 --> 04:46:04,132
want to draw is [ Indiscernible 
].

3137
04:46:20,317 --> 04:46:22,317
The organization understands [ 
Indiscernible ].

3138
04:46:27,166 --> 04:46:32,497
>> The first round was mostly 
covering [ Indiscernible ]. It 

3139
04:46:32,785 --> 04:46:36,380
has been talked a lot in the 
last two days but really do we 

3140
04:46:36,666 --> 04:46:39,500
have the right coverage, and as 
we read progress doing these 

3141
04:46:39,782 --> 04:46:41,782
we've been able to develop [ 
Indiscernible ].

3142
04:46:45,280 --> 04:46:48,493
It helps us that a roadmap for 
18 months.

3143
04:46:51,734 --> 04:46:54,538
>> There are number of 
constraints so we are doing 

3144
04:46:54,809 --> 04:46:57,764
these over about a week keeping 
people on the team. [ 

3145
04:46:58,038 --> 04:47:00,038
Indiscernible ].

3146
04:47:24,172 --> 04:47:33,647
>> We think in terms of thread 
families. It is sort of a threat

3147
04:47:33,922 --> 04:47:36,290
actor and technique. We 
prioritize those that are [ 

3148
04:47:36,566 --> 04:47:43,739
Indiscernible ]. Port knocking 
is not something we prioritize. 

3149
04:47:44,141 --> 04:47:47,965
We put thought into it before we
run these, we know we want to 

3150
04:47:48,263 --> 04:47:50,230
test coming one [ Indiscernible 
]. 

3151

>>

3153
04:48:30,654 --> 04:48:35,486
I think the most important thing
here is to know on our side when

3154
04:48:35,763 --> 04:48:37,763
we should

3155
04:48:41,219 --> 04:48:43,894
leave something for later. We 
just don't have the telemetry 

3156
04:48:44,174 --> 04:48:48,048
and we will not edit this week 
set it aside we will pick it up 

3157
04:48:48,325 --> 04:48:49,419
later. 
>> [ Indiscernible ]

>>

3159
04:52:53,976 --> 04:52:56,482
I would rather have a team of 
engineers who have 

3160
04:52:56,762 --> 04:52:58,762
accountability around the 
detections we create and respond

3161
04:52:58,987 --> 04:53:02,842
to. Because of that we are 
pretty disciplined about writing

3162
04:53:03,127 --> 04:53:06,359
good alerts and having a strong 
standard about how we produce an

3163
04:53:06,650 --> 04:53:08,650
action. Almost all of our 
telemetry throws

3164
04:53:12,591 --> 04:53:15,786
through slunk and all of that 
fires into a slot channel but 

3165
04:53:16,061 --> 04:53:18,554
this is awesome because it's 
eye-catching have these bus we 

3166
04:53:18,825 --> 04:53:22,456
can respond to we don't have to 
be in the office every alert we 

3167
04:53:22,733 --> 04:53:26,305
have will need to a query or 
playbook that will show us 

3168
04:53:26,579 --> 04:53:30,184
exactly what is going on. We 
also keep all of these on a big 

3169
04:53:30,461 --> 04:53:32,953
list and all of those are 
taxonomies by tax every 

3170
04:53:33,231 --> 04:53:37,043
detection we have if it links to
a DTP that's in the spreadsheet 

3171
04:53:37,316 --> 04:53:40,635
and someone who's looking at it 
from an alert doesn't know why 

3172
04:53:40,915 --> 04:53:44,541
we wrote it originally is that 
he has some context what it is 

3173
04:53:44,831 --> 04:53:48,616
what it was created and who 
wrote it. Also a lot of these 

3174
04:53:48,892 --> 04:53:51,772
alerts we created through the 
purple team process. And what is

3175
04:53:52,045 --> 04:53:55,101
interesting there is we don't 
know who wrote this it could've 

3176
04:53:55,548 --> 04:53:59,191
been a red team or who wrote the
report and that's what's most 

3177
04:53:59,468 --> 04:54:02,537
valuable to us. The people who 
are doing the damage. Understand

3178
04:54:02,810 --> 04:54:07,135
what we see on our side whether 
we have the log in or not and as

3179
04:54:07,406 --> 04:54:09,934
Daniel said leaving it better 
than they found it.

3180
04:54:10,210 --> 04:54:19,366
>> My job is so hard because we 
have to do everything perfectly 

3181
04:54:19,638 --> 04:54:23,583
and they do never hear from me. 
The attackers are to get it 

3182
04:54:23,857 --> 04:54:27,935
right once and then it is game 
over. That is kind of a lie I 

3183
04:54:28,222 --> 04:54:31,611
don't think is watching, but 
what we found is not only do 

3184
04:54:31,883 --> 04:54:35,421
attackers only have to make it 
wrong once, but in our 

3185
04:54:35,697 --> 04:54:37,730
environment at least, attackers 
make mistakes. And many

3186
04:54:47,055 --> 04:54:49,737
, much of the telemetry or 
detections is based around 

3187
04:54:50,010 --> 04:54:52,504
finding those mistakes. If you 
did something perfect the first 

3188
04:54:52,778 --> 04:54:56,154
time we may not fire on it but 
as the attackers are enumerating

3189
04:54:56,430 --> 04:55:00,217
and feeling to the network that 
is a gold mine of TTP's that we 

3190
04:55:00,494 --> 04:55:02,494
can alert on.

We have gone through an exercise
whether they create tickets for 

3195
04:58:39,541 --> 04:58:42,923
us come with a hand as one and 
we create committees been great,

3196

going back.

3198
04:58:51,874 --> 04:58:55,214
What have we learned and what 
did we get out of working with 

3199
04:58:55,487 --> 04:58:59,156
purple teams? I think the first 
thing to remember is this is not

3200
04:58:59,444 --> 04:59:04,021
a red team, not a pen test and 
although we are bringing in a 

3201
04:59:04,296 --> 04:59:06,296
third party, we should 
contribute as much resourcing 

3202
04:59:06,565 --> 04:59:10,078
and do just as much work. The 
prep work is extremely 

3203
04:59:10,352 --> 04:59:12,352
important. We have learned that 
over

3204
04:59:16,018 --> 04:59:18,570
iterations the basics getting 
stuff ready in advance but also 

3205
04:59:18,859 --> 04:59:22,193
knowing what you want to get out
of it. Bringing your cats and 

3206
04:59:22,468 --> 04:59:24,468
your flexible cats is extremely 
important.

3207
04:59:28,008 --> 04:59:31,114
Because what you think you're 
going to do on Tuesday may or 

3208
04:59:31,389 --> 04:59:35,018
may not work out, it is great to
be able to drop something and 

3209
04:59:35,294 --> 04:59:38,784
move on to diving into a couple 
of those things, what was most 

3210
04:59:39,065 --> 04:59:41,279
important to us was 
communication. A month before 

3211
04:59:41,553 --> 04:59:44,317
the purple team, we start 
publicizing it to the tech 

3212
04:59:44,590 --> 04:59:49,710
teams. In the meeting we say 
this is coming up, we let people

3213
04:59:49,993 --> 04:59:53,890
know what we plan to test, we 
let people know where we will be

3214
04:59:54,173 --> 04:59:56,942
physically, so that they can 
drop in and see what is 

3215
04:59:57,212 --> 04:59:59,212
happening. We set up a

3216
05:00:02,500 --> 05:00:05,601
channel with the team make sure 
they have their account set up 

3217
05:00:05,878 --> 05:00:09,131
before they show up. We agree to
a rhythm of communication of 

3218
05:00:09,411 --> 05:00:13,111
standups and everything else, it
is just so much better to have 

3219
05:00:13,397 --> 05:00:17,029
that ready when the constraint 
the one week of red team as we 

3220
05:00:17,309 --> 05:00:20,316
have walked into the environment
that we think about what we 

3221
05:00:20,598 --> 05:00:24,494
think we will want to cover. But
we think we want to test what we

3222
05:00:24,776 --> 05:00:28,136
know we want to ignore either 
based on what we know from our 

3223
05:00:28,414 --> 05:00:31,631
CTI what we see in the 
environment in the past we make 

3224
05:00:31,914 --> 05:00:35,057
some assumptions about what to 
they will cover TTP's we make 

3225
05:00:35,334 --> 05:00:38,727
sure that the purple team have 
access to those tools. We put 

3226
05:00:39,001 --> 05:00:42,020
those to the test. More than 
anything else is the 

3227
05:00:42,293 --> 05:00:44,517
communication, talking to 
everyone in the [ Indiscernible 

3228
05:00:44,805 --> 05:00:53,555
]. The way I described it across
the [ Indiscernible ]. When we 

3229
05:00:53,831 --> 05:00:56,917
do our PCI testing, I want no 
findings of that report because 

3230
05:00:57,197 --> 05:00:59,197
why would I?

3231
05:01:01,645 --> 05:01:05,066
In this case I want all of the 
findings. I want to know 

3232
05:01:05,344 --> 05:01:09,753
everything that could possibly 
be wrong so that we can 

3233
05:01:10,029 --> 05:01:13,245
prioritize it and fix it on her 
own timeline with our own 

3234
05:01:13,521 --> 05:01:16,314
privatization. The most recent 
purple team we did a few weeks 

3235
05:01:16,591 --> 05:01:19,964
ago new person I just joined my 
team that we took this was 

3236
05:01:20,238 --> 05:01:22,238
fantastic on boarding for them.

3237
05:01:26,627 --> 05:01:29,383
They had immediate access to the
tools, they solve the detections

3238
05:01:29,666 --> 05:01:32,981
that worked and did not work and
they learned a ton from the 

3239
05:01:33,260 --> 05:01:36,047
adversarial testers and from the
team about what we prioritize in

3240
05:01:36,320 --> 05:01:39,509
our environment. When we are 
done with the week, we expect to

3241
05:01:39,786 --> 05:01:42,262
have more detections, more 
finding similar test cases. We

3244
05:01:50,644 --> 05:01:54,297
steps? The first thing to do 
when the assessment closes is to

3245
05:01:54,572 --> 05:01:57,730
start thinking about the next 
one. Your memory will never be 

3246
05:01:58,173 --> 05:02:05,867
fresher than when it is best to 
start sketching out what TTP's 

3247
05:02:06,142 --> 05:02:10,027
did we lack what telemetry do we
lack what we want to make sure 

3248
05:02:10,306 --> 05:02:13,358
we have covered when they come 
back in three months. We are 

3249
05:02:13,635 --> 05:02:16,995
huge on tech sodomizing [ 
Indiscernible ]. I will show you

3250
05:02:17,270 --> 05:02:20,501
how that works. Make sure that 
what we already have is still 

3251
05:02:20,785 --> 05:02:23,293
working, repeat tests some of 
them are revalidation the 

3252
05:02:23,568 --> 05:02:29,367
existing detections we have. And
we expect when we are done to 

3253
05:02:29,643 --> 05:02:33,232
have new stuff to hand to our 
vendors to say this worked, this

3254
05:02:33,510 --> 05:02:36,572
didn't work. How can you help us
get better? Strategically we've 

3255
05:02:36,856 --> 05:02:40,686
used the purple teaming to 
reprioritize what we are going 

3256
05:02:40,962 --> 05:02:44,049
to do especially the first 
round, you know I was a little 

3257
05:02:44,331 --> 05:02:48,967
skeptical about command history.
When I saw many places that lit 

3258
05:02:49,241 --> 05:02:53,325
up it was something to 
reprioritize and broaden to sin 

3259
05:02:53,601 --> 05:02:55,592
much more rapidly.

What am I, one of the things I 
get tied up in is managing 

3278
05:06:36,212 --> 05:06:42,206
keeping track of what detection 
roles are being used. I like how

3279
05:06:42,956 --> 05:06:45,755
you guys covered that. My 
question is with Excel sheets or

3280
05:06:46,029 --> 05:06:51,797
Google sheets let's start in the
debate, the question is does 

3281
05:06:52,561 --> 05:06:57,111
that scale once you start 
getting into multiple data 

3282
05:06:57,394 --> 05:07:01,292
sources or maybe the rule doing 
different things for instance if

3283
05:07:01,683 --> 05:07:07,431
you have in my case I've Sigma 
rules for my endpoint and I have

3284
05:07:07,707 --> 05:07:11,070
[ Indiscernible ], do you think 
that sheets of any sort can 

3285
05:07:11,355 --> 05:07:16,735
scale that rate work should 
return to something else? It is 

3286
05:07:17,011 --> 05:07:20,670
an interesting discussion. 
>> We are fortunate in that

3287
05:07:24,297 --> 05:07:27,279
we are well funded with a big 
spunk instance and pump 

3288
05:07:27,567 --> 05:07:30,090
everything through there. We can
really prioritize it that 

3289
05:07:30,364 --> 05:07:35,995
aligned what we see. But keeping
it in a spreadsheet is terrible.

3290
05:07:36,290 --> 05:07:38,862
Spreadsheets are always the 
wrong answer. The limitations of

3291
05:07:39,142 --> 05:07:41,142
the environment we have today

3292
05:07:45,015 --> 05:07:48,251
, we can do a daily backup of 
the entire configuration keep 

3293
05:07:48,524 --> 05:07:52,726
that but we haven't broken that 
down to every individual 

3294
05:07:53,000 --> 05:07:55,000
detection and alert. My

3295
05:07:57,442 --> 05:07:59,951
[ Indiscernible ] every 
detection and alert is sort of 

3296
05:08:00,234 --> 05:08:03,013
atomically represented in a 
library we can go in there and 

3297
05:08:03,298 --> 05:08:05,833
make modifications to every 
individual on will then forward 

3298
05:08:06,107 --> 05:08:09,944

But right now we know when you

>> One more question. I 

3304
05:08:41,229 --> 05:08:43,229
particularly liked the talk

3305
05:08:46,361 --> 05:08:49,361
about organizational dynamics a 
bit of a hobbyist study or of 

3306
05:08:49,638 --> 05:08:51,638
organizational

3307
05:08:53,476 --> 05:08:56,251
dynamics and the challenge of 
the red team and the team 

3308
05:08:56,524 --> 05:08:59,447
together and why that friction 
was there. Could you guys just 

3309
05:08:59,721 --> 05:09:03,398
offer a diagnostic on why that 
is, what you think that is, and 

3310
05:09:03,676 --> 05:09:06,743
what you learned as you 
instituted a purple team so we 

3311
05:09:07,031 --> 05:09:09,727
can learn from that and 
encourage more purple team 

3312
05:09:10,000 --> 05:09:12,000
activity. 
>> I think from our perspective 

3313
05:09:12,211 --> 05:09:15,291
it was people showing up once a 
year, once a quarter.

3314
05:09:19,727 --> 05:09:22,501
Locking themselves in a room, 
and walking out with a report 

3315
05:09:22,774 --> 05:09:25,277
feeling very proud of themselves
everything they had found it 

3316
05:09:25,547 --> 05:09:28,301
doesn't help with the team 
self-esteem and it doesn't as we

3317
05:09:28,577 --> 05:09:31,818
discussed produce a good 
outcome. And so a lot of it and 

3318
05:09:32,092 --> 05:09:34,848
I assume from the red team's 
perspective that is frustrating.

3319
05:09:35,122 --> 05:09:39,511
Because they do the same thing 
every week, they come back a 

3320
05:09:39,795 --> 05:09:42,783
year later and all the shells 
connect again, I can imagine

liking that.

the last thing that really

improves the red team

3327

3345
05:11:56,890 --> 05:11:59,846
, who is familiar with [ 
Indiscernible ]? That is more 

3346
05:12:00,127 --> 05:12:04,609
than I thought. For those of you
who are familiar with it, it is 

3347
05:12:04,882 --> 05:12:11,469
not a plane or real car, what it
is is it is an acronym and 

3348
05:12:11,744 --> 05:12:15,803
website. It is an attack ribbon 
that we have

3349
05:12:20,495 --> 05:12:22,729
[ Indiscernible ]. It is 
actively maintained which is 

3350
05:12:23,006 --> 05:12:26,069
nice because it wasn't for a 
while so it was really actively 

3351
05:12:26,342 --> 05:12:30,375
maintaining from 2013 to 2016 
and it had a hiatus and now it 

3352
05:12:30,816 --> 05:12:32,816
is back in a big way.

3353
05:12:36,708 --> 05:12:39,204
Besides analytics I think with 
some interesting things that a 

3354
05:12:39,486 --> 05:12:43,250
lot of people don't have. The 
data model that allows you to do

3355
05:12:43,527 --> 05:12:48,624
agnostic mappings to the data 
model and use those. So have 

3356
05:12:48,900 --> 05:12:53,386
mappings of sensors although 
there is a caveat on that which 

3357
05:12:53,659 --> 05:12:56,426
I will mention. There we have an
expiration tool called [ 

3358
05:12:56,707 --> 05:12:59,470
Indiscernible ]. It is a tool 
for showing sensors

3359
05:13:03,350 --> 05:13:05,828
data sources analytics it's 
really more like a proof of 

3360
05:13:06,103 --> 05:13:10,275
concept. It is a cool way of 
showing if you add a sensor you 

3361
05:13:10,552 --> 05:13:12,552
get more coverage [ 
Indiscernible ]

3362
05:13:15,533 --> 05:13:18,571
recently we've been doing a lot 
of stuff and just trying to 

3363
05:13:18,866 --> 05:13:21,932
increase the quality and the 
good stuff we had and make it 

3364
05:13:22,209 --> 05:13:24,456
better. Adding new analytics 
only [ Indiscernible ].

3365
05:13:28,348 --> 05:13:31,541
That is pretty awesome. Another 
one is we have converted our 

3366
05:13:31,817 --> 05:13:33,817
analytics to [ Indiscernible ].

3367
05:13:39,300 --> 05:13:43,271
Another one is we have added 
implementation. This is an 

3368
05:13:43,554 --> 05:13:47,207
example of one. As you can see [
Indiscernible ].

3369
05:13:56,166 --> 05:14:00,476
We don't really care we are 
agnostic. Our goal is really to 

3370
05:14:00,751 --> 05:14:03,058
increase the coverage of these. 
From a user perspective,

3371

3372

3374
05:14:34,145 --> 05:14:38,450
Bizarre is a set of scripts that
we have written to detect 

3375
05:14:39,136 --> 05:14:45,274
several network based analytics.
It is cool. We are on the

3387
05:23:32,352 --> 05:23:36,234
things and is led to much bigger
things. That is how it happens. 

3388
05:23:36,509 --> 05:23:40,450
But from my perspective and you 
can use for analytics.

3389
05:23:47,017 --> 05:23:50,502
We heard from people who said 
they want to see more. Grateful 

3390
05:23:50,778 --> 05:23:56,381
for all of the work.
>> [ Applause ]

3392
05:24:02,493 --> 05:24:08,090
A Twitter shout out who is 
streaming online. He took a 

3393
05:24:08,401 --> 05:24:10,401
break.

3394
05:24:13,061 --> 05:24:17,927
We will head into the break a 
short 15 minute break before we 

3395
05:24:18,201 --> 05:24:23,679
get to Adam. This is kind of one
of my favorite parts of the 

3396
05:24:23,953 --> 05:24:27,590
entire event. It is candy bar 
time. We will have a brief break

3397
05:24:27,863 --> 05:24:32,670
and this is your last chance to 
visit exhibitors. This is our 

3398
05:24:32,949 --> 05:24:36,782
final episode with Jamie 
Williams. Enjoy the candy. See 

3399
05:24:37,053 --> 05:24:39,053
you back here at 2:30 PM.

3400
05:25:16,143 --> 05:25:18,143
>>

3401
05:25:21,066 --> 05:25:24,895
How did it go? But I was happy 
with a bit I hope the audience 

3402
05:25:25,168 --> 05:25:27,921
enjoyed it. 
>> I know everyone is buzzing 

3403
05:25:28,197 --> 05:25:34,766
around. It was very interesting 
to how has the experience been? 

3404
05:25:35,037 --> 05:25:37,974
But it was very great. The 
organization was amazing and 

3405
05:25:38,246 --> 05:25:43,054
also the quality of the talks so
I'm having a great time. 

3406
05:25:43,055 --> 05:25:47,052
>> One of the things that I took
away from your talk and looking 

3407
05:25:47,325 --> 05:25:51,733
at your products is how like 
invested in your products. Can 

3408
05:25:52,010 --> 05:25:54,010
you give us a little example.

3409
05:25:58,232 --> 05:26:00,232
>> We are using

3410
05:26:04,332 --> 05:26:07,087
ATT&CK in different ways without
going into all of the specifics 

3411
05:26:07,363 --> 05:26:11,525
and details  and some other uses
probably spin up in the future, 

3412
05:26:11,800 --> 05:26:16,717
but the two different types of 
uses are external and internal. 

3413
05:26:17,131 --> 05:26:22,562
The external ones are to augment
our reporting and communication 

3414
05:26:22,838 --> 05:26:30,697
with either our readers and 
research that reports. Whether 

3415
05:26:30,974 --> 05:26:35,763
it is private or public public 
for example. And basically like 

3416
05:26:36,033 --> 05:26:44,951
using leveraging the common 
aspect. The other one is for 

3417
05:26:45,718 --> 05:26:52,276
internal purposes we have in DDR
solution and we have different 

3418
05:26:52,549 --> 05:26:55,930
rules and analytics for 
detecting things and we combine 

3419
05:26:56,691 --> 05:27:02,164
that with basically the 
capabilities and the coverage so

3420
05:27:06,353 --> 05:27:08,831
the regular stuff. 
>> One of the things for both 

3421
05:27:09,103 --> 05:27:14,348
days even last year throughout 
the entire process how key that 

3422
05:27:14,623 --> 05:27:16,774
is, has there been any other 
value added?

3423
05:27:22,733 --> 05:27:25,493
I think that is most important 
we invest heavily and threaten 

3424
05:27:25,769 --> 05:27:28,654
sharing and raising awareness so
that is quite

3425
05:27:33,501 --> 05:27:36,287
visible from our reports and the
amount of publications that we 

3426
05:27:36,562 --> 05:27:41,287
do so that was definitely one of
the main benefits. 

3427
05:27:41,288 --> 05:27:43,288
>> We appreciate it.

3428
05:27:55,481 --> 05:27:57,969
In your case studies you 
actually kind of captured the 

3429
05:27:58,246 --> 05:28:00,246
evolving nature of

3430
05:28:03,153 --> 05:28:08,850
ATT&CK. Different types of  
ATT&CK and the impact it  I 

3431
05:28:09,127 --> 05:28:12,186
wrote this question down and I 
wanted to ask you come protected

3432
05:28:15,750 --> 05:28:18,973
, do you want to go into detail 
about you are forecasting? 

3433
05:28:18,974 --> 05:28:23,135
>> I think we already see some 
criminal types of like software 

3434
05:28:23,828 --> 05:28:29,986
for example in ATT&CK but not 
too many.  There is quite a 

3435
05:28:30,258 --> 05:28:34,346
heavy focus on a PTs and 
targeted stuff rather than the 

3436
05:28:34,621 --> 05:28:36,621
crime where and

3437
05:28:39,350 --> 05:28:41,350
opportunistic stuff and 
commodity but the problem is 

3438
05:28:41,565 --> 05:28:46,561
from what we are seeing and from
the ATT&CKers detecting across 

3439
05:28:46,841 --> 05:28:50,591
the user base is that there is 
just so much of it  and 

3440
05:28:50,864 --> 05:28:53,749
sometimes you can differentiate,
you sense the primary 

3441
05:28:54,281 --> 05:28:57,412
motivations but there are so 
many overlaps and the boundaries

3442
05:28:57,999 --> 05:29:02,688
they are blurred. That is one 
aspect and it is difficult to 

3443
05:29:02,961 --> 05:29:08,172
draw high line okay so we will 
focus on that and all of that, 

3444
05:29:08,452 --> 05:29:12,742
and on the other thing is for 
responsible for the security of 

3445
05:29:13,192 --> 05:29:15,192
the organization

3446
05:29:19,331 --> 05:29:22,806
they are worried about all sites
of threats they are not going to

3447
05:29:23,083 --> 05:29:26,103
say a word about these agency 
groups do not care about the 

3448
05:29:26,381 --> 05:29:29,411
others so these are the things 
that they are meant to have 

3449
05:29:29,694 --> 05:29:32,896
awareness about. I think we 
probably see that as well. 

3450
05:29:32,897 --> 05:29:38,632
>> Thank you for the 
perspective. I appreciate it. We

3451
05:29:38,918 --> 05:29:41,149
will get a quick break before 
the next guest.

3452
05:31:26,900 --> 05:31:31,087
>> Welcome back. I'm here with 
Daniel and Matt self-worth I 

3453
05:31:31,362 --> 05:31:38,503
brought you [ Indiscernible ]. 
These guys deliver it excellent 

3454
05:31:38,807 --> 05:31:40,807
talk. I noted in the thing

3455
05:31:44,366 --> 05:31:47,418
Excel as well as [ Indiscernible
] so we appreciate that to 

3456
05:31:47,690 --> 05:31:49,822
expect most of those are my 
cats. 

3457
05:31:49,823 --> 05:31:53,212
>> [ Laughter ] 
>> One of the interesting things

3458
05:31:53,487 --> 05:31:56,794
is you talked about everyone 
talked about purple team and you

3459
05:31:57,069 --> 05:31:59,069
get repetitive. Responsibility 
communication what innovative 

3460
05:31:59,170 --> 05:32:03,051
thing you said was 
accountability and you quoted 

3461
05:32:03,455 --> 05:32:05,949
perform to the level they are 
measured. I wanted to

3462
05:32:11,204 --> 05:32:14,772
look at that and see where that 
comes from and how do we capture

3463
05:32:15,042 --> 05:32:17,536
that quick 
>> I said that that is not my 

3464
05:32:17,827 --> 05:32:19,827
idea. Human nature is

3465
05:32:22,375 --> 05:32:25,403
we like to perform and make the 
numbers that are being measured 

3466
05:32:25,674 --> 05:32:28,718
to so when it comes to setting 
objectives for tests or people 

3467
05:32:28,993 --> 05:32:30,993
in general, kissing those 
numbers very deliberately to 

3468
05:32:31,272 --> 05:32:34,220
drive the debate over trying to 
have those behaviors drive 

3469
05:32:34,504 --> 05:32:37,783
outputs and deliver thought into
what you are choosing and help 

3470
05:32:38,066 --> 05:32:40,281
make them more successful. 
>> Excellent perspective. One of

3471
05:32:40,554 --> 05:32:44,176
the questions is like there's 
been a lot of investments and [ 

3472
05:32:44,452 --> 05:32:46,452
Indiscernible ].

3473
05:32:48,148 --> 05:32:53,217
How do you maintain? 
>> In terms of maintaining 

3474
05:32:53,666 --> 05:32:55,666
capabilities you mean quick 
>> The culture.

3475
05:32:58,903 --> 05:33:01,679
Not just the capability not a 
technical problem not a people 

3476
05:33:01,958 --> 05:33:04,340
problem it is a very cultural 
problem. 

3477
05:33:04,341 --> 05:33:08,664
>> For us it is commitment to 
redo it. As soon as you finish 

3478
05:33:08,938 --> 05:33:13,481
one you schedule plant and think
about what you want to 

3479
05:33:13,754 --> 05:33:16,204
accomplish. When we do it

3480
05:33:20,237 --> 05:33:23,831
it is time bound, and there is 
stuff we know we have to cover. 

3481
05:33:24,123 --> 05:33:27,327
We would like to make it more 
bite-size and smaller. We can 

3482
05:33:27,605 --> 05:33:31,553
you know do as many tests that 
take a half-day, take one day. 

3483
05:33:31,554 --> 05:33:35,085
>> When we choose the engineers 
that are putting out engagements

3484
05:33:40,393 --> 05:33:44,001
they just may not make the best 
purple team. Deliberately 

3485
05:33:44,284 --> 05:33:47,848
choosing the people we are going
to put on the engagements giving

3486
05:33:48,125 --> 05:33:51,336
the proper training so they 
don't going blind so they know 

3487
05:33:51,611 --> 05:33:55,015
the process making sure that we 
can scale that way as well. 

3488
05:33:55,016 --> 05:34:01,711
>> Is a culture [ Indiscernible 
]. Everyone has goals around 

3489
05:34:01,988 --> 05:34:05,621
communication being able to 
deliver a technical topic to a 

3490
05:34:05,895 --> 05:34:11,553
team of peers. Because we are 
such a small team responsible 

3491
05:34:11,994 --> 05:34:14,768
for big organization is 
important to us that that is the

3492
05:34:15,042 --> 05:34:18,680
number one thing we can do. 
>> I really want to circle back 

3493
05:34:18,954 --> 05:34:22,166
to micro purple team. [ 
Indiscernible ]. What do you 

3494
05:34:22,550 --> 05:34:25,054
mean quick 
>> [ Indiscernible ].

3495
05:34:50,976 --> 05:34:59,783
>> [ Indiscernible ]
>> Being deliberate about it.

3496
05:35:02,251 --> 05:35:10,297
[ Indiscernible ].
>> If we write 1000 detections [

3497
05:35:10,888 --> 05:35:12,888
Indiscernible ].

3498
05:35:20,491 --> 05:35:24,372
>> Excellent point. You 
mentioned the need for bringing 

3499
05:35:24,656 --> 05:35:29,023
new people in. Even not just 
hiring people out of school but 

3500
05:35:29,304 --> 05:35:32,955
coming out later in their 
career, the purple team is a 

3501
05:35:33,231 --> 05:35:35,231
great example this is a complex 
workspace.

3502
05:35:45,506 --> 05:35:48,551
All of these different fields, 
and advice to people who want to

3503
05:35:48,823 --> 05:35:50,757
join this field? Where do you 
start? 

3504
05:35:50,758 --> 05:35:52,991
>> There a lot of projects [ 
Indiscernible ].

3505
05:35:58,318 --> 05:36:02,481
Working with other projects in 
the community and the way we 

3506
05:36:02,755 --> 05:36:05,839
sort of like to think about it 
is being [ Indiscernible ]. 

3507
05:36:06,118 --> 05:36:09,515
Really just finding an area 
where you want to specialize and

3508
05:36:09,795 --> 05:36:13,543
focus. Not cutting off all 
aspects of security so you know 

3509
05:36:13,818 --> 05:36:18,967
how it plays together. 
>> Think the perspective it is 

3510
05:36:19,254 --> 05:36:21,254
vital to have

3511
05:36:23,656 --> 05:36:28,337
diversity in your team including
diversity of experience. If 

3512
05:36:28,619 --> 05:36:31,836
everyone on my team has 10 years
insecurity, they are not going 

3513
05:36:32,109 --> 05:36:34,662
to think of something that 
someone who has a completely 

3514
05:36:34,938 --> 05:36:36,938
different background might come 
up with.

3515
05:36:43,305 --> 05:36:51,488
Daniel, thank you so much. This 
is our last session for today. I

3516
05:36:51,762 --> 05:36:53,762
appreciate all of the 
contributions from the 

3517
05:36:53,885 --> 05:36:58,665
community. Don't forget the rest
of the day is scheduled for 

3518
05:36:58,950 --> 05:37:00,950
ATT&CK. 

3519
05:39:29,796 --> 05:39:31,796
>>> Miners 

3520
05:39:34,656 --> 05:39:37,918
attack on 2.0 continues. Please 
give a worm welcome to KT 

3521
05:39:38,147 --> 05:39:41,168
Nichols. 
>> All right everyone who is 

3522
05:39:45,421 --> 05:39:47,690
enjoying candy, please come back
and enjoy it here because we 

3523
05:39:47,925 --> 05:39:51,857
have one of my favorite parts of
the entire conference right now,

3524
05:39:52,081 --> 05:39:54,561
our lightning talks. So grab 
your candy to go, come on in, 

3525
05:39:54,785 --> 05:39:58,531
folks online you should go buy 
some candy. I'm going to ignite 

3526
05:39:58,753 --> 05:40:01,665
a new debate because I feel like
we need to work on XL things. 

3527
05:40:02,001 --> 05:40:04,264
Candy corn. Great candy or best 
candy ever? We will let 

3528
05:40:08,517 --> 05:40:10,517
that rage,

3529
05:40:13,255 --> 05:40:15,960
rage debate on twitter. So next 
up as I mentioned, we have our 

3530
05:40:16,184 --> 05:40:18,209
lightning talks. So my pleasure 
to introduce our facilitator for

3531
05:40:18,430 --> 05:40:20,221
those lightning talks. My 
teammate Adam Pennington. It's 

3532
05:40:20,222 --> 05:40:22,897
really great because I just get 
to sit back and relax and kick 

3533
05:40:23,119 --> 05:40:26,153
at my feet while he does all the
work here. So Adam, that you 

3534
05:40:26,376 --> 05:40:29,272
realize he is a member of the 
core ATT&CK team. He has been a 

3535
05:40:29,496 --> 05:40:31,725
MITRE for 11+ years.  At 
Carnegie Mellon, still does tons

3536
05:40:31,947 --> 05:40:36,179
of stuff there. He is on 
deception as well so you can 

3537
05:40:36,402 --> 05:40:39,358
never really trust he is telling
you the truth. These join me in 

3538
05:40:39,581 --> 05:40:43,737
welcoming for our lightning 
talks, Adam  Pennington. 

3539
05:40:43,739 --> 05:40:47,515
>>> Think you Katie. And 
hopefully we will get the slides

3540
05:40:47,744 --> 05:40:52,270
up soon. So lots of people have 
talked about in the past that 

3541
05:40:52,494 --> 05:40:54,855
they really liked some of the 
short talks that this conference

3542
05:40:56,929 --> 05:40:58,949
has done. But you know, we don't
have any 50 

3543
05:41:02,612 --> 05:41:05,487
minutes talks. You know we are 
just doing short, short all the 

3544
05:41:05,709 --> 05:41:09,791
way through. So this is going to
be even shorter. Just a couple 

3545
05:41:10,014 --> 05:41:12,077
weeks ago, we put out an 
additional call for 

3546
05:41:12,303 --> 05:41:16,614
presentations, asking people to 
give us their five-minute pithy 

3547
05:41:16,842 --> 05:41:18,842
war stories, their half-baked 
ideas. And I think people really

3548
05:41:19,073 --> 05:41:22,880
delivered on that. It was 
actually, it was selective, so 

3549
05:41:23,100 --> 05:41:26,608
we had more than just the people
up here today. We are going to 

3550
05:41:26,835 --> 05:41:29,761
be running these back to back, 
there is no time for Q&A. We are

3551
05:41:29,992 --> 05:41:31,992
going to be 

3552
05:41:34,508 --> 05:41:36,880
going strictly timed to five 
minutes. I'm going to be showing

3553
05:41:37,105 --> 05:41:39,356
you the timings that the 
speakers are also seeing. So you

3554
05:41:39,580 --> 05:41:43,784
know how close they're actually 
going to get. So I'm going to 

3555
05:41:44,012 --> 05:41:46,012
introduce our first lightning 
talks speaker. He was a special 

3556
05:41:46,229 --> 05:41:48,578
prize for not having any slides,
making my life easier. Brian 

3557
05:41:50,956 --> 05:41:51,620
Donahue. 
>> Hello. 

3558
05:41:51,621 --> 05:41:53,628
>> Hello everybody I'm Brian 
Donahue, I work right red 

3559
05:41:53,853 --> 05:41:58,613
canary. I have worked on last 
year's threat detection report, 

3560
05:41:58,836 --> 05:42:00,829
helped produce and write that. 
Currently helping produce and 

3561
05:42:00,831 --> 05:42:03,648
write this years threat 
detection report. And in the 

3562
05:42:03,873 --> 05:42:08,174
spirit of getting to the point 
quickly in case I get cut off, I

3563
05:42:08,401 --> 05:42:10,430
think that everyone should be 
taking the threats that they 

3564
05:42:10,680 --> 05:42:12,741
observe on their network, 
whether it is there on 

3565
05:42:12,966 --> 05:42:17,659
Enterprises network, or maybe it
is the network, or sort of the 

3566
05:42:17,889 --> 05:42:19,889
networks of your customers that 
you 

3567
05:42:22,244 --> 05:42:24,725
are monitoring, in the course of
business. I think we should take

3568
05:42:24,945 --> 05:42:26,987
all those threats, map into 
MITRE attack and then release 

3569
05:42:27,212 --> 05:42:31,664
what we find in the form of  
Evelyn's rankings. The reason I 

3570
05:42:31,885 --> 05:42:34,573
want to do this is because I 
think we should be creating a 

3571
05:42:34,797 --> 05:42:36,797
sort of, gray 

3572
05:42:39,849 --> 05:42:43,552
and unified miter attack heat 
map. The reason I think we 

3573
05:42:43,779 --> 05:42:46,477
should do that is I don't not 
know that we make really great 

3574
05:42:46,718 --> 05:42:48,561
scientific decisions about how 
we resource allocate insecurity.

3575
05:42:48,562 --> 05:42:51,594
So the other day I was reading 
an article in cyber scoop and it

3576
05:42:51,825 --> 05:42:53,843
was about how the security 
insurance companies are going to

3577
05:42:54,072 --> 05:42:58,806
be in position to dictate the 
tools that we buy. So they 

3578
05:42:59,031 --> 05:43:02,307
create a white list, if you buy 
a tool on the white list you get

3579
05:43:02,534 --> 05:43:04,784
a discount on your premium. My 
initial thought was well, that 

3580
05:43:05,006 --> 05:43:08,965
is a horrible idea. Then I 
thought about it a bit, it is 

3581
05:43:09,186 --> 05:43:11,558
like who is more incentivized to
make sure you don't get 

3582
05:43:11,781 --> 05:43:14,033
breached, then the company 
that's going to have to pay for 

3583
05:43:14,259 --> 05:43:17,196
it when you do? So that got me 
thinking, how do we make these 

3584
05:43:17,417 --> 05:43:20,120
decisions as is? And I got a 
list, it's incomplete. I'll just

3585
05:43:20,345 --> 05:43:22,345
say ahead 

3586
05:43:25,009 --> 05:43:28,046
of time, the list, each item on 
the list has pros and cons, they

3587
05:43:28,279 --> 05:43:31,803
are all flawed, and none of them
are scientific. So sometimes it 

3588
05:43:32,029 --> 05:43:34,833
got experienced people on our 
teams, we let them use their 

3589
05:43:35,056 --> 05:43:37,056
intuition to decide how they are
going to 

3590
05:43:40,987 --> 05:43:44,260
resource allocate. Sometimes we 
go and we talked to an analyst 

3591
05:43:44,483 --> 05:43:47,089
firm. Other teams read the news,
read about an attack, try and 

3592
05:43:47,319 --> 05:43:49,334
build up coverage for it, 
circumstance plays a large role 

3593
05:43:49,564 --> 05:43:51,582
in this. Something bad happens 
and you have to buy 

3594
05:43:55,812 --> 05:44:00,941
a tool. There are plenty of 
firms out there that probably 

3595
05:44:01,180 --> 05:44:03,199
just do this based on sort of 
regulatory and compliance 

3596
05:44:03,418 --> 05:44:06,116
requirements. And then I bet a 
lot of us just kind of make 

3597
05:44:06,845 --> 05:44:08,862
arbitrary decisions. So the 
question is, is there a better 

3598
05:44:09,084 --> 05:44:11,797
way? Of course the answer is 
yes. All you have to do is 

3599
05:44:12,024 --> 05:44:15,848
figure out the threats that are 
most likely to occur, and sort 

3600
05:44:16,069 --> 05:44:18,869
of focus on them first, and then
move backwards to the ones that 

3601
05:44:19,089 --> 05:44:21,348
are less likely to occur. 
Luckily, MITRE attack gives us  

3602
05:44:21,578 --> 05:44:25,335
kind of a nice framework to work
with for this. It is sort of 

3603
05:44:25,561 --> 05:44:27,468
like takes this nebulous 
indefinite thing, a threat 

3604
05:44:27,469 --> 05:44:30,863
landscape, and makes it definite
and sort of gives you a finite 

3605
05:44:31,088 --> 05:44:33,310
list of techniques and the data 
sources you need to observe 

3606
05:44:33,528 --> 05:44:35,528
those 

3607
05:44:37,320 --> 05:44:40,168
techniques. So, I think of this 
sort of in the terms of 

3608
05:44:40,392 --> 05:44:42,621
baseball. Forever you just sort 
of stuck nine players on a 

3609
05:44:42,847 --> 05:44:46,326
baseball field. And now it is 
how you play defense. With the 

3610
05:44:46,546 --> 05:44:48,546
advent of advanced analytics, 
increasingly we are seeing in 

3611
05:44:48,705 --> 05:44:50,973
field shifts, so we have got 
great charts for batters, we 

3612
05:44:51,196 --> 05:44:53,930
sort of know where they are 
going to get the ball, and you 

3613
05:44:54,161 --> 05:44:57,493
move the infield accordingly to 
neutralize their strengths. So I

3614
05:44:57,722 --> 05:45:03,211
am sort of thinking that that in
terms of miter attack where the 

3615
05:45:03,435 --> 05:45:05,904
framework itself is a baseball 
field. You do not want to just 

3616
05:45:06,133 --> 05:45:08,401
throw coverage at the entire 
matrix. You want to figure out 

3617
05:45:10,636 --> 05:45:13,160
the hotspots. So a year ago we 
started producing our threat 

3618
05:45:13,382 --> 05:45:15,382
detection report. The idea was, 
let's figure 

3619
05:45:19,097 --> 05:45:22,246
out the MITRE techniques we see 
most often so we can answer a 

3620
05:45:22,470 --> 05:45:24,745
few questions, one being how do 
I get started with attack, 

3621
05:45:24,965 --> 05:45:27,441
another being  how to use 
ATT&CK, and maybe a third being 

3622
05:45:27,670 --> 05:45:29,670
how do I prioritize 

3623
05:45:31,761 --> 05:45:34,368
coverage?  So I'm thinking that,
if everyone does that, we won't 

3624
05:45:34,591 --> 05:45:36,591
have red canary is very in 
plaintiff 

3625
05:45:40,423 --> 05:45:44,273
centric view, of how you said 
prioritize coverage in which 

3626
05:45:44,493 --> 05:45:46,493
threats are most likely to 
occur, we should have 

3627
05:45:46,522 --> 05:45:48,766
everybody's view on that. I want
to know what firewall companies 

3628
05:45:48,994 --> 05:45:51,680
are seeing, I went to see what 
sort of email filter makers are 

3629
05:45:51,913 --> 05:45:54,758
seeing so we can get a really 
universal view of how the threat

3630
05:45:54,997 --> 05:45:56,997
landscape plays out on the 
ATT&CK 

3631
05:45:59,184 --> 05:46:01,893
matrix.  So, I found three 
problems with this as I was 

3632
05:46:02,124 --> 05:46:04,498
preparing for this, there is 
probably more, I am not that 

3633
05:46:04,735 --> 05:46:06,735
creative. But interestingly true
of those problems were 

3634
05:46:10,266 --> 05:46:14,087
solved yesterday. I will start 
with the ones that have been 

3635
05:46:14,313 --> 05:46:17,012
solved. The first one I could 
not figure out was, how do we 

3636
05:46:17,237 --> 05:46:21,571
normalize the data because the 
company with one customer, their

3637
05:46:21,794 --> 05:46:24,177
prevalence rankings are not 
going to be the same as a 

3638
05:46:24,400 --> 05:46:26,639
company with 10,000 customers. 
The other problem I saw was how 

3639
05:46:26,857 --> 05:46:29,316
do we aggregated all? I actually
think that MITRE is  solving 

3640
05:46:29,544 --> 05:46:31,127
both of those problems 
potentially with ATT&CK 

3641
05:46:31,128 --> 05:46:33,362
sightings. I'm interested to see
where that goes. Now the third 

3642
05:46:33,584 --> 05:46:36,398
problem  I'm seeing is, it has 
to do with sort of the 

3643
05:46:36,628 --> 05:46:38,628
nomenclature. Attack gives us a 
nice common 

3644
05:46:41,142 --> 05:46:44,957
language, but we don't have a 
common language to talk about 

3645
05:46:45,180 --> 05:46:47,410
things like detection and alert.
We call them detections at red 

3646
05:46:47,636 --> 05:46:50,859
canary, and that is sort of what
we are ranking and applying to 

3647
05:46:51,084 --> 05:46:53,328
MITRE attack and we create our 
threat detection report but that

3648
05:46:53,551 --> 05:46:56,168
is not necessarily what other 
people are doing, so go forth  

3649
05:46:56,395 --> 05:47:01,966
and create the grand unified 
heat map. [ applause ] 

3650
05:47:01,967 --> 05:47:06,811
>> So, Dan posted a question to 
us on twitter. He said, 

3651
05:47:07,035 --> 05:47:12,398
Halloween is coming up, so you 
know, it is, what costume should

3652
05:47:12,623 --> 05:47:14,623
I actually wear for my lightning

3653
05:47:18,736 --> 05:47:22,775
talk? And Katie told him if he 
dressed up like a pew pew map, 

3654
05:47:23,002 --> 05:47:25,497
she would get him a free drink 
at our reception the other 

3655
05:47:25,723 --> 05:47:28,352
night. 
>> So not only a pew pew 

3656
05:47:31,601 --> 05:47:33,663
map, but they should a

state basis to it the proverbial
unicorn so we want our threat 

3722
06:16:09,319 --> 06:16:12,371
intelligence to be able to 
capture that factor of it's not

06:16:12,613 --> 06:16:15,612
just a checklist of things I 
haven't just actually things but

this could become a

can actually use and 
operationalize threat

I feel so underdressed now guys 
where is my onesie [ Laughter ].

3733
06:17:00,795 --> 06:17:04,575
I'm here today to talk about 
ATT&CK intelligence and purple 

3734
06:17:05,207 --> 06:17:07,207
teaming 

3735
06:17:09,328 --> 06:17:12,018
before I get started I have to 
give you the obligatory caveat 

3736
06:17:12,261 --> 06:17:15,573
that my view that I expressed 
today are my own and do not 

3737
06:17:15,815 --> 06:17:18,034
necessarily represent those of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New 

3738
06:17:18,276 --> 06:17:21,752
York Federal Reserve system that
is going to go today. Purple 

3739
06:17:22,000 --> 06:17:25,589
teaming with swimming by that it
sounds very about so please 

3740
06:17:25,833 --> 06:17:32,614
forgive me but really talk past 
couple of days people are doing 

3741
06:17:32,859 --> 06:17:37,590
detection people are doing 
really cool heat maps and people

3742
06:17:37,831 --> 06:17:41,772
are also doing purple team heard
a great talk about that earlier 

3743
06:17:42,016 --> 06:17:46,203
today but once we want to do 
micro purple teaming a micro 

3744
06:17:46,452 --> 06:17:51,210
purple teaming work flow it 
began as you might expect with 

3745
06:17:51,451 --> 06:17:55,220
yet another fusion initiative I 
think we have all heard that 

3746
06:17:55,467 --> 06:17:58,375
coming down the line for our 
leaders for another. We were 

3747
06:17:58,617 --> 06:18:03,109
being task saying all right to 
collaborate together not just 

3748
06:18:03,353 --> 06:18:06,321
within the intelligence team but
also want to collaborate better 

3749
06:18:06,561 --> 06:18:10,575
across the entire organization. 
We want to be talking not just 

3750
06:18:10,821 --> 06:18:14,511
to detection creation but we 
must be talking about

3751
06:18:19,811 --> 06:18:22,526
hot teams red teams were only 13
webinar socket we are not 

3752
06:18:22,770 --> 06:18:25,675
talking about and ATT&CK is 
really great that  your to be a 

3753
06:18:25,957 --> 06:18:28,866
common language if you well to 
be the cornerstone. We had only 

3754
06:18:29,107 --> 06:18:31,107
gotten pretty good at the center
vertical

3755
06:18:34,631 --> 06:18:36,631
so that is ATT&CK based 
intelligence on the Intel 

3756
06:18:36,810 --> 06:18:40,350
reports into TVPs  we were now 
for detection creation right now

3757
06:18:40,676 --> 06:18:44,025
internal report and wrote a 
thing where we got many great 

3758
06:18:44,273 --> 06:18:49,818
DVDs we are separated was using 
them? We are praying use cases 

3759
06:18:50,057 --> 06:18:54,697
for I think there's a lot more 
other way that we could be using

3760
06:18:54,938 --> 06:18:58,204
this and fruition call came from
on high so he turned and that 

3761
06:18:58,551 --> 06:19:03,055
blue team I heard you during the
hunt engagement we got all these

3762
06:19:03,297 --> 06:19:08,284
great TTPs great report hearing 
go rent is really cool should 

3763
06:19:08,523 --> 06:19:12,316
last I  hear is a bunch of TTP 
here's a great report here you 

3764
06:19:12,565 --> 06:19:17,075
go but we were starting to his 
roadblocks that which is that 

3765
06:19:17,316 --> 06:19:19,934
you have truly lived until 
you've written and 80 page 

3766
06:19:20,178 --> 06:19:25,556
report with TTP that is three 
that because it's got what got a

3767
06:19:25,800 --> 06:19:27,800
spreadsheet attached to it. Is 
no fun for anybody

3768
06:19:31,307 --> 06:19:34,108
and you can imagine that people 
are super exotic get that much 

3769
06:19:34,348 --> 06:19:37,192
into work with so there's 
clearly some constraints and 

3770
06:19:37,432 --> 06:19:43,210
even on the Intel site we are 
finding that was the Intel be 

3771
06:19:43,453 --> 06:19:45,566
generated really TTP is being 
generated? Truly high priority 

3772
06:19:45,806 --> 06:19:49,130
really really what should be 
about or are you TTPs were being

3773
06:19:49,372 --> 06:19:53,641
created a little repetitive 
because there is customer Carmen

3774
06:19:54,270 --> 06:19:57,547
instrument for really.on Lindsay
and if we are doing overlapping 

3775
06:19:58,066 --> 06:20:00,066
work here

3776
06:20:01,780 --> 06:20:03,981
is human rotini area and similar
intelligence? We clearly needed 

3777
06:20:04,227 --> 06:20:07,260
to do something so our solution 
make it micro

3778
06:20:12,948 --> 06:20:16,247
that I these big reports the 
work is picking that take a lot 

3779
06:20:16,488 --> 06:20:19,441
of time and how reporting let's 
go small so it all started with 

3780
06:20:19,681 --> 06:20:22,372
a single TTP which we got 
abbreviated here left cozy pairs

3781
06:20:22,622 --> 06:20:26,378
of UMI tactic technique we kind 
of abbreviated procedure part 

3782
06:20:26,617 --> 06:20:32,045
suitable get Katie it was there 
I promise. We gave that command 

3783
06:20:32,447 --> 06:20:34,464
to both team and blue team 
things time

3784
06:20:37,529 --> 06:20:40,350
. Teams that's all right got his
command that I created to 

3785
06:20:40,589 --> 06:20:42,589
emulate this behavior

3786
06:20:44,832 --> 06:20:48,424
and losing says I created is use
case that will be able to detect

3787
06:20:48,669 --> 06:20:50,368
and be deployed simultaneously 
in multiple different 

3788
06:20:50,369 --> 06:20:52,627
environments of the IRS or 
Federal Reserve system so you 

3789
06:20:52,868 --> 06:20:57,229
guys know that we are pretty 
distributed so different 

3790
06:20:57,489 --> 06:21:01,337
environments there we found that
yes we could detect it but we 

3791
06:21:01,585 --> 06:21:04,086
also found that particular 
environment we didn't so that 

3792
06:21:04,336 --> 06:21:06,366
leads us to the final results 
which is that

3793
06:21:09,828 --> 06:21:12,543
rapid emulation and validation 
is going to help us be a lot 

3794
06:21:12,793 --> 06:21:15,351
more responsive to high priority
threat after activity and in 

3795
06:21:15,593 --> 06:21:20,159
particular is a lot better 
assumption on coverage so that 

3796
06:21:20,416 --> 06:21:22,416
kind created is new work flow

3797
06:21:27,287 --> 06:21:29,977
which is that instead of having 
a big engagement we say all 

3798
06:21:30,371 --> 06:21:33,311
right we got in Intel determined
this is an event trigger that we

3799
06:21:33,566 --> 06:21:35,816
perhaps a threat after his 
behavior but maybe just one 

3800
06:21:36,058 --> 06:21:38,791
single behavior we want to 
ensure we are covered tell you 

3801
06:21:39,037 --> 06:21:44,064
TTPs team is able to emulate 
create detection is what your 

3802
06:21:44,707 --> 06:21:46,707
coverage is

3803
06:21:52,480 --> 06:21:58,815
questions and answers into the 
trigger that also were at the 

3804
06:21:59,054 --> 06:22:01,969
end of the day purple teaming is
great but let's make it micro 

3805
06:22:02,212 --> 06:22:04,212
Thank you. 
>> Thank you

3806
06:22:08,730 --> 06:22:11,723

the mode you to the stage [

Indiscernible ]. 
>> Thank you.

3808
06:22:18,477 --> 06:22:24,207
I am Nick Carr in this is guard 
rails of the galaxy so I work 

3809
06:22:24,454 --> 06:22:28,428
between that the intersection of
I guess hunting and a detection 

3810
06:22:28,843 --> 06:22:31,317
that looks across all of our 
media services and across all 

3811
06:22:31,566 --> 06:22:34,069
the fire product text reverse 
engineering and technical 

3812
06:22:34,443 --> 06:22:36,443
techniques

3813
06:22:40,827 --> 06:22:43,135
so I talk about execution 
guardrails? First of all this 

3814
06:22:43,382 --> 06:22:45,716
was our first technique our 
first technique to the ATT&CK 

3815
06:22:45,956 --> 06:22:49,707
matrix  my talk about them here 
can immediately saying the U.S. 

3816
06:22:49,949 --> 06:22:53,094
uses their malware uses 
guardrails and other nations do 

3817
06:22:53,339 --> 06:22:57,816
not maybe examples like that 
were raised earlier by the ESA 

3818
06:22:58,061 --> 06:23:02,747
team and most importantly I 
guess my attack celebrity

3819
06:23:07,425 --> 06:23:09,429
Katie Nichols placement quote 
for behalf saying that the 

3820
06:23:09,677 --> 06:23:11,941
hallmark of sophistication is 
restraint so we agreed that 

3821
06:23:12,853 --> 06:23:14,853
sophistication

3822
06:23:17,386 --> 06:23:19,386
means people are restricting 
their activities and guardrails 

3823
06:23:19,492 --> 06:23:23,214
are manifestation of restraint 
answer is looking execution 

3824
06:23:23,463 --> 06:23:25,463
guardrails interesting attackers

3825
06:23:27,953 --> 06:23:30,061
. Quickly clear out a 
combination of a definition 

3826
06:23:30,334 --> 06:23:35,572
detection concept just really 
quickly are doing a couple of 

3827
06:23:35,820 --> 06:23:37,543
things the attackers are 
checking environmental condition

3828
06:23:37,544 --> 06:23:39,878
that air comparing the attackers
applied value. These are the 

3829
06:23:40,123 --> 06:23:43,826
behaviors in this particular 
order that you want to look for 

3830
06:23:44,068 --> 06:23:46,068
I know great generalizing this 
quick talk and

3831
06:23:50,289 --> 06:23:52,065
minor also includes 
environmental key protecting her

3832
06:23:52,066 --> 06:23:53,788
chemo with the same 
environmental information. These

3833
06:23:53,789 --> 06:23:59,267
of those crypto functions in 
that order again tied together 

3834
06:23:59,511 --> 06:24:02,176
so couple of detection issues 
that we run into when looking 

3835
06:24:02,420 --> 06:24:05,629
for something like this the 
first is that it catches a lot 

3836
06:24:06,087 --> 06:24:11,735
of recon if you imagine a 
nontargeted fish that comes in 

3837
06:24:11,991 --> 06:24:14,470
and collect information from the
host of the environment and 

3838
06:24:14,716 --> 06:24:20,066
beacons is attackers encrypt 
those results you want to that 

3839
06:24:20,314 --> 06:24:23,696
is always the wrong kind of 
email guardrails were looking 

3840
06:24:23,940 --> 06:24:26,888
for. We see a lot of people 
confuse what we are trying to 

3841
06:24:27,133 --> 06:24:29,493
talk here with more brought 80 
invasions or

3842
06:24:33,154 --> 06:24:35,887
VM invasions just looking to see
if I'm running within a virtual 

3843
06:24:36,135 --> 06:24:39,238
machine is what we are talking 
about is attackers applied 

3844
06:24:39,653 --> 06:24:42,976
research little others less 
interesting things. The other 

3845
06:24:43,362 --> 06:24:46,755
thing that I see a lot of and 
occasionally share is the 

3846
06:24:47,007 --> 06:24:50,463
insider threats I guess to guard
rail detection which is 

3847
06:24:50,711 --> 06:24:56,174
legitimate uses of protecting 
execution in this case here's a 

3848
06:24:56,425 --> 06:24:58,781
bank macros that are actually 
checking the computer name 

3849
06:24:59,029 --> 06:25:01,029
making sure it matches in 
particular

3850
06:25:07,887 --> 06:25:10,131
naming convention check is 
strong to check the egress be 

3851
06:25:10,376 --> 06:25:13,374
addressing trying to before run 
all the legitimate macro so 

3852
06:25:13,627 --> 06:25:16,340
that's not malicious. What your 
here or is the guardian this is 

3853
06:25:16,582 --> 06:25:19,458
the first three cardio words for
achievement in technical 

3854
06:25:19,703 --> 06:25:23,573
achievement and guard railing. 
The first up is the offense is 

3855
06:25:24,085 --> 06:25:26,085
tool

3856
06:25:31,036 --> 06:25:33,531
Denny guys from NCC group the 
guys do some fantastic art 

3857
06:25:33,775 --> 06:25:36,499
railing while your chance to 
look at some of the things they 

3858
06:25:36,746 --> 06:25:42,626
do but it publicly released guys
told to encrypt a shape a mold 

3859
06:25:43,031 --> 06:25:45,786
first one is a lot of this 
example is needed for cash 

3860
06:25:46,031 --> 06:25:49,929
device. It looks for someone 
where you expect to see their 

3861
06:25:50,169 --> 06:25:52,646
hours landing page looks at the 
local dimensions and the local 

3862
06:25:52,903 --> 06:25:54,903
dimensions of version mobile 
broadband customer

3863
06:25:58,056 --> 06:26:01,549
router some is an example of the
kinds of things into a lot more 

3864
06:26:01,791 --> 06:26:04,190
of these kinds ways you can 
restrict just like attacker 

3865
06:26:04,722 --> 06:26:10,045
today. The next one that uses 
guardrails and close assess 

3866
06:26:10,290 --> 06:26:14,040
operation. Is a spicy. Current 
detection to vendors

3867
06:26:24,257 --> 06:26:26,725
I could write about how does it 
really represent true detection 

3868
06:26:26,969 --> 06:26:29,186
but anyway that's currently out 
there on virus total at 

3869
06:26:29,433 --> 06:26:31,930
Charlotte copy hashes screenshot
I will share out but is malware 

3870
06:26:32,181 --> 06:26:35,073
actually look to see for a USB 
wireless adapter and actually 

3871
06:26:35,325 --> 06:26:39,900
out in April access points as a 
W profile for

3872
06:26:44,880 --> 06:26:47,586
-- and create a rogue access 
point entry and try to connect 

3873
06:26:47,826 --> 06:26:50,872
that 42 so this is we believe 
the attacker was then physically

3874
06:26:51,118 --> 06:26:55,696
caused by with access points 
that is malware was doing is 

3875
06:26:55,954 --> 06:27:00,016
that colors the to hear pretty 
interesting interesting to after

3876
06:27:00,568 --> 06:27:02,568
override these

3877
06:27:05,287 --> 06:27:07,287
. Running out of practice 
lifetime achievement award 

3878
06:27:07,425 --> 06:27:10,960
guardrails goes EPG 41 and you 
have a chance to check out EPG 

3879
06:27:11,218 --> 06:27:15,373
41 report you might be their 
supply chain -- you might not 

3880
06:27:15,619 --> 06:27:18,303
know about the Microsoft crypto 
API individual user accounts on 

3881
06:27:18,548 --> 06:27:25,032
an individual system I realized 
the key pillows. Alright.

too far because what if we are

Twitter make all kinds of things

3885
06:27:46,139 --> 06:27:48,553
that he shared on Twitter spicy 
tweets techniques procedures

I'm going to hang out here just 
a moment to reintroduce Adam so 

3888
06:27:58,879 --> 06:28:05,271
get out of my second shake it 
off while he talks over that was

3889
06:28:05,521 --> 06:28:08,227
awesome that's what my favorite 
part of this and thank you so 

3890
06:28:08,473 --> 06:28:11,312
much to for connecting that he 
has the things that I enjoy 

3891
06:28:11,560 --> 06:28:17,597
hearing your ideas. We will wrap
up attack updates from the team 

3892
06:28:18,011 --> 06:28:20,370
with discussing three that he 
has left of pre-attack was

3895
06:28:28,976 --> 06:28:32,116
Thank you to Katie for giving me
a second to switch gears there.

3896
06:28:37,720 --> 06:28:40,676
This is unfortunate for our 
online audience but if I can get

3897
06:28:40,924 --> 06:28:43,662
a quick shorthand for how many 
of you are operationally using 

3898
06:28:43,966 --> 06:28:52,315
pre-attack today? Two? Okay I 
was a curious about go

3899
06:28:55,186 --> 06:29:01,274
. One of the things that we told
all of our speakers this week 

3900
06:29:01,687 --> 06:29:03,904
was not to introduce attack and 
we actually really appreciate 

3901
06:29:04,148 --> 06:29:06,856
that people have a pretty good 
about that between both the 

3902
06:29:07,101 --> 06:29:11,835
external speakers and the ATT&CK
updates people have been doing  

3903
06:29:12,250 --> 06:29:14,736
but we know that not everyone is
actually worked with pre-attack 

3904
06:29:14,980 --> 06:29:17,909
in the past the wanted to 
actually start their.  Most what

3905
06:29:18,153 --> 06:29:20,360
we've been saying really mean 
ATT&CK this week is enterprise 

3906
06:29:20,605 --> 06:29:23,045
attack  attack was originally 
created to look at behaviors 

3907
06:29:23,291 --> 06:29:27,555
that adversary to activate 
broken into environments. 17 a 

3908
06:29:27,799 --> 06:29:32,711
couple of years after that went 
to look at some of the terrorist

3909
06:29:32,959 --> 06:29:37,231
threat intelligence I go and 
look at techniques for when 

3910
06:29:37,475 --> 06:29:42,229
adversaries would do before they
broke into a system. This is the

3911
06:29:42,471 --> 06:29:45,352
graphic we have used for years 
we are breaking up the kill 

3912
06:29:45,608 --> 06:29:48,534
chain into pre-attack and 
enterprise attack. Just about a 

3913
06:29:49,162 --> 06:29:55,253
year ago we had an efforts to 
take the launching compromise 

3914
06:29:55,517 --> 06:29:57,517
techniques tactics from 
pre-attack

3915
06:30:00,587 --> 06:30:02,587
cannibalize and create the 
initial access tactic

3916
06:30:05,871 --> 06:30:08,237
. This wasn't the same 
techniques but it did represents

3917
06:30:08,480 --> 06:30:13,457
the same coverage the same space
and so we start the process of 

3918
06:30:13,701 --> 06:30:16,571
integrating pre-attack into 
attack. If you remember back to 

3919
06:30:16,952 --> 06:30:22,731
Blake's original beginning he 
talked about the idea of ringing

3920
06:30:23,224 --> 06:30:27,428
some of the different attack 
efforts together and just making

3921
06:30:27,674 --> 06:30:33,393
it all one big happy attack. 
Rather than just go along and 

3922
06:30:33,659 --> 06:30:36,622
continue to take attackers to a 
time our plan is to rip the 

3923
06:30:36,865 --> 06:30:39,779
Band-Aid off and make pre-attack
and attack all into one piece

3924
06:30:44,469 --> 06:30:47,441
. This is the picture started 
with this is the picture we have

3925
06:30:47,861 --> 06:30:50,970
been preaching for years but 
it's not really quite accurate. 

3926
06:30:51,219 --> 06:30:54,407
Really where the space looks 
like a little bit more like this

3927
06:30:57,458 --> 06:31:00,050
. Pre-attack covers a space that
actually comes before the kill 

3928
06:31:00,295 --> 06:31:03,086
chain that often to the theory 
intelligence planning goal some 

3929
06:31:03,488 --> 06:31:07,756
of the budget resource 
management issues so it's a bit 

3930
06:31:07,999 --> 06:31:11,227
less of the kill chain.

3931
06:31:14,730 --> 06:31:17,473
In looking at how we actually 
want to take stuff from 

3932
06:31:17,722 --> 06:31:20,491
techniques from pre-attack and 
looking at some of that space 

3933
06:31:20,733 --> 06:31:26,248
often to just tell we had to sit
down and take a look at how can 

3934
06:31:26,499 --> 06:31:28,709
we design will be pull in and 
what we don't

3935
06:31:32,195 --> 06:31:35,128
? A member of our team Ingrid 
Parker spent some time taking a 

3936
06:31:35,370 --> 06:31:38,878
look at this where she went down
and worked with us and came up 

3937
06:31:39,269 --> 06:31:41,733
with a couple of different 
things and how to decide what 

3938
06:31:41,978 --> 06:31:44,953
goes in. First of all is that 
it's technical so it had 

3939
06:31:45,211 --> 06:31:48,199
something to do with 
electronics, computers it is 

3940
06:31:48,447 --> 06:31:58,144
just a planning exercise -- 
isn't just a planning exercise.

3941
06:32:03,481 --> 06:32:05,959
-- With attack we are mostly 
talking about behaviors in your 

3942
06:32:06,203 --> 06:32:08,746
environment that if you did the 
exact right thing you probably 

3943
06:32:08,991 --> 06:32:12,215
could see. You might want to 
learn all of them but they are 

3944
06:32:12,464 --> 06:32:15,145
in the space that you control 
and have visibility into pretext

3945
06:32:15,388 --> 06:32:20,073
faces a little bit different 
well-meaning meso defenders is 

3946
06:32:20,326 --> 06:32:23,851
maybe an ISP can say DNS 
provider somebody of the chain 

3947
06:32:24,104 --> 06:32:31,310
actually has visibility into 
where. Evidence that Mr. years 

3948
06:32:31,713 --> 06:32:33,681
so when pre-attack was 
originally written there really 

3949
06:32:33,682 --> 06:32:36,288
was not much out there talking 
about things that happened 

3950
06:32:36,540 --> 06:32:41,553
before intrusion one of the 
things that helps lockable beers

3951
06:32:41,795 --> 06:32:44,435
is things like indictments there
have been a number of reports 

3952
06:32:44,692 --> 06:32:49,382
out and other threat 
intelligence companies as well 

3953
06:32:49,784 --> 06:32:52,143
have talked a lot more about 
theory preparation getting ready

3954
06:32:52,386 --> 06:32:54,386
for going into intrusion

3955
06:32:56,900 --> 06:33:00,840
. I haven't actually shown 
pre-attack matrix yet but if you

3956
06:33:01,097 --> 06:33:04,216
have seen pre-attack before it 
actually looks like attack 

3957
06:33:04,617 --> 06:33:08,334
contacted from the top 
techniques on the side so this 

3958
06:33:09,041 --> 06:33:14,955
yellow here is that intelligence
base. These are things like 

3959
06:33:15,204 --> 06:33:17,608
priority definition planning 
thinking about getting ready for

3960
06:33:18,367 --> 06:33:23,863
intrusion. We think those don't 
really fall into the three 

3961
06:33:24,120 --> 06:33:29,598
standards that I just sat down. 
Looking across the rest of it we

3962
06:33:29,841 --> 06:33:32,394
realize actually divided pretty 
nicely into two different 

3963
06:33:32,638 --> 06:33:38,663
sections so got the green and 
blow so you got this 

3964
06:33:39,038 --> 06:33:41,280
intelligence planning that we 
are calling out of scope 

3965
06:33:42,145 --> 06:33:44,145
reconnaissance

3966
06:33:45,849 --> 06:33:48,317
which would be making into a new
tactic enterprise attack and 

3967
06:33:48,832 --> 06:33:54,361
resource development. To give 
you an idea what these look like

3968
06:33:59,061 --> 06:34:01,922
I couldn't the word draft on 
here many more times and still 

3969
06:34:02,167 --> 06:34:05,640
have a slight render well so I 
want to make sure that shows up 

3970
06:34:05,891 --> 06:34:07,891
in the background of your 
screenshot. These are absolutely

3971
06:34:08,131 --> 06:34:11,235
not the final technique names 
they will change not they might 

3972
06:34:11,476 --> 06:34:18,394
change. Reconnaissance is very 
focused on the victim so it's 

3973
06:34:19,114 --> 06:34:24,445
focus on gathering information 
on the victim itself gathering 

3974
06:34:24,689 --> 06:34:27,781
information on individuals 
within the victim sort of what 

3975
06:34:28,458 --> 06:34:34,086
everything around the victim's 
landscape looks like. We also 

3976
06:34:34,331 --> 06:34:39,049
have resource developments. 
Resource development has

3977
06:34:44,964 --> 06:34:48,840
infrastructure and capabilities 
for those of you know threat 

3978
06:34:49,082 --> 06:34:53,851
models that are attack victim 
infrastructure and capabilities 

3979
06:34:54,096 --> 06:34:58,317
might sound a little bit 
familiar is not completely 

3980
06:34:58,559 --> 06:35:03,572
accident so resource development
is the adversary action and 

3981
06:35:03,991 --> 06:35:07,093
building up the pieces that they
need in order to do their 

3982
06:35:07,337 --> 06:35:11,179
intrusion the building up I 
guess it's all certificate they 

3983
06:35:11,422 --> 06:35:14,378
need getting a hold of any 
servers they want were going to 

3984
06:35:14,821 --> 06:35:16,821
be doing both Renée

3985
06:35:21,523 --> 06:35:23,777
David building at the south is 
different from where the 

3986
06:35:24,026 --> 06:35:27,716
requirement through mechanisms 
were authority felt but this is 

3987
06:35:27,969 --> 06:35:30,927
the rough shape of what we think
pre-attack is going to look like

3988
06:35:31,175 --> 06:35:35,586
see my notice that this is 
really look like detected this 

3989
06:35:35,827 --> 06:35:37,827
are some techniques

3990
06:35:40,214 --> 06:35:43,209
so this is not something that 
were going to see in the next 

3991
06:35:43,457 --> 06:35:45,457
few weeks

3992
06:35:46,719 --> 06:35:49,437
. A couple of people have 
complained today that we did you

3993
06:35:49,681 --> 06:35:54,202
release the last Thursday right 
before ATT&CK con people have to

3994
06:35:54,448 --> 06:35:57,696
change their slide is going to 
be a little let  coming we saw 

3995
06:35:57,940 --> 06:36:00,407
some whiteboard sessions that I 
should say that the techniques 

3996
06:36:00,791 --> 06:36:06,303
and that techniques you are 
seeing here today our process a 

3997
06:36:06,548 --> 06:36:08,548
number of whiteboarding sessions
between Katie Nichols and 

3998
06:36:08,657 --> 06:36:12,636
myself. I really intentionally 
wanted to get some time for 

3999
06:36:12,886 --> 06:36:16,464
questions because have entirely 
talk a bunch of you who are 

4000
06:36:16,720 --> 06:36:21,101
interested in PRE-ATT&CK I think
there might be some . Without 

4001
06:36:21,485 --> 06:36:23,485
further is due does anyone have 
any questions?

4002
06:36:32,159 --> 06:36:37,491
>> One question that came to 
mind right away

4003
06:36:41,352 --> 06:36:44,213
and I guess it could be close to
resource gathering that's what 

4004
06:36:44,454 --> 06:36:46,671
I'm trying to figure out where 
it would fit. Supply-chain 

4005
06:36:46,913 --> 06:36:51,141
attacks where you do things 
before hand you know 

4006
06:36:51,386 --> 06:36:55,103
supply-chain attack is but the 
question is do you think you're 

4007
06:36:55,347 --> 06:36:59,161
going to integrate those into 
PRE-ATT&CK like as resource 

4008
06:36:59,407 --> 06:37:04,532
gathering or something like that
that to bottom 20 50 team is 

4009
06:37:04,819 --> 06:37:08,043
taking over so you can did U.S. 
were you thinking that is out of

4010
06:37:08,288 --> 06:37:11,773
scope I would like to know? 
>> At least a piece of 

4011
06:37:12,016 --> 06:37:16,552
supply-chain attack is already 
an initial access so something 

4012
06:37:17,091 --> 06:37:21,206
really actual doing of it we've 
already included in ATT&CK. I 

4013
06:37:21,450 --> 06:37:25,364
would expect any sort of  
electronic preparation of the 

4014
06:37:25,606 --> 06:37:31,586
battlefield will be within scope
. We are probably not going to 

4015
06:37:31,832 --> 06:37:37,157
go as far as somebody sneaks 
into a Chinese factory and tells

4016
06:37:37,411 --> 06:37:43,254
Bloomberg about it but we are 
looking at just the technical 

4017
06:37:43,503 --> 06:37:48,264
pieces. Somebody breaking into a
software development website or 

4018
06:37:48,509 --> 06:37:51,628
something like that kind of the 
more traditional supply-chain 

4019
06:37:51,874 --> 06:37:55,239
attacks we really see in the 
wild. I would absolutely the 

4020
06:37:55,481 --> 06:37:57,481
scope. 
>>

4021
06:38:11,129 --> 06:38:13,713
Do you think this is going to 
fuel discussion around Sprint 

4022
06:38:14,233 --> 06:38:16,769
monitoring and the importance of
possibly got topic?

4023
06:38:17,027 --> 06:38:19,027
>>

4024
06:38:21,895 --> 06:38:24,163
Someone with the detections and 
mitigations are likely to look 

4025
06:38:24,407 --> 06:38:26,896
like initiative we actually have
technique ready for this at all 

4026
06:38:27,151 --> 06:38:30,360
yet. The way we actually develop
new tactics to be that we sit 

4027
06:38:30,605 --> 06:38:36,152
down figure out what the tactic 
-- techniques are within a 

4028
06:38:36,395 --> 06:38:39,984
tactic be a signout technique 
ready. We have got to last step 

4029
06:38:40,230 --> 06:38:45,667
yet. My suspicion is that the 
detection and mitigation for 

4030
06:38:45,911 --> 06:38:49,676
some of these techniques around 
the domain names and registering

4031
06:38:49,921 --> 06:38:54,428
them is going to be around 
Sprint monitoring so that is 

4032
06:38:54,680 --> 06:38:59,018
sort of a natural place trash 
take a look at to see some of 

4033
06:38:59,261 --> 06:39:03,106
these things happening. 
>> Other questions?

4034
06:39:07,195 --> 06:39:09,988
If there are no other questions 
please join me and thinking Adam

4035
06:39:10,233 --> 06:39:12,233
Pennington. [ Applause ] 

4036
06:39:15,524 --> 06:39:17,524
Thanks for that Adam

4037
06:39:21,823 --> 06:39:24,710
. We hope you enjoy these attack
team updates that was feedback 

4038
06:39:24,953 --> 06:39:27,958
from last year that we heard you
wanted to hear more from the 

4039
06:39:28,203 --> 06:39:31,169
team so I figured we would give 
you a preview what we've done 

4040
06:39:31,415 --> 06:39:33,797
and what yet to come so 
pre-attack should be coming 

4041
06:39:34,040 --> 06:39:37,009
soon. Now my pleasure to welcome
Blake back to the stage as we 

4042
06:39:37,259 --> 06:39:39,475
start to wrap things up here at 
attack on 2.0

4043
06:39:47,206 --> 06:39:50,536
. It is been an amazing three 
days not because of all of you 

4044
06:39:50,784 --> 06:39:53,012
folks here in person folks 
around the world people have 

4045
06:39:53,262 --> 06:39:55,967
wash from all kinds of locations
and the part of the global 

4046
06:39:56,210 --> 06:40:01,408
attack community just a couple 
my current from Wisconsin means 

4047
06:40:01,668 --> 06:40:04,639
that she's maybe I have to say 
that name folks in Poland are 

4048
06:40:04,882 --> 06:40:07,479
having a party there and 
Australia listening in from 

4049
06:40:07,721 --> 06:40:13,345
Germany UTC +11 so even middle 
of the night they to do to 

4050
06:40:13,589 --> 06:40:15,589
attack on to point out

4051
06:40:18,488 --> 06:40:20,464
mobile confirmed this morning 
they're watching yesterday they 

4052
06:40:20,465 --> 06:40:23,304
checked this morning with us as 
well it speaks to the global 

4053
06:40:23,546 --> 06:40:25,546
nature of this amazing community

4054
06:40:27,837 --> 06:40:31,442
. I'm going to turn it over to 
Blake to give you a recap of 

4055
06:40:31,694 --> 06:40:33,400
birds other sessions which were 
Monday afternoon. 

4056
06:40:33,402 --> 06:40:36,813
>> We had several birds of a 
feather sessions the topics like

4057
06:40:37,058 --> 06:40:40,445
some techniques cloud controls 
ICS's we went through some of 

4058
06:40:40,708 --> 06:40:43,556
the topic note that have been 
collected by are facilitators 

4059
06:40:43,804 --> 06:40:51,196
and to do a quick recap of those
. One of those sessions was for 

4060
06:40:51,598 --> 06:40:53,608
[ Indiscernible ] detection some
of the discussion

4061
06:40:57,082 --> 06:40:59,295
length words to think about the 
confidence levels of detections 

4062
06:40:59,562 --> 06:41:02,576
rather than just making a binary
detected or not detected that 

4063
06:41:02,818 --> 06:41:05,826
really tell you where to 
coverages because you know 

4064
06:41:06,228 --> 06:41:08,820
several different ways you can 
attach something and a lot of 

4065
06:41:09,065 --> 06:41:14,251
times picture assessments of how
you detect in your own 

4066
06:41:14,494 --> 06:41:16,975
environment based on the tools 
and resources you have which is 

4067
06:41:17,220 --> 06:41:20,425
really cool. It's also important
to help red and blue come 

4068
06:41:20,673 --> 06:41:24,061
together for purple seeming that
way you can do a lot more rapid 

4069
06:41:24,306 --> 06:41:28,318
detection enhancements the red 
and blue alert for each other 

4070
06:41:28,572 --> 06:41:31,161
and you will improve your 
detections a lot better over 

4071
06:41:31,416 --> 06:41:33,416
time

4072
06:41:39,131 --> 06:41:41,978
. If you're wondering where to 
get started and is looking at 

4073
06:41:42,229 --> 06:41:44,953
your data sources is really the 
best place to start because you 

4074
06:41:45,198 --> 06:41:47,937
need to make sure you have the 
right available to get started 

4075
06:41:48,185 --> 06:41:50,577
and detecting threats. 
>> I heard a lot about today 

4076
06:41:50,825 --> 06:41:52,544
either. 
>> Another one of the analytics 

4077
06:41:52,545 --> 06:41:55,534
session. One of the topics there
was we needed to encourage users

4078
06:41:55,786 --> 06:42:00,395
and communities writing 
exchanging is very tough for a 

4079
06:42:00,644 --> 06:42:03,092
lot of people think that is how 
they're environment is very 

4080
06:42:03,337 --> 06:42:07,091
difficult to sure not without 
risk to potentially letting out 

4081
06:42:07,341 --> 06:42:09,795
there is no exactly how they're 
being detected but we think 

4082
06:42:10,040 --> 06:42:13,263
there could be ways to 
generalize the information that 

4083
06:42:13,515 --> 06:42:15,702
we can share ideas without 
risking her own environment

4084
06:42:19,149 --> 06:42:21,778
. Another one was there's a lot 
of properties around analytics 

4085
06:42:22,022 --> 06:42:25,046
that we need to think about it 
capture so there's easy 

4086
06:42:25,289 --> 06:42:29,798
elevation by adversaries if your
detections are based on static 

4087
06:42:30,044 --> 06:42:35,042
strings and they are able to 
change those of policy brains 

4088
06:42:35,285 --> 06:42:37,285
and things like that. Another 
one was

4089
06:42:41,961 --> 06:42:43,961
top attack public analytic 
coverage yet this is something 

4090
06:42:44,165 --> 06:42:48,175
we are trying to change with car
so we are looking for 

4091
06:42:48,420 --> 06:42:51,129
contributions on these so if you
have session work for you in 

4092
06:42:51,377 --> 06:42:53,722
certain areas are comfortable 
sharing those we would love to 

4093
06:42:53,971 --> 06:42:59,535
take them and help the community
in those areas. Another one was 

4094
06:42:59,792 --> 06:43:02,675
analytics tied to specific tools
can be hard to read by other 

4095
06:43:02,924 --> 06:43:04,924
analysts when sharing

4096
06:43:08,105 --> 06:43:11,055
salons and points for trying to 
generalize it in a way that is 

4097
06:43:11,302 --> 06:43:13,164
applicable to multiple 
environments and multiple tools.

4098
06:43:13,165 --> 06:43:15,165
Another one was assessments 
socket assessments and attack 

4099
06:43:15,374 --> 06:43:21,051
based assessments so dealing 
with abstraction can be a pain 

4100
06:43:21,313 --> 06:43:24,441
points sometimes it's hard to 
determine whether the procedure 

4101
06:43:25,118 --> 06:43:27,118
or technique

4102
06:43:29,234 --> 06:43:31,462
so that can make a difference on
hire actually assessing 

4103
06:43:31,703 --> 06:43:34,106
something in which you results 
are. Measure coverages doable 

4104
06:43:34,370 --> 06:43:39,215
the hard part is tracking that 
over time so how often do you do

4105
06:43:39,465 --> 06:43:42,989
assessment how to progress from 
there is a big problem for 

4106
06:43:43,236 --> 06:43:45,236
people

4107
06:43:47,706 --> 06:43:50,723
so the more information we can 
get best practices in that area 

4108
06:43:50,970 --> 06:43:55,837
I think would help the community
a lot. We have feature requests 

4109
06:43:56,239 --> 06:43:58,628
so understand resume creating a 
single or chart to communicate 

4110
06:43:58,874 --> 06:44:01,939
level and this may be due to 
attack being too large to 

4111
06:44:02,184 --> 06:44:07,666
complex need a better way of 
holding things that we to focus 

4112
06:44:08,051 --> 06:44:11,068
on to make better decisions 
which is really good point. 

4113
06:44:11,316 --> 06:44:15,611
Cloud another good topic we 
heard that a lot organizations 

4114
06:44:15,862 --> 06:44:17,862
are pushed to the cloud

4115
06:44:23,050 --> 06:44:25,293
there are several reasons it 
could be accosted measure it 

4116
06:44:25,537 --> 06:44:28,023
could be the technology is 
moving to the cloud that they 

4117
06:44:28,263 --> 06:44:31,504
rely on so a lot of people are 
happy to see that we are 

4118
06:44:31,753 --> 06:44:34,361
covering cloud and ATT&CK now 
which is awesome . Some people 

4119
06:44:34,612 --> 06:44:37,609
felt the SAS platform task may 
not be that interesting and they

4120
06:44:37,853 --> 06:44:42,800
are more interested in specific 
cloud services and techniques 

4121
06:44:43,050 --> 06:44:46,706
those and we are trying to cover
both like I said earlier my 

4122
06:44:47,379 --> 06:44:49,379
presentation yesterday

4123
06:44:55,155 --> 06:44:57,681
we think the cloud is a dynamic 
environment and platforms are 

4124
06:44:57,923 --> 06:45:00,918
likely to change over time so if
you find the SAS is useful 

4125
06:45:01,184 --> 06:45:03,400
deprecated down the road in 
favor of more specific cloud 

4126
06:45:03,649 --> 06:45:06,057
services when we get more 
specific techniques and for the 

4127
06:45:06,307 --> 06:45:09,210
services. Another point was that
identity and access management 

4128
06:45:09,457 --> 06:45:12,592
is really the new parameter for 
a lot of people because

4129
06:45:17,498 --> 06:45:19,976
it's just basically an account 
how you get access to the 

4130
06:45:20,219 --> 06:45:22,204
account how to use those 
credentials and credentialing 

4131
06:45:22,205 --> 06:45:24,574
materials access the resources 
because obviously there is going

4132
06:45:24,820 --> 06:45:30,527
to target those things. Another 
one was our purple and red 

4133
06:45:30,857 --> 06:45:34,707
teaming session so running blue 
teams that it is a leadership 

4134
06:45:34,954 --> 06:45:36,981
chain is really important 
because that helps collaboration

4135
06:45:39,227 --> 06:45:44,509
that frees up resources for them
to do and share similar goals. 

4136
06:45:44,764 --> 06:45:49,666
Another good point is the need 
to avoid getting things to 

4137
06:45:49,910 --> 06:45:52,382
adversarial because if you 
create that friction between 

4138
06:45:52,629 --> 06:45:57,968
teams going to make progress in 
ways that they need to to 

4139
06:45:58,224 --> 06:46:01,903
improve security and the 
environment and the loss point 

4140
06:46:02,146 --> 06:46:04,396
was purple teaming really red 
teaming done right and I 

4141
06:46:04,641 --> 06:46:10,595
completely agree. Another good 
one some techniques so big topic

4142
06:46:10,840 --> 06:46:14,573
a lot of people's minds these 
days. We got a lot out of it 

4143
06:46:14,973 --> 06:46:19,653
just as us on the ATT&CK team  
we had a relatively small group 

4144
06:46:20,054 --> 06:46:23,627
that was a focus session but a 
lot of good feedback so far we 

4145
06:46:23,873 --> 06:46:28,160
are able to cancel are concerned
of structure some of the 

4146
06:46:28,406 --> 06:46:33,475
techniques which was great. What
the participants who shall not 

4147
06:46:33,719 --> 06:46:36,513
be named did say that his 
organization has created 900 

4148
06:46:36,771 --> 06:46:41,341
techniques as extensions to 
ATT&CK  and is that techniques 

4149
06:46:41,591 --> 06:46:45,647
will literally save his life so 
great to hear. Literally. 

4150
06:46:45,890 --> 06:46:50,639
Another good point was there's a
lot of concern over whether or 

4151
06:46:50,889 --> 06:46:53,007
not it's easier or difficult to 
attack assessment growing

4152
06:46:58,445 --> 06:47:00,445
the general consensus in the 
assertion that some techniques 

4153
06:47:00,680 --> 06:47:03,068
will help people learn about 
ATT&CK easier because it's more 

4154
06:47:03,323 --> 06:47:05,794
refined it's easier  to pin down
exactly where something should 

4155
06:47:06,046 --> 06:47:08,992
go because it's more definition 
around it. The end of the 

4156
06:47:09,236 --> 06:47:15,033
session was are a I and and all 
session so there is obviously 

4157
06:47:15,280 --> 06:47:17,798
any to be able to describe the 
Intel more normalized and 

4158
06:47:18,042 --> 06:47:21,489
efficient way so that I know can
be used better across it but it 

4159
06:47:21,733 --> 06:47:25,607
is a hard problem and the second
point was is often hard to 

4160
06:47:25,851 --> 06:47:30,223
describe how about based 
detections map to techniques 

4161
06:47:30,472 --> 06:47:34,283
because of the more [ 
Indiscernible ] nature of how 

4162
06:47:34,537 --> 06:47:36,537
the technology works.

4163
06:47:40,894 --> 06:47:44,129
>> Lots of conversations I know 
go back and forth with Blake on 

4164
06:47:44,378 --> 06:47:46,378
this one

4165
06:47:48,421 --> 06:47:51,139
we have been hearing from you 
the community and we always try 

4166
06:47:51,385 --> 06:47:54,090
to take feedback but these 
readings are often for us to be 

4167
06:47:54,331 --> 06:47:56,779
able to 70 conversation in the 
hallways over some candy or 

4168
06:47:57,022 --> 06:47:59,852
Lacroix what you are thinking 
what you need for the first one 

4169
06:48:00,095 --> 06:48:02,638
Blake should do some techniques?
>> Yes of course

4170
06:48:02,884 --> 06:48:06,184
>> We heard you think cycles so 
much are saving lives here with 

4171
06:48:06,646 --> 06:48:12,412
that techniques conversation I 
have a few people we want to 

4172
06:48:12,654 --> 06:48:16,537
know how can we help you better 
use ATT&CK  and sometimes that 

4173
06:48:16,786 --> 06:48:19,990
is not sure how to get started 
with it that quite a bit so 

4174
06:48:20,242 --> 06:48:22,242
Patty returns will patient 
website very

4175
06:48:27,822 --> 06:48:31,297
that you see in the team put in 
20 but we are looking for work 

4176
06:48:31,686 --> 06:48:34,880
that I think you as a community 
can help us with this to it's 

4177
06:48:35,125 --> 06:48:38,342
not just us the power of ATT&CK 
is an you all  the presentations

4178
06:48:39,202 --> 06:48:42,346
some people I started using 
ATT&CK is back on all of you but

4179
06:48:42,593 --> 06:48:45,807
that's on our minds as well .  
Next to cover 100% of ATT&CK? 

4180
06:48:46,051 --> 06:48:48,051
>> No. 
>>

4181
06:48:52,803 --> 06:48:55,434
Let's say that again Blake 100% 
coverage is that realistic? 

4182
06:48:55,435 --> 06:48:57,435
>> No

4183
06:49:01,336 --> 06:49:03,186
. 
>> You need help explaining that

4184
06:49:03,188 --> 06:49:05,188
I will get hundred percent 
coverage that's crazy perfect 

4185
06:49:05,408 --> 06:49:07,866
disability known as perfect is 
as we talked about again and 

4186
06:49:08,110 --> 06:49:11,327
again no so we hope to some 
content to help you conveyed to 

4187
06:49:11,571 --> 06:49:15,329
your stakeholders where they are
. You what is the doing next 

4188
06:49:15,584 --> 06:49:20,307
class we are conversation you 
really want to know more from us

4189
06:49:20,554 --> 06:49:24,037
about where we are going to try 
to write a blog post we can do 

4190
06:49:24,421 --> 06:49:26,918
better and we will do better 
because we realize that just 

4191
06:49:27,165 --> 06:49:30,089
curiosity you have to plan out 
your teams over the next year, 

4192
06:49:30,335 --> 06:49:34,214
two years, five years. What we 
do is crazy but what we do 

4193
06:49:34,597 --> 06:49:39,212
influence is what you will do so
some of the past three days to 

4194
06:49:39,455 --> 06:49:44,420
make sure you know that we hear 
you. As research wrap up I love 

4195
06:49:44,801 --> 06:49:46,801
this week from Christian

4196
06:49:51,714 --> 06:49:54,681
the 20 he commented he knows 
it's been a good attack, and his

4197
06:49:55,078 --> 06:49:57,571
shower thoughts are filled with 
ideas of how to better apply 

4198
06:49:57,817 --> 06:50:01,043
ATT&CK  one this is all about it
started off by saying we hope 

4199
06:50:01,287 --> 06:50:03,493
you will come together share 
ideas about was working is 

4200
06:50:03,732 --> 06:50:06,313
working so well ideas to make 
your organization favor. I'm 

4201
06:50:06,569 --> 06:50:08,569
Christian I have to

4202
06:50:12,225 --> 06:50:17,424
[ Indiscernible ] Parson noted 
challenges and the common slide 

4203
06:50:17,666 --> 06:50:20,416
that we saw across a lot of 
presenters and yes Thessaly} 

4204
06:50:20,663 --> 06:50:24,379
there are a lot of challenges 
ahead of us but we got it and we

4205
06:50:24,755 --> 06:50:29,066
started together. Go back to 
what Tony started off with the 

4206
06:50:29,309 --> 06:50:31,309
friends we made along the way

4207
06:50:33,965 --> 06:50:36,935
difference we make love the way 
we're going to figure out how to

4208
06:50:37,323 --> 06:50:39,565
defeat there is a member 
networks so problems for a 

4209
06:50:39,808 --> 06:50:42,002
single word whether it's here 
with respect to your own 

4210
06:50:42,246 --> 06:50:46,308
organization.
>> I like to give a shout out 

4211
06:50:46,556 --> 06:50:50,012
one of original mentors on the 
ATT&CK project which are gains  

4212
06:50:50,412 --> 06:50:53,131
he was the person who helped us 
find the original research that 

4213
06:50:53,386 --> 06:50:57,114
went into it so we all out to 
him and the effort that you put 

4214
06:50:57,362 --> 06:50:59,362
in to managing our research

4215
06:51:04,224 --> 06:51:06,427
just not the attack research but
also the broader research 

4216
06:51:06,683 --> 06:51:09,615
program and letter over several 
years with the one he tried to 

4217
06:51:09,864 --> 06:51:13,360
still and I was he would always 
ask us what is your star? I can 

4218
06:51:13,611 --> 06:51:16,106
confidently say that it 
community. We are doing this for

4219
06:51:16,355 --> 06:51:20,256
you because we want ATT&CK to be
better to serve you guys  so 

4220
06:51:20,501 --> 06:51:22,951
thank you very much you are the 
reason this. 

4221
06:51:22,952 --> 06:51:25,155
>> That's awesome I love 
Northstar. We love this sweet

4222
06:51:29,220 --> 06:51:32,870
ATT&CK Con 2.0 is often change 
my mind  change their minds to 

4223
06:51:33,116 --> 06:51:37,474
IT security Twitter there is 
going to be out from ATT&CK Con 

4224
06:51:42,419 --> 06:51:44,657
just like the contacting 
feedback to make it better we 

4225
06:51:44,906 --> 06:51:47,891
want to make this event even 
better next year. As many of you

4226
06:51:48,134 --> 06:51:50,912
know we can't put on these 
amazing events without a lot of 

4227
06:51:51,168 --> 06:51:56,231
people want to take a couple 
folks all of our anything 

4228
06:51:56,487 --> 06:51:58,988
speakers put together this 
research on the slide that's not

4229
06:51:59,239 --> 06:52:02,161
easy so thank you speakers are 
there's anything invested in 

4230
06:52:02,404 --> 06:52:07,600
making is amazing events in 
person at anything you offer so 

4231
06:52:07,845 --> 06:52:10,444
much for us to chat all of you 
here and claim

4232
06:52:15,128 --> 06:52:17,647
Trinkle quite you can't eat 
snacks as well as the online 

4233
06:52:17,892 --> 06:52:21,430
intended from around the world 
thank you for tweeting us for 

4234
06:52:21,705 --> 06:52:24,183
engagement is here because it's 
exciting to know that you are 

4235
06:52:24,423 --> 06:52:27,700
watching from around the world. 
Our audiovisual team we think/

4236
06:52:33,399 --> 06:52:37,655
offer a to the team Larson the. 
I wanted to

4237
06:52:41,931 --> 06:52:44,890
get some special shout out to a 
few people there are so many 

4238
06:52:45,133 --> 06:52:47,133
people seems pretty much 
everyone was patient Thursday 

4239
06:52:47,274 --> 06:52:50,303
helped out from the ATT&CK team 
better  strategic communications

4240
06:52:50,556 --> 06:52:52,556
team is been unbelievable in 
playing basically since last 

4241
06:52:52,776 --> 06:52:58,467
year's ATT&CK Con  [ 
Indiscernible ] that's just a 

4242
06:52:59,144 --> 06:53:03,547
small portion of the many 
communications and events folks 

4243
06:53:03,795 --> 06:53:06,686
behind the scene so let's give 
them a round of applause. [ 

4244
06:53:06,930 --> 06:53:08,930
Applause ] 

4245
06:53:16,461 --> 06:53:19,586
One thing that we learned as we 
worked through all of our attack

4246
06:53:19,828 --> 06:53:21,833
communications externally as 
well as this event that things 

4247
06:53:22,079 --> 06:53:24,079
work really well technical team 
and communications folks work 

4248
06:53:24,277 --> 06:53:28,534
together. This community thing 
is different here so what we 

4249
06:53:28,784 --> 06:53:33,318
found this amazing partnership 
where for example which they did

4250
06:53:33,566 --> 06:53:39,164
to me so now what we techniques 
to become logically sequenced 

4251
06:53:39,409 --> 06:53:42,853
because not that anybody would 
help her in less than an

4252
06:53:48,968 --> 06:53:51,470
-- the actual group pages and 
trying to think of realistic 

4253
06:53:51,717 --> 06:53:54,859
chaining of techniques. What a 
great partnership between 

4254
06:53:55,104 --> 06:53:57,104
graphics between the technical 
team to make those things 

4255
06:53:57,347 --> 06:54:00,730
happen. I wanted to give you 
shout out to the attack team I 

4256
06:54:00,989 --> 06:54:04,811
Pennington so much work on this 
so please join me in thinking 

4257
06:54:05,057 --> 06:54:07,057
for everything he has done.

4258
06:54:11,707 --> 06:54:14,430
Over many months he was helping 
me last night 10:00 it straight 

4259
06:54:14,676 --> 06:54:17,170
shot between. Other folks in the
program committee Jamie Blakely 

4260
06:54:17,419 --> 06:54:22,519
John and Andy and Jen Burns was 
no longer with the team 

4261
06:54:22,762 --> 06:54:27,199
