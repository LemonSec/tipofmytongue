1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,530
- [Announcer] Please join me
in welcoming Allan Thompson.

2
00:00:03,531 --> 00:00:05,470
(applause)

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,000
- Thank you, thanks a lot.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,650
So whoever organized this
calendar for this session

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,960
did an awesome job because John Wonder

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,445
did a great setup for my presentation.

7
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:23,445
So I'm here to talk about Zeek and how we,

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,650
at Looking Glass we
started a research project

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,430
to really understand how
can we do threat detection

10
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,160
and potentially mitigation
in new innovative ways?

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,019
Particularly as ATT&CK talks about

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,272
how behaviors is really important,

13
00:00:40,272 --> 00:00:45,272
technical indicators is really
important but insufficient.

14
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,570
So we were looking for a
way to be able to up-level

15
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,540
the ability to create detection.

16
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,240
And as I was preparing this presentation

17
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,250
the presentation actually morphed from

18
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,970
showing you some metrics
to more to what we learned

19
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,461
as we went through it, and hopefully

20
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:05,224
these lessons that we
learned as we went through it

21
00:01:05,224 --> 00:01:09,640
translate to, you know,
some lessons that you can

22
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,330
maybe apply to your environments.

23
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,560
I want to cover three things.

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,070
The first is give you a little
bit of background on Zeek.

25
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,809
How many people in the room know Zeek?

26
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:18,993
Oh wow, awesome!

27
00:01:19,998 --> 00:01:23,210
I've, I've asked that
question in other rooms

28
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,547
and it was like uhhhhh.

29
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,340
The next one is talking about
how we prepared our data

30
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,780
to actually interact with both STIX

31
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,700
and Intelligence & ATT&CK,
and then how do we use it

32
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,110
to correlate in a real world environment.

33
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,220
From a background perspective
Zeek's been around

34
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,500
for a long time I think
given the number of people

35
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,791
in the room I think I'm repeating

36
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:43,759
things that people already know.

37
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,960
I wanna highlight something

38
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,119
that Zeek really was attractive to us.

39
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,280
It was really open source,
a lot of contributions,

40
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,800
data was incredibly interesting to us

41
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,750
because we didn't want
to reinvent the wheel,

42
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,090
we wanted to build upon that excellence

43
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,530
that's already in the
open source community

44
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,230
and we also wanted to look at

45
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,552
how we can scale it out to
any software environment

46
00:02:06,552 --> 00:02:10,330
and any number of different capabilities.

47
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,240
These are some of the things
that we get from Zeek,

48
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,830
as part of both detection as
well as potential mitigation.

49
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,670
So you can see basic
network protocol stuff,

50
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,149
but hopefully you can
see some of the important

51
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,260
things that you can start to do

52
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,856
with integration with sandbox,
integration with intelligence

53
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:30,109
and some of these higher level behaviors

54
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,760
such as route forcing,
fast flux et cetera.

55
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,420
These are some of the things
that the open source community

56
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,219
in Zeek have contributed.

57
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:39,859
They may or may not be
applicable to your environment

58
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,160
but they key thing is
that they're available

59
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,140
as a reference if nothing else.

60
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,790
From a basic perspective this,

61
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,429
I'm just gonna expand right out 'cause

62
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,930
everybody knows how Zeek,
or most people know Zeek,

63
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,030
the key point here is that Zeek

64
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,660
is not just an analysis tool,

65
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,820
it's also embracing an SDN
approach to deployment.

66
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,079
So you're able to deploy a controller

67
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,130
which advises or pushes policy and control

68
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,859
out to the individual network nodes,

69
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,660
this is a very simplistic example,

70
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,490
but the key point here
is that Zeek is receiving

71
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,640
a copy of our traffic and
then is running analyzers

72
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,070
on that traffic.

73
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,063
From a more advanced perspective,

74
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,910
and this is where it starts
to get really interesting,

75
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,530
is that Zeek actually
embodies a distributed system

76
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,630
it's built upon the active framework

77
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,132
and the ability to start
to have multiple nodes

78
00:03:30,132 --> 00:03:34,520
starting to act on events
and then collaborate

79
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,468
to understand behavior and
potentially collate information

80
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:40,480
becomes really interesting
when you want to scale

81
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,683
this capability out.

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,200
In reality a production environment

83
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,170
is not as simple as the, that
diagram I showed earlier,

84
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,459
it's typically much more complicated

85
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,710
and if I can point, the
key point here is I want

86
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,880
to build and deploy Zeek detection

87
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,950
in all these environments.

88
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,869
Not just on the perimeter,
not just in the DMZ,

89
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,920
not in the cloud, but everywhere.

90
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,899
And so if I'm designing
a capability to detect

91
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,286
the sightings that John
was just talking about

92
00:04:07,286 --> 00:04:10,490
I don't want just the
sightings on the perimeter.

93
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,954
Most of my firewall is
probably blocking that anyway.

94
00:04:12,954 --> 00:04:15,800
What I want to understand is
what sightings am I seeing

95
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,814
inside my network, inside the cloud,

96
00:04:17,814 --> 00:04:20,600
and so I need to be able to do that

97
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,900
using a capability and Zeek is actually

98
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,782
very well designed for that.

99
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,310
So some of the things that
we did when we started

100
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,680
doing this project to employ Zeek

101
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,630
to be able to detect things was,

102
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,659
the first thing is we had
a lot of intelligence,

103
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,310
and I don't just mean a data lake,

104
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,760
I mean continuously monitoring
lots of different data,

105
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,460
and what we wanted to do
was how do we correlate

106
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,440
that intelligence with ATT&CK,
and then use it in Zeek.

107
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,630
So we started with the assumption

108
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,091
that we're gonna use STIX2, as you know,

109
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:54,090
my intro-er said, I've
worked a lot in STIX2,

110
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,380
and STIX2 is fundamentally
a really important

111
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,830
standard to embrace in your intelligence.

112
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,650
Most intelligence providers out there

113
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,830
do not support STIX2
natively today, sadly,

114
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,010
most of them will have
their proprietary formats,

115
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,599
and are slowly adopting STIX2,

116
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,860
but we wanted to start with STIX2.

117
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,480
Next one is how did we
relate it to ATT&CK?

118
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,040
We used STIX2 and I'll show
you an example in a second.

119
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,685
How did we correlate the
activities that we're seeing

120
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:22,470
in Zeek back to the intelligence

121
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,260
and back to the environment?

122
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,120
And that was Zeek.

123
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,370
We used that and I'll
explain how we did that.

124
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,260
Then finally, which John
mentioned, or touched on,

125
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:34,080
is how do you then, when
you detect something,

126
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,577
how do you then act on it?

127
00:05:35,577 --> 00:05:38,219
This project was much
more than just detection,

128
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,720
it was actually about how do
we then enforce mitigation?

129
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,100
But I'm not presenting on that today

130
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,070
I'm just highlighting
that we also did use Zeek

131
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,490
for that aspect.

132
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,260
We have over 90 different
individual data feeds,

133
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,510
commercial, proprietary, open source,

134
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:56,840
lots of different formats,
we built that over many years

135
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,744
to ingest all that data.

136
00:05:58,744 --> 00:06:01,730
The key thing here is
there was about 1800 unique

137
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,320
intelligence attack patterns,
intrusion sets, actors,

138
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,240
that's not like instances,
that's unique individual

139
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,920
pieces of data that describe
those attack patterns.

140
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,650
The challenge that we first met was,

141
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,902
well how do we map that to MITRE ATT&CK?

142
00:06:15,902 --> 00:06:18,250
And so what we did was
we came up with this

143
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,996
very simple (mumbles)
technique, where we say

144
00:06:20,996 --> 00:06:24,760
for a particular attack pattern it maps

145
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,020
to this tactic and these techniques.

146
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,090
And the reason why we did that is because

147
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,068
when we ingest the data we
want to be able to correlate

148
00:06:33,068 --> 00:06:35,020
all of the different intelligence

149
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,609
that we're receiving
in STIX2 back to MITRE.

150
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,650
So that when we report or create metrics

151
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,320
we know exactly which
tactic and which technique

152
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,040
this particular piece of intelligence

153
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,313
when we detect in the
network is being seen.

154
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,360
An example, this is an attack pattern,

155
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,511
an actual attack pattern, in STIX2 format.

156
00:06:54,511 --> 00:06:58,018
This should not be unfamiliar.

157
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,797
We mapped the tactic using the kill chain.

158
00:07:00,798 --> 00:07:03,080
MITRE ATT&CK does the exact same thing

159
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,719
in their definition of attack,
and so we just copied it.

160
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,200
And what we did was we applied it

161
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,150
to our STIX2 intelligence
object so we have

162
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,859
an exact mapping to the
tactic in our intelligence.

163
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,570
So in this case core flood.

164
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:21,210
We did that across the 1800
different things that we did,

165
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,890
using that data mapping technique.

166
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,960
The second thing is that we found that

167
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,830
we wanted to map it through relationships

168
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,870
to the MITRE ATT&CK UUID.

169
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:34,026
So they publish all of
the data using global IDs.

170
00:07:34,026 --> 00:07:37,130
One criticism by the way
if you're looking for input

171
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,900
is we use names, but the challenge was

172
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,760
finding out what name matched that UUID

173
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,733
is actually a real pain in the ass.

174
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:51,649
So doing that for every single technique

175
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:54,670
is really hard and if you had a dictionary

176
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,600
that said, took a common
name and mapped it

177
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,650
to the UUID would be so much easier.

178
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,370
But that's what we did so
what we did was we mapped

179
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,260
all of our intelligence
back to the MITRE ATT&CK.

180
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,599
So when we saw an instance of a particular

181
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,170
piece of intelligence, we
knew exactly which UUID

182
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,030
and attack pattern, in ATT&CK,

183
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,380
as well as our own
intelligence, was matching.

184
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,530
And therefore we could
generate metrics from that.

185
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,722
So that's kind of some
of the data prep stuff,

186
00:08:19,722 --> 00:08:22,219
and I've got six minutes left so,

187
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,556
hopefully I'm gonna make it.

188
00:08:23,556 --> 00:08:28,070
The next part is around,
I'll expand the question,

189
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,599
an intelligence question which
might seem a little esoteric,

190
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,290
but the key point here is
this is a typical intelligence

191
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:38,487
question that you want to
ask, and get an answer to.

192
00:08:38,488 --> 00:08:41,880
You're not just asking
about IP, you're also,

193
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,380
you're also asking about, you know sector,

194
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,189
you're also asking about
active versus inactive,

195
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,010
you're also asking about
which IPs map to FQDNs,

196
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,620
which have active threats,
not just historical threats,

197
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,470
and then you wanna know
which attack patterns

198
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,640
map to those things.

199
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,550
This is a simple query,
but if you're doing it

200
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,500
in a big data lake and you're
sitting drinking coffee

201
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,384
and you don't have to
respond in real time,

202
00:09:07,384 --> 00:09:10,110
you've got forever to answer it.

203
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:10,943
We don't.

204
00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:13,710
We have to answer these
questions really really quickly

205
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,963
at very high scale.

206
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,133
The problem is that many sources

207
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:21,270
represent essentially the same data,

208
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,939
many have the same data
across temporal series,

209
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,530
which makes it more complicated

210
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,650
to be able to answer questions at scale,

211
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,439
and then ultimately all
of these differences

212
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,470
in how the data represented,

213
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,330
just because they use
STIX doesn't mean to say

214
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,390
they've actually normalized everything.

215
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,350
And so one of the things that we've found,

216
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,051
is even although we mapped
everything to STIX2,

217
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:43,540
we still didn't really
have a normalized data set.

218
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,254
So what we ended up doing is
coming up with a data model

219
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:51,600
that asserts facts about entities.

220
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,146
And by normaling, normalizing
STIX2, MITRE ATT&CK,

221
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:58,651
and all this information in
this fairly simplistic model,

222
00:09:58,651 --> 00:10:03,010
it allowed us to answer questions that,

223
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,939
like that intelligence
question, really quickly,

224
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,470
and that became, or is really important,

225
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,150
when you start to do metrics at line rate

226
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:14,270
in the network as I showed earlier.

227
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,850
So, a little bit of example.

228
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,760
By modeling the, all of
the data that we ingest,

229
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,400
we went from, you know, this is typical,

230
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,453
150 million records a day,

231
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,520
that's probably small for some people,

232
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,900
we reduced it to 19 million records a day,

233
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,899
just by remodeling the
data in the entity fact

234
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,850
assertion capability.

235
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,862
We went from 150 gigabits
a day to 25 to 36,

236
00:10:38,862 --> 00:10:41,120
30 gigabits a day.

237
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,550
That makes, that might
be small in a single day,

238
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,257
multiply that by 30, by 60, et cetera

239
00:10:47,258 --> 00:10:50,300
you, you, you can hopefully
see the problem there.

240
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,550
So, back to Zeek.

241
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:57,459
So, model it in entity fact really helped

242
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,450
both correlation and performance,

243
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:03,230
but Zeek actually comes
with at least a basic

244
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,540
intelligence framework to be
able to identify intelligence.

245
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,069
This is this part up here.

246
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,180
And they have an intel-,
Zeek in memory intel store,

247
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,290
that you know, records what
intelligence is being seen.

248
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,949
All of that correlation,
all of that STIX ingest

249
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:22,780
and mapping to ATT&CK, we built
that correlation over here.

250
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,500
And then whenever we see a correlation

251
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,030
from a particular event, we
map it back into this database.

252
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,819
So what we're able to do
is take the advantages

253
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,929
of all the intelligence, and all of ATT&CK

254
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:35,634
and put it back into
the intelligence store.

255
00:11:35,634 --> 00:11:38,530
So let me, I got about three minutes left,

256
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,000
so I just want to give you a basic example

257
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,780
of a simple attack event.

258
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,569
I'll expand it out so I can explain it.

259
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:50,170
So this is a typical event, it's got a lot

260
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:51,944
of information here, but you can see

261
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,590
which network it was in,

262
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,220
what aspect of traffic was detected,

263
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,560
what intel feed produced the information,

264
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,587
what labels are associated,
what destination network,

265
00:11:59,587 --> 00:12:01,200
what attack pattern.

266
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,593
Why does all this matter?

267
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:07,699
First thing is, you can
understand gap analysis.

268
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,230
So you can start to see
where in the network

269
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,350
you have coverage, or you
don't, that's important

270
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,600
if you're trying to
provide complete coverage

271
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,823
across your entire enterprise network.

272
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,070
What applications are you seeing?

273
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,720
Are you seeing specific
ones or only a subset?

274
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,580
Again that's important for
coverage and metrics of analysis.

275
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,770
What intelligence, you know,

276
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,030
what datas are getting the most hits,

277
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,780
what intelligence is most
relevant to your environment,

278
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,990
what attack phase and,
so this is where we,

279
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,642
that data modeling, data prep
aspect really kicks in here.

280
00:12:42,642 --> 00:12:46,550
We're able to tie it back to
the MITRE ATT&CK framework

281
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,469
to say which attacks
are we actually seeing

282
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,730
back to John's sighting aspect.

283
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,560
What classification information

284
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,750
that speaks to the relevance
and the prioritization

285
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,490
that John also mentioned,

286
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,950
and also how do we correlate
against other things?

287
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,313
You know for example
which patterns et cetera.

288
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,552
And finally, just want to summarize.

289
00:13:08,552 --> 00:13:11,930
Our experience was that
Zeek was incredibly flexible

290
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,770
and useful for doing
this cross-correlation

291
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:18,574
across intelligence, detection
and enterprise environment.

292
00:13:18,574 --> 00:13:22,400
It really was useful to prepare
and model the data upfront,

293
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,530
and then make sure that the
correlation could be optimized

294
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,520
for very large scale and high speeds,

295
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,120
and with that I just want
to call out to whoever

296
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,458
put an ampersand in ATT&CK?

297
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:37,030
(audience laughing)

298
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,115
It's a little inside joke, but anyway,

299
00:13:39,115 --> 00:13:41,392
with that I will take questions.

300
00:13:41,392 --> 00:13:43,380
- [Announcer] I think we
are just at time actually,

301
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,396
so please join me in thanking Allan.

302
00:13:45,396 --> 00:13:46,972
(applause)

303
00:13:46,972 --> 00:13:48,266
- [Allan] Thank you

304
00:13:48,267 --> 00:13:50,600
- [Announcer] Appreciate it.
