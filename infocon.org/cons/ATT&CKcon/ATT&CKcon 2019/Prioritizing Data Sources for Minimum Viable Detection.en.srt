1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,078
- [Announcer] Please join me
in welcoming Keith McCammon.

2
00:00:04,078 --> 00:00:05,689
(Audience applauding)

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:06,522
- Thank you very much.

4
00:00:06,522 --> 00:00:08,093
All right, thank you all.

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,150
Thank you very much to
the entire Miter team

6
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,990
for having us here, it's
been a super fun event,

7
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,360
I've had a ton of fun just meeting,

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,130
getting to know folks
over the last couple days

9
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,939
and having a bunch of good discussions.

10
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:24,050
So, following the last talk,

11
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,670
this will be effectively your
freshman level introduction

12
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,780
to data sources, right?

13
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,380
So, the stuff that you just saw,

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,230
is super useful for digging
into a lot of the nits

15
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,269
that you encounter, and
some of the really hard

16
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,440
operational challenges it relates to,

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,669
to dealing with data sources.

18
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,717
But, gonna bring it up a little bit.

19
00:00:44,717 --> 00:00:48,800
And so, I'm Keith, nice
to meet those of you

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,163
I haven't met, and hello
to everyone at home.

21
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,180
Going to, by way of
background introduction,

22
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,430
I've been at this for
around 20 years, I guess,

23
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,004
in the security industry.

24
00:01:01,004 --> 00:01:04,420
And, as I was preparing
for my talk this morning,

25
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,120
which means I was reading Twitter,

26
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,540
I came across a Tweet.

27
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,420
Jeremiah Grossman.

28
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,550
So, if you don't know him,

29
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,410
he's more useful to follow than I am,

30
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,310
or pretty much anybody else.

31
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,250
So, he had some really
interesting thoughts,

32
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,780
and he had kinda posed
a question this morning,

33
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,400
which just, literally
as I pulled up the app,

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,640
sitting there in front of
me, and really resonated.

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,877
And, the question he asked was,

36
00:01:28,877 --> 00:01:30,756
"If there was one thing you wish you knew,

37
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,457
"or a piece of advice,"
and I'm paraphrasing here,

38
00:01:33,457 --> 00:01:34,289
"that you wish you had gotten

39
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,267
"when you got into InfoSec, what was it?"

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,940
And, he provided a couple
of answers of his own.

41
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:44,007
One of those was, "To
focus a little bit less

42
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:45,747
"on what's possible,

43
00:01:45,747 --> 00:01:48,953
"and really think
through what's probable."

44
00:01:48,953 --> 00:01:51,470
And, that really resonated.

45
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,020
It's really, really easy,
particularly if you've done work

46
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,270
for the government or
other places like that,

47
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,690
you know what's possible, right?

48
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,450
And, a lot of these things have
become public knowledge now,

49
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,150
so now we have a really great appreciation

50
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:09,530
for what really, really
high-end, adversary tools

51
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,540
and techniques and trade craft look like.

52
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,517
And, it's really easy
to get mired in like,

53
00:02:14,517 --> 00:02:17,067
"Okay, if I go do these things,

54
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:20,300
"there's still someone
that's going to beat me."

55
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,040
If that's your threat model,

56
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,810
you can rest pretty much assured

57
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,180
that someone's always going to beat you.

58
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,570
So, just trying to think
through how to get started.

59
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:33,920
And, when I thought about
what we're here to talk about

60
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,369
and learn and share, a lot of it,

61
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,640
just for a little bit of context,

62
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,100
as we've gone through
the last couple years

63
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,813
trying to help build a
community around ATT&CK.

64
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,343
As practitioners, as just
community builders in general,

65
00:02:51,343 --> 00:02:55,649
trying to think through
how do we take this

66
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,670
massive body of knowledge and make it

67
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,220
really approachable for people?

68
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:03,010
How do we figure out how to get started,

69
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,649
more so than anything else,

70
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:07,760
the subtext behind this,
and I think the point of,

71
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,709
hopefully the next 20 or so minutes,

72
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:13,340
is it's four people who
are trying to figure out

73
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,190
how to get started.

74
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,109
How do you take this body of knowledge

75
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:19,210
that we've now compiled,
this taxonomy we have

76
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,970
for describing the things
that attackers want,

77
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,863
and then the ways that
they go to get them?

78
00:03:25,863 --> 00:03:27,860
And, how do you dip your toe in,

79
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,590
what's one of the first things you can do?

80
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,690
And so, thinking through
this in the context

81
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,310
of detection engineering,

82
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,760
which is not the focus of the talk,

83
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,030
but is a really interesting
way to think through

84
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:44,460
how you go from data sources
to operational detection,

85
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,020
is you have these three
things you need to do, right?

86
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,510
You need to make sure you're
collecting the right data,

87
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,149
first and foremost.

88
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,390
Having worked for many of these decades,

89
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,010
or for a couple decades now,

90
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,840
alongside some folks
doing really, really great

91
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,100
forensics work, in addition
to security operations

92
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:06,290
and other things, a principle,
or I guess, a phrase

93
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,537
that's always stuck with me is,

94
00:04:07,537 --> 00:04:10,393
"You can't go back in time
to collect evidence," right?

95
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,859
See Richard sitting out here,

96
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,140
who is a pioneer of thinking of things,

97
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,229
not waiting until you need
data to go try to find it.

98
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,110
Collect as much as you
can, as early as you can.

99
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,560
And so, there's a balance you
have to strike there, right?

100
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,120
Once you collect that data,

101
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,140
then you need to ask the
right questions of it.

102
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,270
This is where the work that we're doing

103
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,549
inside of ATT&CK is really,
really valuable, right?

104
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,420
What questions might I need to ask?

105
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,860
What are the things that
adversaries are going to do?

106
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,910
So that I can go formulate questions

107
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,910
to ask of my data set.

108
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,400
And then, you have to be able
to answer those questions.

109
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,349
So, if you've ever bought a product,

110
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,290
and you kind of turn detection
all the way up to 11,

111
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,110
and now you turn on the Miter ATT&CK feed,

112
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,250
that's awesome, right?

113
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,340
So, you've got exceptional
visibility, maybe,

114
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,393
but now you've got 10,000 questions

115
00:05:02,393 --> 00:05:03,859
that you need to go answer.

116
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,380
And, for most teams, that's
not achievable, either, right?

117
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,963
And so, again, striking some balance.

118
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,090
What does this have to do with the tech?

119
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,240
Heat maps, there's a lot of fixation on

120
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,513
measuring detection.

121
00:05:18,393 --> 00:05:21,289
If we've proved anything as an industry,

122
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,730
at least for as long as I've been in it,

123
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,890
it's that objectively measuring detection,

124
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:29,820
protection, prevention, however
you wanna think about it,

125
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,570
is exceptionally difficult, right?

126
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,670
These things are very context based.

127
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,700
Detecting a thing or observing
a thing in one environment

128
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,340
doesn't necessarily
correlate in terms of scope,

129
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,260
impact, severity, when you look

130
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,520
across a whole bunch of them, right?

131
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,909
So, we love to fixate
on measuring detection,

132
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,380
building heat maps, things like that.

133
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,380
And, they're valuable for some purposes.

134
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,900
It's very, very easy to skip
over some of the fundamentals,

135
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,349
which are, like, "Am I
collecting the right data?"

136
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,270
And, particularly for those
of you getting started, right?

137
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,010
If you're trying to think through

138
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,443
defending an enterprise
for the first time,

139
00:06:04,443 --> 00:06:07,010
whether it's because
you're new to the industry,

140
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,440
or because you're a team
of one trying to build

141
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,620
a security program in a
company that doesn't have one.

142
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,980
Trying to take that first step
can be a little bit daunting.

143
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,140
So, can't detect things
that we can't see, right?

144
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,490
Observability comes
before everything else.

145
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,400
If you think through asking
questions of your data,

146
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,549
and then being able to
answer those questions,

147
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,801
if you don't have the
right data to begin with,

148
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:33,500
everything else is moot, right?

149
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,860
So, specific to attack data sources,

150
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,850
those are really, really useful

151
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,710
for a couple particular things,

152
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,909
like there's a bunch of use cases,

153
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,180
but I think the two that
I always come back to are

154
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,870
being able to assign value,
objectively, to data,

155
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,963
and therefore to tools and
solutions that you implement,

156
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,310
and then measuring progress
and coverage, right?

157
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,520
If there's one heat map to rule them all,

158
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,229
that I think is
exceptionally useful as a way

159
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,580
for people to think about
how they're making progress

160
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,450
in their program, and whether
they're spending money

161
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,599
on solution implementation,
tools, what have you,

162
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,600
in the right way, it's
that you wanna make sure

163
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:19,880
that, above all else,
coverage continues to improve

164
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,550
in a thoughtful way, right?

165
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,190
Again, asking questions of data,

166
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,000
operationalizing that
coverage, can be challenging

167
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,310
to various degrees, and
at various points in time

168
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,869
to different folks in
different organizations.

169
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,460
But, making sure that you're
thoughtfully collecting

170
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,616
the right data, that you
understand that cost,

171
00:07:38,617 --> 00:07:39,810
and that you understand those trade-offs

172
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,610
first and foremost is
really valuable, right?

173
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,680
So, a couple obligatory nods here,

174
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,840
I'll start with the ones not listed,

175
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,941
which is like the entire
team at Red Canary,

176
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:52,580
who've done and continue to
do most of the great work

177
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,067
that kind of guides my
thinking about this stuff,

178
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:57,253
Olaf and the Rodriguez brothers.

179
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,740
Just a couple of things that I've used,

180
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,060
resources, people I've followed,

181
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,620
work that I've really
enjoyed following over time.

182
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,590
And, specific to this, things that I used

183
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,609
to help think through
other ways to look at

184
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,513
or value data sources, right?

185
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,080
And, obviously the attack team,

186
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,152
for putting this all together.

187
00:08:19,152 --> 00:08:22,260
So, I use these words in the title,

188
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,700
which seemed like a really neat idea

189
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:26,090
when I think we spent a half hour or so

190
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,673
coming up with the title
for this talk months ago.

191
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,150
And, now I'm backed in to
having defined this thing.

192
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:34,770
So, this is a pretty open
ended concept, right?

193
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,669
So, this is not the point of the talk.

194
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,270
But, going back to how you get started,

195
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,760
and the context of Jeremiah's question,

196
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,483
and the answer that he
provided this morning.

197
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,350
It's just being in a position
to detect most threats,

198
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,550
most of the time, right?

199
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,599
This is not where your
program wants to end up,

200
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,500
I'm not suggesting that you go figure out

201
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,130
how to detect 80% of things,

202
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,370
and then declare victory,

203
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,370
but I am suggesting that this
is a really, really useful

204
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,960
way to get started, and a
really, really useful...

205
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,240
Forcing function for
building a solid foundation

206
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,073
for your program.

207
00:09:12,073 --> 00:09:16,360
So, extending that a little bit,

208
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,640
a few principles that I wanted to lay out,

209
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,939
just as we talk through some
of the more mechanical pieces

210
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,940
of this, these three things
are kind of the guides

211
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,040
that I keep in my brain all the time,

212
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,780
and the words that I try to remind myself

213
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,613
as I'm thinking through,

214
00:09:33,613 --> 00:09:35,327
"Hey, it would be really,
really neat to go off

215
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:36,727
"and do this thing."

216
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,099
Does it maximize coverage?

217
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,750
So again, thinking through...

218
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,530
The one heat map that
I always come back to

219
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,656
in my brain, which is,

220
00:09:45,657 --> 00:09:48,577
"Do I have visibility
into a greater percentage

221
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:51,374
"of techniques than I had yesterday?"

222
00:09:51,374 --> 00:09:54,050
Just from an engineering perspective.

223
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,762
Minimize complexity, right?

224
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,940
Again, this is probably not
the talk for those of you

225
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,549
working at an institution
that has a huge team,

226
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:04,063
and 100 tools.

227
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,819
This is the talk for those
of you who have a small team,

228
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,780
you're under-resource,
you're trying to figure out

229
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,010
how to move the needle.

230
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:15,560
And again, take that first
step, build a solid foundation,

231
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,660
and build some great momentum.

232
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,640
And, optimize for answers, right?

233
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,510
So, at every step along the way,

234
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,319
as you're going and
starting to hoard more data,

235
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,193
that's awesome.

236
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:29,610
As you go and formulate
analytics to apply to that data,

237
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,070
which is also a great
exercise to go through,

238
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,740
at the end of the day, there is a huge gap

239
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,010
between just having
great analytic coverage,

240
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,040
and doing detection.

241
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,640
Which is that, you need to figure out

242
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,140
which of those questions you've asked,

243
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,100
which of those investigative
leads you've created.

244
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,110
Which of those things matter?

245
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,053
Which of them matter?

246
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:50,700
And, there might be 100 that matter,

247
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,480
but there might be 10
of that 100 that matter

248
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,920
a lot more than the rest.

249
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,229
And, you had better get
good at figuring out

250
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,600
how to get from Point A to Point B,

251
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,040
if you wanna achieve good outcomes.

252
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,490
So, these three things, as
we talk through the rest,

253
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,790
just kind of keep in mind.

254
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,860
So, kinda glanced over the slide,

255
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,640
the data sources, really
is the lynch pin of attack.

256
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,290
Again, without these, everything else

257
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,360
that we wanna do with
this fantastic framework

258
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,340
is kind of like...

259
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,020
It's a secondary discussion, right?

260
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:25,050
So, I had to jam these
in at the last minute,

261
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,030
and I think these continue
to change every time.

262
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:30,459
As the Rodriguez brothers
were giving their talk,

263
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,100
I had the little moment of panic

264
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,610
that I got the numbers completely wrong.

265
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,080
It turns out, today I'm only off by one.

266
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,860
These are 48 hours, or 72 hours old.

267
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,410
So, the numbers aside, and I
think there's great tools now

268
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,120
for going and interrogating this data.

269
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,243
But, 59 data sources, and this
is just Enterprise ATT&CK,

270
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,780
that span the 266 techniques.

271
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,370
I'm assuming the website's
right and I'm not.

272
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,910
So, useful for understanding

273
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,569
how we observe a given technique.

274
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,033
That's the purpose, right?

275
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,930
There are some nits,
once you get into this,

276
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,495
and I think the fantastic
tools that you'll see

277
00:12:13,495 --> 00:12:15,500
in Hunter's Forge, places like that,

278
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,830
are extremely useful.

279
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,517
As I was kinda watching that talk,

280
00:12:18,517 --> 00:12:21,410
those are the ways you
wanna go address these nits,

281
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,163
once you get in to operation.

282
00:12:24,273 --> 00:12:26,080
Do you need one or all data sources

283
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,930
to properly observe a technique?

284
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,793
Windows event logs are a
really, really, good example.

285
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,060
You may only need one
of the ten data sources

286
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,250
inside of your environment,
to observe that technique

287
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,170
in a way that informs you well enough

288
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,819
to develop an analytic and
ultimately get to an answer,

289
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,600
to perform detection.

290
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,730
And, they're not clearly defined,

291
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,860
which is also fine, right?

292
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,810
One of things, one of the principles,

293
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,500
is to minimize complexity,
and when you look at

294
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,527
all of the work that goes into ATT&CK,

295
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,640
refining and continuing
to evolve this matrix

296
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,240
and this body of knowledge,
not super important

297
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,860
that we have these
things perfectly defined.

298
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,450
What is important is that they're there,

299
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,140
and that we think about them, right?

300
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,803
So, now let's talk about where we start.

301
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,530
There are kind of four ways,
there's this progression,

302
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,970
that I think, I've at least gone through.

303
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,530
This has been my mental journey,

304
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,220
and I know many of the folks on my team,

305
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,570
and a few others that
I've talked to this week,

306
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:30,140
these are the four steps
that are really high level.

307
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,430
Understand prevalence, so just

308
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,223
which things occur most often.

309
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,550
Then, focus on a class of data or product.

310
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,453
And, this is one where if
you're just getting started,

311
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,660
maybe the decision's a little bit easier,

312
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,719
once you get farther into your program,

313
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,290
now you're trying to close gaps.

314
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,270
You can go through this
iteratively, right?

315
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,760
Your decision the first time
you go through this process

316
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,390
may be completely
different from the decision

317
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:57,040
or the conclusions, or the waiting

318
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,060
that you assigned to these data sources

319
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,542
second, third, fourth time.

320
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,910
Then, you're gonna differentiate
within a class of product,

321
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,449
and then you're gonna
overlay what we know,

322
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,840
things we've heard about.

323
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,070
I'm gonna kinda skip over
the intel parts of this,

324
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,440
but we've done a really good job, I think,

325
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,670
of helping everyone understand
why it's so important

326
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:20,430
that we share operational
data and insights,

327
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,810
so that folks, whether
you're just getting started,

328
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,170
or whether you're trying
to close those gaps,

329
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,923
achieve, go from 80%
to 85% to 90% to 100%,

330
00:14:30,992 --> 00:14:32,640
wherever you are, it's super important

331
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,080
to be able to overlay
some operational context

332
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,180
and understand how and
why these things happen

333
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,012
in the real world.

334
00:14:38,013 --> 00:14:41,453
So, understanding prevalence is simple.

335
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,930
This wouldn't be a con talk
if there wasn't a typo.

336
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,469
So, Hunter's Forge, not Hunter's
Force, which thankfully,

337
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,320
you spent the last half
hour hearing about.

338
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,960
I think this is a pretty dope name,

339
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,331
it's just a little more
superhero than it is

340
00:14:57,331 --> 00:14:58,164
"Lord of the Rings."

341
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:03,164
But, at any rate, this
tool is only providing this

342
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,340
because it was a tool that I
came up with some time ago,

343
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,200
just to answer some of
these questions for myself.

344
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,943
So, not going to spend any time on it.

345
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,330
I use it to make numbers,

346
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,840
you need to be able to
recreate those numbers,

347
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,490
so you have some confidence
I'm not lying at the end.

348
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:22,252
So, top data sources by prevalence, right?

349
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,620
And, I think there's already
been a good bit of discussion

350
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,110
about this last couple days.

351
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,943
But, this is it.

352
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,585
So, these are the top 10 data sources,

353
00:15:31,586 --> 00:15:35,330
in the ATT&CK data set, or the
Enterprise ATT&CK data set,

354
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:38,433
as it exists today, or 72 hours ago.

355
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,920
I'm assuming they haven't
changed much in that time.

356
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,970
That's pretty straightforward, right?

357
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,110
So, now let's think about how we take that

358
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,210
and focus on a class of data or a product.

359
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:54,650
I tried to group these data sources

360
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:59,650
very notionally, based
on the types of devices,

361
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,650
collection platforms they'll come from.

362
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,150
So, you've got some endpoint,
you've got some network.

363
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,160
You have some things that
can come from either,

364
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,939
think NetFlow and stuff like that.

365
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:12,130
And, that's really down to how much,

366
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,260
what type of coverage you're after.

367
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:16,180
We now have cloud, as of a few days ago,

368
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,650
which was the first pass at
screwing up all the numbers

369
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:20,300
I had put together for this deck.

370
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,463
And then, you have other,

371
00:16:22,463 --> 00:16:24,209
so these are things like mail server logs,

372
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:28,293
web server logs, they're specific
to types of applications,

373
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,490
they're materially useful
inside of the data set,

374
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,920
particularly depending on the techniques

375
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,920
that you care about.

376
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,970
But, taking those and just understanding

377
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,067
at a really high level like,

378
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:42,617
"What types of things am I
going to collect data from,

379
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:45,676
"so that I know what solutions I need

380
00:16:45,677 --> 00:16:47,500
"to move this needle forward?"

381
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,560
Then, if you just take that top 10

382
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,160
that I showed you, and look
at where those come from,

383
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,500
now it becomes a little bit more clear.

384
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,930
And so, it will come as
no surprise to any of you,

385
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,000
although having spent most of my career

386
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,540
packet monkeying, so to speak,

387
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,369
spend most of my time now
working with endpoint data.

388
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:10,879
And so, this is not a
suggestion that you should do

389
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,880
one or the other, you
should absolutely do both.

390
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,010
Again, thinking through how you start,

391
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,910
or how you make the next step forward.

392
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:20,060
So now, let's assume,
for sake of argument,

393
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,983
now you're digging in to
wanting to close this 80%.

394
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:27,760
Now, you've gotta differentiate
within a class of product,

395
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,260
and this is where things
start to get interesting.

396
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,930
So you need some data from your endpoints,

397
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,513
what the heck do you do?

398
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,450
You've got a couple
solutions here, and if...

399
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,940
This is always a super
interesting conversation

400
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,698
to have with folks that
are trying to implement

401
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,770
any type of endpoint based data collection

402
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,803
for the first time.

403
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,310
Which of the things
that's available to you

404
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,610
do you start with?

405
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:57,050
And, there are tons of choices.

406
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:00,090
There's open-source
stuff, you've got Cisbon,

407
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,600
you've got all these other providers,

408
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,620
on Mac, OS, Linex, things like that.

409
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,560
You've got a variety of ways
to contain off endpoints.

410
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,970
Then, you've got commercial products.

411
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:12,390
And so, in thinking
through how to process that

412
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,670
for purposes of making
an initial decision,

413
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,610
have found it useful to
just bucket them into

414
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,669
one of two categories.

415
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:24,430
There are solutions that
are visibility first,

416
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,280
meaning that they are optimized

417
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,639
for collecting data consistently.

418
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,938
Meaning, these data types
here that are filled in,

419
00:18:31,938 --> 00:18:35,133
they're optimized for collecting
that data all the time.

420
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,920
On the other side of that,

421
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,310
you have protection-first solutions.

422
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,879
So, these are things, their first job is

423
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,633
to defend the endpoint.

424
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,899
They also try to account
for collection of data

425
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,000
that's useful for hunting
and investigation,

426
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,960
and things like that.

427
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,780
But, that's not their
primary purpose in life.

428
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,889
Their primary purpose in life is to

429
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,520
prevent bad things from
happening, first and foremost.

430
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,170
Then, they're fulfilling
these investigative,

431
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,493
threat-hunting, detection investigation,

432
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,210
use cases secondarily.

433
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:11,470
So, that's cute, and
that's a neat picture,

434
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,070
but now you've gotta figure out,

435
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,149
the point of this is to
put some data behind this.

436
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,700
So, to give you some objective
basis for making a decision.

437
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,440
And so, the way that I ended up doing this

438
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,297
was just to say, "All right,
for a visibility solution,

439
00:19:27,297 --> 00:19:29,597
"which could be a commercial solution,

440
00:19:29,597 --> 00:19:32,067
"it could be something
like Cisbon modular,

441
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:34,167
"where you can just take the
thing that you already have

442
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:36,587
"in a Windows environment,
apply a config to it,

443
00:19:36,587 --> 00:19:37,563
"flip it on.

444
00:19:38,847 --> 00:19:43,847
"Enumerate the data types
that are collected always

445
00:19:43,877 --> 00:19:48,167
"from most of the products or
solutions in those buckets."

446
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,520
You can see here, for
visibility solutions,

447
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,120
again open source or commercial,

448
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,239
these tend to be the data types

449
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,820
that you're going to
get very consistently,

450
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,560
assuming you don't monkey
with the configuration.

451
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,639
On the protection side, they do the thing,

452
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,590
like if you think about the data sources

453
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,080
at the top of the list,
they very clearly optimize

454
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,419
for collecting those all of the time.

455
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,110
You will absolutely get other
types of data from them,

456
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,990
but you're going to get it selectively.

457
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,260
Those agents are going to try to decide

458
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,060
when a process or a
behavior's interesting,

459
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,260
and then they're going to
provide you with additional data

460
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,320
in those cases.

461
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,720
And so, this tool will look at that,

462
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,270
just makes it easy to
measure this in some way.

463
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,720
So, if you take those EDR data sources

464
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,630
as effectively protection.

465
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,480
Meaning, effective,
like any product you buy

466
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,720
to do endpoint protection,

467
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,280
that also does some data collection,

468
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,520
is going to give you process monitoring

469
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,620
and process command line monitoring.

470
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,300
Those are the two common data elements.

471
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,300
That gets you 70%.

472
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,720
That's pretty freakin' good,

473
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,900
from going from nothing to something.

474
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,490
Being able to cover down on 70%

475
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,370
just by throwing almost
any product out there

476
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,250
that attempts to meet these use cases,

477
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,453
is super valuable.

478
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,149
Work heavily with CB Response.

479
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,521
This is not a product talk, but

480
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:16,330
that gets you up over 80%, right?

481
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,163
That's awesome.

482
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,550
For the first time, literally
just a few days ago,

483
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,486
it was like, "All right,
I'll take a look at

484
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:23,807
"Cisbon modular, we'll dig into that,

485
00:21:23,807 --> 00:21:25,267
"we'll enumerate the data sources that

486
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:29,097
"that provides consistently, 85%, almost.

487
00:21:29,097 --> 00:21:31,470
"Like 84%, 85%."

488
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,870
For something that costs you nothing.

489
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,173
Other than just your time to turn it on.

490
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,340
Again, not talking about
building analytics,

491
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,939
we're not talking about
operations, investigation,

492
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,790
and the ends data detection,

493
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,180
we're just trying to figure out

494
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:50,180
which of these things moves
the needle on collecting data

495
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,910
that the attack matrix
says might be useful.

496
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,890
Observations.

497
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,110
Putting ourselves in a position

498
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:59,020
to observe the things that matter.

499
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,690
So, that's kind of just, again,

500
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,530
we're three quarters of
the way through this,

501
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,920
the last piece is the piece, I think,

502
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,180
that you've heard a lot about.

503
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,210
So, that's just overlaying
the operational context.

504
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:15,640
So, while it's neat to
build a great foundation,

505
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,500
and to know that you're
collecting the right data.

506
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,820
And, while it's neat to
have some objective basis

507
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,639
for assigning value to that data,

508
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,343
or helping you make a
implementation decision,

509
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,070
now you've gotta take
advantage of the things

510
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:30,659
that we learn as a community

511
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,950
from putting this into practice,

512
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,570
from the folks that have
gone and built analytics

513
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,810
on top of this, and have
gone through the exercise

514
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:39,720
of going from asking
thousands of questions

515
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,860
of this data set to
finding a handful of things

516
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,060
that matter and that
you need to respond to.

517
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,820
Taking that operational
context and overlaying it.

518
00:22:50,943 --> 00:22:53,250
This was shown yesterday by John,

519
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,730
but this is just the top 10
from our report last year,

520
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,100
which is just showing,

521
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,520
having a team that's built
thousands of analytics

522
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,050
for this stuff, looking
at all those things,

523
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,667
answering those questions like,

524
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:07,500
"Is it bad?

525
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,333
"Is it not?"

526
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,190
And then, escalating it to an enterprise

527
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,920
so that they can respond.

528
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,260
These are the top 10,
just based on prevalence.

529
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,550
And so, now, when you apply this,

530
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,330
you take this and you kind of overlay it

531
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:22,740
with the data source
prevalence information.

532
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,450
Now you can start to make some of those

533
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,760
really hard decisions with respect to

534
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,690
features or functionality of tools or...

535
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,050
Because, you can't afford
to collect everything.

536
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,500
Not everyone can afford
to take Cis on modular

537
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,080
and just turn the thing on

538
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,322
and assume that you can
operationalize that.

539
00:23:40,704 --> 00:23:41,760
You're going to make trade offs,

540
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,629
security and risk management.

541
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,260
For those of you who are new to it,

542
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,720
welcome to a career of making trade offs.

543
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,650
It's super exciting.

544
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,613
And, a great thought exercise.

545
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,600
But again, just taking this stuff

546
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,179
and trying to think through how and when

547
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,930
you would overlay that in
your decision making process.

548
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,610
And then, you can start to look at trends.

549
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:04,050
So, I think it was asked, indirectly,

550
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,850
if we're doing threat
report again this year,

551
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,360
of course we are.

552
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,580
It's also gonna talk about that.

553
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,919
But, this is an interesting
way to think about those,

554
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,690
and more so than anything else,

555
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,900
now that Mitre's collecting
the citings' data.

556
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,320
For those of you who are in a position

557
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,050
to provide citings' data,

558
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:20,629
this is why this becomes critical.

559
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:25,630
Because, prioritizing
data sources in practice

560
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,490
is going to be different
for every enterprise.

561
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:32,090
How those trends change over time

562
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,449
is going to be different as an industry,

563
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:38,070
as an enterprise, as industry verticals,

564
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,195
things like that.

565
00:24:39,195 --> 00:24:43,230
So, power shells across the board,

566
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,470
we continue to see that.

567
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,920
But then, you look at stuff like this,

568
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,630
which is really, really interesting

569
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,210
when you think about the implications

570
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,173
of what you collect and how you use it.

571
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,350
Windows admin shares and remote file copy,

572
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:59,629
in the last twelve months, just like this.

573
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,380
Does anybody know who to thank for that?

574
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,820
Imhotep. (laughs)

575
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,149
Right?

576
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:08,240
It is the great destroyer of enterprise

577
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,280
in the last twelve months.

578
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,710
And, when you think about data sources

579
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,010
and operationalizing those,

580
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,889
and prioritizing how you respond,

581
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,530
these are the things that,

582
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:20,050
once you get over the hump
of collecting the data

583
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:23,000
that you want, and figuring
out what to do with it,

584
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,100
now you can start to take
data from the community,

585
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,139
whether it's from reports from us,

586
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,633
or CrowdStrike, or whomever.

587
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,510
But, more importantly,
even just things you learn

588
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,120
inside of these Slack communities,

589
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,110
and by sharing information
with one another

590
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,899
here and elsewhere, right?

591
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,140
Applying that context.

592
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,770
I only put this in here, 'cause I think

593
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:45,340
I walk into pretty much every
threat intelligence discussion

594
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,679
with the going in position

595
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,920
that it's pretty much always fishing.

596
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,410
We can get into the nits of
like 1,000 attack techniques,

597
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:56,350
how breaches happen, I
think, in a lot of our minds,

598
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,490
is still, it's always fishing.

599
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,370
Which I realize, I'm oversimplifying,

600
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,239
but for the first time ever,

601
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,130
that took a dip down in our data set,

602
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,280
but that's neither here nor there.

603
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,770
So, the important takeaway is that,

604
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,560
again, just to reinforce
what you've already heard,

605
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,870
everyone here be thinking,

606
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,060
whether it's on an individual basis,

607
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:18,970
in a Slack community or
whatever, or as a program.

608
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,490
Like, if you're a large enterprise,

609
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,670
and you're building analytics,

610
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:24,320
and have this data,
and have this resource,

611
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,439
if you're a service provider, very much,

612
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,381
Mitre's got the citings'
program which is ramping up,

613
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:32,250
we have a way to do this now,

614
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,330
and maybe for the first time ever,

615
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:38,260
we have a way to share really
useful threat intelligence

616
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,250
in a way that scales and
doesn't betray privacy

617
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,360
and things like that.

618
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,439
The concerns we've had

619
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,040
when we try to over-complicate
sharing domains

620
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,600
and IPs and hashes.

621
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,199
So, everyone be thinking
about how you can contribute,

622
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,360
whether it's thinking about new ways

623
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,649
to prioritize data sources, assign value,

624
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,790
getting into the details of implementing

625
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:04,260
a particular data source,
and the attributes of those

626
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:08,930
that are interesting, or
just sharing operational data

627
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,010
at a high level.

628
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:13,035
What outcomes did you actually achieve?

629
00:27:13,035 --> 00:27:16,180
And again, just kinda getting
back to those principles,

630
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,110
and to kind of keep in the spirit of this,

631
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:21,889
hopefully being a 100 level talk at best,

632
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:26,580
is just maximizing coverage,
try to minimize complexity

633
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,340
whenever you can, and just
keep optimizing for answers.

634
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,100
And, I think a lot of the
stuff that you've seen

635
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,870
over the course of the last couple days,

636
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,179
and hopefully this way
to think about just,

637

00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,570
is kind of a useful first step.

640
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,905
That's it, thank you
very much, appreciate it.
