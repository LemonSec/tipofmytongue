1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,300
please join me in welcoming our to

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,460
Deloitte Argentina speakers

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:30,989
Valentina Palestine and Ruth Barbra

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:34,589
still show you how to build your own

5
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:37,120
first we are going to go to what exactly

6
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:40,239
the library then we are going to cover

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,928
how to build one cheese pickle it about

8
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,640
the problems that we encounter and

9
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:47,710
finally we are going to end with some

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:51,309
lessons we learned that you can take

11
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:54,280
with you but first I'm going to talk a

12
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:57,839
little bit about our backgrounds so Ruth

13
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:00,489
is that a library team project leader

14
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:04,059
she started with the project around

15
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:06,190
almost four years ago she is an

16
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:09,759
information security specialist an

17
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:13,030
information system engineer and myself I

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,880
have a background in translation

19
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:18,970
so I contributed the project around for

20
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,920
two year almost few years now with 30

21
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:23,470
helping with the editorial process and

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:27,810
I'm also using my programming skills to

23
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:32,080
help me automation and data analysis a

24
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:34,750
little bit about what why we came out

25
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,610
with this project when I first started

26
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:39,130
in cyber threat intelligence one of my

27
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:41,980
first tasks was to collect indicators of

28
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:44,410
compromise from public sources this was

29
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:47,800
a really exhausting job it was really

30
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:50,440
messy but we learn a lot about in the

31
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,050
way and now is luckily everything is

32
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,300
scripting so now we don't have to do

33
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:57,280
that anymore but we learn a lot in this

34
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,649
process so one of the things that we

35
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,960
have to do in those extra spreadsheet

36
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:04,870
that we use for a indicators collection

37
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,889
was to describe the malware that we were

38
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:10,000
a conducting indicate indicators from so

39
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,270
what is interesting about this is that

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,720
the description often mixes were where

41
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,630
the

42
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,130
were there adductors and the campaigns

43
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,250
and pivoting through this data was

44
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:23,079
really difficult if I wanted to know

45
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,300
what other and malware pieces were using

46
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,570
a 3dr it was really difficult for me to

47
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,980
do that so one day we were with Shay

48
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,510
blog and we were talking with the

49
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:35,170
director of sensor intelligence team

50
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:37,209
which is susana Martinez and he and me

51
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,709
we were just thinking about how we can

52
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,750
improve the information that we were

53
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,910
already collecting but showing in an

54
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,170
interesting way that you can acquire in

55
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:49,660
an easy way

56
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:52,059
so this is how the library started but

57
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,730
what it seems to be like the solution to

58
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,709
all of our desires and needs may that

59
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:00,340
end up destroying us if we don't do it

60
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:02,709
well so let's start a little bit

61
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,320
managing the expectation of a process of

62
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:08,050
this kind so it's not a solution by

63
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,470
itself the project is meant to be for

64
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,940
analysts so they can dig into data

65
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,220
regarding the threat vector Sigma in an

66
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:18,070
easy way but they are the the main thing

67
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:21,220
thinkers about what the output is going

68
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:23,019
to be also this is not a collection of

69
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,300
all existing attacks there is too many

70
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:27,610
information there is too many things

71
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:30,489
happening out there so we focus only on

72
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:32,260
highly targeted attacks and focusing on

73
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:35,620
industries on which the load has clients

74
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:38,049
on this is also not an indicator field

75
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,209
you may find some indicators but it's

76
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:42,010
not meant to be as a field for a stock

77
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:44,230
or something like that it's only to

78
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,670
check the information and validate the

79
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,890
information that we are ready putting in

80
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:49,660
the page and also extracting some useful

81
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:53,619
things that can be helpful for a threat

82
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:55,030
hunting it's also not perfect people

83
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,310
that is writing the reapers that we are

84
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,720
consuming is people we are people so we

85
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,049
are prone to errors and we are not

86
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,959
perfect so we can't we have to put a

87
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:07,840
workflow which includes the Quality

88
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,150
Assurance to be able to put the most

89
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,510
information that we can in the most

90
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:16,329
meaningful way and it's also not fixed

91
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,459
in time because think how this is the

92
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:23,770
way as Frankenstein monster information

93
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:25,960
it's alive so what to do aspect of a

94
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,380
project of this kind is to have our

95
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,020
normalize and catalog

96
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:32,360
information so you can't find

97
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,570
information that you are trying to spot

98
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,300
in a particular specific place of the

99
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,980
report also you can see this as an

100
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,510
activity Journal we have a key

101
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,600
observables for each one of these

102
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:47,360
threads we gather a lot of operations of

103
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,450
the apt so this is a way that we can see

104
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,190
the evolution of them and also the idea

105
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,469
is to have all in one place so you don't

106
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,060
have to worry and go through a multiple

107
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,340
sources and dig through a lot of

108
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,440
information because we already done that

109
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,330
for you

110
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,140
so when we started with this we we are

111
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:07,729
seeing this huge monster which is a

112
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:10,159
composed of bullet resources private

113
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:12,170
spin-offs in services naming conventions

114
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,360
and a lot of things that overwhelm us

115
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:17,750
and we feel really tiny again against

116
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,760
this huge monster some of the issues

117
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,650
that we came across we are still

118
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,730
struggling with and we are not going to

119
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:27,859
to get rid of them sooner but we have

120
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:29,780
observed a lot of diverse formatting and

121
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,690
distribution of the information even for

122
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:35,599
one organization they have different

123
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:37,040
formatting a between a one report and

124
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,890
another so you don't find the

125
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,840
information always in the same place

126
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:44,120
also we observe a lot of overlapping and

127
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,010
attribution so we can't really validate

128
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,260
because we have a lack of context or

129
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,480
indicators and evidence of what they are

130
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:53,900
reporting on and that is really

131
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:57,770
difficult for us to put a confidence

132
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:59,419
level on that but this makes us feel

133
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:02,450
really like we are going to be crushed

134
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:07,910
by stress and fatigue but don't worry we

135
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:11,300
are not going to die moving forward with

136
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:13,130
this Indiana Jones analogy with some

137
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,470
time thing like being a very intelligent

138
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:18,020
al aliy analyst is a little bit of like

139
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:21,740
going through a jungle of information

140
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:24,590
open our way with the blade and finding

141
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:28,430
ancient data trying to dig and find the

142
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:31,369
treasure in it so what to do to not get

143
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:34,370
swamp a barrier but all that that huge

144
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,950
ancient information so what we do is to

145
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,700
follow a structure pretty similar to the

146
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,880
one mightor

147
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:43,490
using the webpage we distinguish the

148
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,310
banks and we kind of organize them into

149
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:48,980
AG against what are the industry they

150
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:51,860
hit mostly based on Deloitte's

151
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:53,960
industries of interest we also relate

152
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,360
them with the threat actors and with the

153
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,820
tools and we use the attack framework to

154
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:03,800
identify the tools the tools tactics

155
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:05,510
techniques and procedures well let's

156
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,070
talk a little bit what you will find

157
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:11,990
when you get into the shredder library

158
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:15,349
so the first thing we do is to our offer

159
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:17,900
all the campaigns around the day they

160
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,850
happened or if we don't have that

161
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:23,090
information at around the day they were

162
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:26,210
released we also try to follow the same

163
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:28,369
structure for all the titles we try we

164
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:31,580
will like to be able to see at a glance

165
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:33,650
the apt involve what was the target

166
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:38,510
could be the industry the country or

167
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:40,030
even an entity and with what and we find

168
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:42,680
that this structure is pretty useful

169
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:45,169
when you are doing analysis and also

170
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,410
when you are trying to prioritize or our

171
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:51,670
European process then when you get into

172
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:54,260
one incident this is like the scorecard

173
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:56,660
so you can see the campaign period the

174
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,969
release date a confidence level also

175
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,940
which regions country down industries

176
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:04,670
were affected and a little summary about

177
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:07,190
the incident and then if you don't like

178
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:09,350
enough and there's some information

179
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:11,570
about the victims like in the other case

180
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:16,160
this other case well you will see that

181
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:19,099
to you and we follow sticks terminology

182
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,040
to classify the campaign's according to

183
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,530
the intended effects behind them and

184
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:27,050
finally we provide a brief description

185
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:31,820
of the associated actor and a link to

186
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:33,950
the threat actor page then all these

187
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:37,039
scorecard is followed by what we call

188
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:38,870
the main information and the main

189
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,909
information is a structure in three

190
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,690
sections the first one is the initial

191
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:46,400
access section in which we try to

192
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:48,500
publish everything related to how the

193
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,680
threat actor gainful whole into the

194
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:54,050
victim system we provide

195
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,758
and also the files that were used

196
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:58,128
information about the files that were

197
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:00,379
used and a list of all the tools

198
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:03,559
involved with the description and a link

199
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:06,139
to the tool page also after that we

200
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:07,790
provide a technical description about

201
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:10,730
the campaign

202
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:14,269
finally the page closes with what we

203
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:17,779
call the analysis attribution at

204
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:20,119
geolocation information so for example

205
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:22,129
we put there if we have something that

206
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:25,279
could be meaningful to you know where

207
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:28,040
the shreditor is located or if there's

208
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:32,179
are similarities with other campaigns or

209
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:34,998
other groups and in the last section

210
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:37,249
which is the analysis we gather all the

211
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:39,980
information related to why the

212
00:09:37,249 --> 00:09:43,790
attribution was made or it wasn't made

213
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:48,920
and also when we can we also provide our

214
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:50,868
own assessments about the incident we

215
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,610
call it those because it's not only my

216
00:09:50,869 --> 00:09:55,490
word they are also legitimate tools

217
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:58,249
being abused for this kind of stuff but

218
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,889
we are following some some patterns

219
00:09:58,249 --> 00:10:02,870
similar to the attack software pages but

220
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:05,600
we added a couple of additional things

221
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:07,819
we added a description and a details in

222
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,410
the details we put a specific technical

223
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:12,679
stuff that they are using in that

224
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:15,589
specific campaign and we put a column of

225
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:18,050
campaign on which that Manoir was seen

226
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:20,420
and was reported so we do this because

227
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:23,089
we think that is the best way to a spot

228
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:25,910
when a procedure is changing when a

229
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:27,740
procedure is is changing the way that

230
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,870
the technique is being applied so you

231
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,689
can further understand how the traductor

232
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:34,610
is evolving we are also adding

233
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:37,699
information regarding the indicators

234
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:40,549
that we seen in those campaigns mainly a

235
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:42,740
network and file-related but this again

236
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:44,329
is not an indicator field this is only

237
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:48,170
to validate information that we are

238
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:50,420
really putting there and to also further

239
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:55,069
extract characteristic that may be

240
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:57,139
helpful in hunting after reporting for

241
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:59,089
three actors talking about having all in

242
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:02,240
one side in one page I think that this

243
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:04,759
is the most clear way to see it the

244
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,250
three actors has interesting scorecards

245
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:07,079
in which

246
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,120
we put all the things that we think that

247
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:11,459
are really important to spot at first

248
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,769
which are the affected regions countries

249
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:16,560
and industries but we also try to

250
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:19,170
understand what are the traductor types

251
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,060
if there are state sponsor if there are

252
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,920
a cybercrime actor also the

253
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,920
sophistication level of these reactors

254
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,689
and the motivations behind it and to do

255
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,459
this we follow again the sticks of

256
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:32,099
vocabulary because we want to use the

257
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:34,619
same language across all the industry

258
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,360
and if you seen the right part of the

259
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,120
screen you're going to see the content

260
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,459
table one of the things at the bottom

261
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,829
are the tool set and campaigns which are

262
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:46,199
just a summary of the to stand campaigns

263
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:48,779
that we are already mentioned but you

264
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:51,449
can see everything that it's related to

265
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:53,160
this sector and people to the data and

266
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:54,920
we have also a part of relevant

267
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,569
information this is done because

268
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,459
sometimes we find information that it

269
00:11:57,569 --> 00:12:00,870
can't be fit in any of these sectors

270
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:02,939
that we already mentioned or we can't

271
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:04,680
link them with a specific campaign but

272
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:06,839
we think that it's really important

273
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,790
information to have for example you can

274
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:12,420
see there we have the zero they will

275
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:15,449
really teach us by abt 28 and then it

276
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,660
says point of entry why okay so when we

277
00:12:15,449 --> 00:12:19,920
started this project we thought that

278
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:22,829
understanding the initial food whole on

279
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,509
the factors that did in the organization

280
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:26,670
was really important to our clients

281
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:28,319
but the tactic initial access leading

282
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:31,229
assist at the time so we came up with

283
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:33,509
this point of entry tactic and then when

284
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:38,220
I attack added to it with abrogate that

285
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:40,319
one honesty stick with the framework now

286
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,180
that we talk about what and the how

287
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:44,910
let's talk a little bit about the

288
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:46,709
problems we encounter so for sure the

289
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:50,219
most difficult to identify our the

290
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:52,589
fulfil flag campaigns the analysis bias

291
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:56,610
we have to remember that we work mostly

292
00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:58,980
with Western sources we'll try to do

293
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:01,829
otherwise sometimes but it's difficult

294
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:05,370
and time-consuming and also we have to

295
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:06,809
carry with our own bias too and also the

296
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:09,300
misattribution because I saw Bruce

297
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:11,459
mention sometimes a report general have

298
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,410
information about what why and

299
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:15,420
attribution was made or they don't have

300
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:18,209
indicate of compromise that we can

301
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:22,139
download to carry out our know on our

302
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:23,609
analysis but remembering that we are all

303
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:25,920
humans there are other things that

304
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:28,800
sometimes we spot and we have some

305
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,259
examples to show you these are some that

306
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,269
hit us in some way or another so we

307
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:36,779
identify and we're going to share with

308
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:39,569
you for example in this case we find

309
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:42,149
that allegedly there was a threat actor

310
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:45,029
target in Argentina so we were really

311
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:47,309
curious because just our area of work so

312
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:49,889
we went there and it turned out that

313
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:52,800
actually what happened was that

314
00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:55,410
indicators were uploaded for by our

315
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,079
research team so it's it's important to

316
00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:01,050
remember that not all the time where

317
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:03,239
where our file is uploaded is that it

318
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:06,689
means that the attack is happening there

319
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:09,050
but I'm sure this reduction is going to

320
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:12,540
hit us sooner rather than later

321
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:15,269
another thing we find problematic and

322
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:19,439
this is especially tricky one yes we

323
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:21,889
cannot know it all and the people that's

324
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:26,219
published in the report neither asked

325
00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:28,439
some sometimes we find things that if

326
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,899
you can't be the other side thick thank

327
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:32,819
you like disk in this case which is

328
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:34,829
referring a phishing campaign that

329
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:37,979
happened a long time ago

330
00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:42,049
so some beautiful soul found and the

331
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:46,499
Spanish expression which is actually an

332
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:48,589
swearing which is pronounced like which

333
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:51,990
I do mother

334
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:55,110
so now we can stir it like an

335
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:58,610
Argentinian but this beautiful soul

336
00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:02,990
translated as the shell of your mother

337
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:02,990
which is durable but is

338
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,719
but it's not exactly that as a clean set

339
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:13,490
meaning would be something like your

340
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:15,800
mother private parts and why why we are

341
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:19,399
talking about it why we are showing you

342
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:22,809
this well if we go to this map there are

343
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:26,899
20 countries in which Spanish is spoken

344
00:15:22,809 --> 00:15:28,189
officially and I'm stressing officially

345
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:31,550
because there are more countries in

346
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:34,248
which Spanish is spoke but from those 20

347
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:37,040
that expression is used only in seven

348
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:40,040
countries and we know this observable is

349
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,110
now enough on itself to assure that the

350
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,569
three lecture comes to from these places

351
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:48,230
but maybe we have another indication

352
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:50,628
indicators that we can add up to you to

353
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,089
say well it's from here and especially

354
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:55,459
considering that we have a fairly thread

355
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:59,689
actor fairly active trade actor on the

356
00:15:55,459 --> 00:16:02,809
region and finally really we left the

357
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:05,269
biggest headache for last which is the

358
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:07,399
overlapping attributions that it's the

359
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:09,980
way we call a multiple name and for the

360
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:12,379
same fair actors so the way we dealt

361
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,049
with this is to create something similar

362
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:18,499
to the attack matrix for tactics and

363
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:21,980
techniques but with benders and aliases

364
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:24,949
I'm sure you all really want to see it

365
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:27,559
but I'm not going to show you that it

366
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:30,349
takes a lot of work it takes a lot of

367
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:32,269
research at really complex and refine

368
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:35,299
work so we have to especially mention

369
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:36,740
one of our team members Francis even now

370
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:38,540
that couldn't be here with that that we

371
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:42,860
need him Freddy this you

372
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:48,849
he's helping it along with it and what

373
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:52,040
also do you is to steer a the sources so

374
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:54,610
we find a way to Rae the sources

375
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:59,089
consider considering its type

376
00:16:54,610 --> 00:17:00,980
also the using the matrix we raid the

377
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:03,860
vendors according to the best

378
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,750
miscibility by region based on public

379
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:10,010
reports remember we are always talking

380
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:11,659
about public reports also we rate in the

381
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:15,589
independent researchers by the

382
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:18,860
reputation and also we judge

383
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:22,158
the is the search has a you see so big

384
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:25,668
levels to carry out our own analysis but

385
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:28,519
even though having a formula is awesome

386
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:31,549
and we encourage everyone here to come

387
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:34,789
up with your own formula to do this it

388
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:38,809
is important to remember that you need

389
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:46,100
to be able to overrule it as you see fit

390
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:48,440
when necessary I want to teach you how

391
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,969
to read The Book of Secrets so let's

392
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,070
keep in mind when you're reading a

393
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,019
source you have to identify if they are

394
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:56,090
reporting about a threat actor a

395
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:58,190
campaign or a malware piece or maybe a

396
00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:00,049
combination of those in this case we're

397
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:02,570
going to focus only on what our malware

398
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:06,259
reports because we are going to struck

399
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:07,759
the TTP's from those first I want to do

400
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:09,830
to read the source and identify the

401
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,769
paragraph describing the behavior I

402
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:16,100
think if someone was yesterday they did

403
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:18,769
a CT I CT I training here that was great

404
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:22,399
and they explained this in a pretty neat

405
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:24,889
way but you have to it's basically the

406
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:27,139
same the same process you have to read a

407
00:18:24,889 --> 00:18:28,850
source identify identify the paragraph

408
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:31,100
they are describing their behaviors and

409
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:34,908
then you can move and identified the

410
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:38,299
tactic think just one second we have

411
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:40,399
already a attack has a 266 only

412
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:42,139
Enterprise techniques and only 12

413
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:43,939
tactics so clearly identifying the

414
00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:46,369
tactic is going to be much easier than

415
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:49,039
aspiring the technique once we have the

416
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:51,110
tactic that it belongs to we can't go

417
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,610
through the attack navigator for example

418
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,969
and look for all the techniques that

419
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:57,529
fits in under that a specific tactic and

420
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,119
being able to spot what are the

421
00:18:57,529 --> 00:19:02,090
description and the technique that

422
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:04,519
belongs to the description but you can

423
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:06,678
maybe don't find what you are searching

424
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:09,850
for and in that case you should create

425
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:15,440
your own so let's move to a couple of

426
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:17,570
examples of this this is a piece of

427
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,240
malware that the threat director is not

428
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:22,009
really using a lot of evasion but they

429
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,679
are using a Ballack certificate to sign

430
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:27,110
on this malware piece so this is clearly

431
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:29,240
a defense evasion technique and under

432
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:31,159
the defense evasion we can find a lot of

433
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,260
techniques but there is a specific

434
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:36,790
technique that suits the specific

435
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:39,620
description of this which is the

436
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:41,510
code-signing technique okay so we can

437
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,159
see it's saying the same the signing

438
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:45,560
certificate to emasculate the malware

439
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,670
and make it appear as legitimate so it's

440
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:50,000
clearly this technique that we are

441
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:53,690
trying to spot we have another example

442
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,850
with a little bit more tricky in this

443
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:59,300
case this is a local Gaga abstract of

444
00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:00,709
the report and in this case the three

445
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,200
lectures behind the smile were are

446
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:06,020
changing the default the credentials of

447
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,240
the illustrator accounts so the users

448
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:10,490
can't access to their system they can

449
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,470
work of course they can even read the

450
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:15,500
ransom note and have it adjust to pay

451
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:18,470
which we don't recommend at all but this

452
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,630
is clearly an impact tactic at the time

453
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,880
that we were writing this this

454
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,860
presentation we couldn't find any

455
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,620
technique that suits under this a

456
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:30,709
specific description so we came out with

457
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:33,830
our own in this case we are going to use

458
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:37,430
the naming convention of a attack on 0 1

459
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:38,899
which is our first technique rated you

460
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:41,240
should do the same you should stick with

461
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,760
one specific format so you don't get

462
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,950
lost and also we put a clear description

463
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,740
of the name so you can understand more

464
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:52,550
or less what we are trying to saying

465
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:55,040
with that technique but week ago I talk

466
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:57,590
other this technique and with our name

467
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,240
so now we can duplicate this one and we

468
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,620
can stick with the taxonomy that they

469
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:05,330
are using and stick with the framework

470
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:08,199
and move on so now that we talked about

471
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:10,370
what and the how and the problems let's

472
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,760
summarize everything with some lessons

473
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:15,409
we live that you could benefit from

474
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,930
first just that good technology to build

475
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:20,450
on think that information again

476
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:23,390
information it's alive the framework is

477
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:25,220
constantly evolution it is changing and

478
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:27,350
it has to be that way so the platform

479
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:29,180
you're going to use must support this

480
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:32,209
kind of evolution and this kind of

481
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,890
changes also do not misunderstand the

482
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:35,420
objectives again there is a lot of

483
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,100
information and a lot of attacks going

484
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,710
on so you have to understand that you

485
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:42,629
don't have unlimited resources you have

486
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:45,030
to focus on something so it's not

487
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:48,870
collecting everything again in our case

488
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:50,790
we are specifically trying to cover what

489
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:54,469
our highly targeted attacks against the

490
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:56,940
industries on which we have clients all

491
00:21:54,470 --> 00:22:00,020
really important is to define good

492
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:04,140
quality work clips so think about this

493
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:06,389
poor display content a percentage

494
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,900
content is the same and not content

495
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:13,470
presented at all so what we do is we

496
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:16,140
have a simplified version of the datoria

497
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:18,900
process so first someone goes into

498
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,090
production and creates a report after

499
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,550
example extracts the tactics and the

500
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:27,120
technique then someone else review it

501
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:29,550
and maybe it could add something some

502
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,909
maybe they're the producer forgot a

503
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:34,950
technique or missed something the

504
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:37,410
formatting is not right and then we will

505
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:40,050
be sent back to production until until

506
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:42,540
it's it's sufficiently good enough to go

507
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:44,909
to the proofreader which will be the

508
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,310
final set of eyes that will review it

509
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:49,770
the older content before it gets

510
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:55,320
approved and it will be accessible to

511
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:57,900
the client so sticking with good

512
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,929
presented content it's important that

513
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:04,380
you should all be choosing a taxonomy

514
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:06,210
and is sticking with it in arc for

515
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,800
example if you want we call thread

516
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:12,990
actors but miter uses adversary's and

517
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:15,810
you may want to call cyber actors or

518
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,880
enemies if you're actually it's your

519
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:20,040
choice but the important thing is that

520
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,370
you are not changing between terms in a

521
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,310
whimp

522
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:25,290
so in our case we chose sticks for

523
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:28,470
vocabulary and we structure all our

524
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:29,760
content around the attack framework also

525
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:32,250
it's important to think how the

526
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,590
information is going to be consumed we

527
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,720
learned this the hard way so when we

528
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:39,480
started our first reports were really

529
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,580
messy and complicated to go through but

530
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,320
then when Valentina join she really

531
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,330
helped us to put a template and a

532
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,740
structure for the information so now all

533
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:48,210
the reports are really easy to

534
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,890
understand and are really easy to spot

535
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:53,220
the important information that you are

536
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:54,480
after and also think about how all the

537
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,610
information on the Internet

538
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,010
your collecting can be transformed into

539
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:01,139
more information so you probably may

540
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:03,240
want to know which are the most active

541
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:06,120
red actors in a specific region maybe

542
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,160
the most targeted industries or maybe

543
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:11,549
what are the most used techniques for a

544
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:13,470
specific country or maybe you want to

545
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:15,929
only know what were the most used

546
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:18,299
technique in periods of time so having

547
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:20,429
that in mind will allow you to

548
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:25,168
understand better how to structure the

549
00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:27,840
data and also about just like a summer

550
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:29,880
of everything you have to think what

551
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:36,240
that is really really really important

552
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:37,860
to be consistent part before finishing

553
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,630
we want to thank all the thread library

554
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,580
team members that couldn't be here with

555
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:43,980
us but it wouldn't be the project

556
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:47,010
wouldn't be possible without their help

557
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:51,179
we also want to think the attack team

558
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:52,860
Katy Adam Blake Debbie and all the

559
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:55,770
people behind my tag for all their

560
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:57,270
support collaboration and well thank you

561
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:59,309
all for listening to our presentation

562
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:01,230
and if you have any questions you can

563
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:03,379
