1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,008
- [Announcer] Please join me
in welcoming Otis Alexander.

2
00:00:04,008 --> 00:00:07,008
(audience clapping)

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,040
- So, I'm gonna really consider
getting a wig for myself

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,569
for my next presentation.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,640
Might help with my confidence.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,330
(laughing)

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,192
Not this time.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,070
Either way.

9
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,720
So, I'm gonna give a quick
update about ATT&CK for ICS.

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,349
I'm gonna try to cover
some of the typical things

11
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,550
that I get asked about.

12
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,040
So, why ATT&CK for ICS?

13
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,441
How does it fit into the other frameworks?

14
00:00:35,441 --> 00:00:36,600
What are the use cases?

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,180
And of course, when is
it gonna be available?

16
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,920
So, why ATT&CK for ICS?

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,810
So, we can think about it

18
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,530
from a couple of different perspectives.

19
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,610
ICS, Industrial Control Systems,

20
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,390
are behind some of the world's
most critical infrastructure.

21
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,280
That's a reason, in and of itself.

22
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,340
To kind of look at how adversaries

23
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,000
are affecting new systems.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,670
The other thing is ACID
owners and defenders

25
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,370
really wanna have a deep knowledge about

26
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,510
how adversaries are affecting new systems,

27
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,680
they wanna know about their trade craft,

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,750
they wanna know about the
technologies they use,

29
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,913
and they wanna use that to
help inform their defenses.

30
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,090
Another thing is, adversaries
have unique behaviors

31
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,530
in these environments.

32
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,680
Their environments are
unique in and of themselves

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,160
and I'll go over a couple of the things

34
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,810
that we have to consider.

35
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,270
So, unique adversary goals.

36
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,770
So, one of the things that
adversaries are trying to do

37
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,720
in this area, they're trying to disrupt

38
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,440
delivery of service in conjunction

39
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,789
with the industrial process.

40
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,780
They may also try to cause physical damage

41
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,720
to pieces of equipment, so
that's important as well.

42
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,330
And some of the things we
really don't want to happen are

43
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,573
the really catastrophic failures.

44
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,603
Things that affect property or human life.

45
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,530
Some other things that
we have to consider are

46
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,400
the technological differences
between ICS and maybe

47
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,810
traditional IT systems
where IT is present in ICS.

48
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,490
We also have things like controllers

49
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:14,430
that are interfacing directly
with big pieces of equipment

50
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,440
that run the process.

51
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,810
We also have specialized applications

52
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,270
and specialized protocols,
and these things are

53
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,540
taking in account of the state of

54
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,750
the industrial control
system at any point in time,

55
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,170
and they're allowing us to
make changes to the system.

56
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,440
So these are all important things

57
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,440
that we have to take into consideration.

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,880
Then there's different ways
of defending these systems,

59
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,579
so we're less mature in this area.

60
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,150
So one thing is, what are the data sources

61
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,580
that we need in order
to defend these systems?

62
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,920
Where do we collect them from?

63
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,070
If we're dealing with low
level and better controllers

64
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,000
they don't have the same interfaces to

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,610
collect post-face information.

66
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,113
We also have to think about the protocols.

67
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,910
And the last thing I wanna highlight is

68
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,480
if we're thinking about
mitigations or security controls,

69
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,440
we don't want them to affect safety.

70
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,790
We really don't wanna be
a part of the problem.

71
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,200
So these are a lot of unique
considerations that we have

72
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,149
and I think this is kinda the why

73
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,847
we want ATT&CK for ICS.

74
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,270
So in general, when we're thinking about

75
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,970
industrial control
systems, we have to think

76
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,210
kinda from the asset owner
or operator's perspective,

77
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,970
and what their complete system looks like.

78
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,290
So this is just a representation
of the functional levels

79
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,100
of an asset owner's system.

80
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,720
What this includes is what
you would traditionally call

81
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,600
like a headquarters,
or something like that.

82
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,590
Like enterprise systems.

83
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,340
High level operations management.

84
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,220
And then you get down into the OT,

85
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,940
or the operational technology,

86
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,980
or industrial control system

87
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,940
where you have supervisory control.

88
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,079
Some remote way of
looking into the system,

89
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,670
controlling the system,
and then some local control

90
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,980
that you may have that directly interfaces

91
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,340
with the pieces of equipment.

92
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,920
So looking at the traditional
adversary behavior,

93
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,549
it kinda ranges along
the whole model here.

94
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:14,450
So it's not like adversaries
are always just getting into

95
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,680
supervisory control or
the lower level system,

96
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,660
they're sometimes or most of the time

97
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,670
making their way through from
the enterprise systems down.

98
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:27,670
So IT literally spans the whole model.

99
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,010
It spans from enterprise
systems all the way down

100
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,880
to basic control sometimes, where you have

101
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,750
embedded windows and things like that.

102
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,060
So that's where enterprise
attack really comes into play

103
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,240
because it explains the
entry points for adversaries

104
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,620
coming in via IT or enterprise systems.

105
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,040
It also explains that IT conduit

106
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,390
that they leverage to
get up into basic control

107
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,539
or to the area they need to be

108
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,870
in the industrial control systems.

109
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,340
But we can't forget
about the special goals

110
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,489
that adversaries have at the low levels,

111
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,010
what they're really trying to accomplish.

112
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,560
We can't forget that there
are protocols that are unique,

113
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,380
there's unique platforms
at the bottom there,

114
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,570
embedded systems that are
interfaced with the equipment.

115
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,430
And we can't forget that there's

116
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,260
specialized applications
that operators use.

117
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,730
And that's really where ATT&CK
for ICS comes into play.

118
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,900
So that's its focus, is
to complete the story

119
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,969
of the adversary's
behavior, from enterprise

120
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,000
all the way down to the low level systems.

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,490
So what we're doing is we're
really trying to figure out

122
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,450
what the interface
between the two models are

123
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,340
and we have some solutions but
we're trying to refine that

124
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,090
so that you can get the full gamma

125
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,772
of the adversary behavior
in these systems.

126
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,950
So what are some of our use cases?

127
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:51,349
So we have some current ones
that we are working on now

128
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,950
that we're currently utilizing,

129
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,460
but we also have some future
ones that we wanna look at.

130
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:00,460
So in general we utilize a
lot of the same use cases as

131
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,909
enterprise, so one of the big ones

132
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,160
is standardized information reporting.

133
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,890
So we have so many reports
for the same incident

134
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,070
that report in different ways.

135
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,170
And sometimes it's hard to get a sense of

136
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,810
what people missed and what's common.

137
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,590
So a standard language for
looking at these reports

138
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:24,789
or if security practitioners
use a standard language

139
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,650
to report, it may help the community.

140
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,409
A lot of our use cases center
around the analysts as well,

141
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,180
so enabling the analysts
to do their job better.

142
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,880
This is still kind of a new area,

143
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,830
when we talk about OTSox,
they're having a hard time

144
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,380
finding people who have
the expertise in this area.

145
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,020
So ATT&CK for ICS can
help them in their job.

146
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,740
So one thing is time and
incidence response playbooks.

147
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,760
Analytic development, analyst training.

148
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,180
Also we utilize adversary emulation

149
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,670
or threat-based red teaming,

150
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,560
and test bet environments
to better understand

151
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,010
what the artifacts are that
are left behind by adversaries.

152
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,570
To understand how well
our defenses are doing,

153
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,170
and things like that.

154
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,440
Another use is criticality analysis.

155
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,670
So when we're looking at an
industrial control system,

156
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,480
we can better understand
how assets and functions

157
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,780
link up to the mission.

158
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,270
And how an adversary
utilizing certain tactics,

159
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,190
techniques and procedures
can interrupt that,

160
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,660
those functions and those assets.

161
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,350
So we can better get a sense
of what we need to focus on

162
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,633
in the environment that
affects the mission.

163
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,920
So a future use case that
we're really interested in

164
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,980
is threat modeling at the design phase,

165
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,460
so we've been talking to
device manufacturers and

166
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,440
one of their critical
needs and one of the things

167
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,700
that they've been using ATT&CK for ICS for

168
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,450
is to help untrained engineers

169
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,670
understand what the ramifications are of

170
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,060
adding features at the design process

171
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,260
for low level embedded controllers.

172
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,320
So they can understand what attack vectors

173
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,180
are opening up, where the
TTP is associated with that,

174
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,480
and then what mitigations
and security controls

175
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,443
they can use to kind of
address those things.

176
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,940
So, challenges.

177
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,360
We've had a lot of challenges in terms of

178
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,600
working with this framework,
building this framework,

179
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,010
and one of them is just a
general lack of real world data.

180
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,210
There is some really good stuff out there.

181
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:28,870
There's some detailed information

182
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,549
that we're able to capitalize
on for this framework.

183
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:36,150
But in general, I mean, our lights are on,

184
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,829
we don't have problems with water.

185
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,080
You know, in general, things seem stable.

186
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,177
So it doesn't seem like
there's a lot going on.

187
00:08:42,177 --> 00:08:44,030
And that could be for a number of reasons.

188
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,199
Maybe nothing's happening.

189
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,770
Maybe we have no visibility

190
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,100
and we don't know what's happening.

191
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,470
Maybe we're really bad
at root cause analysis.

192
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,440
So what is actually an attack we chop up

193
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,530
to a fault or human error?

194
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,569
Or maybe we're just really
bad at information sharing.

195
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,780
Or we don't have any incentive
to share information.

196
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,850
So we hope the ATT&CK
model for ICS will help

197
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,670
with some of this to
get people talking more

198
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,530
about what they're seeing
in their environments.

199
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,050
And also to start to
think about visibility

200
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,060
in these environments so that
we do catch what's going on.

201
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,300
Also a big thing is what's the
proper level of abstraction

202
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,010
when you're dealing with multiple domains.

203
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,520
We look at electric power,
we look at water systems,

204
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,140
oil and gas, what level
should the techniques be at

205
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,210
to best explain adversary behavior

206
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,363
over a broad set of domains?

207
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,860
And then, diverse set of
protocols and vendors.

208
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,380
How do we find the
proper abstraction layer,

209
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:50,430
and we've been getting feedback
about that to help out.

210
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,390
And then scope, so...

211
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,939
Do we just focus on

212
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,500
adversaries and what they've
done to certain domains?

213
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,120
Do we expand that out to think about how

214
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,610
these TTP affect different domains?

215
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,080
Do we look a the whole

216
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,870
cyberphysical system domain in general?

217
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:13,870
Any cyber element that
affects the physical world,

218
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,180
is that how far we wanna go?

219
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,709
Or do we kinda scope
it and be more refined?

220
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,280
These are all challenges
that we have thought about

221
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,313
that we're addressing with the framework.

222
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,190
So we've gotten a lot of good feedback

223
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,713
and that's helped us in terms
of our tactic development.

224
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,360
So we've included some
new tactic categories that

225
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,870
we think are really important

226
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,150
to describing adversary behavior.

227
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,882
Initial access is one.

228
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,000
We wanna know how the adversaries

229
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,070
are making their way
into the OT environments.

230
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,810
We wanna know how they're
inhibiting response functions

231
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,969
so that deals with safety, protection,

232
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,560
quality assurance and the like.

233
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,050
'Cause these are all
protection mechanisms that

234
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,140
should be in place to stop
bad things from happening.

235
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,699
And then, how adversaries
impair process control,

236
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,770
so how do they disable,
manipulate physical processes

237
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,620
to cause some ultimate impact,

238
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,660
like loss of control, loss of view,

239
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,850
or loss of revenue or productivity.

240
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,640
So these are all things
that we are considering.

241
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,230
We've updated the attack matrix

242
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:33,200
to reflect some of these new tactics,

243
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,160
and we've added techniques to address how

244
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,803
adversaries are accomplishing these goals.

245
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,870
So some things that people asked me first,

246
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:46,110
I'm gonna address now.

247
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,820
So what's the status of ATT&CK for ICS?

248
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,500
Well, we're currently in
our third major revision

249
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
and I was trying to kinda highlight

250
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,800
some of the changes that we've
made in this last revision.

251
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,790
We actually have 84 individuals
from 29 organizations,

252
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,449
we got a new person yesterday,

253
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,210
who have early reviewer access, you know,

254
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,950
just to give us initial feedback

255
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,370
about the model before we go
through with public release.

256
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,510
So these organizations range over

257
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,800
private and public entities.

258
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,020
So we're getting a lot of
different use cases and feedback

259
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,210
from a lot of different people.

260
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:26,000
So we're planning for release
December of this year,

261
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,050
so it's available to the larger community

262
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,069
so we can collect feedback.

263
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,090
We wanna do an independent release

264
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:34,700
where we're not on
attack.mitre.org right now

265
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,990
just to help facilitate
rapid response to feedback

266
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,100
that we anticipate getting.

267
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,130
And if you want access before that time,

268
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,920
we are currently allowing that via NDA,

269
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,069
so if you have any questions
about that, please let me know.

270
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,940
We're really excited to
get this out to the public

271
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,690
so that you can start using it,

272
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,347
so that you can start
providing your feedback

273
00:12:58,347 --> 00:13:00,930
and we can mature and refine it.

274
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,550
So, think I have time for questions?

275
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:05,219
- [Announcer] Well, I'll
push questions into break.

276
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,400
- Okay, cool.

277
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,274
- Please join me in
thanking Otis Alexander.

278
00:13:08,274 --> 00:13:11,274
(audience clapping)
