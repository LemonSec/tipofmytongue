1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:08,770
please join me in welcoming Daniel

2
00:00:02,989 --> 00:00:12,739
Wiley's extern and Matt Southworth hi

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:15,800
I'm Matt I work on the security team at

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:18,289
Priceline the online travel company and

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,300
may or may not know price finds a pretty

6
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:22,939
small company which means we have an

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,699
extremely powerful but also pretty small

8
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:28,999
security team sort of definitionally

9
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:32,780
we're all generalists and that means we

10
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:35,540
skew more blue than red of course we see

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,850
the value in adversarial testing but we

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,500
had some problems with your sort of you

13
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,650
know rinse and repeat third party red

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:46,460
team or pen test for the last year we've

15
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:49,730
been doing purple team simulations with

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,980
praetorium and we found that to be a

17
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:55,459
super successful way to work together to

18
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:57,440
level up both teams and the purple teams

19
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,050
that we run our structured around the

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,349
mitre attack framework also Priceline is

21
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:06,770
part of a holding company we own kayak

22
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:08,899
booking.com opentable and I've seen the

23
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,298
outcome of similar purple team

24
00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:13,700
operations repeated at all of those

25
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:15,649
brands and so we've learned more from

26
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,319
what they've done and what they've

27
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:20,619
brought to it just to be definitional

28
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,270
for us when I say a purple team I mean

29
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:25,179
third-party adversaries working with my

30
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,560
in-house defenders for about a week

31
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:30,020
working through what we can and can't do

32
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,759
and that's the point of this talk is

33
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,929
what went well in those exercises where

34
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,289
have we improved and what are we going

35
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:35,289
to do next

36
00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:40,460
I've helped grow and build our purple

37
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:42,799
team service line over the past year and

38
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,619
a half two years now so we'll get into

39
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,719
it so one of the problems that we were

40
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:50,179
seeing that initially led us to get into

41
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:52,788
the purple team space security spends

42
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:55,369
has gone up astronomically especially in

43
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:57,529
a detection space however in the terms

44
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:59,479
of metrics in terms of how you contract

45
00:01:57,529 --> 00:02:02,359
your improvements over time prior to

46
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:04,100
attack we weren't necessarily seen so

47
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:06,439
the strong ways to measure how well that

48
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,348
spanned was resulting increases in your

49
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:10,758
detection the other thing that we were

50
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:12,738
seeing is sort of that red

51
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:15,379
confrontation often times these two

52
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:17,569
teams have different metrics that drive

53
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:20,209
their success often ones that are Dhyana

54
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:22,099
opposed to each other so you know

55
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:23,930
impossible to share information and

56
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:25,099
these teams are not working together to

57
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,430
solve the true problem which is

58
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:29,629
improving their security so are some the

59
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,730
symptoms we were seeing with that

60
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:33,440
just in general failures to detect us on

61
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,140
the red team's operated to make mistakes

62
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,629
and we're like oh we're burned but we

63
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:40,099
just wouldn't get detected or we would

64
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:41,989
just do a traditional penetration test

65
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:43,340
and we'd have these awkward discussions

66
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:44,870
where they would you know catch us on

67
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,790
something and say well make sure you

68
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,290
note our strong detection and we would

69
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,790
get into a whole bunch of what-ifs where

70
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,200
we realized they were doing a

71
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,480
substitution where they were trying to

72
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,399
answer a hard question how good is our

73
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,488
detection with an easier question which

74
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,560
is did we catch this contest and I often

75
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:02,540
said those things right make sure you

76
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,489
note in your report our strong detection

77
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:08,030
so when my boss reads it he knows we're

78
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:09,530
not complete fools but I think we had

79
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,049
some of the same problems with red

80
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:14,239
teaming one of the things that

81
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:16,940
frustrated me the most was repeat

82
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,099
findings you know test over test you

83
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,329
know tom cat or a JBoss server with

84
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:21,440
default credentials I feel like there's

85
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:23,989
always one sitting out there on my

86
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,720
network and I think part of the reason

87
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:29,209
we had those repeat findings is because

88
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,799
the red team would run they take a week

89
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,230
to write a report they'd send the report

90
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,480
over to us we'd read through it by that

91
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,948
time it's been a month and our logs have

92
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,840
rolled and our memories have gotten

93
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:40,699
stale and we're not sure did we see this

94
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,040
could we have alerted on this right do

95
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:45,019
we have the right to limit read the you

96
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,910
know that loop was just taking too long

97
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:48,319
to feed back into my team to do

98
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:56,090
something actionable with the test that

99
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:57,858
we wanted to do so this is our slide

100
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:01,159
sort of why why did we end up choosing

101
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:03,290
attack this move into this one it

102
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,608
provided a repeatable process so when we

103
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,290
were doing a purple team previously

104
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:07,970
before attack we would just sort of base

105
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:09,620
it off of it what we thought was a good

106
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,389
thing with attack they were able to

107
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,269
establish repeatable processes and clear

108
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:15,650
definitions from iteration to iteration

109
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:17,750
also it's aligned with industry so we're

110
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,010
able to communicate standards clearly an

111
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,120
address with Priceline but across a

112
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,978
number of our other clients and

113
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,930
customers as well and that helps provide

114
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:25,430
a layer of defense ability for why we

115
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,440
test things and what our conclusions are

116
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,539
and also allows us to show improvements

117
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,669
or sometimes you know things getting

118
00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:33,260
worse over time and provide metrics and

119
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:35,030
a strategic sometimes you know tactics

120
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,070
or you know do the sources that we've

121
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,299
been talking about or down to individual

122
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:41,779
procedures and providing recommendations

123
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,969
there yeah as part of that holding

124
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:46,039
company we're very competitive with the

125
00:04:43,969 --> 00:04:48,620
kayak security team with the open stable

126
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:51,469
security team hi Frank and we want to

127
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,779
see how our coverage maps to theirs

128
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:56,389
we've taken findings from these with the

129
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:58,250
idea of going to the vendors and saying

130
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:59,570
we bought this product from you we feel

131
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,639
like you should cover these specific

132
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:05,029
TTP's here's something that can trigger

133
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:06,950
it why aren't you helping us here and we

134
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:09,800
function a lot by dashboards by burn

135
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:12,770
down lists right and having done these

136
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,300
exercises three times we know what we

137
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,919
want to do what we want to get to and

138
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,080
it's easy for us to visualize that and

139
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,250
you know show bite-sized forward

140
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,270
progress to our team and our leadership

141
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,219
so what our objectives are in this

142
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,510
purple team is we have four key ones the

143
00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:28,639
first is to improve detection

144
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:30,349
capabilities through the targeted

145
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,360
emulation and the key word I want to

146
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:33,889
draw there is improve our goal during

147
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,120
these exercises is to leave the

148
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:36,979
environment better than we found it

149
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,479
because it's red-and-blue working

150
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:40,580
together there's a huge opportunity to

151
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,229
not just do an assessment but actually

152
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,029
like move the needle on security and say

153
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:46,039
you were here before we taught you

154
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:47,389
something we built some alerts from a

155
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:49,969
similar it's better we reduced false

156
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:51,889
positives and truly leave the place

157
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:53,450
better than we found it and then collect

158
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:54,860
metrics as well so that's the

159
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,479
organization understands where they

160
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,099
stand in terms of their legs to detect

161
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,630
what data sources they're logging

162
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:01,490
what solutions are performing well

163
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,260
they're not performing well yeah our

164
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:05,180
first round was mostly covering

165
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,219
telemetry which has been talked about a

166
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,199
lot in the last two days but really do

167
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:11,330
we have the right coverage and as we

168
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,740
progress through doing these right we've

169
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,599
been able to develop both the tactical

170
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,789
and the strategic recommendations for

171
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:18,139
our team that you know some we came up

172
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:20,659
with ourselves something we asked Daniel

173
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:25,010
for that really helps us set a roadmap

174
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:26,659
for you 16 18 months there are a number

175
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,789
of constraints so we're doing these over

176
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:30,589
about a week two people on our team

177
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:32,479
the folks at Priceline or other clients

178
00:06:30,589 --> 00:06:34,250
so we run into some areas where we just

179
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,109
can't or won't Esther and Vince

180
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,940
the first one is time so it's just a

181
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,459
week there's some TTP's where maybe

182
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,870
takes too long to set up or just isn't

183
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:44,570
necessarily reasonable to do it over

184
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,669
that time so pop quiz tea 10:30 is the

185
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,409
data transfer size limits so that's

186
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:50,120
where an adversary will break up huge

187
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:52,130
chunks of data into small chunks over a

188
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,110
period of time if we're only doing it a

189
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:56,539
week we may not necessarily hit the

190
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,919
sensors that would trigger that so

191
00:06:56,539 --> 00:07:01,700
instead of testing that we can just have

192
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:04,279
those conversations yeah and we think in

193
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,110
terms of threat families which are sort

194
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:08,599
of an amalgamation of a threat actor and

195
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:12,380
technique and we prioritize those that

196
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:14,539
are in e-commerce online travel and tea

197
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,669
1205 port knocking is not something we

198
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:18,860
prioritize right so when we put thought

199
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:20,180
into it before we run these we know what

200
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,459
we want to test we know what we want to

201
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,719
leave to the side and then capability

202
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:25,760
this covers sort of a number of

203
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:28,039
different areas there's ones where we

204
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:31,099
just probably aren't allowed to test so

205
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:32,570
DC shadow tea 1207 it's kind of unusual

206
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:33,560
to have a vendor show up and you give

207
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,510
them domain name into your network

208
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,219
unless they go and get it themselves so

209
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,830
we've also found that you know showing

210
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:41,539
up and saying hey we'd like a TA account

211
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,919
sometimes sets the wrong tone so being

212
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:44,839
communicative about that open and say

213
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,729
here's our limitations with the access

214
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,620
provision to us we may not be able to

215
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:51,610
test those here's how you can go do it

216
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,719
yourself help set in more collaborative

217
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:55,760
communication tone for the rest of the

218
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:57,110
engagement then also just technical

219
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,029
capabilities we're not going to try and

220
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,490
break into a factory to insert malicious

221
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:03,140
chips so we may not necessarily test

222
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,060
some of those initial access ones they

223
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,200
require a bit more effort there yeah I

224
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,659
think I think the most important thing

225
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:11,360
here around capabilities is to know on

226
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:13,219
our side when we should leave something

227
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,510
for later we just don't have the

228
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:16,519
telemetry we're not going to add it this

229
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:19,640
week set it aside we'll pick it up later

230
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:20,779
yeah if you find that they can't detect

231
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,310
something don't beat them over the head

232
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:24,140
with it if there's a data source missing

233
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:28,070
there's really no point in continuing to

234
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:29,570
test that specific area so from our

235
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,709
outsider perspective there's sort of

236
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,310
three areas that we found made us

237
00:08:30,709 --> 00:08:33,799
successful

238
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,240
cooperation is key our very first purple

239
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,449
team we sat in a room all by ourselves

240
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,510
and tested for a week

241
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,130
I hated it so what's important there is

242
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,659
also we failed and we learned from that

243
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,220
we talked and said what went right what

244
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:46,290
went wrong and we were able to improve

245
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:48,000
on future iterations and talk to people

246
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,760
and say what did you not like about this

247
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,380
how can we improve prioritizing

248
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,970
accordingly so understand you know

249
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,920
what's hard for you to execute what's

250
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,690
hard to fix and get client input and

251
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,339
have that drive to testing strategy in

252
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,920
terms of which TTP's you're gonna go

253
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,270
through first and where do you then

254
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,860
decide where you're gonna focus breath

255
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,079
when you want coverage across certain

256
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,180
tactics or data sources when you want

257
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,620
depth with things where potential

258
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,660
dumping or things for those named or sub

259
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,190
techniques we want to really drive into

260
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:18,569
some of the more detailed and esoteric

261
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:20,520
procedures so in order to support this

262
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,900
we built some automation I want to give

263
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,890
you know some chatter so a lot of the

264
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,730
other folks have done some great work

265
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:27,990
here why did we choose Metasploit we

266
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,820
want to tour it on the behavior not the

267
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:31,410
tool Metasploit provides a huge number

268
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,630
of extensions a lot of capability to

269
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,430
work with api's we were really able to

270
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,930
drill down into what is actually the

271
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:39,180
technique about there were some other

272
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,949
implementations for instance credential

273
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,349
dumping we would run a PowerShell

274
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,810
command to get a PF script from the web

275
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,010
and then you know invoke that script and

276
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:48,329
we were seeing that that was actually

277
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:50,189
learning on the PowerShell being

278
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,780
downloaded and not the credential

279
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,190
dumping and we'll we didn't really want

280
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,130
that we wanted the behavior we were

281
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:58,020
after eaten crates with a lot of other

282
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,640
tools powershell dotnet and then where

283
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,040
you can do a whole bunch of cool things

284
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,840
there clear standards and support across

285
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,480
a variety of operating systems so I'm in

286
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,550
exam Mac as well so why should you not

287
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,260
use Metasploit why listen the payloads

288
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,089
can be pretty hard it's Metasploit a lot

289
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,410
of EDRs really don't like when you run

290
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:15,030
it on the system even if it is

291
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,620
whitelisted we ran into a situation

292
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,750
where when it's loading certain

293
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,460
extensions even though the binary itself

294
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,130
is quite listed the way it reflectively

295
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,780
loads those dll's in memory the new york

296
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,610
did not really like how that was being

297
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,550
done so we had to work with our partner

298
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:31,200
there to do some stuff manually

299
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,849
deployment isn't easy there's others

300
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,760
enterprise solutions which really make

301
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:37,170
this easy Metasploit doesn't some things

302
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,970
can be pretty hard to customize and

303
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,110
specially with CTU and if you're not

304
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,420
familiar with it there's a bit of a

305
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,940
retention curve yeah as a defender right

306
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,099
I I had training and Metasploit at Derby

307
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,550
con 1 which was many years ago and I

308
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,019
might touch it 20 twice a year since

309
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,149
it's really hard to pick that back up

310
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:54,740
and although they've written some great

311
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:56,600
automation that they can leave around

312
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,970
their environment no one on my team is

313
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,350
an expert at running this right and we

314
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,959
need to think about if we want to spend

315
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:06,290
time on that or you know bring in a

316
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,579
third party to run it for us so this is

317
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,199
a couple of the modules that we have

318
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:11,390
written for Windows I do want to give a

319
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,860
huge shout out to the other teams that

320
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:15,319
have we've incorporated their work

321
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,089
Tomic Red Team specter ops mitre and

322
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,560
game and a number of others which we

323
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:21,440
tried to make sure we credited in each

324
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,489
of these modules so this is a bit of an

325
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,440
eye chart but essentially what it's

326
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,510
showing is that you can customize the

327
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,010
modules the commands want to make sure

328
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:29,240
there was a clear standard across the

329
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,370
tactics so that when you run a

330
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,079
persistence module it does the same

331
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,579
thing and you don't necessarily as an

332
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:36,439
operator to think what did this thing do

333
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:38,839
again so we approached me to get those

334
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,640
standards so persistence will spawn calc

335
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:45,019
and write some data and time stamps to a

336
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:47,600
certain file and I'm just showing it

337
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:49,339
running I also want to give a shout out

338
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,630
to detection lab from Chris Long we do a

339
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:52,459
lot of our development and testing in

340
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:54,140
there it makes it really easy to spin up

341
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:56,180
a Windows domain with a lot of tools and

342
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,550
really be able to test our alerts and

343
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:00,920
animation really very quickly so take a

344
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,270
look at that project if you have it this

345
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,160
is another example we were a testing

346
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,449
process injection and due to the tools

347
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,860
that were configured we weren't able to

348
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:10,820
get the telemetry that we were looking

349
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:13,279
for I had a great conversation

350
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:15,880
Monday evening here with someone from a

351
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,260
bank whose detection team has 12 people

352
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,899
we don't have a detection team like that

353
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:23,089
we don't have a sock and I don't think

354
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:25,670
we want a sock I would rather have a

355
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:27,470
team of engineers who have some sort of

356
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:29,979
shared accountability around the

357
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:32,180
detection we create and respond to

358
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,699
because of that we're pretty disciplined

359
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:37,099
and fanatical about writing really good

360
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:38,540
alerts and having a strong standard

361
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,880
about how we produce an action those

362
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:43,430
almost of all of our telemetry flows

363
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,560
through spunk Splunk and all of that

364
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,540
fires into a slack channel this is

365
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,859
awesome because it's eye-catching half

366
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,449
the stuff we can respond to on our

367
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:54,019
phones we don't have to be in the office

368
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:55,579
and every alert we have will link to a

369
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:57,529
query and/or playbook

370
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:59,959
that'll show us exactly what's going on

371
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:02,130
we also keep all of these in a big list

372
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:04,920
right and all of those are taxon

373
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:07,320
my attack so every detection we have if

374
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,479
it links to a TTP that's in the

375
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,800
spreadsheet and someone who's looking at

376
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,720
it who maybe hasn't seen this alert

377
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,760
before or doesn't know why we wrote it

378
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,410
originally instantly has some context

379
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,290
about what it is why it was created and

380
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,699
who wrote it also a lot of these alerts

381
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:24,089
we've created through the purple team

382
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:26,010
process and what's interesting there is

383
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:27,660
we don't know who wrote this it could

384
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:29,400
have been a red teamer who wrote the

385
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:33,089
report and that's what's most valuable

386
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,970
to us is the people who are doing the

387
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:37,800
damage right understand what we see on

388
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:40,140
our side whether we have the logging or

389
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:45,630
not and as daniel said our leaving it

390
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:48,569
better than they found it i've used this

391
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:51,030
line on my boss a few times right my job

392
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,620
is so hard because we have to do

393
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,720
everything perfectly and then you never

394
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,970
hear from me the attackers only have to

395
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,760
get it right once and then it's game

396
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:04,350
over that's kind of a lie I don't think

397
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:07,020
he's watching but what we found is not

398
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:09,690
only do attackers only have to make get

399
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:13,230
it wrong once but in our environment at

400
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:15,570
least attackers make mistakes and many

401
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,790
much of our telemetry or our detections

402
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,650
is based around finding those mistakes

403
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:22,410
if you did something perfect the first

404
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:24,060
time we may not fire on it but as the

405
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,949
attackers are enumerated and feeling

406
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:29,430
through the network that's a gold mine

407
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:30,540
of TTP's that we can alert on so how

408
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:33,329
does this play into the purple team

409
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:35,370
testing we can use our cooperation with

410
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,540
math and his team to understand what

411
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,940
their environment looks like where the

412
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:41,520
data sources are and help prioritize and

413
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,380
focus on nodes where there's perhaps a

414
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,750
gathering at et PS that form a chain as

415
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,980
part of their attack path so we've been

416
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,320
trying to think what chains a little bit

417
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,030
more and sort of graph out how do these

418
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,740
techniques flow into each other there's

419
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,730
been some great work by other folks in

420
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,260
this conference as well where they

421
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,780
talked about how other attacks can

422
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:00,240
facilitate lead or you know cause other

423
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,180
TTP's so by grouping these in certain

424
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,820
areas we can

425
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:05,739
and how do we sort of either increase

426
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,930
the weight of certain areas by making it

427
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,550
harder to exploit these nodes or make it

428
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,410
easier to detect or remove them

429
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:13,120
altogether by instituting protections

430
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,959
that just would eliminate them from the

431
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,760
graph altogether

432
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,190
yeah our internal term for this is

433
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,140
attack pathing which really is just

434
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:25,360
taking it through the environment how do

435
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:26,830
you get to the crown jewels so there are

436
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,480
some areas where realized that attack is

437
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,670
not enough so I want to touch them just

438
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,810
a little bit cloud was on that list but

439
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,569
you know in the latest release

440
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:35,709
there wasn't stuff added there some

441
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,870
areas like software-as-a-service

442
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:40,660
applications maybe don't necessarily fit

443
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:43,240
cleanly internal api as we've seen some

444
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,980
weirdness where applications are talking

445
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,630
with other applications internally and

446
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,950
our clients are curious about well how

447
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:50,740
would we detect you know something

448
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:52,570
malicious using this API or some TTP's

449
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,880
where prior to subtext and maybe just be

450
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:57,550
too broad for us to necessarily give

451
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:01,060
just one score focus on just one part of

452
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:03,189
that such as database access or other

453
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,750
areas like that what are our solutions

454
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,400
when we run into these problems where

455
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,620
somebody doesn't fit cleanly into our

456
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,500
model and our plan the first one is just

457
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:13,030
talk communicate I'm explaining to Matt

458
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,980
and understand from him to his team

459
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:16,720
what's important to them what are our

460
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:19,030
limitations how do we dive into these

461
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,320
areas more or less and then internal

462
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:22,030
communication from our team as well

463
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,830
we're talking and thinking how can we

464
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,540
really test these things and then

465
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:27,310
technical breadth so we brought in our

466
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,810
web app folks when Matt had some

467
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:31,119
questions about how you detect mage

468
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:32,709
heart attacks and really thinking

469
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,030
outside of just your red team outside of

470
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:38,590
your blue team and bringing in folks

471
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:40,870
from all sorts of areas and skills yeah

472
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:42,340
so a couple things that at least when we

473
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:45,280
put these slides together weren't

474
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:48,490
reflected in attack just very specific

475
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:51,699
and actionable alerts from my team to FA

476
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:54,280
bypass right changes in our GCP org

477
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:56,680
these are just simple detection that are

478
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,390
high value for us that came through

479
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,370
creative thinking during the purple team

480
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:03,040
that wouldn't have spawned if we were

481
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:06,339
maniacally focused on coverage of attack

482
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,109
TTP's so how do we actually deliver

483
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:11,198
value entities let's sort of be an angle

484
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:14,589
our current report format is Excel so X

485
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,850
that's a shot for some folks so why did

486
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:17,648
we choose to do that we found that

487
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:21,488
trying to put this huge matrix into a

488
00:17:17,648 --> 00:17:24,488
PDF just was terrible it really makes it

489
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:26,319
really easy to view as a quick dashboard

490
00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:28,119
and most importantly for us because

491
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,710
we're a third party these things are

492
00:17:28,118 --> 00:17:31,090
being shared across organizations so

493
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,499
having something that you host or some

494
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,178
sort of internal web app didn't really

495
00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:36,009
work we wanted something that was easy

496
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:38,739
to use easy to share and easy to

497
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:40,210
communicate not just the technical level

498
00:17:38,739 --> 00:17:42,129
where you can drill into the TTP's but

499
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,629
also do strategic recommendations and I

500
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:45,789
can show templates off of this that

501
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:46,928
people are curious and also the other

502
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:49,419
thing I want to put on there is tickets

503
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:51,100
as part of our sort of theme of making

504
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:52,509
the environment better sometimes you can

505
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,859
deliver this report but if you see an

506
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:55,389
issue and you're working with the

507
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:57,220
clients and want to just put in a ticket

508
00:17:55,389 --> 00:17:58,840
in their system JIRA service now would

509
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,909
have you work with them and get that

510
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,080
access and document what you did and so

511
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:03,940
they have all the information there so

512
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,769
they can build out the alerts in their

513
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,330
ticketing system yeah we've gone through

514
00:18:05,769 --> 00:18:09,669
an exercise where either they create the

515
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:11,158
tickets for us or they hand us a CSV and

516
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:14,259
we create all of those tickets

517
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:16,419
it's been great the at that point the

518
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:18,159
tickets are even texana mised for us so

519
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:24,549
we can go back and see which TTP they

520
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:26,440
were covering so what have we learned

521
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:29,679
and what did we get out of working with

522
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:32,499
purple teams I think the first thing to

523
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:35,529
remember is this is not a red team this

524
00:18:32,499 --> 00:18:37,059
is not a pen test and although we're

525
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:39,519
bringing in a third party we should

526
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:43,539
contribute as much resourcing and do

527
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:46,269
just as much work the prep work is

528
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:48,730
extremely important we learn that over

529
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:50,739
three iterations the basics getting

530
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,679
stuff ready in advance but also knowing

531
00:18:50,739 --> 00:18:55,239
what you want to get out of it and

532
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:57,460
bringing your cats and you're flexible

533
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:59,619
cats is extremely important to the work

534
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,029
because what you think you're going to

535
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:02,769
do on Tuesday and may or may not work

536
00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:05,739
out it's great to be able to drop

537
00:19:02,769 --> 00:19:09,129
something and move on so diving into a

538
00:19:05,739 --> 00:19:11,950
couple of those things what was most

539
00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:15,209
important to us was communication a

540
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:17,739
month before the purple team we start

541
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:19,509
publicizing it to the tech teams right

542
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:21,309
and the weekly operations meeting we say

543
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:23,470
this is coming up we let people know

544
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:24,879
what we plan to test we let people know

545
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,740
where we will be physik

546
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,470
so that they can drop in and see what's

547
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,850
happening we set up a comms channel with

548
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,980
the team we make sure they've got their

549
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,959
account set up before they show up we

550
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,970
agree to a rhythm of communications of

551
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,830
stand ups and everything else it's just

552
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,740
so much better to have that ready when

553
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:43,449
the constraint the one week of red

554
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,850
teamers we have walk into the

555
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,770
environment we think about what we think

556
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:49,209
we will want to cover what we think we

557
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:52,060
will want to test what we know we want

558
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:53,770
to ignore either based on what we know

559
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:56,320
from our CTI or what we've seen in the

560
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:58,360
environment in the past we make some

561
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,610
assumptions about what tools are going

562
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,740
to cover which TTP's we make sure that

563
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,959
the purple team have access to those

564
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:08,380
tools and we put those through the tests

565
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,330
and more than anything else it's that

566
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,250
communication right it's talking to

567
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,419
everyone in the org not just the

568
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,580
security team let them know what's

569
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,900
happening let them know why let them

570
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:20,820
know if there's an interruption in

571
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:24,640
service where to come and yell at me so

572
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:26,080
the way I described it across our org is

573
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,780
this is like a pen test if we want to

574
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,240
succeed when we do our PCI testing I

575
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:34,600
want no findings on that report because

576
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,890
why would I in this case I want all of

577
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,510
the findings right I want to know

578
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:39,790
everything that could possibly be wrong

579
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:41,110
so that we can prioritize it and fix it

580
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:44,470
on our own timeline with our own

581
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:46,959
prioritization the most recent purple

582
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:48,640
team we did a few weeks ago a new person

583
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,250
had just joined my team that week and

584
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,650
this was fantastic onboarding for them

585
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,750
because they had immediate access to our

586
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:57,910
tools they saw the detection that worked

587
00:20:55,750 --> 00:21:00,280
and did not work and they learned a ton

588
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:02,560
from the adversarial testers and from

589
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,260
our own team but what we prioritize in

590
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,600
our environment when we are done with

591
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,640
the week we expect to have more

592
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,639
detections more findings and more test

593
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:16,590
cases taxon o mais against attack that

594
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,590
we can keep and run in the environment

595
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:23,170
so we finished the assessment we

596
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,940
finished three assessments what do we

597
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:27,070
want to do next steps

598
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:29,290
the very first thing to do when the

599
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:31,210
assessment closes is to start thinking

600
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:32,860
about the next one your memory will

601
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:35,800
never be fresher than just when it's

602
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:37,750
done so start sketching out what TTP's

603
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,409
did we lack what telemetry did we lack

604
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,730
what

605
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,820
we want to make sure we have covered

606
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:45,310
when they come back in three months

607
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:48,700
we're huge on tax on amazing and JIRA

608
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:51,100
right I'll show you how that works make

609
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,090
sure that what we already have is still

610
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,189
working

611
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:57,070
repeat tests some of them are

612
00:21:54,190 --> 00:22:01,450
revalidation the existing detection z'

613
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:03,490
we have and we expect when we're done to

614
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:07,000
have new stuff to hand to our vendors to

615
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:09,010
say this worked this didn't work how can

616
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,020
you help us get better

617
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,780
strategically we've used the purple

618
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:16,330
teaming to reprioritize what we're going

619
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:18,639
to do especially the first round you

620
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:20,740
know i was a little skeptical a little

621
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,930
skeptical about command history when i

622
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,790
saw how many places that lit up it was

623
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:28,840
something we reprioritized and brought

624
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:29,920
into our sim much more rapidly and then

625
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,179
when it comes to the strategic

626
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,370
improvements when you're building these

627
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,750
reports and recommendations again have a

628
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:36,219
dialogue you don't want to recommend

629
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,140
something that they tried and failed and

630
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:40,630
shut down or if they did try and fail it

631
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:42,160
understand why maybe you understand pain

632
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,840
points of why that failed and how you

633
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,610
can help them succeed in those areas or

634
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,110
help them reprioritize certain things

635
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,179
that could potentially close off a whole

636
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:50,530
attack vector or a whole tactics such as

637
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,440
lateral movement if you move to like

638
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:55,480
private VLANs

639
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:57,910
so I mentioned we were fanatical about

640
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,520
alerting and having great hiding in the

641
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:02,440
alerting we do the same with the

642
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,840
findings out of the purple team you

643
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,070
don't need to see my JIRA but rest

644
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,280
assured that every finding in their

645
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,600
right is texana mised against attack

646
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,820
it's something that we can track with a

647
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,199
burn down chart we know where we are we

648
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:18,700
know where we want to be at the end of

649
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:20,430
the sprint at the end of the quarter and

650
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,600
then align the alerts with attacks so

651
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:24,160
Priceline currently uses spreadsheets in

652
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,770
order to help keep track of what alert

653
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:30,520
corresponds to what but then I line that

654
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:33,850
back to attack and or not Excel Google

655
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:36,190
sheets I think sometimes can help track

656
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:37,629
and facilitate quick actions and reviews

657
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,160
on their team there's also other

658
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,570
solutions so thunderstorms tonight

659
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,350
hunters playbook we're big fans of as

660
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:47,200
well so what are the our final tips for

661
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:48,300
success checklists make sure you request

662
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,680
what you need they

663
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,629
help facilitate the quick communication

664
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,730
and parlaying of information and

665
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,960
accounts on both sides that when you get

666
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,790
there day one you can maximize your

667
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,640
value and you're not getting spun up for

668
00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:00,930
a whole eight or nine hours sharing so

669
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,940
you don't want to silo this information

670
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:04,350
if the testers are working have them

671
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,270
share whatever information or logs are

672
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:08,429
using with you know the client of the

673
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:09,930
blue team so they can see these things

674
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:12,090
in real time and it's not a surprise at

675
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:14,040
the end what happens and then planning

676
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,899
so no plan survives first contact right

677
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,980
but having that plan and understanding

678
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,840
what you think you would test would

679
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,540
allow you to deviate from that in a

680
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,340
useful and deliberate way and then

681
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,260
defining the objectives so understand

682
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:27,480
your adversarial thoughts and what you

683
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:30,660
hope to get out of the test yeah for us

684
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,280
the most important outcome is more

685
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,110
communication and understanding within

686
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,870
our team and between us and the other

687
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:38,129
tech stakeholders we want to make sure

688
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:39,770
they know what's happening they know

689
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:42,270
where we are and they can come find us

690
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:44,730
something that I really like to get out

691
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:47,639
of the purple teaming either that my own

692
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:50,490
team will develop or Daniels is sort of

693
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:53,250
quick hit demos these are super powerful

694
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:55,530
when working with other tech teams right

695
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:57,510
just demonstrating here's a counted

696
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:58,800
enumeration against exchange it's

697
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:02,220
something that for whatever reason

698
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:04,080
you'll get your ticket resolved you'll

699
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,390
get the finding cleaned up ten times

700
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,889
more quickly if you can show someone a

701
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:12,960
real-time demo again as we had at its

702
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:14,730
university so bringing in folks from all

703
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,680
areas of the internal side as well as

704
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:19,070
external so you can really hit a lot of

705
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,070
areas

706
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:25,029
