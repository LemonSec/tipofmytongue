1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,750
- It's my pleasure to introduce
my teammate, Blake Strom.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,050
Almost needs no introduction
but I'll introduce him anyways.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,700
He's the ATT&CK lead, one
of the original co-creators

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,010
of ATT&CK many, many years ago,

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:14,379
and he's been leading
the effort ever since.

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,300
Doesn't just do that.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,586
At MITRE, he's also our

8
00:00:16,586 --> 00:00:19,810
Capability Area Lead
for adversary emulation.

9
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,130
He helps out, he's been core

10
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,953
on the ATT&CK evaluations efforts,

11
00:00:22,953 --> 00:00:25,308
and sometimes, in his spare time,

12
00:00:25,308 --> 00:00:27,940
you know, moments he gets,
he likes to roast coffee,

13
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,940
leading to his Twitter
handle @stromcoffee.

14
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,490
So really excited for
Blake to kind of summarize

15
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:36,000
what we've done this
past year with ATT&CK,

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,370
how far we've come, and
really, where we're going.

17
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,233
So please join me in
welcoming Blake Strom.

18
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:45,209
(audience applauding)

19
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,210
- Thank you.

20
00:00:48,297 --> 00:00:49,599
Thank you very much, Katie.

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,224
ATT&CKcon is really a special time for us.

22
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:55,056
Even though we go out to
conferences constantly

23
00:00:55,057 --> 00:00:57,430
briefing ATT&CK and talking to people,

24
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,120
this is our opportunity
to get the community

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,425
to come here and talk about one topic.

26
00:01:01,426 --> 00:01:04,210
So thank you very much for coming.

27
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:07,710
So as Katie mentioned, it's
sort of hard to understand

28
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,970
how far we've come without understanding

29
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,786
sort of where we started.

30
00:01:11,786 --> 00:01:16,732
So this is the very first
version of the ATT&CK matrix.

31
00:01:16,732 --> 00:01:19,760
This came out internally within MITRE.

32
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,863
This hasn't seen the light of day before.

33
00:01:21,863 --> 00:01:22,696
(audience laughing)

34
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:26,149
Early on in 2014, so the
project had been going on

35
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:29,010
for about six months at the
time and we were sort of

36
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,151
using it internally to figure out, okay,

37
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:33,250
threat actors use these techniques.

38
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,574
This is our coverage against it.

39
00:01:35,574 --> 00:01:38,470
And, you know, there's a lot
of things that pop out in this.

40
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,743
You know, there's only eight tactics.

41
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,080
There's no execution tactic.

42
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,429
There's no collection.

43
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:50,610
Host enumeration hasn't
reading to discover yet.

44
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,900
There's only four technique
in credential access,

45
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,110
and if I remember correctly,

46
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,970
OS and software weakness
was the the first version

47
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,100
of the credential-bumping technique.

48
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,863
So there's a lot of benefits
to this version of ATT&CK.

49
00:02:01,863 --> 00:02:03,547
You can go to your CSO and say,

50
00:02:03,547 --> 00:02:06,077
"Hey, boss, we only need
to cover 64 techniques.

51
00:02:06,077 --> 00:02:08,764
"I can get this done
in a couple of months."

52
00:02:08,764 --> 00:02:12,316
You can fit the matrix on
one slide and still read

53
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:14,283
the technique names.

54
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,530
It's a lot easier to believe vendors

55
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,457
when they come and say to you,

56
00:02:17,457 --> 00:02:19,796
"Hey, we've got 100% coverage of ATT&CK."

57
00:02:19,796 --> 00:02:21,929
(audience laughing)

58
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,060
But, as we all know, the
space isn't quite this simple

59
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,576
and ATT&CK has had to evolve over time.

60
00:02:28,576 --> 00:02:30,510
So here's where we are today.

61
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,510
He have 266 techniques
in the enterprise matrix.

62
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,350
But we didn't stop there.

63
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,000
You know, enterprise now
covers Mac and Linux,

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,150
in addition to Windows.

65
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:49,802
We also have PRE-ATT&CK now
with 174 techniques currently.

66
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:54,666
We've extended off to mobile
ATT&CK that has 79 techniques.

67
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:58,141
And, of those, that
collection of information,

68
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:03,141
we have about 93 groups,
414 software entries,

69
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,103
and 1,971 technical references

70
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:11,080
that span technical best practices,

71
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,600
information about how techniques work,

72
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,180
and threat intel reports,

73
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,230
which is an incredible
corpus of information.

74
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,230
But it extends beyond this, too.

75
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,978
It's not just the knowledge base.

76
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:23,980
There's a sister project,
Cyber Analytics Repository,

77
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,222
that I'm sure a lot of
people are familiar with.

78
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,080
There is ATT&CK-based SOC assessments

79
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,923
where we're trying to help people

80
00:03:31,923 --> 00:03:33,947
who are just getting started with ATT&CK

81
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,893
figure out where their
best first steps are.

82
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,000
There's ATT&CK for ICS.

83
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,070
So the team's been working hard on this

84
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,739
to get this ready.

85
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,020
The ATT&CK evaluations where
we're trying to provide

86
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,270
objective insights to
how vendors are doing,

87
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,493
good-start behavior.

88
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,019
And then, there's the
ATT&CK Sightings Ecosystem

89
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,480
that we started this year so that we

90
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,299
can get better statistics
about adversary use over time,

91
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,863
so we can provide better trending data.

92
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,480
So ATT&CK has really come a long way,

93
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,769
not just as a knowledge base,

94
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:08,580
but also, as an idea to
help threat-informed defense

95
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,713
in multiple ways.

96
00:04:11,382 --> 00:04:13,220
And we really didn't get here by accident.

97
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,547
So ATT&CK was a deliberate effort to track

98
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:19,103
and maintain a knowledge
base of adversary behavior,

99
00:04:19,103 --> 00:04:21,210
and there's a lot of things
that contributed to this

100
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,950
over the last six years.

101
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,984
So there's been a lot of innovation

102
00:04:24,984 --> 00:04:29,984
in sensing input systems,
sensing network activity

103
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,140
to better identify these threats.

104
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,080
There's a lot of innovation going into how

105
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,659
to analyze that data through analytics,

106
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,105
whether it be machine
learning or other mechanisms.

107
00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:43,530
So people are seeing a lot more activity

108
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,489
than they have been before.

109
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,239
And I think the realization
that IOCs just aren't enough

110
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:50,977
to build a security program
on have really helped

111
00:04:50,978 --> 00:04:54,930
this idea of the focus
should be on threat behavior

112
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,052
to detect adversaries more robustly than

113
00:04:58,052 --> 00:05:00,074
with just IOCs alone.

114
00:05:00,074 --> 00:05:05,074
And, because of this
visibility, people are seeing

115
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,630
a lot more activity.

116
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,760
So there's a lot more
reporting out there, and this,

117
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,780
coupled with the lower barrier
of entry for adversaries

118
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,489
to get started because
there's more tools available

119
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,320
just means there's a lot
more activity to see.

120
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,920
There's certainly a lot more reports now

121
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,460
than we can even handle
as the ATT&CK team.

122
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,750
But this is a very good problem to have

123
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,720
because people are more willing

124
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,543
to report out this information.

125
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,400
And then, the next point
is, we can't see everything.

126
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,080
We don't see everything as
MITRE and the ATT&CK team.

127
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,983
So we rely on the community to tell us

128
00:05:36,983 --> 00:05:39,490
what they're seeing in order to make sure

129
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,650
that ATT&CK is growing and
we're accurately representing

130
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,971
what adversaries are doing today.

131
00:05:44,971 --> 00:05:47,690
And this sort of reminds
me of a conversation

132
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,650
I had about a month and a half ago

133
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,709
with someone who leads a team
at a healthcare organization.

134
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:55,340
And he was basically able to get buy-in

135
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,089
from his leadership to
share information with us.

136
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:00,450
Because the vendor space in the community

137
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,710
looks at ATT&CK, and maps to ATT&CK,

138
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,609
and builds their products around ATT&CK.

139
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,980
Because it helps them get the tools

140
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,111
that they need in order
to detect and respond

141
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:10,380
to threats better.

142
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:14,598
And even beyond that, he
said it helps other peers

143
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:18,800
in his industry because
they're paying attention

144
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,490
to ATT&CK too, so that they're better able

145
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,660
to respond to incidents.

146
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,493
Which is awesome.

147
00:06:24,493 --> 00:06:26,277
This is why we're doing ATT&CK.

148
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,815
So to dive in some of the
numbers for updates this year,

149
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:37,050
we have one new tactic,

150
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,800
we have 43 new techniques for enterprise,

151
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,310
13 for mobile, 16 new groups,

152
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,443
and 87 new software entries.

153
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,930
We've got 41 new
mitigations for enterprise,

154
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,680
87 updated techniques, 16
update techniques for mobile,

155
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,680
67 updated groups, and 92
updated software entries.

156
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,960
And you saw a bunch of the
team that was up here today.

157
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,900
It's a lot of work to maintain ATT&CK

158
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,863
and all the other projects
that have been built

159
00:07:06,863 --> 00:07:08,670
around ATT&CK at MITRE,

160
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:12,060
and I'm always just amazed
at the level of effort

161
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,536
and work that we're able to do on this

162
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:16,590
to improve it over time.

163
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,929
And you heard Katie.

164
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,550
We all work on different jobs.

165
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:21,160
I don't think there's any single person

166
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,940
that works on ATT&CK full-time.

167
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,230
Because we're all looking at chart reports

168
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,430
for other projects.

169
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,670
We're doing red-teaming
and adversary emulation.

170
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,180
We're doing threat analysis.

171
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,838
And this all helps to keep our skill sharp

172
00:07:31,838 --> 00:07:34,400
so we can maintain ATT&CK in the right way

173
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,299
for the community.

174
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,050
And so, if you saw Dave
Herrald and Ryan Kovar's talk

175
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,530
at the last ATT&CKcon, they
gave a really good talk

176
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,830
about using red-teaming and automation

177
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,380
to help test your analytics.

178
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,930
But towards the end of their presentation,

179
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,730
they were sort of bemoaning the lack

180
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,570
of cloud coverage in ATT&CK.

181
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,440
And, at the time, we
had been thinking about

182
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,375
what cloud coverage might mean in ATT&CK,

183
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,220
but it really wasn't that much.

184
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,840
It was basically just to answer questions

185
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,840
about what we were doing with
ATT&CK even fitting the cloud,

186
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,909
how it might approach it.

187
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,335
So basically, the really
early planning phases.

188
00:08:16,335 --> 00:08:19,469
So we were able to
actually redirect resources

189
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,100
to this effort because there
was such a high demand.

190
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,130
Thank you, Dave and Ryan.

191
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,270
And I'm happy to say, if
this clicker will work,

192
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,880
as of last week, we
released the first version

193
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,933
of ATT&CK for Cloud.

194
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,313
Yay.

195
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:38,069
(audience applauding)

196
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,830
And we realized this was
just a drop into the bucket.

197
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,955
There's 36 techniques that we have.

198
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:45,540
This problem is a lot bigger
than just 36 techniques.

199
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,790
We know this.

200
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,545
We talked to a lot of
organizations to help build this,

201
00:08:49,546 --> 00:08:52,560
to help make us make sure
that we're defining it

202
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,662
in the right way.

203
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:55,690
A lot of them have said that, you know,

204
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:58,860
a lot of people think
cloud is just an extension

205
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,740
of the ATT&CK, of the enterprise matrix.

206
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,060
So that's how we built it.

207
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,775
And of the organizations
that we talked to,

208
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:09,209
we received well over

209
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:13,363
100 different technique
contribution ideas.

210
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,549
So we had to prioritize
those based on similarities,

211
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:21,270
based on what we could find,

212
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,780
threat reporting that actually says

213
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,991
that these techniques
are used in the wild.

214
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:27,699
And some of those organizations
that submitted to us

215
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,570
were able to actually say
that, yes, we've seen this

216
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,160
even though it isn't reported.

217
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,199
I mean, that's huge.

218
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,200
So I'm happy to say that this
is first extension of ATT&CK

219
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,300
where we've had almost 100%
community contributions,

220
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,348
and this is exactly how ATT&CK
should grow longer-term.

221
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:47,000
This is just amazing.

222
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,650
So as far as coverage goes,

223
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:53,120
ATT&CK for Cloud covers
infrastructure as a service.

224
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,360
So we've got the three providers there,

225
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,366
Azure, AWS, Google Cloud.

226
00:09:58,366 --> 00:10:00,340
We have a platform tag

227
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,470
for general software as
a service techniques,

228
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,410
and then, we have specific platforms

229
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,343
for Office 365 and Azure Active Directory,

230
00:10:09,344 --> 00:10:13,723
to cover specific techniques
for those software platforms.

231
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,010
So the biggest challenge in
building ATT&CK for Cloud,

232
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,560
and even some of the other
efforts that we've done

233
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,939
like ATT&CK for ICS is
there just isn't a lot

234
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,550
of incident reporting out there.

235
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,680
I mean, we know things happen

236
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,353
but they're just not reported quite yet.

237
00:10:32,354 --> 00:10:35,470
And there are some notable
incidents for cloud

238
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,153
like the DNC hack.

239
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,801
We were scouring even DOJ indictments

240
00:10:40,802 --> 00:10:43,400
for information on this.

241
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,906
So, really, consider this a call-to-arms

242
00:10:45,907 --> 00:10:48,651
to help us bolster the community knowledge

243
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:51,271
about what adversaries are
actually doing in this space.

244
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:54,536
Because we really needed
to build this out further.

245
00:10:54,537 --> 00:10:57,930
So if you're in a position
to either share with us

246
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,770
information on what's going on,

247
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:03,710
or influence reporting to
what gets out into the public,

248
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,943
please do so, because we
really need it for this.

249
00:11:08,194 --> 00:11:10,211
Another big change to this area,

250
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,357
in April, we released the Impact Tactic.

251
00:11:13,357 --> 00:11:16,600
So, before April, ATT&CK was very focused

252
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,480
on confidentiality and data exfiltration,

253
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,660
so theft of information,

254
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,250
and we know that destructive attacks

255
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,070
were sort of a big glaring gap in ATT&CK.

256
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:31,098
So we did a lot of work
analyzing incidents of,

257
00:11:31,098 --> 00:11:34,848
like Sony Pictures and Saudi Aramco,

258
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:38,420
and just WannaCry, and
the rise of ransomware.

259
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,146
So this is a big problem
for a lot of people

260
00:11:41,146 --> 00:11:45,040
and we wanted to make sure
that we covered it in ATT&CK.

261
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,328
So, urgently, there were 14
techniques that were published

262
00:11:47,328 --> 00:11:50,531
and we just added two at
the last update last week

263
00:11:50,532 --> 00:11:54,583
for system shutdown and reboot
and account access removal.

264
00:11:58,258 --> 00:12:00,820
Another big change to this here was more

265
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,090
of a structural change.

266
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,350
So we did a revamp of
mitigations in enterprise

267
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,276
so that it acts very
similar to how mitigations

268
00:12:08,276 --> 00:12:10,479
are described in mobile.

269
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,960
So they're treated as objects
similar to groups in software

270
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,458
where we can have a definition
for the mitigation idea,

271
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:19,650
and then, we can describe
how that mitigation applies

272
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,670
to individual techniques through

273
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,469
the relationships between them.

274
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,879
And how we built this was,
we basically went through

275
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:30,821
the existing text field
entries and scoured them,

276
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:34,237
pretty much, to create these categories.

277
00:12:34,237 --> 00:12:38,199
And it's really helpful
for doing what-if analysis.

278
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,680
So what is the coverage
of a potential mitigation

279
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,520
that you wanna deploy
against the techniques,

280
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,480
which is a really powerful thing to do,

281
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,440
that you couldn't do before

282
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,780
with the prior text field entries

283
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:54,230
because ATT&CK grew quite a bit over time,

284
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,900
you know, different things are described

285
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,120
in different ways by different people.

286
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,905
So this was our way of remaining

287
00:12:58,905 --> 00:13:00,439
a little bit more consistent about

288
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,253
how we're describing mitigations.

289
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,687
So let's talk about
some issues with ATT&CK.

290
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:11,080
Anyone who's use ATT&CK for a little bit

291
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,434
knows that the techniques
are a little bit uneven.

292
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:17,363
This was a common theme
at last year's ATT&CKcon

293
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,880
because some techniques are very broad.

294
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,060
Some are even broader than these.

295
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,160
But these have some definition in them.

296
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,579
So there's multiple ways
to do these techniques

297
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:30,479
that aren't really defined
well in ATT&CK yet.

298
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,750
Some are very narrow.

299
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,880
So specific way to execute something

300
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,720
or bypass certain mechanisms that maybe

301
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,973
are too narrow to be a technique.

302
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,070
We weren't really thinking
about these things

303
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,250
when we were building ATT&CK.

304
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,926
I mean, you saw the first version earlier

305
00:13:44,926 --> 00:13:47,066
in the presentation.

306
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:49,030
We were just trying to describe activity

307
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,589
in a way that people
would pay attention to,

308
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,800
and we weren't really worried
about abstraction at the time.

309
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,079
So this has sort of only
magnified the problem

310
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,790
as ATT&CK has grown.

311
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,209
And it's really hard to
strike the right balance

312
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:05,699
for where to put a
specific piece of activity,

313
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,894
or an analytic, or some intel.

314
00:14:07,894 --> 00:14:10,710
And it's even hard for us
in trying to figure out

315
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,230
where to put a new technique
or some new information

316
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,500
that somebody has sent to us.

317
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,760
And it's kind of hard, if anyone's seen

318
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,664
these horrible gradient
puzzles where all the pieces

319
00:14:20,664 --> 00:14:23,400
are almost identical and
they're the same color,

320
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,720
trying to group them all
together by similarities,

321
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,130
it becomes a really challenge
to build this puzzle.

322
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,653
And one really good example is,
when we were building Cloud,

323
00:14:32,653 --> 00:14:37,190
we got several contributions
for O-OFF spearfishing.

324
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,100
Nobody disagrees that
this should be an attack.

325
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,099
This should, very much, be an activity

326
00:14:41,099 --> 00:14:44,561
because it's been reported
used by several groups.

327
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:46,700
But the submissions that we got were like,

328
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,780
okay, this is spearfishing

329
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:50,600
so you should put it in initial access.

330
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,180
And the write-ups we
got were very detailed.

331
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,400
There's a lot of activity in there.

332
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,270
But when we started peeling
away the layers of it,

333
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,281
it was very clear that there's

334
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:00,219
multiple different steps to this.

335
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,318
So, yes, the spearfishing is coming in.

336
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:06,250
We can cover that by
spearfishing with a link.

337
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,730
So a user clicks on it,
they're presented with

338
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,520
a malicious application that's
asking for authorization

339
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,020
to grab their O-OFF token.

340
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,300
So the user has to click on that.

341
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,140
That's credential access.

342
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,970
And then, there's another
step even beyond that

343
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:22,170
where the adversary is using
that authorization token

344
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,849
to access that resource and
pull email or information

345
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,050
from the user's account,

346
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,685
which is use of that token.

347
00:15:27,686 --> 00:15:30,893
So even though ATT&CK,
how it is is kind of hard

348
00:15:30,893 --> 00:15:33,846
to figure out exactly
where something should go,

349
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:35,830
there is a lot of power in its flexibility

350
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,840
to pull apart activity
and make sure that you fit

351
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,973
the right pieces in the right spaces.

352
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,963
So our fix to this is sub-techniques.

353
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,960
So it's important to note
that they're just behaviors.

354
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,090
So techniques are behaviors.

355
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,130
You can consider them groups of behaviors.

356
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,743
Sub-techniques are still just behaviors.

357
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,920
It's also important to note
that we're basically using

358
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,150
what we have.

359
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,520
So we're not adding a whole
lot of new information to this.

360
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,870
It's basically a refactoring
of what's already in there.

361
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,984
Credential dumping is a good example.

362
00:16:12,984 --> 00:16:15,324
Process injection is another good example

363
00:16:15,324 --> 00:16:18,030
of sort of those medium
to high-level techniques

364
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,963
that have a lot of
definition in them already

365
00:16:19,963 --> 00:16:21,890
that that we're turning
into sub-techniques.

366
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,990
So this isn't a huge change.

367
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,790
It is, structurally, but the information

368
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:29,237
is going to be, pretty
much, the same in ATT&CK.

369
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,360
And because ATT&CK is used for
a lot of defensive purposes,

370
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,220
it's natural to try to think about

371
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,500
how to create sub-techniques

372
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,619
that are defender-focused in mind

373
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:42,380
to group techniques
based on the data sources

374
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,670
that you can use to collect activity,

375
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,463
or the mitigations that you
can use to prevent them.

376
00:16:47,463 --> 00:16:50,913
And we tried that and it
didn't work, unfortunately.

377
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,410
So we decided to maintain
an adversary mindset.

378
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,900
That's what people expect out of an attack

379
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,480
and that's what we're continuing
on with sub-techniques.

380
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,310
Because it's a more logical grouping

381
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,962
of what the adversary is
trying to accomplish and how,

382
00:17:03,962 --> 00:17:05,853
then trying to do it any other way.

383
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,650
And it's also good to
think about sub-techniques

384
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,280
as platform-specific techniques.

385
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,410
So we can describe the
activity at a high level,

386
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,730
the technique level, and
then, get into the details

387
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,160
about how that activity
applies to a specific platform

388
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,730
at the sub-technique level.

389
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,730
And, unfortunately, this
isn't a universal thing

390
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,730
that we can apply across the board.

391
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,810
There are tactics like command and control

392
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,169
that are very platform-agnostic,

393
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,560
that we're gonna have to
find a different mechanism

394
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,310
of breaking those out.

395
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:36,618
Because, after all, different
goal require different actions

396
00:17:36,618 --> 00:17:38,470
that are all done different ways,

397
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,680
and there's no one universal sort of logic

398
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,180
to break out of sub-technique.

399
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,810
And so, we are working on
sub-techniques right now.

400
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,973
We've done a ton of work
this year to figure out

401
00:17:49,973 --> 00:17:53,930
the right way to either
break out sub-techniques

402
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,593
from existing techniques' role,

403
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,760
really narrow techniques
under technique groupings.

404
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,650
So the rough stats so
far is that we're going

405
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:09,060
to likely be dropping the
number of techniques to 166

406
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,483
from the current 266, which
is a pretty big reduction.

407
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,810
And so far, we've identified
280 potential sub-techniques,

408
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:20,350
so hence, the meme.

409
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,043
You can fit a ton of
sub-techniques in ATT&CK now.

410
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,880
And we're implementing this right now.

411
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,620
So we had to wait until the October update

412
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,439
to do a clean break, and we're going

413
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,840
to be pausing technique
updates for right now.

414
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,772
You're free to send us your information.

415
00:18:35,772 --> 00:18:38,250
We'll keep tracking it in our internal

416
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,960
contribution-tracking system.

417
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,980
But for right now, don't
send us groups and software,

418
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,090
because the back lanes are gonna change

419
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,220
and we'll just have to wait
until sub-techniques is done

420
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,220
in order to do that.

421
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,470
And so, to talk a little
bit about how we're

422
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,580
gonna implement this, when
sub-techniques rolls out,

423
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:59,540
it won't be the de facto
production version of ATT&CK.

424
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,460
We're gonna be cloning the ATT&CK site

425
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,160
and putting it in some other
location as sort of a preview,

426
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,370
to give people enough time
to digest the information

427
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,300
and plan how they're
going to implement this.

428
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,370
Because it is a big change
and we want to be sensitive

429
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,000
to that and how much effort it's gonna be

430
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,663
to redo tools, redo mappings,
and things like that.

431
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,730
So in case nobody's heard
of sub-techniques before,

432
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,270
hasn't read the blog
post yet that we put out

433
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:28,680
a couple of months ago,
this is one example

434
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,667
of credential access.

435
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:33,949
So you can see the old view on the left

436
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,340
of just the credential access tactic

437
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,580
with the individual
techniques underneath that.

438
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,970
And, on the right, is the
potential sub-techniques

439
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:41,803
breakout of that.

440
00:19:41,803 --> 00:19:44,530
So if you look at the
credential-dumping technique,

441
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,500
there's a lot already-defined
ways of doing that

442
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,380
in the description.

443
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,230
So we'll be, essentially,
breaking those out

444
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,050
into structured ways of
doing credential dumping

445
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:57,520
for Windows, against the
Security Accounts Manager,

446
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,591
or LSA Secrets dumping
and things like that.

447
00:20:00,592 --> 00:20:02,190
So the sub-techniques will, essentially,

448
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,465
be the technique ID for
credential dumping .001,

449
00:20:06,465 --> 00:20:08,429
or .002 for these.

450
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,993
So they'll be directly
tied to that technique.

451
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,490
And so, talking about that
blog post that we put out,

452
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,930
the main reason that we did
that was to get some feedback

453
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,250
from the community, to
make sure that we're on

454
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,450
the right track.

455
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,690
And, overwhelmingly, people
feel that this is very necessary

456
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,912
for ATT&CK and, even
given the amount of work

457
00:20:28,912 --> 00:20:30,550
that it's gonna be to implement it,

458
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,075
it will be worth it longer-term.

459
00:20:32,075 --> 00:20:33,503
So that was great to hear.

460
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,510
People also took the
opportunity to provide us

461
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,936
some more feedback.

462
00:20:38,936 --> 00:20:40,787
So one of the biggest
questions that we got,

463
00:20:40,787 --> 00:20:42,170
"Aren't these just procedures?"

464
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,820
And, no, they're not.

465
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,649
So procedures have a very
specific definition in ATT&CK.

466
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:51,020
Essentially, when you go
look at the technique pages,

467
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,430
there's that box that has the
groups and software examples

468
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,500
that are tagged to that technique.

469
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,570
And that's what we consider procedures.

470
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,399
So we actually took that feedback

471
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,490
and updated the name of that
box to Procedure Examples

472
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,323
to help that.

473
00:21:03,323 --> 00:21:04,730
But even broader than that,

474
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,270
procedures relate to
how specific adversaries

475
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,897
are going about their operation.

476
00:21:08,897 --> 00:21:11,409
So it's really had to
capture that in ATT&CK

477
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,441
without describing how the adversaries

478
00:21:13,441 --> 00:21:15,490
are moving between techniques,

479
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,050
or how they piece things together

480
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,925
if they're on an operation.

481
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:20,955
A few people noted that
there are still going

482
00:21:20,955 --> 00:21:25,580
to be visualization challenges
with sub-techniques.

483
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,710
And, even though we're
shrinking the matrix

484
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,485
at the technique level by quite a bit,

485
00:21:29,485 --> 00:21:31,949
and we're going to make
that the default view

486
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,610
of the ATT&CK matrix, we
wanna have some functionality

487
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:37,330
so people can expand
the techniques to show

488
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,189
those sub-techniques.

489
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,524
And the version that we
posted in the blog post shows

490
00:21:42,524 --> 00:21:45,260
the horizontal breakout where, you know,

491
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,700
if you click on too many things,

492
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,117
it's gonna expand out.

493
00:21:48,117 --> 00:21:50,464
But we also have a
vertical breakout example.

494
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:53,570
So we'll likely put out
some more information

495
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,023
and have some community input
and we might actually make

496
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,639
both the versions
available so people can use

497
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,810
what they like best.

498
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,889
A few people also noted
that there's a potential

499
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:07,480
for issues from having an
individual sub-technique

500
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,860
mapping to multiple techniques,

501
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,606
and we're trying to
avoid this at all costs.

502
00:22:11,606 --> 00:22:13,450
So don't worry.

503
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:15,856
We've got this.

504
00:22:15,856 --> 00:22:19,927
And then, another big
challenge people identified

505
00:22:19,927 --> 00:22:24,010
was having the tools available to map

506
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,690
from the old version of ATT&CK to new.

507
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,870
So we're going to be
providing spreadsheets

508
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:28,703
that have that mapping.

509
00:22:28,703 --> 00:22:31,032
We're looking into ways of doing JSON

510
00:22:31,032 --> 00:22:32,629
to have a machine-readable version.

511
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,070
And we're also going
to be taking advantage

512
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,688
of the STIX Revocation functionality

513
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,670
where we can revoke an
object and have it be revoked

514
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:43,050
by its replacement, which
could be a sub-technique.

515
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:45,423
So there will be that
pointer in the STIX data.

516
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,553
A few people also noted that this is

517
00:22:48,553 --> 00:22:50,890
a good opportunity to do
data source refinement.

518
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:53,900
And data sources are a
thing that's five years old,

519
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,540
so we know this is a problem,

520
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,990
but we can't get it done during something.

521
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,500
So this is something
that we're gonna be doing

522
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,663
after this gets released.

523
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:05,040
A few people also noted that techniques

524
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,367
should be OS-agnostic.

525
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:08,050
Largely, we agree.

526
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,820
It's not gonna be universal because

527
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,149
what I said earlier about it,

528
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:12,900
there really being different criteria

529
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,730
for breaking out sub-techniques per tactic

530
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,093
and even per technique.

531
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,050
A few people noted that
techniques should always

532
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,230
have sub-techniques.

533
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,619
Again, sort of.

534
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:24,370
This is something to shoot for,

535
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,195
but we're not going to
force a decomposition

536
00:23:27,195 --> 00:23:32,070
or rolling something into a sub-technique

537
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,629
if it doesn't make sense.

538
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:36,010
Part of the awesomeness of ATT&CK

539
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:36,900
is its flexibility.

540
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,200
So we wanna maintain that.

541
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,929
And then, sub-techniques
should be OS-specific.

542
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,990
I already covered that,
so yes, definitely agree.

543
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,900
And a few people also
noted that sub-techniques

544
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,700
will help people to have a false sense

545
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,030
of security because they're just looking

546
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,740
at the top-level matrix view
and once they color that green,

547
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,718
they think they're done.

548
00:23:54,718 --> 00:23:56,320
So it was really good to hear that

549
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,429
because that's one of
the reasons that we're

550
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,900
doing sub-techniques.

551
00:24:00,451 --> 00:24:03,869
And so, Katie and Tony
also already talked about

552
00:24:03,869 --> 00:24:05,678
the growth of the community,

553
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,180
so I'm going to, too,
because this is awesome.

554
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:13,043
We've have 132 different
contributors to ATT&CK right now,

555
00:24:13,043 --> 00:24:14,570
which is incredible.

556
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,620
I mean, ATT&CK is built by the community,

557
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:18,398
and it maintained by the community.

558
00:24:18,398 --> 00:24:21,286
We've had explosive growth
in Twitter followers.

559
00:24:21,287 --> 00:24:23,630
A year ago, it was about 12,000,

560
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,280
and I think we're over
28,000 as of the start

561
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,403
of the conference.

562
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,240
And there's 99 open-source repositories

563
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,473
that use or leverage ATT&CK in some way.

564
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,720
So ATT&CK is global and
it's all over the world.

565
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,145
It's showing up in conferences,

566
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,418
even people not briefing it from MITRE.

567
00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:45,480
It's showing up in workshops
in professional groups

568
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,650
and things like that.

569
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,290
So it's great to see.

570
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,960
So there's still a lot of work to do,

571
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,129
so things to come.

572
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:56,216
We will be continuing to
roll the efforts of ATT&CK

573
00:24:56,216 --> 00:24:57,985
under the ATT&CK umbrella.

574
00:24:57,985 --> 00:24:59,580
It's just ATT&CK.

575
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,750
We started this with the
initial access tactic

576
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,090
and we're gonna be continuing
it with the PRE-ATT&CK revamp.

577
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,550
I already mentioned this but the ICS team

578
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,899
is hard at work trying to get this ready

579
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,759
to go and will likely be publishing this

580
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,440
as a separate website
in a couple of months.

581
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,520
So the reason why it's gonna
be in a separate website

582
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,431
is to give some flexibility to grow

583
00:25:17,431 --> 00:25:19,398
to better match that domain,

584
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:20,790
and then, we'll be looking

585
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:24,270
at rolling it under ATT&CK later on.

586
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,500
And then, a lot of people are creating

587
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,403
their own controlled mappings to ATT&CK,

588
00:25:27,403 --> 00:25:30,460
so we think we can help build
a community around this.

589
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:34,230
So we'll be talking about
this over the conference, too.

590
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,750
So if I didn't cover your favorite topic

591
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,990
related to ATT&CK, we've
got more updates planned

592
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,389
that are sprinkled throughout
the next couple of days.

593
00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:45,303
We're gonna be talking
about our threat report,

594
00:25:45,303 --> 00:25:48,210
ATT&CK mapping, automation tool, TRAM,

595
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,940
and we'll be talking
about ATT&CK sightings

596
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,140
later on today.

597
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,266
And then, we'll be covering ICS ATT&CK,

598
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:57,050
our controls-mapping
effort, car analytics,

599
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:00,623
and then, integration with
PRE-ATT&CK later on tomorrow.

600
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,589
Thank you very much.

601
00:26:03,589 --> 00:26:06,755
(audience applauding)

602
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,031
- Got about five minutes for questions.

603
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:14,781
- Alright, questions?

604
00:26:19,668 --> 00:26:20,673
- Really?

605
00:26:20,673 --> 00:26:23,590
(speaking faintly)

606
00:26:28,747 --> 00:26:30,940
- Hi, just curious if Navigator is gonna

607
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,370
be mapped to the new techniques, as well,

608
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,270
the new framework?

609
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,530
- Yes, yeah, once we
roll sub-techniques out,

610
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,810
we'll have a version of the Navigator

611
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:39,570
that can support that, as well,

612
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,919
along with the different
visualization options.

613
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,770
Back there in the corner.

614
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,869
- What's your thinking on mitigations

615
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:53,300
versus course of actions?

616
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,087
Are they the same thing?

617
00:26:55,087 --> 00:26:58,660
- I think it really just
comes down to definition.

618
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,468
We're treating them like course of action

619
00:27:00,468 --> 00:27:02,770
in STIX right now.

620
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:06,253
So, yes, they could be, very
much, courses of actions.

621
00:27:16,022 --> 00:27:17,110
- [Katie] No one else?

622
00:27:17,111 --> 00:27:18,800
If no one else, there we go, yeah.

623
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,283
- [Blake] Yeah, there's James.

624
00:27:21,152 --> 00:27:24,090
- You can always rely on
me to ask you a question.

625
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:27,409
No, I actually just wanna
thank you for putting yourself

626
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:28,310
in this position.

627
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:33,310
I know that trying to
steer a ship with 10,000

628
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:37,190
or 23,000 followers is not easy.

629
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,453
And so, I feel your pain
and keep up the good work.

630
00:27:40,453 --> 00:27:41,730
I really appreciate it.

631
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:42,563
- Yeah, thank you.

632
00:27:42,563 --> 00:27:44,270
It's really the community
that makes this worthwhile

633
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,303
for us so I should thank you guys.

634
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:48,660
- [James] Mutual love.

635
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,493
- Yep.

636
00:27:49,493 --> 00:27:51,669
(laughing)

637
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:52,670
- [Katie] Blake, I'm
gonna throw on at you.

638
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,010
And we didn't pre-stage this

639
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,860
so feel free to yell at me later.

640
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,693
Interesting question.

641
00:27:56,693 --> 00:27:58,237
Now, Carl asked me last night,

642
00:27:58,237 --> 00:28:01,030
"Where do you see ATT&CK in five years?"

643
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:01,933
- I hate this question.

644
00:28:01,933 --> 00:28:04,183
(laughing)

645
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,139
I see it bring maintained
more by the community.

646
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,150
We want more transparency in the process.

647
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:14,090
I mean, we have some ideas
on tools and processes

648
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:15,490
that can help with that.

649
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,900
So MITRE's always gonna be, I think,

650
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,100
in a role where we're curating it.

651
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,860
But we really want to
foster more contributions

652
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,732
from the community.

653
00:28:23,732 --> 00:28:25,903
So that's where I think it'll be.

654
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,303
- Any other questions?

655
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,954
If not, please join me
in thanking Blake Strom.

656
00:28:33,954 --> 00:28:37,120
(audience applauding)
