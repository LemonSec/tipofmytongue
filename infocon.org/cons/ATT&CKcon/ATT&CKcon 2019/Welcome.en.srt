00:00:00,261 --> 00:00:04,490
- [Narrator] ATT&CKcon 2.0
presents our conference emcee,

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,940
ATT&CK Threat Intelligence
Lead with MITRE,

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,520
please give a warm welcome

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,896
to America's own, Katie Nickels.

5
00:00:10,897 --> 00:00:13,960
(audience applauding)

6
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,900
- Good morning everyone.

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,129
Thank you all for coming

8
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,900
and welcome to ATT&CKcon 2.0,

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,580
the second annual ATT&CK
community conference.

10
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,529
We are so pleased to welcome

11
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,480
the hundreds of you here in McLean,

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,840
as well as, the thousands of
you who are watching online.

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,479
Welcome to the MITRE campus
here in McLean, Virginia.

14
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,650
We at MITRE are so excited to bring people

15
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,240
from around the world

16
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,040
who are passionate about
this idea of ATT&CK,

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,040
and of creating a threat informed defense.

18
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,400
Our goal for these next two
days is for you to share ideas.

19
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,900
So, we know what we do on the ATT&CK team,

20
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,940
maintaining ATT&CK is important and all,

21
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,030
but, ATT&CK's real power
is in how you use it,

22
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,510
and how you apply it.

23
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,580
And, we hope that you'll
share best practices

24
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,390
over these next two days.

25
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,550
What works, what maybe
doesn't work so well

26
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,059
when you're using ATT&CK,

27
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,660
and it sounds a little bit cheesy,

28
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,440
but MITRE's mission is to solve
problems for a safer world.

29
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,500
And, we truly hope that
when you leave here,

30
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,820
you'll go back to your
organizations and make them safer.

31
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,000
That's why we're all here.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,630
That's what it's all about.

33
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,160
So, so excited to bring you all together.

34
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,160
We're all about community here at ATT&CK,

35
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,883
and that ATT&CK community,
both online and in person.

36
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,823
Let's see if we can get
our community slide on.

37
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,190
So, we started out yesterday

38
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,649
bringing those folks together

39
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,330
with our pre-conference training day.

40
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,070
This is our second ATT&CKcon

41
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,820
and we're changing things up,

42
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,080
keeping some things the same.

43
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,050
We were pleased to welcome
over 150 of you yesterday

44
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,110
to different trainings.

45
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,300
We were excited to roll out

46
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,509
detection analytics with John,

47
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,720
SOC assessments with Andy,

48
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,970
CTI and CALDERA trainings.

49
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,320
We also wrapped up the day with

50
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,529
12 Birds of a Feather discussions,

51
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,450
which were a lot of fun.

52
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,020
So, thanks to those of you who joined us,

53
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,770
and of course, we had to add
another reception last night

54
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,039
since we had another day.

55
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,960
So, thanks for those of you who joined us

56
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,913
in our Oktoberfest reception.

57
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,163
So, going back hopefully
to our community slide.

58
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,950
We are tweeting throughout the conference.

59
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,829
So, if you use the hashtag #ATTACKcon,

60
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,010
or follow us @MITREattack,

61
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,630
we'll be choosing some
of our favorite tweets

62
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,140
throughout the event.

63
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,410
So, we really like cat GIFs.

64
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,000
We also enjoy custom memes.

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,350
So, if that's your
thing, not saying you'll

66
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,000
definitely get a prize, but you might.

67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So, tweet at us throughout the conference,

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,740
we'll be sharing some of our favorites.

69
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,090
To give you a sense of how
many people we have in McLean,

70
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,770
we have 260 people in-person registered,

71
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,450
folks hanging out in the
lobby here in the auditorium

72
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,670
from over 133 organizations

73
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,720
and, amazingly, 19 countries,

74
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,560
which speaks to the amazing
global reach of ATT&CK.

75
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,700
So that was particularly exciting.

76
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,290
In addition to those of you here,

77
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,049
we also have thousands
registered to watch online.

78
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:04,650
We have 4,052 individuals
who signed up to watch.

79
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,200
And, then in addition to that,

80
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,200
we have 94 watch parties with
1,312 expected attendees.

81
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,047
So, all together, thousands
and thousands of you

82
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:17,329
are here today, watching online.

83
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,040
So, thank you so much for joining us.

84
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,660
And, again, tweet at us.
So, as I said, we added our

85
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,740
pre-conference training day yesterday.

86
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,430
Another new addition,

87
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,950
some special online content for you.

88
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,790
My teammate Jamie Williams is going to be

89
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,859
hanging out on our ATT&CKcon account

90
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,440
with speakers and special guests.

91
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,720
So, for folks online, don't miss that.

92
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,770
Hang out during the
breaks, during the lunch,

93
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,483
and it should be a lot of fun.

94
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,930
We're really grateful for all
our exhibitors and sponsors,

95
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,840
who have made this event come to you.

96
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,170
As you know, MITRE is a nonprofit,

97
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,410
and we work in the public interest.

98
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,040
So that means we don't endorse
any particular company,

99
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,040
but we do appreciate that
all of these companies

100
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,290
have invested in this community event.

101
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,030
The power of what you all do

102
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,500
and bringing us all together.

103
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,580
So, really, really, really
grateful to all of them.

104
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,970
We have eight exhibitors.

105
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,470
Make sure during the breaks,
you check out their tables,

106
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,970
they have some great swag.

107
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:13,359
Chat with them because vendors

108
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,060
are such an important
part of this community

109
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,640
and how we use ATT&CK.

110
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,060
And, talk to them about their
services, their products,

111
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,019
how they're using ATT&CK
during the breaks,

112
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,719
during lunch here in McLean.

113
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,660
So, thank you so much to
all of our exhibitors,

114
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,580
AttackIQ, Cybereason,
Digital Shadows, McAfee,

115
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,479
Praetorian, Red Canary,
SafeBreach, and XM Cyber.

116
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,500
This year we also have
food and beverage sponsors,

117
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,370
including our delicious breakfast,

118
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,150
sponsored by Scythe this morning.

119
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,030
Any time I start a day with
guacamole, is a good day for me.

120
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,929
So, hopefully you enjoyed the tacos

121
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:48,350
and got some unicorn swag as well.

122
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,240
In addition to Scythe, we have several

123
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,150
other food and beverage sponsors.

124
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,909
Cisco, CrowdStrike, Endgame,
Microsoft, Syncurity,

125
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,800
ThreatQuotient, Trend Micro, and VMRay.

126
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,830
So, thank you again to
all of our sponsors,

127
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,930
all of our exhibitors, for
bringing this event to you.

128
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,280
Speaks to the power of this community,

129
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,880
and kinda what we're doing here.

130
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,550
Wanted to take a moment to
introduce the ATT&CK team.

131
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,630
I think, sometimes there's
this myth that only myself,

132
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,550
or Blake or those of us who
are out speaking publicly

133
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,970
do everything behind ATT&CK.

134
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,390
And, nothing could be
farther from the truth.

135
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,969
As any of you on a team
knows, it takes a village.

136
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,494
And, there are so many people

137
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:29,170
who maybe aren't out
publicly speaking everyday,

138
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,070
who do a ton of work on ATT&CK.

139
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,780
So, we wanted to take a moment
to recognize all of them.

140
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,669
And, I know you're excited to meet them,

141
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,490
but please hold your applause 'til the end

142
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,440
so we can bring 'em all in.

143
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,150
Over the last year, we've
really grown our team.

144
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,989
We have over 30 people who
are on the ATT&CK team,

145
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,230
as well as projects in
the family like CALDERA.

146
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,100
So, wanted to just take a
moment to introduce all of them.

147
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,000
So, first off, of course,
Father Attack, as we call him,

148
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,240
our ATT&CK Lead.

149
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,790
He helps out with ATT&CK evals,

150
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,870
he's the Adversary Emulation

151
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,450
Capability Area Lead, Blake Strom.

152
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,020
Also, ping him about
cloud and sub-techniques.

153
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,789
I've listed on the slide some of the areas

154
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,360
each of these folks knows a lot about.

155
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,210
So, log them during breaks,

156
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,539
they would love to answer your questions.

157
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,460
Next up, me.

158
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,979
I'm the Threat Intel Lead for ATT&CK.

159
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,300
I also help out with ATT&CK evaluations.

160
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,500
Next up, wanted to
introduce Adam Pennington.

161
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,700

I still see John, who's

over a lot of these folks,

258
00:09:59,077 --> 00:10:01,177
and over the ATT&CK project here at MITRE.

259
00:10:02,107 --> 00:10:04,089
Al right, that's just the folks in-person.

260
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,340
I'm not going to name everyone else.

261
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,110
But, let's thank the ATT&CK
team for all they do.

262
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,277
(audience applauding)

263
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,410
All right, you are all dismissed.

264
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:20,337
Thank you for smiling and
waving to your adoring fans.

265
00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:22,300
(audience laughing)

266
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,030
All right, so you can
see we've grown our team

267
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,810
quite a bit over the past year.

268
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,810
And, we wanted to bring
you a highlight video now,

269
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:31,260
where we're gonna show
you some of the highlights

270
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,680
of what the team's been
up to over the past year.

271
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,859
Thanks to Neils and the media team

272
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,730
for putting this together.

273
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,833
So, take it away.
