1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:03,590
- [Katie] Please join me
in welcoming Olaf Hartong

2
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:07,114
(applause)

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,340
- Thanks Katie that's way too humbling.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,549
Um thank you for attending.

5
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:17,917
I wanna talk about data and
this is kind of important to me

6
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:21,639
and most of the people have
been talking about coverage,

7
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:23,180
super important,

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,340
but there's multiple ways
to achieve that I believe.

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,710
So first a very sort intro

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,429
because I probably don't
have that much time.

11
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:34,330
I've been in infosec for quite a long time

12
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,600
mostly working on the defensive side

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,130
I work together with the
red team just to learn more

14
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,200
but um

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,850
the most important for
me is basically data.

16
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,293
I love data anyway you can
get it, I'll play with it.

17
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,810
I didn't always be in infosec,

18
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,880
I used to be a documentary photographer,

19
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,093
I went to art school,

20
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,750
which actually helps me
get a different perspective

21
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,583
on things.

22
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:57,416
Right I don't,

23
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,930
I try to shear away from tunnel vision

24
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,700
and kinda get a helicopter perspective,

25
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,790
I have two boys which I
truly love but onwards.

26
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,240
So this is also very important quote,

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,520
it's actually cool that I'm not
the first to quote her here,

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,660
but if you don't really know
yourself and not your data,

29
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,179
and your enemy you'll be clueless right.

30
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,060
So you're just chasing chasing
whatever you want to do

31
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,060
and not really have a focus
on where you wanna go.

32
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,600
So again data, data is
very important for me.

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,770
So everybody knows this
it's been flashed a lot,

34
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:33,740
you don't have to read it,

35
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,520
it fits on a slide but you can't
do anything with it anymore

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,330
but the important thing is now

37
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,000
we talk little bit about coverage,

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,110
so most, what most people do is

39
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,000
they map their current coverage to it

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,700
which it's totally useful for

41
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,070
and in this example
everything has the same value

42
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,850
just because other wise
it won't be readable

43
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,640
but some of them you'll have
more confidence in than others.

44
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,840
So then the next thing you might do

45
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,870
is map some bears and some
criminals and some pandas to it

46
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,400
just to have some focus
into where you wanna go

47
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,070
and I use them because
I like the pictures.

48
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,780
Um but then again so how do you
achieve that coverage right?

49
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,330
So then there's a lot of techniques there,

50
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,870
you wanna go ahead and cover
those in probably multiple ways

51
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,750
because there's multiple
ways to execute them.

52
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,410
So how do you achieve this?

53
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,609
So there's multiple ways,

54
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,500
probably you can start
playing with the tools

55
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,570
and then see what it's generating

56
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,085
and then start building your
detection rules for that.

57
00:02:28,086 --> 00:02:29,540
But then you also need
a lot of this stuff.

58
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,910
So there's a lot of data,

59
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,190
you probably already
gathered all of the data.

60
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,447
You have all these tools maybe even more,

61
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:38,790
um so why not focus on that first.

62
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,720
So that was my idea and what
I also get from clients a lot,

63
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,570
is so where do we begin?

64
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,109
So usually you start
with like I said before

65
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,640
with the lower hanging fruit,

66
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,140
or the stuff you're really scared about,

67
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,779
or maybe combine it and see okay

68
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,800
where do I have a correlation

69
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,100
and start from there.

70
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,160
So it's just an easier way of starting

71
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,260
So I wanted to create a simple toolkit,

72
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,850
sorry it is based on excel,

73
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,680
but I figured it should be portable

74
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,500
it should be usable by everybody

75
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,770
and sadly everybody uses excel

76
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,590
even though its not always best tool.

77
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,113
Some love it some hate it,

78
00:03:11,113 --> 00:03:12,440
it's not that important.

79
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,930
But it's at least on most of the systems

80
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,420
and then again also
PowerShell which is available

81
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,579
at least on Windows and on Mac
and Linux you can install it,

82
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,022
it will work mostly.

83
00:03:23,022 --> 00:03:26,929
Um and that's mostly due
to my scripting skills

84
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,370
so nothing to fire against PowerShell

85
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,740
because I kinda like it actually,

86
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,310
and then if you use my excel
sheet and the PowerShell script

87
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,890
that I provide you'll
get a nice JSON file,

88
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,279
you can load that up to the navigator

89
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,820
and I'll show you how that works now.

90
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,620
So essentially that excel sheet
contains the tech framework,

91
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,200
so I ingest the whole thing
the nice JSON that they provide

92
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,329
and I quickly put it into
the right columns for you

93
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,780
so that at least you can reference it

94
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,310
in all the other workbooks.

95
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,870
So there's a weights work book,

96
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,890
so basically what I did
is I rated every technique

97
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,527
and I went to all the data sources

98
00:04:03,527 --> 00:04:06,500
and looked which data source
was the most important

99
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,782
for that technique.

100
00:04:07,782 --> 00:04:11,970
So this is super biased as
the buzz word of the day,

101
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,660
I mean this is my interpretation
of every technique,

102
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,089
so if you don't trust me
please go through them

103
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,099
and adjust them accordingly.

104
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,690
Um and then there's the important
part the rating workbook,

105
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,851
so this is basically the
one that he use as a user

106
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:26,912
which I'll dig in a little bit later

107
00:04:26,912 --> 00:04:29,099
just to show you an overview.

108
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,520
So this is the data source one,

109
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,359
I wasn't sure whether there
was read...you could read this

110
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,230
so i actually zoomed it in a little bit

111
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,040
and basically what I did is I explained

112
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,800
so these are all the techniques
with adjoining data sources

113
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,900
and I gave them a rating

114
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,159
which adds up to 100
as a total rating score

115
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,500
and that's important later

116
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,850
when I calculate your data
coverage before every technique.

117
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,950
So in an example if there's like five

118
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,810
and then the process monitoring

119
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,770
might be the most important
one for that technique

120
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,930
it usually gets a slightly higher score

121
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,200
than some of the ones
that I deem less important

122
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,853
to be able to properly
detect the technique.

123
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,840
Um so to the rating workbook

124
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,869
basically what I did is I went
through all the data sources

125
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,130
and put them under each other

126
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,670
and I tied them to the
adjoining event codes

127
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,914
that are being logged and
so I love Sysmon also,

128
00:05:20,914 --> 00:05:23,039
and so there's a lot of Sysmon in there

129
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,790
and it's definitely not complete

130
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,720
it's just what I usually encounter.

131
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,380
So you can add your own
event ID's if you are,

132
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,170
or if you have some specific
application log that you have

133
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,010
and so on and what you do then

134
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,390
is you rate them on completeness,

135
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,500
timeliness and availability.

136
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,480
So how well are you covering
it throughout your network

137
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,010
how quickly do you get it

138
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,780
into your central logging environment

139
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,159
which might be important as well

140
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,560
because you have to adjust your
detection rule against that

141
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,510
and where do you store it?

142
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,870
So do you even ship it

143
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,270
to your local or to your
central environment,

144
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,299
or do you keep it locally?

145
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,620
Which is also kind of a feedback thing,

146
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,520
your detection capabilities.

147
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,240
So that will be calculated
into a mathematical score

148
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,380
but I look at completeness
and availability,

149
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,680
most of the time in this
you can usually accommodate

150
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,507
by looking at the index time
instead of the generator time

151
00:06:12,507 --> 00:06:15,333
and so on so this is slightly easier one.

152
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,240
And what I do then is basically
I factor that total score

153
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,650
which is at the right

154
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,609
and I calculate that

155
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,750
against the weight of that
data source for that technique

156
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,210
and that will give you a coverage score

157
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,342
for basically that technique in the end.

158
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,850
So I do that through PowerShell

159
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,650
because I'm not really good at excel

160
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,370
nor am I at PowerShell but this works.

161
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,350
So basically what I did is

162
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,928
I created the module for you
that you can install or load

163
00:06:43,928 --> 00:06:46,480
and basically there are
a couple of functions

164
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,830
so you can download the
latest tech JSON file

165
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,120
which was updated a couple of days ago

166
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,193
which added a lot of
cool stuff and thank you.

167
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,910
Um you can update it then so
you can update your excel sheet

168
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,170
with the same PowerShell module

169
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,280
you can request the JSON file
that I'll show you later,

170
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,049
and I also added some new features now

171
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,310
where I have some issues

172
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,130
with the way people
sometimes use the tech.

173
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,414
So you can also see where
you could apply it best

174
00:07:17,414 --> 00:07:21,060
and now they are starting
to implement the mitigation

175
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,610
and detecting capabilities more
so I'm also working towards

176
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,523
implementing this into my toolbox.

177
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,049
So this is a short demo basically

178
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,840
of showing you whenever
you generate the JSON file

179
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,840
which I won't bother you with,

180
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,349
it's just a simple PowerShell command,

181
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,570
but when you load it up you
get a coverage map like this

182
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,800
and then in the comments field,

183
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,990
you'll see your total
coverage for that technique

184
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,040
but also the stuff you're missing.

185
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,570
So if there's a zero there
then you don't ingest the logs,

186
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:49,650
maybe its not important

187
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,219
but at least you know you're missing it

188
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,354
so you might be working
towards onboarding that

189
00:07:53,354 --> 00:07:56,543
or you have a proper coverage
so you're actually fine.

190
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,722
Um and the cool part
about this is also that

191
00:07:59,723 --> 00:08:04,180
I saw in the change log there's
warning for the navigator

192
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,390
that you're actually now able
to export the comments as well

193
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,500
so you can look it up in excel again

194
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,100
instead of having to hover all these boxes

195
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,113
which is cumbersome at the least.

196
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:19,020
So I was already ranting a
little bit about that right,

197
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,419
so there's a couple of ways

198
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,050
that I perceive a tech to be used,

199
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,460
not only for creating an alert

200
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,349
but also hunting an incidence response

201
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:32,620
and if you visualize that and
basically the way I look at it

202
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,799
to properly cover everything
in alert is super hard

203
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,979
so usually I deem techniques
a little bit lower

204
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,240
than for instance hunting
where you can do a lot more

205
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,440
and it takes more time to dig into it,

206
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,030
there's less pressure on
false positive rates and so on

207
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,410
and actually the same for forensics

208
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,310
because they usually take more time

209
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,170
and the likelihood of
covering that technique fully

210
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,860
is higher than when you start doing this

211
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,890
from an alert perspective.

212
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,030
So it's not exact science
it's my opinion again

213
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,318
so please bare with me there.

214
00:09:05,318 --> 00:09:08,880
I did the same thing basically
so I added them all up,

215
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,450
I looked at the data sources I knew,

216
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,800
I know what the name
is I know what it does

217
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,997
and I rated it,

218
00:09:13,998 --> 00:09:16,670
I'll zoom in again sorry,

219
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,380
and basically on a one to five scale

220
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,060
how likely it is that you
will be having full coverage

221
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,310
for that technique.

222
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:24,670
Maybe we move to sub-techniques later on

223
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,079
it will be a little bit more granular.

224
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,893
So I'm really looking forward to that.

225
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,540
Um and as I said I love Sysmon

226
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,000
so I also filled it in for
Sysmon that's another caveat

227
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,330
and this looks amazing right

228
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:40,350
it's a lot of coverage from just one tool,

229
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,180
but mind you the actual wave covering it

230
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,060
probably a little bit more than that,

231
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,930
it's actually the orange one
and there's a huge difference

232
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,890
on the right side of the spectrum

233
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,430
and this partially has to do with Sysmon

234
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,280
as you have to configure it

235
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,050
so some of the stuff you
configure will give a big load

236
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,019
on your systems here we
really don't want that

237
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:06,780
but also the gap in the
quality of the naming

238
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,410
in the data sources from my side,

239
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,290
I mean it's not perfect and they know it,

240
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,890
they're working on it I'm really helpful,

241
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:15,360
I really wanna help them there as well,

242
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,950
but this is something that
you have to keep in mind

243
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,900
throughout the whole thing of using it.

244
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:24,010
It won't be full a assessment
that really guides you okay.

245
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,670
You have to find it there
so keep that in mind.

246
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,189
Um and then as I mentioned

247
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:30,420
I am working on the defense mitigation

248
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,939
and they actually now are changed

249
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,040
also with a lot of the mitigations

250
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,069
that are in the latest update

251
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,200
which I didn't have time to include

252
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,148
since I was pushed I think Thursday.

253
00:10:42,148 --> 00:10:45,270
So but the same process
goes there as well,

254
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,510
so basically all the
defenses can be weighed

255
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,080
for that technique and then
how easy is it to buy parts

256
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,940
you know how likely is it
you are able to cover it.

257
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,750
Um and with three minutes left,

258
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,970
part of my roadmap is
adding those mitigations

259
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,230
but also I am working with a colleague

260
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,930
on graphing the whole Att&ck framework

261
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,579
and what we did there is actually

262
00:11:08,607 --> 00:11:10,990
the 11th tactics aren't really linear,

263
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,760
so they're not hopping along
which was also the beef

264
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,280
with what the kill chain does

265
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,319
but they keep on moving back
and forth and back and forth

266
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,792
so we modeled that into Att&ck,

267
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:24,240
or into graph sorry

268
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,810
and basically what we want to end up with

269
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,680
is a sort of plot out for Att&ck

270
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,660
where you can fill in the
sheet I showed you before

271
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,430
import that with the ratings
and then it will show you

272
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,750
okay you've got good coverage here

273
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,450
an attacker won't be able to
probably take the whole path

274
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,000
and you have to go another way.

275
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,440
So it makes it a little bit easier

276
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,910
for defender to focus again

277
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,329
where you should be covering
your techniques most.

278
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,090
But also from an attacker
it might be very useful

279
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,590
if you land on the...(mumbles),

280
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,200
they have an EDR they probably
cover this, this and that.

281
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,270
Then I probably need to
go there, there and there,

282
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,750
and then you might be happy.

283
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,870
So it works both ways.

284
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,920
Um and actually I have one minute left

285
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,430
so I have time for questions
I didn't expect that.

286
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,262
Um

287
00:12:05,453 --> 00:12:06,323
So thank you.

288
00:12:07,224 --> 00:12:09,474
(applause)
