1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:13,639
please join me in welcoming James the

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:15,559
rude alright sound is good it's good to

3
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:17,470
see everybody here I had the pleasure of

4
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:20,090
speaking last year and this year

5
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:23,060
everything has grown so hats off to the

6
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:26,420
attack team I can't believe what you get

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:28,610
away with like all this stuff and it's

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,940
amazing it's really amazing so for me

9
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:34,370
the 2.0 really means let's take some

10
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:39,649
risks gonna go twice as big this year

11
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:42,379
maybe a logarithmic scale let's really

12
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:45,159
blow this up cuz you know I kind of

13
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:47,718
represent that salty guy that uh

14
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:50,359
that a lot of the keynote speakers were

15
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:52,280
talking about I'm the guy who's been

16
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:55,429
doing this for a long time with my head

17
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,379
in the trenches and so I decided how do

18
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:59,269
I talk about that how can I be critical

19
00:00:57,379 --> 00:01:01,940
about myself and you see the Dungeons &

20
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:03,409
Dragons reference here so I'm gonna kind

21
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,509
of turn it into a little bit of a game

22
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:07,640
it's a crazy idea but I think that

23
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:10,189
security needs crazy ideas so don't be

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,549
afraid of trying something crazy

25
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:15,969
sometimes quick disclaimer before I

26
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:15,969
start

27
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:31,440
all right I think I'm a level 8 security

28
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:34,200
guy now if I put on the cape and I'll

29
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:38,850
hold on do you not believe me I got a

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,470
medal for cybersecurity excellence all

31
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,250
right so now that my credibility is

32
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,250
established

33
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:50,700
don't call me Bobo the cyber clown

34
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:53,970
because KC ruined that so what am I

35
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,590
gonna do well my perspective on things

36
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,590
is maybe a little bit different than

37
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:01,980
your CTI folks I have been under the

38
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:04,530
surface of the ocean metaphorically I'm

39
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,360
not an actual diver looking for treasure

40
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,640
and every once in a while I come up and

41
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,440
go whoa everything's changed I mean uh

42
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,559
get my lung capacity up I'm gonna dive

43
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,750
back down and look for some more and so

44
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,610
that makes for a socially awkward weirdo

45
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,500
who's now talking to you with wearing a

46
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,360
wig but Halloween it's like what

47
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,790
tomorrow so I'm allowed to do this I

48
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:32,520
think sorry my trying to run this by you

49
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:34,609
exactly so who is security guy wall

50
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,340
security guy likes to think that he's a

51
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:41,820
James Bond Sean Connery type guy who's

52
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,890
always smooth and knows what to do in an

53
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,780
emergency situation but he backs it up

54
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:49,140
with some math you know he just Sudoku

55
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,850
in his free time you got some analog

56
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,190
measure so it's okay I got some tools

57
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:56,070
for that I can process analog and

58
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,980
digital and when I take my day off I'm

59
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:02,310
gonna go camp in my tetrahedron tiny

60
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:06,750
house you can come to me there and ask

61
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:09,060
me questions but how do I actually see

62
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:12,390
myself like real James how do I see

63
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,980
myself well I'm like mr. bean sometimes

64
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,779
I'm like driving the car and like

65
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:19,609
disaster is happening everywhere around

66
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:23,250
me and like somehow stuff is working out

67
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:24,900
and it's almost like a fear maybe some

68
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,390
people share this in common I don't know

69
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,300
I get up on top of that power line and

70
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,869
you know what I do I fix that little bit

71
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,760
and then I

72
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:37,920
climb down the ladder I'm like yep this

73
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:40,079
is sustainable my favorite really here

74
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,540
is that I fixed it part where

75
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,430
everything's burning down around so what

76
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,470
does this have to do with attack well in

77
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,420
perspective and communication and

78
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,180
talking to people that's why I like

79
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:54,750
about attack honestly is that it gives

80
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:57,150
you something to start with for a guy

81
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:00,090
like me to talk to a person who's

82
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,560
interested in threat Intel but I can

83
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,859
tell you have seen the wheel reinvented

84
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,569
many many times so what what happened to

85
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:09,390
me a couple years ago I moved to a farm

86
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:12,420
that was by choice this is like a weird

87
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:14,339
first world problem where I decided I

88
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,769
love animals I'm not like producing

89
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,289
artists and cheese or anything but you

90
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:22,350
know gives me an excuse and one thing

91
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:24,930
that went along with that that maybe you

92
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,580
know about maybe you don't this is gonna

93
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,889
sound like I live in a shack but I don't

94
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,198
I swear I have HughesNet oh if you're

95
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:34,940
familiar with satellite internet but the

96
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:38,130
modern web is not really built for

97
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:42,389
gloating websites at 2,000 millisecond

98
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:45,780
latency my like over watched team you

99
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:48,090
know sorry not over watch I don't play

100
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,429
that game but is a good example so I

101
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,450
really have this theory about myself and

102
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:55,770
that is that I'm at this point where I

103
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:58,139
started my career with a whole lot of

104
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,030
ambition and as time gets on I go

105
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:02,940
weirder and weirder and saltier and

106
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,049
saltier and all of a sudden I'm looking

107
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,510
at my career and I'm going home

108
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,120
maybe I'm past to the point where I can

109
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:12,840
actually like do everything myself

110
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:16,500
maybe I am well on my way to being a

111
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,210
hermit farmer I did buy a farm so as I'm

112
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,010
putting together this presentation to

113
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,698
try to convince you of something in 10

114
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,500
minutes

115
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:25,169
this is what I'm doing I'm using this

116
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,120
awesome tool frankly called beautiful AI

117
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:30,120
it only loads in Chrome because

118
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,449
apparently Firefox isn't a modern

119
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,900
browser but guess what loads on

120
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:39,169
HughesNet so kudos to those guys and as

121
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,520
I'm waiting for my stock imagery to load

122
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:43,289
this is the kind of stuff I'm doing I'm

123
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,690
looking at the JavaScript that's going

124
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:45,969
on

125
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,770
and the things that I used to do hey I'm

126
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,950
looking for malicious stuff there so I'm

127
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:52,719
like oh that that string looks like a 64

128
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,190
encoding or not encoding or that's a

129
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,280
hash or that's whatever and it's like

130
00:05:54,190 --> 00:06:00,250
kind of this squirrel ad D mentality

131
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,080
because when you fight fires for like 15

132
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,970
years you get dropped into different

133
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,310
situations but it's almost instinct to

134
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:08,350
do this stuff but later what am I gonna

135
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:10,360
do well have you ever dug through like

136
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:13,450
your old screen capture folders

137
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:18,250
that's a selfie of me and V are like Oh

138
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:19,840
like five years ago or something so but

139
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,580
I do have some kind of audience so if

140
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,380
you're sitting here homing like I kind

141
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,729
of get what this guy's talking about I'm

142
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:29,620
there's dozens of us and you know this

143
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,780
this came up on the tweet and I'm like

144
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,340
whole language makes us gods and I'm

145
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,380
worried always worried about getting

146
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,869
taken out of context to the point where

147
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:39,400
I do markups and disclaimers and all

148
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,040
that kind of stuff but sometimes you

149
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,620
just got to speak your mind on things

150
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:49,330
and you have the audience I guess is the

151
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:51,130
point making its 3.2 million subscribers

152
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,950
to miter is that what that number means

153
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:55,960
it's not PewDiePie numbers but you know

154
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:59,409
maybe they could hire PewDiePie I don't

155
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:01,630
know so what is the point of my talk

156
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:03,250
really what is this any of this have to

157
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:06,159
do with attack well I'm using the

158
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:08,440
Chewbacca defense I'm saying like hey

159
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,390
things are complicated therefore it's

160
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,460
not my fault that things are going wrong

161
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:16,599
have you ever seen that episode I mean

162
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:18,820
I'm sorry but really that that's the

163
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,880
kind of thing that happens to you over

164
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,110
time as a super technical

165
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:27,250
self-proclaimed technical fire fighter

166
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:29,200
is you you make excuses it's people talk

167
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:31,540
about cognitive bias it's a kind of

168
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,219
cognitive bias you see yourself as

169
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:36,310
something else and you say it's not my

170
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:38,830
fault because things are complicated for

171
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:41,620
really though what's the point well when

172
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:44,440
you asked me about my derp attack charts

173
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:47,710
and cyber heat maps and things this is a

174
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:50,110
new it's not like if you want to pay me

175
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:52,150
money my motivation is going to like

176
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:55,249
that thing up green I'm going to do it

177
00:07:52,150 --> 00:08:00,589
even if I trick myself into doing it

178
00:07:55,249 --> 00:08:02,329
to do it and so here I've regularly just

179
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:05,299
Google stuff to see what it means to

180
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:07,429
regular people I mean that's like a

181
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:09,349
really powerful tool to be honest try

182
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:13,909
the Wayback Machine sometimes for some

183
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:17,659
perspective so I googled like

184
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:19,188
cybersecurity heat map this is what came

185
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:21,438
up I don't think it has anything to do

186
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:24,949
with attack the bottom one is a blog

187
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:27,799
post from 2010 defending the risk matrix

188
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:31,029
I mean so this isn't a new conversation

189
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:34,129
that I'm having people spend forever so

190
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:34,938
again what this is how people think of

191
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:37,938
algorithms

192
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:40,968
I looked up algorithm on stock photo

193
00:08:37,938 --> 00:08:42,139
which is awesome but this is what comes

194
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:45,470
up people still think about the matrix

195
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:48,559
that movie came out in 1999 I mean I

196
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:51,620
think of algorithms completely

197
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:54,379
differently than you might is my point

198
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:57,740
so maybe try role-playing as a character

199
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:59,480
of roll a dice and say you know critical

200
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,370
strike I hate you with this technique

201
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,160
what does that mean to you communicate

202
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:05,990
with people don't be afraid to ride a

203
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,420
unicorn every once in a while and talk

204
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,740
about stupid things at ten minutes to

205
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,920
convince you I don't even know what my

206
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:18,259
time is probably my way ahead or way

207
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:20,839
behind I'm Way ahead okay so what

208
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:23,300
changed in my life to give me these

209
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,449
perspectives and things like that and a

210
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:29,089
lot of it to me personally this doesn't

211
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:32,359
apply to everybody is just listening to

212
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:36,019
like audible I started doing that on my

213
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,250
commute years ago it's been five six

214
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:38,480
years and you're like what it's been

215
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,439
five six years and you look at your

216
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,870
library you're like holy crap I've read

217
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:47,059
204 I don't even know cuz the pages it's

218
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:49,160
like 15 at a time and have like 20 pages

219
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:50,990
or something like that it's not to brag

220
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,329
about how many books I've read that's

221
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:55,430
really not the point and I'm sorry for

222
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:58,628
some people I don't read it I listen to

223
00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:00,979
it some people do get upset about that

224
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:04,579
but these are the kinds of people who

225
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:07,100
answer questions that I have so if

226
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:08,140
you're having these questions about what

227
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,710
do I do to commute

228
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:13,900
Kate how do I apply the attack framework

229
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:18,000
don't go into an existential crisis and

230
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:21,550
start blabbering on stage with a wig on

231
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,480
just that's what you'll end up doing you

232
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,270
know these guys

233
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:29,020
it's cult science I guess which is super

234
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:31,210
condescending sorry um but really Judea

235
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,550
pearl if you don't know who Judea pearl

236
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:38,140
is anybody know who he is

237
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:40,870
show of hands no no yes Bayesian

238
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:44,020
networks just googled it okay cool I

239
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:47,700
mean like hey I got my PhD and that was

240
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:51,520
me my other PhD is from Stack Overflow

241
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:54,070
so Judea parole is an awesome guy

242
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:57,250
they've coined always credited with

243
00:10:54,070 --> 00:11:00,130
coining the term a Bayesian network so

244
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,900
when he writes a book I read it you know

245
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,910
just see what the guys doing is a

246
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,790
Holocaust survivor still doing this

247
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:10,839
stuff that like ninety or something I'll

248
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:14,530
be in the farm but um so Bayes vs.

249
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:16,570
Fisher the I often have looked at heat

250
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:19,540
maps and charts and metrics and I'm like

251
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:21,400
why don't I like this well people had

252
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,849
this argument look at the history of

253
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,350
tobacco big tobacco arguments and how

254
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,270
that whole thing in the United States

255
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,850
sorry other than international audience

256
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:34,449
Sir Ronald Fisher I'm not dogging him

257
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:36,100
he's a genius or was but you know

258
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:41,050
Reverend Thomas Bayes goes back to the

259
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:44,530
sixteen hundreds Google my uncle quick

260
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:46,810
please Jordan elenberg also fantastic

261
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:50,230
book so what is my point my point is

262
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:53,260
like seek perspective outside of just

263
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:56,320
our niche industry people like to say

264
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:59,410
InfoSec cyber security security i don't

265
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,210
say security cyber security but really

266
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,189
it's information theory there's

267
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:05,380
mathematics behind these things I'm not

268
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:08,830
the guy to teach you the math I'm really

269
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:11,640
not but maybe if you talk to me about

270
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:15,040
your ideas in a way that it's accessible

271
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:17,830
then we can come to like a system that

272
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,890
works because the ODA loop thing is real

273
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,640
and if you don't believe me go through

274
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,760
boot camp

275
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:27,220
and then when you get out ask people

276
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,649
like what are you willing to do for your

277
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:32,709
country right now or train a horse or

278
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:34,570
something like that perspective got to

279
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:37,829
put yourself in those places please join

280
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,829
me in thanking James the rude
