1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,130
- [Host] Please join me in
welcoming Philippe and Joshua.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,220
- [Philippe] Thank you so much.

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,092
- [Joshua] Thank you.

4
00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:07,330
(audience applauds)

5
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,570
- [Philippe] All Right.

6
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,000
So, I am formerly from CIS.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,070
Josh is from--

8
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:14,200
- [Josh] Current CIS.

9
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,033
- Yep.

10
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:16,810
And when choosing a presentation,

11
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,560
don't include your previous
employer in the title

12
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,747
when you're presenting.

13
00:00:20,748 --> 00:00:23,700
But I want to, obviously, give
a big thanks to Verizon, CIS

14
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,840
for letting me do this presentation.

15
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,030
This is something I've worked pretty

16
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,260
extensively on my time at CIS.

17
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,710
So this is probably less a
presentation, more of a journey,

18
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,320
so let's go together.

19
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,833
- Sounds so philosophical, man.

20
00:00:37,528 --> 00:00:38,433
Yeah, so my name is Joshua Franklin.

21
00:00:39,476 --> 00:00:41,940
I am the product owner
of the CIS Controls.

22
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,989
I did 10 years in the federal government,

23
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,480
most of it at NIST.

24
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,819
If you have your favorite NIST standard,

25
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,770
I probably wrote that.

26
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,189
If you have your least favorite,
I didn't write that one.

27
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:52,022
(audience laughing)

28
00:00:52,022 --> 00:00:52,855
Definitely, definitely.

29
00:00:52,855 --> 00:00:55,900
I did a lot of telecom work.

30
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,830
Also worked on Mobile ATT&CK, so,

31
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,236
that one's super important.

32
00:01:01,237 --> 00:01:04,730
And my voice is so low that
I'm causing this rumbling.

33
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,810
Yeah, yeah.

34
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,480
I'm a Cyber Security Standards guy.

35
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,630
- All right, as mentioned,

36
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,720
I'm currently a Verizon DBIR co-author.

37
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,310
Which is weird 'cause I haven't authored

38
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,700
anything since I started in September

39
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,810
but I'm gonna keep riding
that as long as I can.

40
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,360
I was previously at CIS.

41
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,748
I was a product owner for the controls

42
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:24,170
and I also did a lot in
terms of doing assessments

43
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,400
for helping organizations
understand their security posture.

44
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,870
And if the paper bag is
wet, I can maybe code myself

45
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,980
out of it.

46
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,460
So, while working at CIS, one of the kind

47
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,710
of persistent problems that we've seen

48
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,940
is what we like to call
the Defender's Dilemma.

49
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,990
So, I don't know, who here
does threat intelligence

50
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,360
as kinda their primary job function?

51
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,340
All right, who's here
as kind of, you know,

52
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,830
threat intelligence
defender, everything else?

53
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,800
Yeah, right, so, as a defender,

54
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,090
there's a lot of
complexity to the problem.

55
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,350
The biggest problem is really

56
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,580
how do I know what the
right thing to do is?

57
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,413
Right?

58
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:02,100
There's a million different options.

59
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,320
NIST 853 provides close to a million-ish.

60
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,803
- [Josh] Yeah, something like that.

61
00:02:07,803 --> 00:02:08,636
- Right, there's a lot
of different options

62
00:02:08,636 --> 00:02:09,630
and there's a lot of
different possibilities

63
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,590
and a lot of different things you can do.

64
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,560
The next part of the problem
is how do I actually do it?

65
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,020
How do I convert this into
something that's actionable,

66
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,590
something I can actually
do in my environment?

67
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,970
And then how do I demonstrate to others

68
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,320
I've done the right thing?

69
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,750
'Cause you may figure it out for yourself

70
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,160
but you have internal stakeholders

71
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,760
that need to have confidence in you.

72
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,390
You also have external stakeholders,

73
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,980
that need to have confidence in you.

74
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,899
So that's really kind of
what CIS is really surrounded

75
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,920
and kind of focused on, is addressing

76
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,123
these type of questions.

77
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,900
- So yeah, who is CIS?

78
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,130
You know, we are a non-profit,

79
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,329
based out of Albany, New York.

80
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,520
Basically we have both an operations side

81
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,723
and a best practices slash policy side.

82
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,403
Yeah, next slide here.

83
00:02:56,403 --> 00:02:59,989
A lot of folks know us
because operationally,

84
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,670
we actually run the MS-ISAC or Multi-State

85
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,780
Information Sharing and Analysis Center.

86
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,417
Basically have a whole bunch of sensors

87
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:11,200
and a lot of state and
local government networks,

88
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,589
that we basically let them
know if they've been popped.

89
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,423
Right?

90
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,090
Next slide.

91
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,090
On the Operations Security
Best Practices side,

92
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,620
we have both the Benchmarks,
and the CIS Controls.

93
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,480
In terms of Benchmarks basically
pick your favorite tech

94
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,179
and we probably have some
sort of cyber security,

95
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,520
super, hyper detailed guidance
for how to configure it.

96
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,330
I like to say they're sort of like Stigs

97
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,400
but they don't break stuff as much.

98
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,810
This isn't going out anywhere, right?

99
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,150
Anyway and then the CIS Controls,

100
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:55,103
that's where Phil used to
work and I currently work.

101
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,096
Cool, so the actual CIS
Controls came from NSA,

102
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,810
the whole DOD side of things.

103
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,150
And most folks here
probably, actually know

104
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,010
the CIS Controls better
as the SANS Top 20.

105
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,019
I actually said the SANS Top 20

106
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,550
in my interview at CIS, for this position.

107
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,143
Not the best thing to do.

108
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,793
But yeah.

109
00:04:21,793 --> 00:04:26,400
Nowadays they are referred
to as the CIS Controls.

110
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,830
So as you can expect there are 20 of them.

111
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,450
Here's what they look like.

112
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:38,820
This isn't really a master
class in the Top 20.

113
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,610
Some of the larger things

114
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,410
I'll sort of point out here,

115
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,800
is with most Controls frameworks

116
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,363
there's basically identify
what's in your network first.

117
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,370
What's on the left is some
of the more basic things

118
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,840
and then it gets typically
more and more difficult.

119
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,409
All the way to the right, on
the furthest right side there,

120
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,850
you actually have the
Organizational Controls,

121
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,630
which are a little more squishy.

122
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,383
Kinda like harping back
to the last presentation.

123
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,630
We have the Implementation Groups,

124
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,190
which is our new jam.

125
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:17,780
Basically taking all of
the 171 CIS sub-controls

126
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,510
and splitting them into
basically low, medium, and hard.

127
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,200
We are basically preaching that everyone,

128
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,030
at the very least, should
be implementing IG1,

129
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,729
Implementation Group one.

130
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,160
That's what we are defining
as basic cyber hygiene.

131
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,610
A lot of folks use that word and they all

132
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,530
mean different things.

133
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:41,400
So this is what we think
basic cyber hygiene means.

134
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,539
- So in terms of creating best practices,

135
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,340
there's really kind of a spectrum, right?

136
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,039
Right now, we are still
in the early phases

137
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,910
of developing a best practices community.

138
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,970
CIS Controls is community built,

139
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,015
has a lot of really smart
people that work behind it,

140
00:05:56,015 --> 00:05:58,360
we like to call them the
five schmucks in the room.

141
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,210
That's where it starts.

142
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,400
That's where you bring smart
people together in your team

143
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,729
and you say, "What do
I need to be doing?".

144
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,260
How do we get started?

145
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,200
And as we grow as an industry,

146
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,670
we have to start looking
at how can we find

147
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,223
data to support our position?

148
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,880
How do we know what the are
actual shifts and changes

149
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,240
in the trends, in terms of
what adversaries are doing?

150
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,010
And this is kind of a
bit of a complex problem.

151
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,210
Especially as we scale.

152
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,250
We still bring in our biases.

153
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:30,743
We still have inherent biases
in terms of what's going on.

154
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,440
But that's not necessarily what
the data's gonna be showing.

155
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,450
So what we want to do is move us towards

156
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,460
a data driven model for Controls.

157
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,070
And that's where we wanna
go and start looking

158
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,170
actually at testing.

159
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,250
Creating hypothesis.

160
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,150
Does this recommendation actually prevent

161
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,060
what we're claiming it prevents?

162
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,360
So what that kind of brought
us to are pre-attacks.

163
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,120
So we've taken a couple
stabs at this initiative.

164
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,330
Let's start looking at
how can we really get

165
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,500
a good understanding for what's
happening for adversaries.

166
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,410
The first one we created
was released in 2016.

167
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,010
It utilized a Kill Chain of a Cyber Notion

168
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:11,980
and also the NIST Cyber
Security framework.

169
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,090
It was really about helping organizations

170
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,000
kind of understand those trade offs.

171
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,570
What's the right thing to do and how much

172
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,250
do I need to do it?

173
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,380
And as a community we can
also do this together.

174
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,340
We don't have to figure it out on our own.

175
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,729
We can actually collaborate
on an initiative.

176
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,330
So the especially 'cause
not every organization

177
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,460
has access to the brain
power in this room.

178
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,969
We are very fortunate.

179
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,683
We are very specialized people.

180
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,030
At the end of the day
that's not the access

181
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,869
most organizations have.

182
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,010
So we're trying to look at this

183
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,610
from an industry perspective.

184
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,450
How can we benefit everyone?

185
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,650
So if we can start
understanding what the general

186
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,210
trends are, maybe we can
start helping organizations

187
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,233
make those decisions without
having to have large staff.

188
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,360
So this is what it looks like.

189
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,190
Our version one.

190
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,200
As you can tell, it's
got a Kill Chain-like

191
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,780
style, phase in the very top.

192
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,320
And then you have the NIST Cyber Security

193
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,540
security functions.

194
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,820
So that a control really
will do one of five things

195
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,110
it's gonna help you detect, protect,

196
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,140
respond, recover, and identify.

197
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,940
This was obviously our first cut.

198
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,110
It was kind of an ongoing process.

199
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,120
And from there we identified
what do the controls

200
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,650
do at different steps in the process?

201
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,159
So that, if maybe you can't implement

202
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,760
application white listing
there might be an alternative

203
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,659
control that can help either
in front of the process

204
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,589
or later on in the process.

205
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,560
So it's all about making
these educated decisions

206
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,923
in terms of what the overall
control selection is.

207
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,500
However there's limitations to that

208
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,300
and that is not every attack
will follow that pattern.

209
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,240
So when I joined the team,
let's look at literature.

210
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,240
What's everyone writing about?

211
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,960
What are they seeing
in terms of the trends?

212
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,704
'Cause there's really great resources.

213
00:08:59,704 --> 00:09:01,969
Some from Verizon, obviously.

214
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,830
Then other fire.

215
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,210
So there's a lot of resources out there.

216
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,470
So how can we go and make sense of this?

217
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,470
So for six months I went
through every single report.

218
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,510
And codified every single finding.

219
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,610
- [Joshua] Super fun?

220
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,443
- Super fun.

221
00:09:17,443 --> 00:09:18,420
- [Joshua] Super fun.

222
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,535
- Oh yeah, it was super fun.

223
00:09:19,535 --> 00:09:20,367
(chuckling)

224
00:09:20,368 --> 00:09:21,201
Yeah yeah, and it takes a
large amount of resources,

225
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:23,034
But that's also ultimately how you can

226
00:09:23,034 --> 00:09:24,670
really leverage these things.

227
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,910
But it's not really scalable.

228
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:30,719
Reviewing is very time consuming.

229
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,060
Some of these reports tend to be a little

230
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,410
bit marketing focused.

231
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,242
Which is fine.

232
00:09:34,243 --> 00:09:35,773
This is a marketing tool.

233
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:38,290
And sometimes it's difficult
to be understanding

234
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,939
of the underlying data.

235
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,980
Every organization has a different
view of the same problem.

236
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,774
So how do we actually go and make sense

237
00:09:46,774 --> 00:09:48,870
of all these different views?

238
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,460
And then how can we really leverage them?

239
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,677
So thankfully ATT&CK came along.

240
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:58,757
And helped us get a better understanding

241
00:09:58,757 --> 00:10:01,290
as to what's going on.

242
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,443
So we can start looking at this,

243
00:10:02,443 --> 00:10:05,090
looking at ATT&CK as a standard language

244
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,640
for what adversaries are doing.

245
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,790
It's been evolving over time.

246
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,380
Mitigations were, I
think, actually a very big

247
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,189
improvement in that evolution.

248
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,760
'Cause now we can start
looking at very tangible

249
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,340
objects within the framework.

250
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,250
It's not this thing that we
have to pull out from the text.

251
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,120
We can start looking at it.

252
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,520
We can start tying it
back to the controls.

253
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,460
Which will help us at least understand

254
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,527
what's the relationship
between mitigations

255
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:33,023
and the controls we recommend to MITRE.

256
00:10:35,008 --> 00:10:37,690
This is obviously a giant I-chart.

257
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,790
But this is just to prove that we did it.

258
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,310
We'll be releasing this publicly

259
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,729
probably in the next few weeks.

260
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,563
- [Joshua] Couple months.

261
00:10:43,563 --> 00:10:44,524
- [Phillip] Couple months.

262
00:10:44,524 --> 00:10:45,357
(Joshua laughs)

263
00:10:45,357 --> 00:10:46,189
Few weeks, tomorrow.

264
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,023
- [Joshua] Totally talked
about that beforehand.

265
00:10:47,023 --> 00:10:49,543
- [Phillip] Ask Josh, he'll
give it to you in a Pen Drive.

266
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:54,310
But the idea is we can
tie back our content.

267
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,609
We can start looking at we've
said prioritization matters.

268
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,360
And this is the first six controls.

269
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,610
As it ties back to mitigations

270
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:07,610
and as those mitigations
tie back to the techniques.

271
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,060
However there's still limitations to this.

272
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,449
It doesn't really tell us where to start.

273
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,860
We're assuming that our
prioritization scheme is correct.

274
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,360
Maybe it is.

275
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,283
Maybe it isn't.

276
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,630
So what we wanna do is a second version

277
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,640
of the community ATT&CK model.

278
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,730
You tell me when I'm
supposed to transition over.

279
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,080
It's the next slide?
- I mean, yeah.

280
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,160
- We'll roll with it.

281
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,260
- So we're re-amping the
community ATT&CK model.

282
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,660
We want it to be really founded in MITRE.

283
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,740
'Cause it provides a
standardized language.

284
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,960
We can all tie into it.

285
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,508
There was a whole conference about it.

286
00:11:40,508 --> 00:11:42,020
I feel like it was a good
way to sneak in here,

287
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,198
and talk about this.

288
00:11:43,198 --> 00:11:44,031
(Joshua laughs)

289
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:45,074
Supposed to tie into ATT&CK,

290
00:11:45,075 --> 00:11:48,940
but it also helps us really
kind of talk the same language.

291
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,380
So what we've done is... oh okay.

292
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,213
- [Joshua] Timer.

293
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,045
- [Phillip] Timer is finally up to date.

294
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:54,879
- [Josh] Cool.

295
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,968
- It was the longest minute in the world.

296
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:59,038
(both chuckling)

297
00:11:59,038 --> 00:12:00,930
What the community
ATT&CK model's gonna be,

298
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,510
is gonna be understanding
of what are the most

299
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,920
common things happening.

300
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,110
What are the techniques that are involved

301
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,840
with those common occurrences?

302
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,920
And what are the controls?

303
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,890
So that as we are moving and progressing

304
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:14,263
you know the (mumbles)
controls is an evolving thing.

305
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,120
We're on version seven right now.

306
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,350
Josh is tomorrow writing version eight,

307
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,503
after he updates and
publishes the mappings.

308
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,961
But next year he'll be
working on the next iteration.

309
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:26,794
- We will be.

310
00:12:26,794 --> 00:12:28,197
- So how can you start using the data

311
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:30,610
and our understanding of what's happening

312
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,380
in the industry to inform us?

313
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,212
Part of that we obviously have
to tie our contents together.

314
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,720
Which we've done.

315
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,720
So we have a mapping of the
controls, to the techniques,

316
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,947
and the controls to the mitigations.

317
00:12:42,947 --> 00:12:44,480
The next thing we really wanna do is start

318
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,180
looking at the data.

319
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,420
What are the techniques
that are most commonly used

320
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,420
and fortunately, actually
that's the next one,

321
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,849
so there's different
ways in which we can look

322
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,083
at prioritization.

323
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,980
So obviously I wanted to be an artist

324
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,340
but this is initially where you can

325
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,750
start looking at the MITRE data.

326
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,970
I think it warrants a
little bit more insight

327
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,690
than I have done but if
you can look at MITRE

328
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,770
ATT&CK as a graph there's
a lot of really neat things

329
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:11,603
you can start looking at.

330
00:13:11,603 --> 00:13:15,099
So what are the most
commonly used techniques.

331
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,550
But the thing is there's also
issues with this approach.

332
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,790
It's limiting.

333
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,589
There's very much a focus on APTs

334
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,630
'cause each citation largely tends

335
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,783
to be different APT
groups or different tools.

336
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,953
That's not what's hurting most people.

337
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,290
There's very much a focus in terms of that

338
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,450
but it's a starting point.

339
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,080
I actually have the data in graph format,

340
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,490
if anyone's ever interested.

341
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,323
Talk to me.

342
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,252
I'll post it on Twitter,
whatever, and get it out there.

343
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,223
- Yeah, so, as we said,
data's very important.

344
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:56,750
Through the MSI Sec, our operational arm,

345
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,639
we have lots and lots of
data with basically sensors

346
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,308
in a lot of the state and local counties.

347
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:06,360
And we're basically able
to leverage that data

348
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,260
to see if the controls
that we're recommending

349
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,363
make a lot of sense.

350
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,360
And so here are the, this
is the Top 10 malware

351
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,933
that the MSI Sec is recording.

352
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,710
This information basically
gets posted on our blog

353
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,653
every once and a while.

354
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,240
We could say maybe we
want the CIS Controls

355
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,480
to actually mitigate these
Top 10 pieces of malware.

356
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,233
And if we want that, how do
we really check that out?

357
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,963
So if you sort of overlay all of the,

358
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:45,809
at least six of these ATT&CK
matrices over one another,

359
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:50,480
we basically want to make
sure that we have a control

360
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,980
that basically mitigates
each of these techniques.

361
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,360
And so that's something that we're really

362
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,380
going to be thinking is one
of the most important outputs

363
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:04,693
for the community attack model.

364
00:15:06,983 --> 00:15:11,983
We have 20 controls but we
actually have 171 sub-controls.

365
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,823
A lot of these sub-controls
have just kinda

366
00:15:17,823 --> 00:15:21,949
made their way into the
CIS Controls over time

367
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:26,120
and sometimes it sort of
feels like techno-mancy

368
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,724
just a mixture of magic and tech.

369
00:15:28,724 --> 00:15:31,220
They're just there
because some smart person

370
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,020
a long time ago said that.

371
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,900
It should really be there.

372
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:39,560
So we basically want to
figure out which ATT&CK paths

373
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,810
we want the CIS Controls
to mitigate against.

374
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,280
And it's more than just
the Top 10 malware.

375
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,100
There's phishing but also
accidental incidents,

376
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,020
those sorts of things.

377
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:57,020
And so we're basically going
to be defining the Top X

378
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:01,410
ATT&CK paths inside of the
community ATT&CK model,

379
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,620
that the CIS Controls are
going to defend against.

380
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,650
- [Phillip] Yeah and the
concept of the ATT&CK paths

381
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,910
is really looking at
the sequence of events.

382
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,140
I think we have a tendency of looking

383
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,740
at some of these things
as individual moments

384
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,180
but there's really a series.

385
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,260
There's a sequence of things that occurs.

386
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,120
And part of that, there's
also preconditions

387
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,060
for those things to occur.

388
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,010
So as we're starting to look through,

389
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:26,480
understanding okay,
this technique requires

390
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,460
administrative privileges, all right,

391
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,000
it requires system level access

392
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,090
or it requires such and such.

393
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:34,918
Well what's the thing that happened prior

394
00:16:34,918 --> 00:16:39,040
to that for them to get
that level of access?

395
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,069
So if we start understanding
what's the sequence

396
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,470
because we can't defend
against all the techniques

397
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,840
but there's probably a
handful of techniques

398
00:16:47,818 --> 00:16:48,890
that are more commonly used and abused

399
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,630
because they're effectively.

400
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,730
But we all know that, and
I think as a community

401
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,530
that's what we want to move towards,

402
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,060
is really understanding what
are the most common techniques?

403
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,823
What should everyone really
be defending against?

404
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,729
And also what the
controls would be looking

405
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,930
to do as part of the
community ATT&CK model.

406
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:11,859
- Yeah, so we are basically
going to be embarking

407
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:15,129
on this whole journey of
figuring out what these top

408
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,322
ATT&CK paths are.

409
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:22,690
There's a bunch of different
ways that we can be doing this.

410
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:25,317
What were the largest breaches ever?

411
00:17:25,317 --> 00:17:28,450
Maybe it was based on the criticality

412
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:32,233
of the assets that were affected.

413
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,459
Did these breaches cost
a whole bunch of money?

414
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:40,330
Did Brian Krebs blog
about it way too much?

415
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,860
I mean there's a whole
bunch of different criteria

416
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,889
that we can use for basically inclusion

417
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,270
of these ATT&CK paths.

418
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,810
To sort of take a small bite of that,

419
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,159
since Phil's here, there's
a really nice Verizon

420
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,870
report out there that basically says 20%,

421
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,939
sorry 28%, I can number.

422
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,570
Of all breaches can be
attributed to malware,

423
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:10,570
about 30% of those breaches can
be attributed to ransomware.

424
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,200
So let's take a quick look at this

425
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,143
and see how we would use ATT&CK here.

426
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,833
Well here's WannaCry.

427
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,290
So it does a whole bunch
of different things

428
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,540
but what's the really important thing

429
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,750
that actually makes it ransomware?

430
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:33,750
And we can see data encrypted for impact,

431
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,640
highlighted in the top right
and then inhibit system

432
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,000
recovery in the bottom right.

433
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,903
Next slide.

434
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,840
For the NotPetya we just see
the actual data encrypted

435
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,870
and so at the very least
we want to make sure

436
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,949
that we have a CIS Control
that basically mitigates

437
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:58,090
that and we have some sort
of authoritative data source

438
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:02,209
that's justifying that
sub-control's existence.

439
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:06,440
I would like to point out that
there is ransomware on mobile

440
00:19:09,818 --> 00:19:12,360
and they have an encrypt
files impact there

441
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,689
but the same type thing is
not inside a Mobile ATT&CK.

442
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,980
I'm just drawing y'all's eyes to the fact

443
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,850
that Mobile ATT&CK is out there.

444
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,929
Okay, folks, don't forget.

445
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,490
Okay it's really important.

446
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,323
Okay.

447
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,603
Next slide.

448
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:27,436
Cool!

449
00:19:27,436 --> 00:19:31,490
So we've already seen
some of the tech patterns

450
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,960
that we're really interested in here.

451
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,523
So MITRE has two mitigations,

452
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,670
associated to the Data
Encrypted for Impact technique.

453
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:48,670
We have five sub-controls
that could potentially

454
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,687
help out here but specifically
only 10.1 and 10.5

455
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,963
actually mitigate this
individual ATT&CK pattern.

456
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,187
The big question here next is do we need

457
00:20:02,187 --> 00:20:05,229
sub-controls two, three, and four?

458
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,010
And it's worth taking a step back

459
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,720
and going through this big exercise,

460
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,240
and we're basically going to be using

461
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,743
ATT&CK to really do that.

462
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:20,129
- So this is what we try
to do in terms of CIS

463
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,480
is find a way to bridge
your operations and policy,

464
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,010
and do it at scale,

465
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,190
'cause at the end of the day

466
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:28,800
we want to make sure
that our recommendations

467
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,300
or CIS Controls, or Benchmarks

468
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,770
can tie back to something
that's consistent.

469
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,600
So this is kind of our pipe dream,

470
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,560
is having a community ATT&CK model,

471
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,550
obviously powered by ATT&CK,

472
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,570
be that translation point.

473
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,540
Where the SOC and Incident Response

474
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,408
can either codify or tie their data

475
00:20:46,408 --> 00:20:49,919
and tell us how trends are
changing in these patterns.

476
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,580
There's a finite number of patterns.

477
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,240
There isn't gonna be 266 patterns.

478
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,760
There's probably only
gonna be a handful of them.

479
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,250
We don't know that yet 'cause we're still

480
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,560
in this very early phases.

481
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,350
But I think that's what
we need to move towards,

482
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,540
is really understanding

483
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,980
what are the things
that are most in common

484
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,263
and how can we start as a
community address them together?

485
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,932
Next steps Josh.

486
00:21:13,932 --> 00:21:17,630
- We are going to be developing

487
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:21,950
the CIS community ATT&CK model.

488
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,590
We are looking to basically get it out

489
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,809
some time later this
year or early next year.

490
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:29,170
I don't think Phil knew that.

491
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,363
That's not his fault.

492
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,199
We are looking for folks to contribute.

493
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,810
So if you have data,

494
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:37,710
if you have a lot

495
00:21:40,137 --> 00:21:42,889
of knowledge and
specialization in this area,

496
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,420
if you just like to talk loudly,

497
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,213
we want folks to basically chip in.

498
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:52,263
This is a community driven standard.

499
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:59,550
Reach out to us at
controlsinfo@cisecurity.org

500
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,523
- [Phillip] Or workbench

501
00:22:01,523 --> 00:22:04,226
which is where we do all
our community activities.

502
00:22:04,226 --> 00:22:05,780
- I'll get ya hooked up into workbench.

503
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,206
Yeah yeah yeah.

504
00:22:07,207 --> 00:22:08,040
- So that's it.

505
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,277
It looks like we have a few
green seconds here for--

506
00:22:10,277 --> 00:22:14,030
- We had 45 minutes worth of
content that we got in to.

507
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,116
- 30.

508
00:22:15,116 --> 00:22:15,949
- Yeah.

509
00:22:15,949 --> 00:22:16,782
This is awesome.

510
00:22:16,782 --> 00:22:17,615
It's awesome.

511
00:22:17,615 --> 00:22:18,448
- All right so questions?

512
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,356
- You guys are so loud I can yeah

513
00:22:23,356 --> 00:22:24,543
oh my god.

514
00:22:26,415 --> 00:22:27,248
Oh my god.

515
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:30,403
- I have one.

516
00:22:30,403 --> 00:22:34,280
So thinking about so
often these communities

517
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,740
of people who do the day
to day threat defense

518
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,470
and threat intel and network defense

519
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,550
are often separate from
the controls folks.

520
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,383
What have you seen there?

521
00:22:42,383 --> 00:22:43,216
What can you comment on

522
00:22:43,216 --> 00:22:44,479
and how do you think the rest of us

523
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,760
can help you all bridge those?

524
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,660
I mean, that's why we
wanted to have you here

525
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,610
but anything you can comment on for that?

526
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,173
- That's a really good point.

527
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:57,048
They are definitely two
separate communities.

528
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,170
It's events like this that basically

529
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:03,643
brings both halves together.

530
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,990
I would say in the actual best
practices and standard side

531
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,020
we need this community's
help to basically make sure

532
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:17,210
that everyone is able
to leverage these free,

533
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:20,823
large, open controls framework.

534
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,323
It really,

535
00:23:23,323 --> 00:23:25,227
things won't get better
unless we all pitch in.

536
00:23:25,227 --> 00:23:27,490
- And to build off of what Josh is saying,

537
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,080
the problem is complex.

538
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,129
Cyber Security's complex.

539
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,910
Otherwise we wouldn't have jobs.

540
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,870
It touches a lot of
different fields as well.

541
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,760
The more we can speak
a standardized language

542
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,593
the better it is.

543
00:23:39,593 --> 00:23:42,298
However you talk to
legal, or you talk to risk

544
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:45,376
and you start talking about
individual techniques,

545
00:23:45,376 --> 00:23:47,629
that's not always going to translate.

546
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,870
But I think if we start
looking at an abstraction

547
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,209
and start talking about patterns

548
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:54,258
and I think a lot of
different speakers (mumbles)

549
00:23:54,258 --> 00:23:55,600
did a phenomenal job about
kind of doing that extraction.

550
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,540
What are the things we're
actually concerned about?

551
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,540
That's what's key and
I think as a community

552
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,610
we can come together and really figure out

553
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,459
what are the things
that we can extract out.

554
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,080
So from a threat intelligence,

555
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,129
obviously tracking APTs
is a big part of your job.

556
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,180
However that's not the only
thing that's impacting people.

557
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,200
I think if we can start looking
at the different languages

558
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,690
and start looking at
kind of we standardized,

559
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,300
we'll be in a much better position.

560
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,543
- [Host] Thank you so
much, Phillip and Joshua.

561
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,171
(audience applauds)
