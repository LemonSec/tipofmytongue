1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,816
- [Katie] Please join me
in welcoming, Mike Long.

2
00:00:03,816 --> 00:00:06,816
(audience clapping)

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,570
- All right so we'll go
ahead and get started.

4
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,660
First, Katie thank you very
much for the warm introduction.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,890
For everybody else, I'm very
humbled and grateful to be here

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,400
and share this information with you.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,959
So today, I'm going to be
sharing with you an update

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,790
on one of the many projects

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,740
the ATT&CK team is actively
working on and supporting.

10
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,099
And this involves mapping various

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,420
information security control frameworks

12
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,860
to attack techniques and behaviors.

13
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,050
So as we go forward with this talk,

14
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,430
we'll start by providing an
overview of this project.

15
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,240
We'll talk about some of
the specific challenges

16
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,740
that we're trying to address.

17
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,150
We'll share some of the prototypes

18
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,350
we've created along the way.

19
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,800
And finally we'll close by showing you

20
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,570
some of our future goals and plans,

21
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,420
basically showing how we want this project

22
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,540
to go going forward.

23
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,960
By the way, as I look at the
clock it's not lost on me that

24
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,040
I'm the last thing standing
between you and a great lunch,

25
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,890
so, I'll be sure to keep this moving.

26
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,940
So fundamentally, what kicked
this off is the fact that

27
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,899
many of the organizations
we support are required,

28
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,660
either by policy, law, best practice,

29
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,600
they're required to select and implement

30
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,619
information security controls

31
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,670
documented in various publications.

32
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,480
We have NIST SP 800-53, commonly in use

33
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,520
by the government.

34
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,240
PCI-DSS, commonly used by private sector.

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,770
And of course our CIS controls.

36
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,030
So we've got all these different controls,

37
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,160
they provide varying levels of guidance.

38
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,440
One of the commonalities across them

39
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,370
is basically the mindset that,
when we're picking controls,

40
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,730
and we're deciding how to
configure and implement them,

41
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,560
those decisions should
really be driven by knowledge

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,420
of the threats that are actively
targeting our organizations

43
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,310
and the vulnerabilities found within.

44
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,910
So as we go forward, we'll
talk about some examples

45
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,479
where ATT&CK can help.

46
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,890
But despite this, we find
that many organizations

47
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,310
still experience similar challenges.

48
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,100
When you look at all these
different frameworks,

49
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,780
some of them are just vast in scope.

50
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,500
If you look at NIST
800-53, when you expand

51
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,360
all of the controls, the implementations,

52
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,820
the enhancements, you're left
with thousands of controls.

53
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,869
And so it's very easy for
people in that situation to ask,

54
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,323
which control should I select, and why?

55
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,000
On the worst end of the
spectrum, I've actually seen

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,390
organizations that just elect
for the brute force approach

57
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,730
and they select all of
them so, on the one hand,

58
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,010
they're fortified, but at what cost?

59
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,840
We have other organizations
that have been dealing

60
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,370
with these controls long
before ATT&CK existed and,

61
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,830
in many cases, they're wondering,
how do we better integrate

62
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,400
ATT&CK into our existing control
processes and technologies?

63
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
So, these are some problems
that we've been focusing on

64
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,321
for a little while and, we've
actually talked to a lot of

65
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:39,390
organizations that are
kinda taking the initiative,

66
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,059
and they're currently making their own

67
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,000
ATT&CK control mappings.

68
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,530
And a little bit later, we'll
show you some of the cool

69
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,610
use cases you can derive
from these mappings.

70
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,160
But really the question for
us as the ATT&CK team is,

71
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,640
how could we help centralize
and curate these mappings

72
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,209
so that we can make them available

73
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,940
to the global cyber security community?

74
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,000
So that's really the
premise behind this project

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,900
and as we go forward, we'll
show you some of the different

76
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,120
prototype mappings we've
made along the way.

77
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,120
We'll talk about some of the
challenges we've encountered,

78
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,020
and how we hope to address
those challenges going forward.

79
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,980
So I'll start by showing
an example mapping.

80
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,619
We've talked about these
mappings but, if you're anything

81
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,750
like me you're asking,
what do they look like?

82
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,700
How do we use them?

83
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,720
Why might they be helpful?

84
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,690
So this is an excerpt taken
from a prototype mapping we made

85
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:26,290
that shows how we can map NSA's
top 10 mitigation strategies

86
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,359
to attack tactics.

87
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,570
Now you'll notice that the
mapping values were derived

88
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,380
from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

89
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,730
So you have the common functions

90
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,880
of identify, protect, detect, and so on.

91
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,680
So by having these mappings we could start

92
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,750
making some useful analysis.

93
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,573
For example, you might start by saying,

94
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:44,480
which of these controls can help

95
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,940
mitigate threats that I care about.

96
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,200
So we'll start with initial
access as an example,

97
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,910
because, well, that's
when the intrusions begin.

98
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,530
So we see many organizations
often have an abundance

99
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,200
of protective controls,

100
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,700
but they might be asking,

101
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,089
what is our effectiveness

102
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,320
with respect to detective controls.

103
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,739
And so if we take a mapping like this

104
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,250
we could walk down the detective column

105
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,530
and we could start asking some
thought provoking questions,

106
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,320
for example, are we continuously

107
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,049
hunting for network intrusions?

108
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,470
Are we segregating our networks

109
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,609
using application aware defenses?

110
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,430
Have we integrated threat
reputation services?

111
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,230
And as you go through this workflow

112
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,820
you'll likely identify capability gaps,

113
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,895
which can help inform your
future cybersecurity roadmaps.

114
00:04:23,895 --> 00:04:26,250
Likewise, it'll start
giving you an understanding

115
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,120
of your current coverage
as it exists today.

116
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,900
And that could be useful for
building followup assessments.

117
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,739
For example, measuring the effectiveness

118
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,030
of your existing controls.

119
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,400
So in the grand scheme of things,

120
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,250
really these mappings
are just another tool

121
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,260
that we can leverage in order to improve

122
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,173
our understanding of our
cybersecurity effectiveness.

123
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,793
Now I'll share with you
another prototype mapping.

124
00:04:47,793 --> 00:04:49,970
This was actually developed in response

125
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,290
to a strong community request
that we develop a mapping

126
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:58,110
showing how ATT&CK maps to
the controls in NIST 800-53.

127
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,720
Now this is a complicated
problem to tackle,

128
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,140
and we've made a lot of
different prototypes.

129
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,969
And through this process

130
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,510
we've identified a number of challenges

131
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,520
that we're eventually
gonna need to overcome.

132
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,820
So I'll start by sharing one

133
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,010
of the prototypes that we created

134
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,990
and kinda talk about how does it work

135
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,403
and what kind of limitations are present.

136
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,150
So like most cybersecurity products

137
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,539
we started with a spreadsheet.

138
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,470
So on the left-hand side
we have our ATT&CK tactics

139
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,170
organized by...

140
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,950
We have our ATT&CK techniques
organized by tactic.

141
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,300
On the top side along the x-axis

142
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,530
we have our NIST 800-53 controls

143
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,619
organized by control family.

144
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,040
Now one of the immediate
challenges is that

145
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,160
the spreadsheet is extremely large.

146
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,155
We basically have about 244
cells extending to the right,

147
00:05:41,155 --> 00:05:43,869
making this a little unwieldy at times.

148
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,120
Furthermore, scrolling down
we've got 266 ATT&CK techniques

149
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,760
as it exists today.

150
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,750
So one of challenges that
we need to work through is

151
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,380
how do we deal with the
fact that these frameworks

152
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,633
are going to continue to grow and expand?

153
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,690
Now one of other approaches
was taking this mapping

154
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,230
and just dividing it by control family.

155
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,900
So on the one hand it's
a little bit smaller,

156
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,370
it's a little bit easier to cope with.

157
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,240
But the fact remains is at this point

158
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,470
it's an Excel spreadsheet,
it's a little bit error prone,

159
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,570
and we need to find some better ways

160
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,772
to cope with this scale.

161
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,409
And so that kinda brings
us to the challenges

162
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,970
we derive by creating
these different prototypes.

163
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,890
And I share these with you
for a couple of reasons.

164
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,760
One, if you've made these mappings

165
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,080
I suspect you're probably
experienced similar challenges.

166
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,900
And two, we're using this as the basis

167
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,669
for the solutions that we plan
on developing in the future.

168
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,490
One of the first challenges
is mapping criteria.

169
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,260
So how we kinda match to
the different functions

170
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,920
of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

171
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,000
But those could be broad
and at times subjective,

172
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,140
so we wanna have criteria
that is very clear

173
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,530
and that there are defined conventions

174
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,159
so that if we're working in teams

175
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,560
or sharing this with the community,

176
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,130
it's easy to jump in and
start making contributions

177
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,356
following known standards.

178
00:06:49,356 --> 00:06:52,430
To the point of standards, we
also recognize the fact that

179
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,280
both ATT&CK and these
different control frameworks

180
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,320
will continue to grow and expand.

181
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,969
And so it might not be
enough to just grow these

182
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,420
in an Excel spreadsheet.

183
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,193
We might need a structured data solution

184
00:07:02,193 --> 00:07:04,680
that can keep up with the
changing nature of the scale,

185
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,800
of these control frameworks.

186
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,633
Then there's scale.

187
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:10,669
The fact is we're talking about hundreds,

188
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,870
if not thousands, of controls.

189
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,853
So, we need to find a programmatic
way to deal with that.

190
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,289
Last thing I'll share
with these challenges

191
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,850
is we've seen many organizations
have made these mappings,

192
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,510
and we know right away
that they're probably

193
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,599
of great value to the community.

194
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,250
But the challenge is sharing it.

195
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,780
In many cases when you're
dealing with your controls

196
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,969
you're talking about
your security posture.

197
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,080
And there might be sensitive data

198
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,120
that you don't wanna reveal to the public.

199
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,860
So we're fully, we fully
acknowledge that challenge.

200
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,560
And what we wanna do going
forward is find a way where

201
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,490
organizations can share these mappings,

202
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,420
we can make it available,
and perhaps MITRE

203
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,863
can serve as the curator
to make that happen.

204
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,050
So that brings us to our future goals.

205
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,860
So we talked about some of
the different challenges,

206
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,470
we showed some of the prototypes.

207
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,760
So now we're gonna talk
about what we're going to do

208
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,909
to try and make this reality
and get this into your hands

209
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,580
in a timely manner.

210
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,710
So fundamentally our end state is

211
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,950
we want to provide a curated
source of trusted mappings

212
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,469
that can support community contributions.

213
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,420
We found that in many ways
ATT&CK has been such a success

214
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,400
because it's been driven
by the people who use it

215
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,340
and we wanna continue
that model going forward.

216
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,950
Beyond that, as far as
the technical approach,

217
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,400
as we go forward we're
gonna start developing

218
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,239
a flexible mapping data structure,

219
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,750
and I look to some of the other
common structures we've seen

220
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,370
kinda related to this.

221
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,203
If we look at sticks, for example,

222
00:08:26,203 --> 00:08:28,280
they've shown how we can
take a very large body

223
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,409
of different criteria and put
it in a structured format.

224
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,471
And our thought process is if we have that

225
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,330
then it should be a
little bit more scalable

226
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,390
than, say, an Excel spreadsheet of doom.

227
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,159
And lastly, when we have this
structured mapping format,

228
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,719
then it should be a little bit easier

229
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,050
to make that data accessible
in a user-friendly application.

230
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,380
So right now our current
motivation is the ATT&CK Navigator.

231
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,560
Maybe it could be a part
of it, or separate entity

232
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,160
if it's not possible to integrate,

233
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,100
but the end state remains.

234
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,520
We wanna get these mappings to you

235
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,193
and we want it to be an
easy process to use them.

236
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,210
As that brings us to our conclusion,

237
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,150
the first thing I'll point
out is obviously this project

238
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,699
is in its early stages.

239
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,482
And the good news with that
is this is the perfect time

240
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:12,040
to offer your input, your
ideas, your perspectives.

241
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,380
I know having spoken with

242
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,800
the different controls participants

243
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,719
during the birds of a feather session

244
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,230
that this is a subject that
people have strong ideas about.

245
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,720
And so if there's specific
mappings you want, let us know.

246
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,730
Let us know what mappings
you want and why,

247
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,540
and then that positions
us in a better position

248
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,610
to try and make that reality.

249
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,850
Other thing I'll say is,

250
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,440
if you're one of these
organizations that has taken

251
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,660
the initiative and you've
made a really great mapping,

252
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,699
and you wanna share it with the community,

253
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,630
definitely reach out to us,

254
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,870
we're happy to have that conversation

255
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,220
to figure out how to get it out there.

256
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,120
Last thing I'll say, and
this kind of underscores

257
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,760
a common theme at ATT&CK Con is that

258
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,510
when we work together we gain advantages

259
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,230
over our adversaries.

260
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,700
So only by working together
can we make this reality,

261
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,100
and if this is a subject that
you're really passionate about

262
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,160
we ask, let us know if you
wanna help and we're happy

263
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,660
to have discussion about
how to make that reality.

264
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,140
So that was the controls mapping update.

265
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,490
I'd like to open up the floor now

266
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,390
and answer any questions you may have.

267
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,699
Most common question is what
are they serving for lunch?

268
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:15,531
(laughing)

269
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,550
- Yeah, we wanted to allow a few minutes.

270
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,800
I know this is something
that a lot of folks

271
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,849
have looked into in the
audience, spoke before.

272
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,830
Any questions for Mike?

273
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,590
- And I will say if there
aren't any questions now

274
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:25,860
I'm gonna be lingering around.

275
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,310
So do feel encouraged to reach out to me.

276
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,530
I'll be onsite.

277
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,610
And likewise, if you have
any further questions

278
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,650
or requests from us do feel
free to reach out to us

279
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,620
the information below.

280
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,810
- Mike, one question that I had,

281
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,569
after you mentioned in
the challenges slide,

282
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,080
but could you talk a little bit more

283
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,550
about the challenge of
like a one to many thing

284
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,229
or the challenge of the fact that

285
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,010
it sort of depends on how
you implement a control,

286
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,520
what were you finding as you were trying

287
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,939
to map these controls to each technique.

288
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,140
How tough was that?

289
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:58,530
- So that's one of the big
challenges with these mappings.

290
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,900
On the one hand it's really easy to look

291
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,530
at an Excel spreadsheet and say

292
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,079
if we have malicious code protection

293
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,990
that will block spearfishing attachments.

294
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,580
But speaking as a red teamer I know

295
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,010
that that is not the case.

296
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,580
It really depends on the
specific implementation

297
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,110
and a lot of variables.

298
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,500
So the challenge is balancing that.

299
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,830
We wanna offer the guidance
that could help organizations,

300
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,950
but at the same time we
have to respect the fact

301
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,770
that the effectiveness of these controls

302
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:23,520
really depends on your implementations.

303
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,290
So at the end of the day
this is a starting point

304
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,469
to understand your environment,

305
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:31,150
recognizing that it does
require deeper examination

306
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,150
to really understand your effectiveness.

307
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,213
- Okay, well said.

308
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,900
I don't have anything to say to that.

309
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,819
Yeah, I appreciate you also

310
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,572
bringing that red team perspective.

311
00:11:42,572 --> 00:11:44,490
Hey, I don't know if this
is actually gonna work.

312
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,520
From a red team perspective,
maybe not so much.

313
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,340
So I think that's another theme

314
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,710
that we've talked about all conference

315
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,750
is false sense of security.

316
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,700
And that's seriously a risk here.

317
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,960
Funny to use the word risk,

318
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,520
but a risk of doing this controls mapping

319
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,319
that I think kind of as we
as a community look at this,

320
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,030
keeping that in mind, I think
that's really important.
