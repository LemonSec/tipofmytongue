1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,790
- [Katie] Now my pleasure to
welcome Blake back to the stage

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,230
as we start to wrap things
up here at ATT&CKCon 2.0.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,040
I'm gonna come out from behind the podium

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,479
cause I feel so constrained

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,520
and I like to walk around.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,180
It's been an amazing three days

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,640
and that's because of all of you.

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,930
Folks that are here in person,

9
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,285
folks online around the world.

10
00:00:20,285 --> 00:00:22,840
People have watched from
all kinds of locations

11
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,673
and tweeted at us,

12
00:00:23,673 --> 00:00:24,700
let us know that they're part

13
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,939
of this global ATT&CK community.

14
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,443
Just a couple, Mike Kern from Wisconsin,

15
00:00:29,443 --> 00:00:31,325
eating some cheese maybe.

16
00:00:31,325 --> 00:00:33,400
I don't know how to say that name,

17
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,363
but some folks in Poland are
having a watch party there.

18
00:00:37,572 --> 00:00:39,450
An Australian listening in from Germany.

19
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,610
UTC+11, so even middle of the night

20
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,560
they tuned in to ATT&CKCon 2.0.

21
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,050
Mumbai confirmed this morning,

22
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:48,890
they were watching yesterday,

23
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,200
they checked in this
morning with us as well.

24
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,310
Just speaks to the global nature
of this amazing community.

25
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,298
Going to turn it over to Blake

26
00:00:56,298 --> 00:00:57,310
to give you a recap of
Birds of a Feather sessions,

27
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,760
which were Monday afternoon,

28
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,000
seems like so long ago.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,900
- Yeah, it does.

30
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,160
Thank you Katie.

31
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,210
So we had several Birds of
a Feather sessions set up

32
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,929
spanning topics like
sub-techniques, cloud controls, ICS.

33
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,930
And so we went through
some of the topic notes

34
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,474
that had been collected
by our facilitators

35
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:19,330
and just do a quick recap of those.

36
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,343
So one of those sessions was a
threat hunting and detection.

37
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,950
Some of the discussion lead towards

38
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,220
to think about the confidence
levels of detections,

39
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,500
rather than just making a
binary detected or not detected.

40
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,650
'Cause that really doesn't tell you

41
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,060
what your true coverage is,

42
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,210
cause you know there's
several different ways

43
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,220
that you can detect something.

44
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,830
And a lot of times it's your assessments

45
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,050
of how well you detect
in your own environment

46
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,042
based on the tools and
resources that you have,

47
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:47,100
which is really cool.

48
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,553
And then it's also important
to help red and blue

49
00:01:49,554 --> 00:01:52,060
come together for purple teaming.

50
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,750
That way you can do a lot more
rapid detection enhancements.

51
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:59,790
The red and blue will
learn from each other.

52
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,050
And you'll improve your
detections a lot better over time.

53
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,810
And then if you're wondering
where to get started in this,

54
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,900
looking at your data sources

55
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,410
is really the best place to start,

56
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,243
because you need to have,

57
00:02:10,243 --> 00:02:11,900
make sure that you have
the right data available

58
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,333
to even get started in detecting threats.

59
00:02:15,412 --> 00:02:16,530
- [Katie] I think we heard
a lot of that today even.

60
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,650
- [Blake] Yup.

61
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,800
Another one was the analytics session.

62
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,340
So one of the topics there was

63
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,770
we needed to encourage
users in communities

64
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,680
to write and exchange analytics.

65
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,256
So this is very tough for a lot of people,

66
00:02:28,256 --> 00:02:31,060
because it is sort of how
they're detecting threats

67
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,893
in their own environment.

68
00:02:31,893 --> 00:02:33,600
And it's very difficult to share that

69
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,640
without risk to potentially
letting adversaries

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,290
know exactly how they're being detected.

71
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:40,540
But we think there could be ways

72
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,111
to generalize the information,

73
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:44,131
that we can share ideas better

74
00:02:44,132 --> 00:02:46,563
without risking our own environments.

75
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:50,720
Another one was that there's
a lot of properties around

76
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,709
analytics that we need to
think about and capture.

77
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:58,390
So there's ease of evasion by adversaries.

78
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,940
If your detections are
based on static strings

79
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,380
and they are able to change
those false positive rates

80
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,563
and things like that.

81
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,450
Another one was many top attack techniques

82
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,060
don't have public analytic coverage yet.

83
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,040
And this is something that
we're trying to change with CAR.

84
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,730
So we're looking for
contributions in these.

85
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,200
So if you have detections
that work for you

86
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,260
in certain areas and you're
comfortable sharing those,

87
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,126
we'd love to take them and help them,

88
00:03:25,126 --> 00:03:28,230
help the community in those areas.

89
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,260
And then another one was
analytics tied to specific tools

90
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,320
can be hard to read by
other analysts when sharing.

91
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,980
So that's another point for
trying to generalize it in a way

92
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,109
that is applicable to
multiple environments

93
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,173
and multiple tools.

94
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,588
And then another one was assessments,

95
00:03:44,588 --> 00:03:49,450
sock assessments and
attack based assessments.

96
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,589
So dealing with the abstraction
can be a pain point.

97
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,120
Sometimes it's hard to determine whether

98
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,610
it's a procedure or a technique.

99
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,040
So that can make a big
difference in how you're actually

100
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,463
assessing something and
what your results are.

101
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,019
Measuring coverage is doable,

102
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:07,570
the hard part is tracking that over time.

103
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,730
So how often do you do assessments?

104
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:10,920
How do you measure the progress

105
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,831
from one assessment to another?

106
00:04:12,831 --> 00:04:15,299
It's a big problem for people.

107
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,240
So the more information we can get

108
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,890
about best practices in that area,

109
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,032
I think would help the community a lot.

110
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,330
And then we had a feature request.

111
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,630
So they'd like a standardized way

112
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,822
of creating a simpler chart to communicate

113
00:04:27,822 --> 00:04:29,320
that this is a level.

114
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,670
And this may be due to
ATT&CK being too large

115
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,090
and too complex.

116
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,109
So we need a better way of
sort of honing in on the things

117
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,560
that we need CISOs to focus
on to make better decisions.

118
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,010
Which is a really good point.

119
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,429
Cloud, another good topic.

120
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,000
So we heard that a lot more organizations

121
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,280
are getting pushed into the cloud.

122
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,799
As there's several reasons.

123
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,230
So it could be a cost-saving measure,

124
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,240
it could be the technology
is moving to the cloud

125
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,420
that they rely on.

126
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,490
And so a lot of people
are really happy to see

127
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,853
that we're covering cloud in ATT&CK now,

128
00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:02,490
which is awesome.

129
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,917
Some people felt that
the SaaS platform tag

130
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:07,159
may not be that interesting

131
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,650
and they are more interested in

132
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:14,210
specific cloud-native services
and techniques against those.

133
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,998
And we're trying to cover both,

134
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:20,027
like I said earlier, in
my presentation yesterday,

135
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,600
we think the cloud is
a dynamic environment

136
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,000
and the platforms are
likely to change over time.

137
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,080
So if we find that SaaS
isn't really that useful

138
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,181
then we might deprecate it down the road

139
00:05:30,182 --> 00:05:33,060
in favor of more specific cloud services

140
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,930
when we get more specific
techniques in for those services.

141
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,920
And another point was that
identity and access management

142
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,330
is really the new perimeter
for a lot of people.

143
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,469
Because, you know, it's
just basically an account,

144
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,910
how you get access to the account,

145
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,210
how do you use those credentials

146
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,190
and credentialing materials
to access the resources.

147
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:56,190
Because obviously adversaries
are gonna target those things,

148
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:58,718
so good to hear.

149
00:05:58,718 --> 00:06:02,360
Another one was our purple
and red teaming session.

150
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,450
So having red and blue teams

151
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,570
under the same leadership
chain is really important,

152
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,435
because that helps collaboration,

153
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:12,150
that frees up resources for them to do

154
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,623
and share similar goals.

155
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,130
Another good point is the need to avoid

156
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,754
getting things too adversarial,

157
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:24,170
because if you create that
friction between teams

158
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,420
they're not gonna make progress
in ways that they need to

159
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,620
to improve security in the environment.

160
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,250
And then the last point was purple teaming

161
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,710
is really red teaming done right.

162
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,685
We completely agree.

163
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:34,600
- [Katie] I like that.

164
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,850
- Yes (laughing).

165
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,920
Another good one, I love
this one, sub-techniques.

166
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,360
So big topic on a lot of
people's minds these days.

167
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,270
So we got a lot out of it
just as us on the ATT&CK team,

168
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,049
because we had a relatively small group,

169
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,400
it was a focus session,

170
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,760
but a lot of good feedback so far.

171
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,969
So we were able to answer
some of our concerns right now

172
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,720
over structuring some of the
techniques, which was great.

173
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,510
One of the participants,

174
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,270
who shall not be named,

175
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,103
did say that,

176
00:07:04,103 --> 00:07:07,737
"His organization has
created 900 techniques

177
00:07:07,737 --> 00:07:08,863
"as extensions to ATT&CK

178
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:12,220
"and that sub-techniques will
literally save his life".

179
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,263
So great to hear.

180
00:07:13,263 --> 00:07:14,621
- [Katie] Literally, like--
- [Blake] Literally.

181
00:07:14,622 --> 00:07:15,810
- [Katie] Literally.
- [Blake] Yes, literally.

182
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,720
And another good point was

183
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,160
there's a lot of concern
over whether or not

184
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,430
it's easy or difficult to learn
ATT&CK as it's been growing.

185
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,820
But the general consensus in the session

186
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,900
was that sub-techniques will help people

187
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,260
learn about ATT&CK easier
because it's more refined,

188
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,380
it's easier to pin down exactly
where something should go,

189
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,480
because there's more definition around it.

190
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,840
And another session was
our AI and ML session.

191
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,690
So there is obviously a need

192
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,240
to be able to describe threat intel

193
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,598
in a more normalized and efficient way,

194
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:51,170
so that ML can be used better across it.

195
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,740
But it is a hard problem.

196
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,890
And then the second point was

197
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,610
it's often hard to describe

198
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,940
how ML based detections map to techniques

199
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,984
because of the more
nebulous nature of the,

200
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:07,263
how the technology works.

201
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,230
- Lots of conversations,

202
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,322
and I'll kind of go back and
forth with Blake on this one.

203
00:08:13,322 --> 00:08:15,570
We've been hearing from you the community

204
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,909
and we always try to take feedback.

205
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:17,963
But these three days are awesome for us,

206
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:20,921
to be able to have so many
conversations in the hallways,

207
00:08:20,921 --> 00:08:23,420
over some candy or LaCroix,

208
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,560
on what you're thinking,

209
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,200
what you need from us.

210
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,010
So first one, Blake, should
we do sub-techniques?

211
00:08:29,011 --> 00:08:30,361
- [Blake] Yes, of course (laughing).

212
00:08:30,361 --> 00:08:31,536
(audience laughing)

213
00:08:31,536 --> 00:08:32,369
- [Katie] And I think
we've heard that from you.

214
00:08:32,369 --> 00:08:34,417
It's not just us saying that.

215
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:35,490
We love that quote so much,

216
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,051
we're saving lives here with
sub-techniques (laughing).

217
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:38,884
(Blake and audience laugh)

218
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:41,260
One conversation I had with people,

219
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,092
you know, we wanna know

220
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:44,140
how can we help you better use ATT&CK.

221
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:44,973
And someone said,

222
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:47,490
"Well we're still not sure
how to get started with it".

223
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,230
And we've heard that quite a bit

224
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,470
and so over this past year,

225
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,980
we've tried to rollout
a Getting Started page

226
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:52,940
on our website,

227
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,810
the blog series that Nancy and
the team put into an eBook.

228
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,500
And we're looking for more of that.

229
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,900
And I think you as a community
can help us with this too.

230
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,959
It's not just us,

231
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,350
the power of ATT&CK is in you all

232
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,510
and so many great presentations
throughout this event

233
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,640
that have shown people how you
can get started using ATT&CK.

234
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,449
So I've put that back on all of you,

235
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,460
but that's on our minds as well.

236
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,660
Blake, next one, should I be
able to cover 100% of ATT&CK?

237
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,969
- [Blake] No (laughing).

238
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,836
- [Katie] All right, let's say that again.

239
00:09:18,836 --> 00:09:20,100
Blake, 100% coverage, is that realistic?

240
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,230
- No, it's not (laughing).

241
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,530
- [Katie] It is not realistic.

242
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,207
So we've heard that you
need help explaining that.

243
00:09:25,207 --> 00:09:27,070
You need us to say that.

244
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:27,970
So we've said it now,

245
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,250
I will also say no you
cannot get 100% coverage.

246
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,083
That's crazy.

247
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,530
No one has perfect visibility,

248
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,230
no one has perfect data sources,

249
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,730
as we've talked about again and again.

250
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,800
So no.

251
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,760
And so we hope to put
out some more content

252
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,610
to help you convey that
to your stakeholders,

253
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,130
whoever they are.

254
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,630
The other one, "What is the
ATT&CK team doing next?"

255
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,900
We had conversations,

256
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,000
you really wanna know more from
us about where we're going.

257
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,400
We tried to write some blog posts,

258
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,780
but we can do better.

259
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,670
And we will do better,

260
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,041
because we realized that
it's not just curiosity,

261
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:58,032
you have to plan out your teams

262
00:09:58,032 --> 00:10:00,880
over the next year, two years, five years.

263
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,746
And what we do, it's kinda crazy but,

264
00:10:02,746 --> 00:10:04,689
what we do influences what you all do.

265
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,800
So this is some of the
feedback that we've gotten

266
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,647
over the past three days

267
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:11,003
that we wanted to make sure
you know that we hear you.

268
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,159
As we start to wrap up I love
this tweet from Christian.

269
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,787
This morning he commented,

270
00:10:17,787 --> 00:10:19,267
"He knows it's been a good ATT&CKCon

271
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:21,587
"when his idle shower
thoughts are filled with ideas

272
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:22,762
"about how to better apply ATT&CK

273
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:24,709
"and new ideas from day one".

274
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,660
And that's really what this is all about.

275
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,860
I started off by saying this,

276
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,280
but we hope that you'll come together,

277
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,760
share ideas about what's working,

278
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,400
maybe what isn't working so well,

279
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,000
and leave with ideas to make
your organization safer.

280
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,640
So I'm glad Christian got
a head start on that one.

281
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,260
Christian see me later for a flag.

282
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,668
And I think that was a flag worthy tweet.

283
00:10:42,668 --> 00:10:45,880
Bryson noted challenges.

284
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,200
It's a common slide that we
saw across a lot of presenters.

285
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,570
And yeah, that's absolutely right Bryson.

286
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:55,800
There are a lot of challenges
ahead of us, but we've got it.

287
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,650
And we've got it together.

288
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,030
And go back to what Tony started off with,

289
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,720
the friends we made along the way,

290
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,950
the friends we make along the way

291
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,340
are gonna help us all figure out

292
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,670
how to defeat these adversaries,

293
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,360
kick em out of our networks,

294
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,950
solve problems for a safer world.

295
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,100
Whether it's here,

296
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,300
whether it's back in
your own organizations.

297
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,940
- [Blake] So I'd like to give a shout out

298
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,750
to one of our original mentors

299
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,790
on the ATT&CK project, Richard Games.

300
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,349
He was the person who helped us

301
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,010
fund the original research
that went into it,

302
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,863
so we owe a lot of this to him

303
00:11:25,863 --> 00:11:30,863
and the effort that he put
in to managing our research.

304
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,690
Just not the ATT&CK research,

305
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,160
but also the broader research program

306
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,860
at MITRE over several years.

307
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,471
But the one thing he
tried to instill in us was

308
00:11:38,471 --> 00:11:39,837
he would always ask us,

309
00:11:39,837 --> 00:11:41,370
"What is your North Star?"

310
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,360
And I can confidently
say it's the community.

311
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,870
We're doing this for you
because we want ATT&CK

312
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,960
to be better to serve you guys.

313
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,860
So thank you very much, you
are the reason that we do this.

314
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,352
- [Katie] Awesome. I love the North Star.

315
00:11:55,352 --> 00:11:57,146
So we love this tweet,

316
00:11:57,147 --> 00:12:00,360
"ATT&CKCon is awesome, change my mind".

317
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,016
I don't think anyone
will change their mind,

318
00:12:03,016 --> 00:12:05,980
DoITSecurity on Twitter.

319
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,290
A surveys gonna be sent out
from attackcon@mitre.org

320
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,469
after the conference.

321
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,220
Just like the ATT&CK
Team loves your feedback

322
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,100
to make it better,

323
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,100
we wanna make this event
even better next year.

324
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,070
As many of you know,

325
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,180
we can't put on these amazing events

326
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,650
without a lot of people.

327
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,790
Wanted to thank a couple folks.

328
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,361
All of our amazing speakers,
putting together this research.

329
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:27,810
All of these amazing
slides, that's not easy.

330
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,071
So thank you speakers.

331
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:31,530
All of our sponsors and exhibitors

332
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,670
who have invested in making
this an amazing event.

333
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,810
In person attendees,

334
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,329
thank you all for hanging out with us.

335
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,730
It was so much fun for us

336
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,590
to chat with all of you here in McLean,

337
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,560
drink LaCroix, eat candy, eat snacks,

338
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,729
that's my favorite part.

339
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,180
As well as the online attendees
from around the world,

340
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,299
thank you for tweeting at us,

341
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:50,040
for engaging with us here,

342
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,130
cause it's really exciting to know

343
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,310
that you're watching
from around the world.

344
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,709
Our audio/visual team,

345
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,730
we had so many comments,

346
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,667
so many tweets saying,

347
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:58,563
"This is like the best live stream ever".

348
00:12:58,563 --> 00:13:01,400
UltraHD whoo it's great!

349
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,540
But thank you to the AV team,

350
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,920
Lars the voice of God,

351
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,420
who's my new hype man
now, so that's awesome.

352
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,060
(audience laughing)

353
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,369
Wanted to give some special
shout outs to a few people.

354
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:13,020
Again there's so many
people behind the scenes,

355
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,920
pretty much everyone who
was on stage the first day

356
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,549
helped out from the ATT&CK Team.

357
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:20,230
But our Strategic Communications
Team has been unbelievable.

358
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,760
They've been planning basically
since last years ATT&CKCon.

359
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,810
Debbie, Nancy, Karen, Nicole, Pascal,

360
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,518
Nils, Aaron, Kelsey, Gina and Jeremy.

361
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,780
And that's just a small portion

362
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,540
of the many, many communications

363
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,209
and events folks behind the scenes.

364
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,122
So, let's give them a round of applause.

365
00:13:37,122 --> 00:13:40,122
(audience clapping)

366
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:44,960
And one thing that we've learned

367
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,400
as we've worked through

368
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,430
all of our ATT&CK
communications externally,

369
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,380
as well as this event,

370
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,401
is that things work really
well when technical teams

371
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:55,120
and communications folks work together.

372
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,350
Again this community thing,

373
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,130
it's just no different here.

374
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,000
And so what we've found

375
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
is we have this amazing
partnership where, for example,

376
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,750
Rich Struse has an idea
to make some subway maps.

377
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,560
Pascal, amazing designer.

378
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,420
Then while we want the techniques

379
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,099
to be kind of logically sequenced,

380
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,240
because not that any of you
would hyper-analyze them

381
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,080
and you know, look if
that's realistic or not.

382
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,710
So then Mike Hartley from our team

383
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,310
looked through the actual group pages

384
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,936
and tried to think of realistic
chaining of techniques.

385
00:14:21,937 --> 00:14:24,370
What a great partnership between graphics,

386
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:27,020
between the technical team,
to make those things happen.

387
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,497
So wanted to give a shout
out to the ATT&CK Team.

388
00:14:29,498 --> 00:14:33,180
Adam Pennington has done
so much work on this,

389
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,012
so I just wanna,

390
00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:36,077
please join me in thanking
Adam for everything he's done.

391
00:14:36,077 --> 00:14:39,670
(audience clapping)

392
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,969
Over many, many months;

393
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:42,960
he was helping me last
night at like ten o'clock

394
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,300
get screenshots of tweets.

395
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,882
Other folks on the program committee;

396
00:14:45,882 --> 00:14:49,229
Jamie, Blake, me, John and Andy.

397
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,530
And then Jen Burns, who's
no longer with the team,

398
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,453
but appreciate her efforts as well.

399
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,439
Gotta give a special shout out to Jamie,

400
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,328
who was amazing on the ATT&CKCon couch.

401
00:14:58,328 --> 00:14:59,230
(audience clapping)

402
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,133
Well done Jamie.

403
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,690
So many other people to thank,

404
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,170
but we're just really, really grateful

405
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,329
and humbled that everything that you do

406
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,990
let's us do what we do
everyday and we love so much.

407
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,659
So, thank you all for coming.

408
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:15,550
Really, really appreciate it

409
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,990
and we hope to see you next year,

410
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,120
if not before on Twitter,
in person at conferences.

411
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,410
Thank you all so much.

412
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,233
And we'll see you later.
