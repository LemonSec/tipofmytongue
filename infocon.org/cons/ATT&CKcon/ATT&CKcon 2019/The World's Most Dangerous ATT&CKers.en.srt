1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,633
- [MC] Please join me in
welcoming Robert Lipovsky.

2
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:07,559
(hands clapping)

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:08,392
- Thanks.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,273
Great, hello everyone.

5
00:00:11,273 --> 00:00:12,500
Thanks for that introduction.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,530
It's a pleasure to be here.

7
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,860
So, the talk is going to be about

8
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,450
the most interesting techniques

9
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,900
of two infamous APT groups

10
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,622
that I think need no introduction.

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,110
Over the twelve years
that I've working in ESET

12
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,099
doing malware research

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,390
I had the privilege of working

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,190
with some of the most
skilled reverse engineers

15
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,019
and threat researchers,

16
00:00:35,019 --> 00:00:37,500
so credit goes to them for
some of the discoveries

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,873
that I'll be talking
about in the presentation.

18
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,300
So, before we get to the
main scope of ATT&CK,

19
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,750
as Katie said, just a
really quick introduction

20
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,550
about how we use it.

21
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,440
So we started augmenting
our threat reports,

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,949
not only with IOC's, but
also attack mappings,

23
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,980
for example our wheel
of security block posts.

24
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,910
This is what it looks like,

25
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,639
and this is just a snippet
for this particular example

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,980
so the list is much longer,

27
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,020
but you can get an idea.

28
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,780
So there's the tactic, the
technique and also an inscription

29
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,780
how that particular malware
uses that technique.

30
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,560
Also for similar reasons
and in a similar way

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,090
we are mapping attack
in our EDR solutioning,

32
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,480
set enterprise inspector

33
00:01:26,443 --> 00:01:27,500
whenever that was feasible and possible

34
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,733
because there's a varying
level of granularity for that.

35
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,020
Okay, so those were the external uses

36
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,910
for improving the communication
with our audiences,

37
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,183
whether it's our readers or our users,

38
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,660
leveraging the common
taxonomy aspect of attack,

39
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,970
but we also use it internally

40
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,289
as one of the guides for
enhancing enterprise inspector

41
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,020
and improving our analytics,

42
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,700
but I won't go into the details about that

43
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,870
because you've been hearing
all about those things

44
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,130
at this conference or you might have read

45
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,369
the ATT&CK's great blog
post on the subject

46
00:02:05,037 --> 00:02:06,310
so they covered that really well.

47
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,580
Okay, so let's get to those APT's

48
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,810
and those interesting techniques.

49
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,160
Of course this is not going to be

50
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,440
a comprehensive listing at all.

51
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,300
That would make for a much,
much longer presentation.

52
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,490
Just some highlights

53
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:22,250
which I thought were really
interesting and noteworthy.

54
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,620
So the first group, and
because of the lack of time

55
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,900
I just selected one particular software

56
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,950
that they were using.

57
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,080
That was APT28 or Fancy Bear or Sednit

58
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:36,850
and last year we found out

59
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:41,609
that they used the first UEFI
rootkit found in the wild.

60
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,950
So this was a pretty significant deal.

61
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,950
Running code from the SPI flash memory

62
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,010
the first thing that runs when
you start up your computer,

63
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,220
before Windows is loaded,

64
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,310
before any security software
has a chance to load too,

65
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,980
that's a really powerful
persistence mechanism

66
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,299
and gives the attackers
an ability to withstand

67
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,030
not only complete wipe of the system

68
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,260
but even a hard drive replacement.

69
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,233
So they use this against attacks against,

70
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,963
in attacks against
diplomatic targets in Europe.

71
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,830
You can read all of the
details in the paper.

72
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,740
I'm not going to go into them.

73
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,900
I'll just mention that
they drew their inspiration

74
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,099
from LoJack which was a legitimate piece

75
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:33,453
of antitheft solution for laptops,

76
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,700
and in an antitheft solution

77
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,589
this powerful persistence
mechanism makes sense.

78
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,200
I mean if a thief was able to
easily get rid of the solution

79
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,799
it wouldn't be a very good
antitheft tool, would it?

80
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,380
Okay, so it's featured in ATT&CK

81
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,460
and listed under the
system firmware technique.

82
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,410
There are some other examples over there,

83
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,627
but basically before LoJacks

84
00:03:59,491 --> 00:04:01,350
UEFI rootkits were mostly in the realm

85
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,870
of theoretical proof of concepts,

86
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,370
or reported according to leaks,

87
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,130
reported functionality
of government agencies

88
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,579
or the hacking team software.

89
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,220
Okay, lets move onto the second group

90
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,300
where we'll spend a little bit more time

91
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,030
looking at their techniques

92
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:23,630
and they're know under the
umbrella term as Sandworm.

93
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,690
In our naming we go into a little bit

94
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,330
lower level of granularity

95
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,490
which stems from the way
we were tracking them.

96
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,370
So the first threat cluster and activities

97
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,110
related to that was BlackEnergy,

98
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,960
I think needs no introduction here,

99
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,849
which facilitated their
most infamous campaign

100
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:49,050
was that it facilitated the
first ever power grid attacks,

101
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,543
black-outs caused by a cyber attack.

102
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,150
Then there was Industroyer,

103
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,239
also referred to some
folks as Crash Override.

104
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,940
This was, I would say,

105
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,100
one of the most cunning pieces
of malware we ever revealed

106
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,000
and the reason is that,
not just it's modular,

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,300
but it's able to communicate

108
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,120
with industrial control systems hardware

109
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,720
using their very own language.

110
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,940
It had an implementation

111
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,640
of four different industrial protocols

112
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,020
so effectively this malware
was bridging the gap

113
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,143
between IT and OT attacks.

114
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,600
We also saw a shift from BlackEnergy

115
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,790
to what we call TeleBots at some time.

116
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,680
So there were lot of things in common,

117
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,804
like shared infrastructure,

118
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:37,960
but the malware was different.

119
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,359
The reason why we called it that

120
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,080
was because they were
using the telegram API

121
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,979
for command and control communication.

122
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,490
And not only the tools changed

123
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,320
but also the focus,

124
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,500
so it's really hard to conclusively say

125
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,010
that they are exactly the same people,

126
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,332
the same group behind it,

127
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,020
and the focus shifted from
critical infrastructure

128
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,460
and the energy sector

129
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,190
towards the financial sector,

130
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,620
and their most famous attack

131
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,930
which spread beyond
the borders of Ukraine,

132
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,320
worldwide was of course NotPetja,

133
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,560
and in parallel to the TeleBot activity

134
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,090
there was also GrayEnergy

135
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,390
which we consider the
successor of BlackEnergy.

136
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,409
Staying with that original focus

137
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,990
of critical infrastructure
and energy companies

138
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,853
and still active until today.

139
00:06:28,758 --> 00:06:31,729
So that was just a quick
overview of that group

140
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,540
and lets take a look at the
techniques that they were using.

141
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,110
So for initial access they
were mostly using Spearphising,

142
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,230
that's unsurprising,

143
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:45,060
with various methods of gaining execution,

144
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,210
whether it was pure social engineering

145
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,400
or they were also using
exploits, even zero days.

146
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,510
But let's get to the more interesting

147
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,520
and not that common stuff.

148
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,623
So they did supply chain compromises.

149
00:07:01,864 --> 00:07:06,099
The NotPetja, starting off
from the infection of Medoc

150
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,210
so from Medoc actor as we call it,

151
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,820
that's the most widely known example,

152
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,563
but there are also other cases.

153
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,109
Another interesting technique
was used by GreyEnergy

154
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,640
and that was exploiting a
public facing application,

155
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,300
specifically it was trying to gain entry

156
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,653
inside a network via a
vulnerable web server.

157
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,490
And a couple of other
interesting notable techniques

158
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,960
by this group.

159
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,000
There were BlackEnergy plugins
that were abusing TeamViewer.

160
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,860
So targeting specific
versions of TeamViewer,

161
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,640
changing the settings to enable a backdoor

162
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,330
and remote, unattended access
to that infected machine,

163
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:51,390
even, so basically the ability to gain,

164
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,210
regain entry even after
all their other tools

165
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,883
were detected and cleaned off the system.

166
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,430
Another BlackEnergy plugin,

167
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,200
which acted as a parasitic infector.

168
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,409
This was really interesting,

169
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,350
because we don't see a lot
of these virus like malware

170
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,070
a lot nowadays.

171
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,230
So we saw some Juniper installers
circulating in the wild

172
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,573
that were infected by this plugin.

173
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,320
And the third example I wanna mention,

174
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,614
I guess the ICS people in
the room will recognize this.

175
00:08:22,614 --> 00:08:25,250
That was execution via HMI,

176
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,620
so in this particular example
it was targeting SIMATIC,

177
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,960
the SIMATIC, sorry, Simplicity HMI,

178
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,740
but there were also
others that were targeted

179
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,683
such as WinCC.

180
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,419
So that script that you saw over there,

181
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,839
that would be launched by
Simplicity in this case

182
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,450
and it would run the first
stage of BlackEnergy.

183
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:51,450
So the details about this are
described in this ICS advisery

184
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,762
so you can go there and check
out the details if you want.

185
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,260
This is interesting because
this was one of the first

186
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,800
indicators that this group had an interest

187
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,800
in critical infrastructure in ICS.

188
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,252
This was of course before the
blackouts actually happened.

189
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,670
Speaking of, let's talk about impact.

190
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,829
'Cause if I were to describe this group

191
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,730
with just one word I
would call them impactful

192
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,421
for the havoc they caused in Ukraine,

193
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:27,830
whether it was with the blackouts

194
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,210
which left hundreds of thousands

195
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,130
of people without electricity

196
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,000
or with a pseudo ransomware, NotPetja,

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,720
going beyond the borders

198
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,420
and affecting some of the
worlds largest corporations.

199
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:43,449
Let's take a look at
the Industroyer impact.

200
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:44,930
So the primary one of course

201
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:49,030
was the ability to
de-energize that sub-station

202
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,780
and it was doing that,
as I already mentioned,

203
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,050
by sending commands to
these types of devices,

204
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,000
protection relays, effectively
opening circuit breakers

205
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,120
and speaking the language
of these devices.

206
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,400
So that's an important thing to say.

207
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,113
So there were no exploits,

208
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:08,153
there were no software
vulnerabilities involved in this.

209
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,690
Vulnerabilities, however,

210
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,130
were involved in the second
type of functionality

211
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,900
that affected the operations
at that workstation,

212
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,900
and that was carried out by the
denial of service component.

213
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,610
This also went after the protection relays

214
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,100
and it was abusing a fault that was,

215
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,730
abusing a vulnerability, not a zero day,

216
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,580
because it was patched
already at the time,

217
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,620
but not in those particular cases

218
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,693
and it would render the
protection relays unresponsive.

219
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:42,470
And the third impact,

220
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:47,030
although if we were to consider
the upcoming ICS attack,

221
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,650
it would probably be classified
a little bit differently,

222
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,850
in a different level of granularity,

223
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,550
but basically the third way

224
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,360
that Industroyer affected the operation

225
00:10:57,305 --> 00:10:58,810
of an electrical sub-station

226
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,300
was through the data wiper component.

227
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,930
So that one did not go
after the protection relays

228
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,532
but after the HMI's used to
control and monitor them.

229
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,800
And the purpose of that
was to amplify the impact.

230
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,793
To make recovery from the
attack more difficult.

231
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:20,280
So wipers, these destructive components

232
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,480
are kindof a signature
thing of this group.

233
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,710
We observed an evolution of this

234
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,680
through the years that
we were tracking them,

235
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,939
from the BlackEnergy plugins

236
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,720
through stand-alone Kill Disc components

237
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,443
to file encryptors,

238
00:11:36,443 --> 00:11:39,350
desruptive file encryptors
masquerading as ransomware,

239
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,235
most notably NotPetja,

240
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:43,120
but there were also others before that,

241
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,833
that had the same basic idea.

242
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,290
And they even in some
cases, in some variants,

243
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,310
they even through a little bit of a prank

244
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,670
intended to intimidate the victims,

245
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,550
so any Mr. Robot fans here?

246
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,223
You'll probably recognize this.

247
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,070
Okay, so to finish off the talk

248
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:07,593
it's great that ATT&CK is evolving.

249
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,120
When we first started
using it and contributing

250
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,200
the one impact, the one tactic

251
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,470
that was directly missing was impact

252
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,030
so we're really happy that that was added.

253
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:24,100
If I were to predict future expansion

254
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,970
I would say that we can probably expect

255
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,700
even more criminal types
of impacts being added

256
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,610
as we are already seeing

257
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,150
the boundaries between threat types

258
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,189
and motivations already
becoming very blurred,

259
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,670
so with that, I thank you for listening.

260
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,420
Use ATT&CK and contribute.

261
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,252
Thank you.
