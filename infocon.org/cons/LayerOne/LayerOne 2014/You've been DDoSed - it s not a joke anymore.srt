Jenny am Aquinnah see image second
because

16
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:03,170
computers hard signature

17
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,049
okay worked quick okay so

18
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:18,340
quick incall the past

19
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,210
67 years seminal family watch companies

20
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,339
most my work was is was focused

21
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,399
on doing with engine protection and
security as well as

22
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:32,619
the dust mitigation in town the cases I

23
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:36,530
currently I work for the professional
services organization family watch

24
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,390
%uh company and but the my duty sis tool

25
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,679
my work with customers and improving the
infrastructure to

26
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:47,039
you please dead easy dance tuning out of
service so

27
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:50,739
Pam this is the touched talk on this
topic

28
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:55,079
and giving it all day long and is kind
of interesting to see how things have

29
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,509
progressed over the years

30
00:01:56,509 --> 00:02:01,500
initially we were looking at you know
something to protect victims cash if the

31
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,129
tornado

32
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:05,840
so I'll cover to believe that and but

33
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,098
calf looking I was looking at some mild
slights

34
00:02:09,098 --> 00:02:13,119
and has an interesting to see how the
focus is shifting every year but

35
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,470
did the whole teams can ask you the same
so anyway

36
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,950
and so at usual disclaimer opinions
expressed in this

37
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,160
station on my name not my employer which
is a major

38
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,190
vendor hang their heads and which action
does not have the dust mitigation your

39
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,639
side

40
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,709
we need to have no horse in this race um

41
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:37,769
and also a shift from his understanding
me from speaking to fast let me know

42
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:41,099
issued a month instead axis stuff accent

43
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,810
that's like contains a said anyway

44
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,430
I if you have any questions a don has
that interest me

45
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:53,099
and let's make this interactive I a.m.
affection not used to speaking françois

46
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:53,840
Jordan some

47
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,239
I'm always working at the point you know
it's very interactive so I

48
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,910
I'm not that good a presenter I'm sure
my going to cover

49
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,209
helping shift shift cash changed over
the last year ass pussy

50
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:06,560
look at I want to deflect and now

51
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,580
DNS and FTP attacks are and I'm

52
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,660
where I think things will be going next
in the name

53
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,490
of coming next 32 maximum six months
action so

54
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:20,130
and that's what it was that's what we're
going to cover

55
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:25,720
at now I de dos landscape landscape over
the past year washes change some

56
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,050
bendix changed a little motivation
pretty much stayed the same

57
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,680
and dues and technologies also and
shifted a little mouth before using

58
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,650
anti-peace they're using DNS

59
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,710
for the major medica tax so

60
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,970
you know thats cash which things

61
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,980
are nowadays now from point a few
motivation

62
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,429
probably you cannot is that there is
much less talk about anonymous

63
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,690
but I am if you look at what's happening
any

64
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,790
reality wish to have the same am you
don't seem to get spanks watch

65
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,640
corporations

66
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,630
so even though there's not a lot of
public talk about the highest the same

67
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,420
stuff is going on

68
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,549
in be pretty much have the same actors
behind it

69
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,770
intentions but ended in a different way
and then Mom that

70
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,420
vocal about June about themselves and

71
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:19,570
using particular names and looking at
bend which this is have interesting

72
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,300
West year and there was a if anyone's
attack the two skanks concerning because

73
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:24,770
it was

74
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:29,560
big gap from the years before that am
now this is not as bad

75
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,669
meant let's take a look at this eso
based on the are

76
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:36,049
networks 14 2010 there was

77
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:40,500
a wanna take it was 500 gig and

78
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,900
now looking at help things changed over
the next

79
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,510
three years West you we had about 200
gig

80
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,080
and this year which had quote

81
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,190
left before particular number do you
remember that number

82
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,710
400 yes so

83
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,640
how realistic is Thomas I don't know
there's some of controversy up

84
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,650
and on this number and you've got there
you know a

85
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,669
BC on miss me supporting or

86
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:12,020
not properly mentioning so I can't
comment on that but pat the number that

87
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,210
they were important is some

88
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,940
480 so you can see and what things are
going

89
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,450
sum up the limiting factors are still

90
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:26,390
the fact that matter how large a botnet
you have a calming effect as you have

91
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:30,380
use to you cannot manage to deliver set
them up

92
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,400
traffic 21 and points just because the
connective tissue the Sandpoint

93
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,440
is somewhat limited now with

94
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,870
talking about limiting death and
gigabits but still

95
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,880
it is somewhat limited um now what is
competing

96
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,880
on the other hand being able to produce

97
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,850
exit somewhat large so over the last
couple of years

98
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,750
from if I have to generalize it is the
availability of the selectors

99
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:01,570
and the ability to amplify traffic so
does it but each or complaints

100
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,030
that I'll scams like to look into
because

101
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,780
dear common for the genus simplification
entebbe appreciation and S&P which is

102
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,119
going to be coming up next

103
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,340
six months and so look at the door

104
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,049
concepts reflection amplification
looking at the selection I'll

105
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,150
Kim its yes this is the lights

106
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:27,710
its industry so

107
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:32,090
we had the attacker detect be sending

108
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,200
a packet week peace source IP address

109
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,320
which he's not dead on IP address

110
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,530
it is actually getting this is the
victim and

111
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,369
when each is the reflector deflected
responds

112
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:49,560
to what he thinks he's the source which
action is the victim now

113
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,980
and at studious a number to which
electives

114
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,690
and you can see how this can scale up so

115
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,420
what does reflection do

116
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:05,420
to help you always accused

117
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,460
office/business education factor sorts
of dresses that occurred is one of the

118
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:13,799
most

119
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,730
abuse cases the source and the other one
is amplifies the effects of so in this

120
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,680
particular case

121
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,230
we're only a few ski in the source of
the attack I

122
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:25,560
but you're right the next point will be
and defiant so

123
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,140
um why is this soul important why is it
so important for somebody to office

124
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:36,680
of his kid okay so you don't call

125
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,020
after them but you know if they're
coming from a job she wear you know the

126
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,380
US legal system doesn't have it each
there's not much you in that

127
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,740
still one of the issues is that

128
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,760
um with stateful protocols when you have
to have

129
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,840
a.m. you I can test it is talking to you

130
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,229
you can always blog that you can have
some system and that

131
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,540
can automatically pick up traffic that
is if not more they can block

132
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,750
this source I with stage 4 a stateless

133
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:09,090
attacks is dns NNTP are um when the
source

134
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:14,190
is changed um it is going to be fairly
difficult to dispute any

135
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,260
now to keep that in mind this is more
around

136
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,800
this victim here because they'll be
seeing that reflected in this case

137
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,030
but they will never be seen the attacker
um now also the

138
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:29,429
deflected itself each day decides to do
something about the problem

139
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,310
they will never be seen the attacker
acted as the only be seen the victim IP

140
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:33,829
address

141
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,700
so needed the victim of the attackers
the

142
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,780
defect can do anything based on source
IP address um

143
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:46,140
now I'll world's might talk here I am so
so

144
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,030
I use kinda messing about stateless a
stateless and stateful

145
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:54,020
some can inject a little but now me all
those attacks

146
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,090
over unity or did easy trickled it lays
on top of you to do which

147
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:01,380
a loss for at the sporting um and

148
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,720
some is that day is that anybody
actually that has a question about this

149
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,400
I think this

150
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,490
fairly simple concept to admit to going
to death

151
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,630
okay calm

152
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:15,520
so um this is the section but to get
axle shaft attacker

153
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,699
we have two sectors we have picked now
the next thing

154
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,570
we do cash in 20 more minutes to chat on
this

155
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,660
and know what's also interesting here is
that detectives usually

156
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,860
are unaware of what's happening and a
willing participant in this attack

157
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,200
now did well

158
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,220
while having test date in mind it's too
isn't going to look good

159
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,470
ish you are participating as a sectarian
attack

160
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,710
and she can portion up the attack is
delivered from your DNS infrastructure

161
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,000
latif were talking about

162
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,100
reflect DNS um you never know when this
will come out in the newspapers

163
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,650
especially if the victim is

164
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:58,670
a competitor of yours and somebody on
the victim network

165
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,079
a does not properly investigate the
incident than just sees a

166
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,740
fairly high amount of traffic coming
from your IP space to their

167
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,000
website world to their DNS
infrastructure so

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,820
a you gotta be careful there because you
know some people say oh it's on my

169
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,470
problem but actually it is your problem
because first it's

170
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,540
digital it it's about internet for gene

171
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,540
and awesome have can at least get on the
internet

172
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,880
the fifties it is a civil liability
depending on deputy

173
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,480
this phase its Houston also maybe the
attack has some

174
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,490
other agenda behind Aldis

175
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:38,000
maybe dear masking actual inclusion to
think that these going and maybe that's

176
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,370
why

177
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,850
that the King pretty good reflectors she
has to be careful about that

178
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,090
I am now the second component and okay

179
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:51,520
and obviously not think she cites and so
the second place this is the progress I

180
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,760
mentioned so far DNS

181
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:58,920
NDP and SNAT so dead other protocols
that can be used to do deflection

182
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,949
boast the Ashby intentionally

183
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,650
and indeed he's in I did so is because
Daisy

184
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,300
allow for amplification which was the
second point it was brought a second ago

185
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,339
I'm for the simplification mean that

186
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,090
committee in the case in the DNS which
is heavy

187
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,240
smoke weighty going to a reflective
silver

188
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,440
and then the deflector will respond with
512 bytes

189
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,410
or more depending on the protocol was up
which it said he did

190
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:30,010
exporting solve the DNS eckardt's they
can have much bigger

191
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:34,420
a responses the DNS issue as well allows
for much because responses

192
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,530
so here you're looking at in the best
case

193
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,839
you know eight times and education at
City indeed is the

194
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,510
least efficient case so that's the best
case for

195
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,380
victims but you know it could be much
worse than that

196
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,420
um so we had that thing

197
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,800
DNS and to be and S&P is wrong

198
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,310
I am know why would somebody wants to
have an SNMP

199
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:05,170
a civil exposed to the Internet that's
another question

200
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,699
but I'm definitely something they need
to look at

201
00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:13,300
I am some those are the different

202
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,089
pipes know the people 'cause it provides
fairly high

203
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:21,610
racial implications now if somebody
would like to only conceal

204
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,759
did the salsa de think they can easily
use chat again our

205
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:28,829
dicking even dual some form of seafood
am

206
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:33,149
which is only going to provide the
selection but not to the

207
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:36,720
implication that you if they just
checking on mice

208
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,259
wanna K

209
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,269
so quickly let's look at

210
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:47,829
how the DNS I infrastructure operates
and how

211
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:51,609
a defect would work and and have more
details later

212
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,660
if you use you would like to me to go
into details but

213
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,810
just teach you what's we have a user or
station which talks to Eric Garcetti so

214
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,219
usually on-premises

215
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,149
in the company or on the corporate
network and then this occurs is over

216
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:05,870
he's going to go to the Internet and

217
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,690
asked the necessary silvers working up
the chain

218
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:13,680
have the DNS the DNS name to figure out
what the IP addresses

219
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,569
and or it is a PDF acquitted it will be
the other way around

220
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:21,389
IP to name and so on so now

221
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:26,079
issue not this this super is designed to
cities disquiet only

222
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,349
so whatever this client asked to disable
going

223
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,360
work on it and respond now if there was

224
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,269
attacker somewhere over here any debt
asking that simple a question there's

225
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:40,430
really legitimate that he's for units

226
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,469
December BSing somebody on the Internet

227
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:47,910
and when this event is designed cities
corporation well

228
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,560
netscape obvious but our not too many
people to configure DNS servers

229
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,439
internet so we end up with said was that
would respond to a friendly place from

230
00:13:57,439 --> 00:13:58,219
the outside

231
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,579
now is displayed here has the sort as
short-sighted this

232
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:05,209
over cinema here the play to cashier end
is this guy

233
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:07,829
response to these victims is

234
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:11,410
it was I am dishwashing that made the
quake and

235
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,959
as explained earlier Yoshida how the
fiction works and how deeply

236
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,340
education I'll send more traffic now
have more resource

237
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,220
more mortgage-interest and we have a
problem for depicting

238
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,260
I anti-peace can if Senor

239
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,200
am so what's interesting around Mt and
key is that

240
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,460
you know we have the same thing use it
talking to an end to be super

241
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,630
need to be said rule on the Internet
fetch the time from

242
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,700
other and to be said worse and a poor

243
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,350
back now I am in entebbe there's the
notion of

244
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,060
past different strata senators are sold
the ones that they're stepping

245
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,599
not connected directly to GPS unit and
reading or some other

246
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,620
high-precision walk and that the

247
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,400
the source this information so if you
have one of dole's

248
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,520
if this is one of those that will not be
a problem but

249
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,590
most people don't need to be similar on
the network that goals and bookstore has

250
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,490
to consumers

251
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,620
um and this is what the problems now

252
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,950
many many years ago for some reason
maybe for

253
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,420
me for debugging purposes may be
somebody

254
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,130
I have no idea the way they did that but
I am

255
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:24,189
there was big men developed called Mon
least

256
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:28,500
did when issued from the user tune into
pieces wouldn't it be said

257
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,700
would respond with least up all

258
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,450
clients effort talks to it up to 600

259
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:40,250
so think about it this way I'm sending a
single query and then I get the watch

260
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,450
list up to 600 entries

261
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,970
since the 5th up to descend to be
similar

262
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:50,130
while how is that useful of change in
absolutes

263
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:55,180
have no idea and but the wait is useful
the absence would be somebody here on

264
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:55,890
the Internet

265
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:59,920
an attacker would send acquitted the NTB
said at a question

266
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,310
missed and then woods for Schmidt EE
this is

267
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,810
that is the tip to get here those for
the play with the

268
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:11,400
source idea the victim week was the
quiet again to be said again to be

269
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,310
settled his respond with all the traffic

270
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:17,359
want to the to the victim us and it's
education and then

271
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,850
we he initially thats reflecting and
amplification then

272
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:24,150
and a large number I meant to be said
for spam we have a.m.

273
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,740
one's mother traffic going to depict um

274
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,010
no the next one that is coming and I am

275
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:34,930
and like couple weeks ago was already
looking at some tools that

276
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,459
offend my got from some undergone sites

277
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,080
they were basically looking at doing
SNMP using particular S&P qua some

278
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,310
going to go in particular to do said but
this will be out soon

279
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:51,770
you know we'll be seeing those am
there's already a water skiing on the

280
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:52,480
Internet

281
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,010
a for I am is set for open S&P said
worse

282
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:59,710
you know some of those a research
station at most a dozen researchers

283
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:03,420
but I am again did

284
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,639
disinterest actually is already well
mapped actually when

285
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,140
when the DNS a text that is coming out
am could CD

286
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:15,010
entebbe an SNMP skinny was already going
so

287
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:19,230
I am the people that know what they're
doing decided to see this and before

288
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,240
later in this is like entebbe was used

289
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,400
a decent the stage and

290
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,530
yeah I'm thinking 930 to six months
French test team S&P

291
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,389
being used

292
00:17:32,389 --> 00:17:35,240
is education now

293
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,610
what can you do about it well there's
one thing you can do it should be good

294
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,620
internet citizen

295
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:48,090
I'll Janet mock trial or you don't

296
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:53,009
I think this is okay missus bobbitt and
that's classified

297
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:56,129
you she any um

298
00:17:56,129 --> 00:17:59,590
I'll she's the tribal issues you have
questions company our it now

299
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:03,749
open it is over project order and open

300
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:08,210
NTP project or is the same guy behind
them just as much

301
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,210
entity um all she does is he

302
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,299
chose a machine something old machine
accorded

303
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:17,340
usually takes about 24 hours to scan the
internet

304
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,730
I'll original sports and she provides

305
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:24,169
least of machines that responded to a
particular

306
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:30,830
ports in offering to be that would be
150 you know Dennis Jessop CEO

307
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,499
I'm lookit to look at those she
publishes

308
00:18:34,499 --> 00:18:38,169
lists and issue half

309
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:41,830
IP space love yours be launched to those
lists for

310
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,049
there's an intersection between your
titties ID space

311
00:18:45,049 --> 00:18:48,158
and those lists just going to kid I am

312
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:51,389
just really no reason for in for and

313
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:55,340
seems to be open to the Internet I'll
DNS servers there's something companies

314
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,799
that the terrain data model

315
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,789
around providing ready to seek an SMS
but unless you're

316
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:06,029
Google DNS or Open DNS on other stuff
stuff that is going to do yet another

317
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:10,320
DNS you probably don't have a reason to
be doing that I

318
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,740
also the other thing is that there is a
heating patches for bind

319
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:19,340
so if for some reason you need to
offered this is a serious

320
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,269
you can in the morning team meeting at
you should look at Michael from last

321
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:23,539
year

322
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:27,190
actually are going to some details above
the configuration of

323
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:32,159
binding how you do that %uh also he's on
the ice your website so

324
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:35,570
its its lead to the formylin walk

325
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,289
did defines the dating sites it's fairly
simple

326
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:42,658
implement in what it would do it with
just

327
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:47,610
if a pretty sure IP address which she's
the victim

328
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:51,769
East DPG the same weighty many times a
second

329
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:55,149
it would just editing it how many thanks
she's going to respond

330
00:19:55,149 --> 00:19:59,678
it his there is really no legitimate
reason for points to be asking the same

331
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:00,960
question multiple times cuz

332
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,049
based on the historical there will be a
studio in the packet bindle

333
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:08,529
decibels to cash that and Sephadex
seconds

334
00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:14,950
from some okay and that's the
mid-session Q&A

335
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:21,950
Sam

336
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:25,040
we should probably talk later died just
don't want to talk

337
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,200
does this particular records did you can
request

338
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,850
X amount of times the 1i

339
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:38,580
as important at all so kisses nature
walks in a different way

340
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,300
S&D walk is going two-goal two different
meatless

341
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,540
judicial also it would say to the
different always

342
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:50,810
in a mi a it does Bo queries

343
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:54,149
%uh Indus multiple buddy not is

344
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,810
its wat broke into tears after that
edged

345
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:00,870
but much about it because its do not why
the public

346
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:05,169
and it something is going to be
weaponized thirty-some arm

347
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:11,250
end and other morbid Austin in the BX
questions

348
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:17,140
so far okay

349
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,150
I get sure what did not change

350
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,600
and over the past year so be much

351
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,189
the business I did nothing to change

352
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:31,690
from up knees from but tensions did not
change

353
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,190
especially when you have IP addresses
the society this

354
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,200
of his kid sport are UGG

355
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,750
to the able to quickly talk to your
upstream sending

356
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,390
to be able to talk did different ups the
ante in order to to ease the traffic

357
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:45,880
because

358
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,030
despondent looking at it. force ants on
they've been looking at

359
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:53,399
compass interfaces given that they can
look at false

360
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,000
but old too much to happen you I'm
because you're under attack

361
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,910
somebody's under attack somebody's is
down at that point so

362
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,960
the better your level what had level

363
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,280
but should be had with your peers the
better for everybody as you can

364
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,520
stage effect back to the to your agents
I am

365
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,020
also am dear particularly pleased

366
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,050
actively work to remove I'll

367
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:21,950
or dear system providers that

368
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,340
to not implement I Nicolas shooting

369
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:29,050
Dennis um but your caucasian

370
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:35,060
and the Netherlands I am did is well
known for hosting or malicious activity

371
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,950
in the intention to do not a flight any
miss you think so

372
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,560
I a water G effective attacks actually
watched from

373
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,800
cuz they have really good connectivity
in with 1 gigabit interface

374
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,300
on assisting can cause a lot of damage
is usually action cyl

375
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,370
let's say that one of their peers

376
00:22:55,370 --> 00:23:00,590
dropped both couple months ago this more
coming and this is again based on some

377
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,580
community efforts

378
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:07,060
I am because when I'll system operators
the site to monetize

379
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:10,870
on being malicious this is bad for
business for everyone because this is

380
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,739
excessive amounts of bandwidth used

381
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,620
that means that their customers
occupants on some people

382
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,949
thanks to get upset million takes time

383
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:24,540
good the case takes time to a collect
the Wolves

384
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:28,310
and you should not have those partners
ready to work visa walks while the legal

385
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,490
process catches up

386
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:35,950
just not going to work okay and business
sentiment so

387
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,340
I let's look at a slightly different way
how does

388
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:43,590
little stiff is different home has
details different ranch and pointing to

389
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,689
your home page so

390
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:48,290
um its be much better off

391
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:52,310
DB TT since traffic fast upbeat

392
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,770
tool having lunch I my larger action
more bended

393
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,930
to the Internet I or hitting your

394
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:02,800
systems position situated dead in a
place where you can get it or you can

395
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,110
have access to more bandwidth

396
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:08,429
saw him talking specifically to about
companies that like to host

397
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:12,460
sheezy on-premises versus I holstein

398
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,720
a in a caucasian and I have seen many of
those same %um

399
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,670
actually believe how many watch and the
prices for some reasons to watch to host

400
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,820
on-site versus buying up space

401
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,730
outside the company um and again also

402
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:31,730
I you know if it is some kind of state
for attack against

403
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,950
actually worse tells the different
changing many customers

404
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:38,420
starting to click on links going to your
website not very different

405
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,570
so it's all about capacity did you have
television

406
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:44,919
and them debility to absorb the loss is

407
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,400
much decree want to being able to save
more users

408
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,790
it peak times I am

409
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:56,860
and a member many years ago San working
and said I was living in a place where

410
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,699
they should

411
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:01,750
realized that it's actually cheaper be
down for five minutes

412
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:06,240
on the top of New Years I because the
unit

413
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,520
everybody will be calling everybody on
top of New Years to

414
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,930
see happy new year and I am they were
just

415
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:16,130
should on the phone switches we're
talking about twenty-five years ago but

416
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,860
which should on the hostages so the
defense which is ongoing

417
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,090
fire and literally fire so

418
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:25,459
you don't that was dead mediation to the
houses

419
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,910
I'll you know if this is not acceptable
to you then you

420
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,970
may want to consider helping peace

421
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,040
your resources so that you can handle
these kinda situations

422
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,350
or maybe for some businesses aid is not

423
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:42,040
that big of a deal have worked with a
couple a hospitals

424
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,690
the TFG no critical public facing
infrastructure so they're like

425
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:49,550
a wall if the site goes down year that's
bed from the image but

426
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,860
a yet the customers will be able to
schedule online appointments

427
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,969
and they're going to call the call
center and

428
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,580
dish to 12 complete the business fine
it's not a problem for us to be down for

429
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,310
10 minutes or

430
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,700
20 minutes so its it's it's a methodist

431
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,810
no the business setting and what level
they would like to

432
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:14,659
be able to take abuse the up and

433
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,380
another way how should a position is to
management is that up denouncing this

434
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,280
condition D

435
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,100
there is your infrastructure and I am
repeating wanted in bed jurisdictions

436
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,010
you have the inner city kids to be
selling

437
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:29,010
let the house is the composer
infrastructure scratching

438
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:32,240
121 outage so if you have to talk to be

439
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,300
IT management thanks you can just
position at this hey you know what

440
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,930
if you do not want to him out each in
the story Jimmy

441
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:43,320
you buy any 10 this tragedy you do to
cash in same thing we did those

442
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,710
issue making actual be suffering you
know

443
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:50,160
down during a Thank You Tube it back by
more bandwidth

444
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,400
and more equipment she did you can't
make high levels Dec

445
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,880
and difficult what they want to do it's
you know it is you want them

446
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:04,060
and at that point its businesses and
that's pretty much :excited:

447
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,360
world too expensive ago you have

448
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,139
young mediations camp like interests you
you invested

449
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:16,520
amount of money and you know that you're
protected up to assist

450
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,710
level

451
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:22,039
up speaking by being protected to
certain level if you look at s

452
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:25,200
bag so if we have

453
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,500
the intensity of the attacks in this
direction and

454
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,080
number of attackers that can potentially
costs me

455
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,230
St attack or the Mumbai attacks new
multi-state

456
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,269
there's a 12 month attackers the Kindle

457
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:42,450
small tax and there's only a few
attackers the Kindle

458
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:47,240
meaty serious damage so didn't address
mediation

459
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,669
is basically this she getting with the
business

460
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:54,149
where these box should be should be
lower should be high

461
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:57,260
how far the bottom goals

462
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,769
it bans on how much he sources uTorrent
or how much money you

463
00:28:00,769 --> 00:28:04,630
toward its pretty simple its
businesspeople

464
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:07,779
noted technical

465
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:11,470
okay another Kenny

466
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:16,179
session see

467
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:21,970
two people still awake desk

468
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,899
I

469
00:28:23,899 --> 00:28:29,439
loans the room

470
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,950
his she acid in the lost my sight

471
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:37,680
talk to the professionals so um add
spice to the south side of my pockets on

472
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,570
a joke anymore so

473
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,689
and do what for five years ago

474
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:45,530
out vice most people to of most watch
companies to

475
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:50,850
just need to get themselves arm dist in
this was at the time when I was

476
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:54,370
suggesting that they would go 2240
between activity

477
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:58,360
and having sufficient similar capacity
to handle that

478
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:03,409
and dip there was not much more than
that I mean there was like the

479
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,950
kinda YouTube it attacked the the to
particular government institution

480
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,230
issue but there was not much I think
there was another one was about sixty

481
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:13,390
and everything else was about twenty ten
to twenty cubits

482
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:17,320
I know this outward looking at said hey

483
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,480
venison attack so if we go back to
pinch-hitter

484
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,460
we can actually find a second slice on
the first line

485
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:30,040
in may be here will be how much you
would like to be able to mediate

486
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,270
site or all on your a infrastructure

487
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:37,360
and Dan the next lane be how much would
like to

488
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,280
mitigate to ace could be provide if so
Delta she 80s

489
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,750
debt expanse that you're going to be.
including between

490
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,750
your aid you in your infrastructure in
pain to

491
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:51,080
an expensive provider to do that for you
so

492
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,949
at you know that's in business from to
define dose most boundaries

493
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:58,080
is a hey you know what I want to do up
to thank you give its on-site

494
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,970
if it is martin think bits and checked
out send them to me answer

495
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:07,410
as II have alexi injected outs think my
traffic school but then send it to me

496
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:13,420
am and had that's pretty much it better

497
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,400
that thats that song that song

498
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,850
the side its own good for sale on the
side

499
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:24,889
actually mediating the traffic up over
the last five six years there has been

500
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,910
a can have a new discipline or new brand

501
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,520
issues in numbers were called take
intelligence which is about the

502
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,120
searching

503
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,959
detectives researching the technologies
and

504
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,580
DC's another

505
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:43,419
typeof answer to your question a water
the companies

506
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:48,140
are currently working home arm being
able to identify the actors

507
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,090
attribute defects and prosecute in the
shipping more and more

508
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:56,120
about seven eight years ago it wasn't
for the for somebody to go on prosecute

509
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:01,719
people for he's getting in the house is
at or for any other online practice was

510
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,640
texting you there

511
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,210
now this morning more work in this this
area I'll

512
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:11,080
largest corporations leading into
departments did do with attribution and

513
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,240
passing information to law enforcement
to

514
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:18,300
execute the arrest and you know the toll
proper process for the everything stands

515
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:18,879
in court

516
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,690
inside so this is another set of the
question now

517
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:26,780
um another ADA's also am

518
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:29,899
each cast adrift agent agencies I'll

519
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:34,670
dealing with the sources said text so
Beach

520
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:38,720
drones or reflectors you have to have
she's on the internet the

521
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,350
12 send the traffic to attack convict
I'll

522
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:45,409
so instead of blocking everything on the
victim side

523
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:48,570
its if we shift the victim here

524
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:52,320
and this is the physician with all the
different quietest data walking

525
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,399
the attack right before the victim you
can actually

526
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,490
walk its yup points of

527
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:02,980
deflectors or yup points if the choir
have the box

528
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,140
and DC's

529
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,780
all social becoming bottom component to
the love this

530
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:13,780
the mitigation strategy but ET's it's
never going to be 100 percent efficient

531
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,480
because that is a very large amount

532
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,240
IP space that is not controlled by by

533
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,450
corporate entities that have alignment
and desires to do with those problems

534
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:29,100
budget there'll be a lot of
nation-states other countries that

535
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,389
get about it in traffic will be coming
from there and

536
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:36,820
we also for political reasons do not
want to disconnect

537
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:42,399
contentious internet I so so they will
be stew some traffic coming but did

538
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,539
there'll be other magicians two keys
that as I said in shitty you

539
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:52,539
having bishop had a great song

540
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:06,100
sul did his nose chichi types because

541
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,549
you DNG eased I'll it's dull doesn't
matter if it was a

542
00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:14,299
you know being forward seem word or an
IT sector DNS

543
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:18,789
but um the was the 50 they want and a
few

544
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:22,710
to be fairly used to execute now they
started

545
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:29,259
DNS infection in computer flexion from
point a view the house is

546
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:33,480
so I wanted did that would be the to the
data currently do

547
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,629
and dorsey Thanksgiving secure

548
00:33:36,629 --> 00:33:43,428
property is just as effective other
questions

549
00:33:43,429 --> 00:33:47,590
okay

550
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:50,999
mitigation so Kenneth

551
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:55,080
few categories you're so you can defend
yourself my order to cover this for its

552
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,080
okay interest um

553
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,970
you can defend yourself the different
technologies for example if you're

554
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,200
defending DNS

555
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,679
energy have large infrastructure you can
employ any cast where you have multiple

556
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:05,859
physical seems

557
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:10,279
a s English to the same IP address I
handle SimCity

558
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,720
steve did you in different geographies
we separate connectivity

559
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,839
so I there's a high-level again this
year

560
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:20,710
I the other one is be deducted tradition
year

561
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:24,290
there's your vendors that are focusing
solely

562
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:30,049
on that I am and the West London I have
seen

563
00:34:30,049 --> 00:34:33,409
over too many times is the overall
network picture

564
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:37,329
still if you think did a firewall cindie

565
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:41,859
put in front of your website list and
will stop the bad guys

566
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:44,918
yes it will stop the bad guys

567
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:48,069
it will stop everybody from access your
website

568
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:51,129
because the final the first thing that
is going to burn down

569
00:34:51,129 --> 00:34:54,808
when there's enough service so you know
its comic

570
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:59,869
which completely secure though and it is
important but what does

571
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:02,970
good doesn't it for the temple bolted to
the floor

572
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:06,709
so a a waterbody

573
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:10,720
all this type of pictures that were
pushed by particular

574
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,990
handle vendors more including fire was
it that a

575
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:19,220
fairly quarter the edge ended just
doesn't work doesn't skip

576
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:22,430
arm you know also issued think about it

577
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:27,940
long before chain for checkpoint stopped
sending files which was the first

578
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:31,960
device that was a single device to
school tomorrow there was two finals

579
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,960
arm in definition for firewall

580
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,970
is set the measures that separates from
another

581
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:42,240
does not need to be one single box or
what single point the failure

582
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,419
so the committee in this way you can
start

583
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:51,420
leading the defense in the furthest for
the out in the perimeter

584
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,160
you can just stateless access-list it
only a law system port

585
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:00,078
then after that you do I am that you can
deploy some mitigation equipment

586
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,430
then after the mediation with mint you
can have from tens

587
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:07,348
did that completely stateless with no
date on that %uh

588
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:11,279
dan after the front ends for example you
can deploy filed

589
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:14,410
is going to do some most easily fixed
inspection or do you

590
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:18,009
may not deploy for all the way she may
do something else humane

591
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,980
you have middle tier it is going to do
brokering of connections between

592
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,019
different systems

593
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:26,758
and then only the system is it important
to you can follow of somebody's

594
00:36:26,759 --> 00:36:29,890
but if you think a bit

595
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:33,288
I am fire always nothing more day
mortified

596
00:36:33,289 --> 00:36:37,019
books you can have a box it came to
inspection the traffic

597
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:40,470
and you don't like the West usually are

598
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:43,709
some don't busy

599
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,420
dip dish understand what you're doing
when you're when you're taking the

600
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,160
nitrogen

601
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,578
come by for one towards implementing
thinking digital

602
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:54,569
children deceitful

603
00:36:54,569 --> 00:36:58,150
now second category is defending commit
so that that that is becoming more and

604
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,030
more important

605
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:02,369
over the past couple years with the

606
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:05,480
with the proliferation reflect DNS

607
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,359
NTP because the core of the problem

608
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,509
he's actually all those collectors and

609
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,520
issue can't be good internet citizen

610
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,540
are impetuous am

611
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:22,609
did beast you all water collectives it
will be useful to texts

612
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:26,950
so at this point it is about protecting
the internet from

613
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:31,220
ourselves because we become part those
I'm you know endorse

614
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,290
love this infrastructure that is used
for attacks are

615
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:37,720
in particular be should be two TD's deep
reviews

616
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,730
attempts to described whole shooting
should work

617
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:44,000
but you have to summarize it they simply

618
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,130
issue have stuff networks matters with
only one connection to the Internet at:

619
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:48,569
your

620
00:37:48,569 --> 00:37:53,058
DMZ Sansone there is no reason for them
to be originating traffic with

621
00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:56,150
IP space with IP addresses do not belong
to you

622
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,329
this is really no reason and so

623
00:37:59,329 --> 00:38:02,540
have that implemented am it's not many
lies

624
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:06,160
assists situations arm

625
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,210
in this is going to at least the venture
from being

626
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:14,270
one of the selectors I am social when
you're talking to police

627
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:18,420
other companies in college them to the
so because

628
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,720
a you know here in the US we have
watched an activity

629
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,569
and we're making much but the deflectors
dan

630
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:29,160
me know machine somewhere in the machine
shop in China

631
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,779
just we just have more abilities to
damage

632
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,450
or be used to cause more damage to
others

633
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:41,029
and

634
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:44,299
again talk to the professional snow
detection becoming

635
00:38:44,299 --> 00:38:49,319
large enough so that it's not really
reasonable for somebody to invest

636
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:51,500
the amount of money to be able to

637
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,370
BTG does be shrewd

638
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:57,540
38 offer you some

639
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:02,680
and the tank chief users to persist when
she wrote that who works for small

640
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,200
to intelligence company speaking after
intelligence

641
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,460
arm does it

642
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,040
took it easy to mistake looking at but
there's also a lot more on the Internet

643
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,820
and I have a sled

644
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,850
corner at is not good because

645
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:23,299
supposed to go this way ashen

646
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:27,670
to so to defend yourself any case for
DNS

647
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:32,520
did a stint addition equipment defend
internet they're all posts more things

648
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,380
that you can do

649
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,890
them in the morning more of them but
they're VAT

650
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:40,359
chief to implement a team meeting a bomb
threat thing

651
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,630
you know public computer DNS servers

652
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:46,870
so the first two cost a lot of money you
know

653
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:51,000
the APS sorry this mediation devices
cost a lot of money

654
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,610
being able to take any casting
structured cost a lot of money as well

655
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:57,940
arm the other ones fairly cheap so

656
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:03,550
you know my mobile with stem again it
requires that everybody where she

657

659
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:21,210
already covered that so so but
corporations or both being good

660
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:24,770
internet isn't and

661
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:28,960
dip companies have to start looking at

662
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,260
what damaged a camp eventually cost
internet other

663
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,510
response versus only looking at

664
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:39,890
what can hurt them

665
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:41,290
chain its

666

important when you're dealing with you

673
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:08,960
