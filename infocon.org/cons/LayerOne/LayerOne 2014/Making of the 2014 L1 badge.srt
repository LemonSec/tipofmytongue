1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:07,399
I'm I missed

2
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:20,460
guy I hope you guys had a good lunch did
you go to the EQ backs launch

3
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,980
john Jaso the it went up in the air

4
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,030
well yeah table ok

5
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:36,020
go helium buttons cell

6
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,300
I am before we started stock we also
have all the contests are going on now

7
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,559
ID applications live CT apt is live if
you sign up for tamper evident you are

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,239
lamenting why you did that in the first
place about right now

9
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,709
I but this is Chris Charlie nm

10
00:00:53,710 --> 00:01:00,710
and they'll be talking about this year's
batch K

11
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:08,810
cell I just frat warning and we haven't
really slept in the last 24 hours

12
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:15,810
so please email of that might be why
he's got it now

13
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,250
I A now I just saw a background we've
been doing

14
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,690
this is the fourth year we've done
electronic badges we really tried to

15
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,990
make something really cool and
interesting and this is the first

16
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:29,710
electron

17
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,830
actually dead this was and many
synthesizer

18
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:39,369
display

19
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:42,630
this is the the speaker batch for the
same here

20
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,469
this is actually the first and Bajnai it
kinda done so well

21
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:50,809
was not easy and they made me do it just
to learn

22
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,880
cell and Shipley then be dead

23
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,280
and I see remote and it came with a
little shield for speakers as well

24
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,859
then this is last year's which was
really awesome can do a mini

25
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,630
oscilloscope in logic analyzer

26
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:11,900
also was some really cool LED's just to
have

27
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,170
more blinking and Madonna

28
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:21,929
all else fails they make really great
custer's hand okay so

29
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,349
at the background for this year's batch
and

30
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:29,310
this is totally something that we've
tried to do before

31
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,329
and when NFL is for start-up we did this

32
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:38,099
approx mark 3 LCD is a a group project
and it was honored

33
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:43,250
lot of people had not dan's tiny tiny
service mount soldering before

34
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,900
and and end up with a lot of trouble
shooting

35
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,040
this is a printout

36
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,418
that by stockers photo

37
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:57,859
credit given and

38
00:02:57,859 --> 00:03:01,480
this is something that we print it out
and if thou so that you could kind of

39
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:08,480
track the massive amounts have component
that detected at this point this is when

40
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,970
things went wrong

41
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:15,349
on one at the board's we had to do

42
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:18,869
a a lot of different antenna tests I am

43
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,910
there's the elephant as an HF antennas
and we can make our own

44
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,849
lot a different lot different s which I
am

45
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:33,418
seen seen our own and

46
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:38,180
that didn't work out

47
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,180
so this year add Charlie it started
their badges I know eyelashes airline

48
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,500
with the goal to have it done by
Christmas

49
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,200
cuz that's always kind of the goal to
have it done by Chris

50
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,670
and believe it or not we have a revision
done by Chris

51
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:57,220
there was actually a bad totally done
working by Christmas

52
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,770
first to

53
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:06,630
and a

54
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,070
a badge one batch singular

55
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,549
an cell

56
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:17,829
like I said little little sleep I also
only just finished this

57
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,900
said and

58
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:25,270
okay so the proxy Park

59
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,359
overall is a really complex board and
there is roughly

60
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,580
200 parts and and its it can definitely
be tricky

61
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,500
so you can understand how someone might
go little bit crazy

62
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,530
having to route several revisions

63
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,469
have something like this and there were

64
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,130
lots and lots of provisions and for one
of them

65
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,880
Charlie spend that ten hours straight
trying to you finish it to make a

66
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,580
deadline

67
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,719
to order the PCB's and there with
another

68
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,350
revision that he we actually title
Charlie X losses night

69
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:07,510
because he had done it so many times
right

70
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,889
you mean yes

71
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:12,030
so the preservation every day and they
didn't have a hardware SPI

72
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,150
and and it turned out when run fast
enough

73
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,599
so we had to change in animee I did the
hardware SPI but then we missed a few

74
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:20,270
items

75
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,729
mistakes on the PCB's I'm in another
revision

76
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:28,539
and miss some power lines cell

77
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:31,719
that was well reaction

78
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:35,280
and getting now in and made cell

79
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,150
but didn't have to worry about it they
were just moved on to the next one so

80
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,520
there are two revisions that

81
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,109
repeatedly that use the stm32 f1

82
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,550
and Charlie hard to really really hard
today

83
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,699
get this one to you transfer from the
FPGA at 13.56 cock

84
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:55,180
but then arco discovered that there is a
24

85
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,979
megahertz chance for required yours
absolutely no way without

86
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:02,529
chip was going to make it happen so on
to the next one

87
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:07,330
as so then we started using the fam 7

88
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,969
much was an because we knew good work

89
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:15,089
because on the original box marked and

90
00:06:15,089 --> 00:06:18,740
but we did make it new Buddha make it
better

91
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,960
and we did include 512kb flash memory

92
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,460
so it is improvement

93
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,150
Alan the whole reason why there was the
tragic loss is mine is because after he

94
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,250
had already submitted

95
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,380
this year's badges he went ahead and
made a whole new one

96
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:40,730
just cuts this is

97
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:44,520
this year's

98
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,380
and okay citizen background on the
ordering process

99
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,520
and we ordered these from %ah to
different places

100
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,549
and the first party ordered we actually
ordered from inside the US it is really

101
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,319
expensive

102
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:01,289
but supposedly it doesn't take much time
they claim to have a one-day turnaround

103
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:03,300
end up being about a four-day turnaround

104
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,530
and about three and all yours for only
five boards

105
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,219
but much I need a quick testing can be
convenient

106
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,460
but when me again these boards made for
the conference's

107
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,138
we got two summers ago it wasn't which
is in Malaysia so it takes a little bit

108
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:20,160
longer but definitely cheaper

109
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,530
seventy body is interested in making
their own PCB's

110
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:30,530
and is definitely a company worth
looking into I did the really great

111
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,520
and %um pretty well ongoing relationship
with them

112
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,240
so hate relationship really

113
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,710
an detd

114
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:49,210
sigh I lost my spot month

115
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,489
okay so one thing that when you add
dealer to PCB's

116
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,470
one thing to know is that they charge
based on the square inches if you're

117
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:57,940
bored

118
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,330
so does it really matter the shape it's
the overall strange is that it takes

119
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:04,659
cell when we order the LF antenna

120
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,550
we head and kinda

121
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,060
planned out how much its gonna cost me
submitted the order and then we noticed

122
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,350
immediately that it was far more
expensive

123
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,440
then we had calculated ourself and the
reason for that

124
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,610
is that when you

125
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:26,020
to secure the board's you wanna kinda
turned into an angle if you have

126
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,380
anything protruding out to them

127
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,210
so that way it's not taking any
additional space the first time we did

128
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,380
it we did it this way

129
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:37,960
cell and staying at more space and the
cost increased significantly

130
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,770
citizens I know when you're making your
own we also

131
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:46,100
found out then this is something that I
had only just learned and we were told

132
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,960
by the many

133
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,980
by soldiers are kids the Paley it's
really difficult to make

134
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:55,470
oils their really really touchy and
every step of the process

135
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,190
and sell there was really good chance
that they would like for the dead

136
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,860
which is great okay

137
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,530
cell background on what it takes to
bring you this

138
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,579
badge tons and tons of time

139
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:14,600
so there's like months of planning
different provisions ordering

140
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,520
boards testing the boards or in part

141
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:24,069
and a huge invasion space this is my
dining room table

142
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,700
it is a 10 foot long table it is cuz
hovered

143
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,339
impact in all these parts are actually
being used on the match

144
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:36,100
so the next two parts they're all the
parts that are actually being used

145
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,200
everywhere

146
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,390
this is my his the kitchen counter where
we are making sense of

147
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:48,280
so there's paste everywhere and led all
over the counter

148
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:54,260
we didn't we prima a take-out and indeed
and in millions plates cuz they were

149
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:54,780
everywhere

150
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,319
was on the floor their tissues
everywhere this is the net

151
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,280
completely different tableware wonder
being assembled it

152
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,180
the huge station at Faith okay

153
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:14,819
so what is it actually deal in nineteen
nothing

154
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,540
the what it could do what it's supposed
to do

155
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,980
is an read RFID cards

156
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:28,190
obviously and you can call them IFAD
cards you ken

157
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:32,100
simulate replay which is similarly any
and any recorded card the hash

158
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,280
analyze way forms and you can intercept
information from other readers

159
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,400
and you can save we've also included an
SD card

160
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,480
and pad so that you can

161
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,500
use that to store information and we are
still

162
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,380
building these so if you haven't really
seen any around it's because they're

163
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,470
still being assembled

164
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,700
and Dino sleeping in 24 hours there

165
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:04,440
with a big shout out to March here just
ten JK who have been staying up with us

166
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,250
to help us bring you these boards

167
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,650
so yes a round of applause for them

168
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:15,709
they don't have to do it they're just
doing it to be nice

169
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:18,969
and some people are under the impression
that you're going to provide eases

170
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,910
can't and it would be really really
difficult

171
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,848
to you give you a kit to do you land

172
00:11:26,849 --> 00:11:31,489
like I said and over 200 parts yes

173
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:37,039
so we have the parts if you wanna make
your own K hop

174
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,489
take it yeah

175
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:45,659
so hopefully we'll have kids but the
kids are just gonna be n

176
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:49,259
they're gonna be a lot less part
significantly a lot less parts and it's

177
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:50,079
basically getting

178
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,498
allow you to use the LED on the board
can also come to the really awesome Sam

179
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:57,129
7 really expensive check

180
00:11:57,129 --> 00:12:00,359
cell has

181
00:12:00,359 --> 00:12:04,949
or small

182
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:10,179
or again which is really important

183
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:13,409
my checklists during this whole process
is really important that you double

184
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:16,929
check all a tactless you check your
inventory and make sure all your parts

185
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:18,850
fit before you show it to the conference

186
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,739
homes have the same

187
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:27,089
but they don't they battled

188
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:31,029
iPad the kids were gonna start selling
them after the talk in the hardware

189
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:33,179
hacking village they're gonna be forty
dollars

190
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:36,608
and the companies that have instructions
when you buy the kit there are

191
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:40,229
only a limited amount and so when you do
buy them there are some specialized

192
00:12:40,229 --> 00:12:41,089
instructions

193
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:44,549
that I'll give to you because there's no
way I can write them down

194
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:48,470
without showing on the board an hour
gonna do lined up

195
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,540
known

196
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:54,380
open up okay both batters died

197
00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:01,189
hard

198
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:05,310
hard

199
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:09,219
about all

200
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:16,220
hard keeping

201
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:24,760
okay so

202
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,040
normally on a those have a circuits
elect

203
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,949
cut itself off act I like 2.3 air like
2.5 volts

204
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:38,530
and I'm I decided to let it run

205
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,720
as far as the battery would allow so in
theory you can write it down to zero

206
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,860
volts

207
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,290
which isn't very good for the battery
but I figured you know you're all adults

208
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:47,670
seeking

209
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:51,280
figure it out I'll also use that extra
like 30 minutes

210
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,300
runtime: cell the batteries are

211
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,800
the replacement batteries for a Apple
iPod

212
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,650
second generation touch so they're about
to three dollars

213
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:06,329
said a few do runners down it dies in
Orem

214
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:09,450
protease part number: I am

215
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,710
the pork and destroy itself because

216
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:18,410
it makes enough power on the help let to
come back around and zap it's ATC

217
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:25,410
cell that's exciting I'll

218
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:26,988
but

219
00:14:26,989 --> 00:14:30,739
but that that's a good thing cuz you
wanna be able to send as much power as

220
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:31,769
as possible

221
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:35,189
rikers madame back Tagore retarded

222
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:38,329
far away or you know or yeah I'm

223
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:41,679
the wall your investigating might be

224
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,199
Sheldon topper like this here I am

225
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,919
cell that's a good thing us article

226
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,959
Oso

227
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:59,809
yeah so that because you toward I just
kinda placeholder batch

228
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:02,988
and and what it was gonna be head

229
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:07,859
on mine it actually is is the second
layer I get attached

230
00:15:07,859 --> 00:15:11,970
like so yet and

231
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,989
I've wired up a plus the bottom

232
00:15:14,989 --> 00:15:19,549
so my might procs mark has a built-in
internal antenna

233
00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:25,309
cell it's like as opposed to normally

234
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:30,309
pong so

235
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:35,660
normally you have at this thing hanging
off and that's your lover content on a

236
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,839
I have this little call in the back

237
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,089
I had actually sent you

238
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:46,759
combined hand

239
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:49,779
I think gonna ended

240
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:54,100
up

241
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,540
ok anyone is familiar approx mock

242
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,260
we site started bombing on in all
divisions about my transpass was the

243
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,040
the potluck free there's been another
LCD mark

244
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,910
which we built like years ago doesn't
work it's never works

245
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:15,170
agent ones so this is a completely
redesigned

246
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:20,769
approx mark free with real telepath done
properly suspects mafia telepath

247
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:23,899
with the old which is different SD card

248
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:28,910
it's the 500 talk aged speaker that is
not connected with b2b websites

249
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,019
buckingham

250
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:33,040
change that was morning

251
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,060
buckets fully compatible with the

252
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,329
dick gephardt version at the source
close you can download us

253
00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:43,800
the source code I made a VM which is 4
G's a month to

254
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,359
is good GCC installed in action value
goes up his tight make

255
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,060
we also included other reef ice foreign
you can reflash

256
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,760
through thick gooey and so there's a
command line toward

257
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,519
questions initially loaded you will
replace it a.m.

258
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,110
just before we started the data we tried
a and you can see here's a test the

259
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,970
antennas for tea party-backed six-fold

260
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,400
into a burglar's which is you know
punish me to tag

261
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,480
you would've done live on stage here on
earth mean that but this is the new ago

262
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,049
a so one agrees we started to talk
markets cuz when we initially day

263
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:18,619
is horrible

264
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:22,409
something to do with me and the Middle

265
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,860
0 sorry but I'm

266
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:31,219
Rosa gotta

267
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,430
so data part of a when we first started
using it was

268
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,610
all forty use like no one knows how to
use it so

269
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:42,070
my first props mark was actually a stud
finder unseen video that but it plays

270
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:46,850
The Simpsons and find studs and because
I couldn't be bothered used to do it I'm

271
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,810
SES this what does the windows one is a
Linux one on this until kinda nice you

272
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,909
can just open it up

273
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,180
click on it and it worked or you can
just use the command-line version other

274
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,600
just like if you use these in post
market works at:

275
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,840
so all that is there all the tags

276
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,770
I'm and then radio or came out with the
chinese want it's compatible with that

277
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:05,780
too as well but

278
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,940
ours is way beyond that I'm so I think
this is a better want to do what it is

279
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,490
we're going to do is loss which the

280
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,420
and her driver's so you can do more than
13.56 megahertz

281
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,570
is clearly cause of crystal because the
new chip for use in is a hundred and

282
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,720
fastest the to you megahertz think

283
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,960
I'm sdmf t54 it's got a megabyte

284
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,220
Rome as well and that's going to be the
that's all I lost my mind

285
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,230
decides make up about a week and a half
ago I am

286
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:39,000
and we're gonna keep going back to keep
making it but think this will be a lot

287
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,400
better

288
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,880
I am Anderson if any was up smoke-free

289
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,110
LCD you cannot get a chance to work

290
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:49,679
reliably but I think this will work
really well I'm

291
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,470
I made a Windows version of the bill
does well for people don't use

292
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:58,160
like these in Linux because I don't like
using Linux like using Windows

293
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,859
so as polarizing but there you go

294
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:04,779
her I'm about to have a I'm having a
contest in the

295
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:08,299
toted me a hardware hacking village if
anything right Microsoft Word quicker

296
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:09,019
than I can

297
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:12,389
in the nets this o'clock at night in
Windows Jer

298
00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:15,928
take me five minutes because I'm gonna
use a committee

299
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:20,549
but Sir got flash tools and stuff either

300
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:23,899
all ready to go israel's up

301

news editor finds Michael Gray

325
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,460
and yes they will build the ball or run
the code does missed

326
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,930
mine doesn't seem to be connected to
these you concede that Israel

327
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:04,200
hence the happy fine jumper wire

328
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,120
from whole here yes

329
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,510

mode still yes

335
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,240
hey does this repeal loaded with like a
hundred different chip 100 different

336
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,960
shit tubes

337
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,029
I'll we did forget one get one thing

338
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:44,789
on the back at the batch she flip it
over with the side that has the

339
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:49,039
doesn't have the logos you notice is a
chip that doesn't like it's connected to

340
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:49,539
anything

341
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:56,539
and it says good look next to it every
see that I got the soloist was measured

342
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,129
the right no

343
00:21:58,129 --> 00:22:03,498
thats bit fury ASIC so is capable of
generating because if I make asses

344
00:22:03,499 --> 00:22:07,350
should put a chip on their I have some
other ships well

345
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:11,449
official of the just closer up

346
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:15,610
the I

347
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:19,258
it will work if you publicize you for
the circuit will work you can connect

348
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:20,169
today

349
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:23,950
by harm in it will run he said

350
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,309
yes yeah

351
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:30,879
has SS are idea 156 it does

352
00:22:30,879 --> 00:22:35,949
it does and does from 143 144 be all the
usual stuff but

353
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:39,559
they've added on the whole bunch stuff
which is Carlos Amy fours like

354
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:43,649
when we initially side pockets crack but
people have been working on the

355
00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:46,959
for some reason decided to pick up the
key in the last year so and know the

356
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,340
whole bunch of stuff

357
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,289
chip test centres the state can also can
be right and cause a lot of people

358
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,279
familiar with approx what we're seeing
the Dr

359
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:57,730
you can call because he can take a card
it will read it

360
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:01,179
put a black katana it will overwrite a
and you can also

361
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:05,009
overwrite some cause I'm even if they're
not been pre-programmed

362
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:08,499
so as well as the ability to clone and
simulate

363
00:23:08,499 --> 00:23:14,659
you can just hop pop deposit like crazy

364
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:20,070
a question

365
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:26,000

366
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,120
of shop scars on my arms

367

374
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:03,270
unlike most commercial readers I

375
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:07,040
which have a a set number I'll hoping to
decode

376
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:10,889
I scare however much questions like
these %uh

377

FAA new format comes out I'll

379
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,970
as long as you know about format is you
can program

380
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:25,580
PJD for you this has quite a few

381
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,750
likes of stronger up

383
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:38,130
in case you do it can be added
