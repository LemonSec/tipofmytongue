1
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:10,860
so

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,059
are for speakers ready to come up here
we have

3
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:17,650
Danielle giving a talk on privacy in law
in

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,709
all sorts of very important stuff you
should probably care more about than you

5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:21,020
do

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:28,020
so welcome Daniel actually I'm not gonna
be speaking about law at all because

7
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:36,840
that's boring as hell

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,840
and right here for that why I'm gonna be
speaking on is basically

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,440
the importance love your community

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,769
and a are liberty and freedoms today

11
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,989
but we gonna start also are so I'm a
star

12
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:56,570
with the a few things i wanna talk about
overall first

13
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,030
who am i were I come from

14
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,049
its works on our privacy fears why you
should have fears like you know this but

15
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,299
it's nice to reiterated odd privacy
abuses tree so does it sound like I'm

16
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:09,400
making this stuff up

17
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,049
being a conspiracy theorist an essay
scandals

18
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,630
artists stay in touch with what's going
on privacy legislation that I pushed

19
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:22,399
what can states do since the Fed's won't
do anything except abuse all rights

20
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,430
why montana which is why I'm from

21
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:31,950
and what is the firewall freedom well as
a last resort the first words montana

22
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,619
I know you guys know this montana is in
red

23
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,740
and also the COS one more politically
right california's in blue

24
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:48,520
that's we're at right now for those you
who are lost a

25
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,690
a

26
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:53,700
alright my background my family actually
moved in from or Jan

27
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,180
in nineteen ninety four's overpopulated
they want to get out they want to raise

28
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,470
their kids and %uh

29
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:01,740
3 in 3 environment

30
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,140
it was great %uh my grandparents are
russians who literally escape communism

31
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,720
and a move to iran and where my dad was
born

32
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,560
so I have some history on Aug government
takeover in that area

33
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,680
and then the other grandparents are
Italian one who fought with the United

34
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,630
States against the Japanese and Italian
immigrants so

35
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,440
some pretty good history right there on
what is important what you have to fight

36
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:26,940
for

37
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,040
and when you need to fight for it I
graduate from

38
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,200
roundup high school ice wanna put that
out there all the time anyway I speak

39
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,429
because no one's heard around

40
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,020
high school town 2,000 people in a
30-mile radius with more cows than

41
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,770
people

42
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,840
its quite fascinating that I'm even here
today I went to university Mont addis a

43
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,430
public

44
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,240
I'll University three majors and a
political science minor

45
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,040
after that I implemented state
government taxes since I saw what might

46
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,320
behind the scenes and

47
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,480
State Department's and it was a joke a
special laws being passed that didn't

48
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,340
make sense

49
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,220
that were on policy to tax you guys more
and more

50
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,440
a it was not my kinda career I want to
do to try to make me a programmer and

51
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,510
I'm more of a social guy

52
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,420
so thats why I'm speaking from you guys
apparently

53
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:19,380
came back to montana ran for office so
here's just one question

54
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,560
you here and you have to raise your hand
if you think so

55
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,650
who here thank you I love guys in the
back to hear believes they have a role

56
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,890
to play in politics policy government
who you're actually thinks that that

57
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,798
something that they have an important
role in so what have you

58
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:37,790
that's actually an unprecedented amount
%uh

59
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,859
will talk about why is probably most
evolve you

60
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:48,860
cool may have a role

61
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,510
I was most concerned about is our
government is obtaining

62
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,599
all this data possible again I was
always what happens if they collect this

63
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,310
data

64
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,289
now it is we know that they're
collecting it

65
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:37,159
great until you get to the next point

66
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:41,639
where you gotta think about human nature
to err is human to forgive divine

67
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,139
I know everybody in here has done
something stupid in their life because I

68
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:47,199
know I've done quite a few stupid things
yeah

69
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,210
last night some you guys probably broke
curfew laws

70
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,770
you know what you learn from it one day
maybe maybe not but

71
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:58,250
the fact that all what you did last
night or in your past may be recorded

72
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,080
somewhere

73
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,250
to be found out a later time to be used
against you is the biggest threat and

74
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,530
concern that people

75
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,309
%uh should have to use information
against an opponent

76
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,599
is politics and what is politics about
does anybody know

77
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:16,060
power

78
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,909
money is about power cuz in the end
result

79
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:25,250
it's about power %uh sold the loss was
power tends to corrupt and absolute

80
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,710
power corrupts

81
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,258
absolutely so you get these people
enough power and they're gonna want more

82
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,659
you give them the ability to abuse a
system

83
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:37,759
that was meant for the idea of security
and they will abuse it

84
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,759
so has this happened before

85
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,020
yes it has J edgar Hoover was ahead the
FBI and the organization prior for about

86
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,109
forty eight years

87
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:54,099
his he transform the FBI into his
private secret police force and I read

88
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:56,680
this quote from President Harry S Truman

89
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,669
we want no gestapo or secret police FBI
standing in that direction they're

90
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:02,508
doubling and sex life scandals

91
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:06,300
and plain black male J edgar hoover
would give his right eye to take over

92
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,419
and all congressmen and

93
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:12,740
arstan and senators are free to PM when
you have

94
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,360
elected officials like myself your phone
individual who was swaying my boat

95
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,839
you no longer have a democracy one other
thing is they tried to

96
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:26,979
with his data he try to %uh derail
Martin Luther King's

97
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:30,599
our stances with his sex life scandals

98
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:36,550
by nineteen sixty the FBI had subversive
files on some 432,000 Americans

99
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,319
this is history this was before and use
technology happened

100
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,969
who read had or was %uh created hoover
use black male politicians

101
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:47,490
including ya

102
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,600
883 files on senators and some 172 files
on congressman

103
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,540
most these were shredded but here's a
interesting example what was contained

104
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,040
unique name withheld said

105
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,040
she had spent the afternoon up 3 June
1959 was senator

106
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,390
name withheld in his private office she
also said she had sexual intercourse

107
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,919
with the senator during the afternoon on
the couch in the Senators office

108
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,230
well that that is expected in politics
so

109
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:20,060
but the fact that you would present
these files saying oh you look into what

110
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,920
the FBI's doing how would I let this go
on be released

111
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,430
and all the sudden all the senator this
was as top priority anymore he had more

112
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,550
important things to do

113
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:32,410
in Watergate scandal this is the

114
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:37,070
gonna go back one this was the example
of one individual

115
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:41,740
getting all is power in abusing in our
system here is an example of

116
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,510
politics abusing on data collection
which

117
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,770
was done June 17 1972

118
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:52,400
basic most you may know this but five
men were arrested two thirty trying to

119
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,190
buck the office

120
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:56,300
the democratic national committee at the
Watergate Hotel

121
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,470
because you know what information is the
most useful thing in politics

122
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,520
we know something about the other guy
they're gonna expose it right before by

123
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,370
such voting

124
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,500
to derail them on now that we all began
twelve years of history on us

125
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,479
%uh expect that to happen there aren't
very few notable individuals in politics

126
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:14,020
today

127
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,900
especially DC level %uh this event
actually prompted montana

128
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,020
saudis the data privacy cause in the
state's constitution

129
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:27,870
analysis do the historic abuse and how
state gathered information

130
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:32,219
the stars you which was eastern Germany

131
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:37,479
they collected enough paper to fill more
than a hundred miles ourselves

132
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:41,990
and the index a cross-reference a five
and a half million names

133
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:46,260
of hundreds of thousands of unofficial
employees are basically writing out each

134
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,850
other

135
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,380
fall

136
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:55,380
for me me for potions to

137
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:59,220
any

138
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,029
said started by the government basically
is how it this is

139
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:07,260
the amazing thing is they only could top
$40 phones a time because of a lack of a

140
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,660
equipment and technology and I was still
enough to keep an entire nation at bay

141
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,100
for a while anyway for decades so

142
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,310
let's look at it because pictures are a
lot more amusing than words

143
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,050
here is what the area the stars the
filing cabinets amounts to you

144
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:27,630
%uh which is basically a terminal to
Salt Lake City

145
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:34,630
International Airport day the lineup

146
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,300
to a few weeks later we learned about
information are informational government

147
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,310
partnerships

148
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:01,469
partnerships with companies revealed
including Microsoft

149
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,240
now when government put enough pressure
on companies

150
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,260
to act a certain way that's more fascism

151
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,209
up few months later we learned about NSA
employees

152
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:16,250
more spying on ex-lovers so

153
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:21,980
there's on your first abuses of the
system a week later the black budgeted

154
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:27,230
intelligence community is release which
is 50 2.6 billion for 2013

155
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,459
as a lot of money 0

156
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:36,260
few days later AT&T we learned ATT
calling records database used by the DEA

157
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,589
goes back twenty years and

158
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:44,560
few weeks after that we learned that the
NSA stores metadata millions of web

159
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,930
users for up to year

160
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,839
only because the storage issues those
store longer but they ran outta space

161
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:57,160
that's embarrassing up October 2nd NSA
tracks of a location Americans for up to

162
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,689
two years is the one that I kinda hone
in on during the last session all talk

163
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,399
about later

164
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:04,779
october thirtieth dennis et breaks into
Google Yahoo data centers

165
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:08,300
I and does it without them knowing

166
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,089
interestingly enough we learned recently
that Google was agreeing to work with

167
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:12,500
this

168
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,899
an assay as well so you down kinda gets
tricky

169
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:20,120
or they only sharing some information
and the rest they were shane has been

170
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:20,890
stolen

171
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,810
the summer for the essay was collected
by billing records a mobile phone

172
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,369
location

173
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:30,360
daily and generous 16th Dennis it was
collecting millions attacks

174
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,990
I don't know why that was on the first
ones cuz very know the recording our

175
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:33,730
phone calls

176
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,190
ugh every seven 20 percent

177
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,240
up to 30 percent of all call calls are
being recorded

178
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,310
again because the storage issues that's
sad

179
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:47,099
here's here's the one I like to use a
put it out there cuz this is the most

180
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,130
important thing

181
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,570
that can affect our future November 26
the essay spot nah

182
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:56,560
just and you can apply to any have it
from my friends look up how to make a

183
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,959
homemade guns to

184
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:01,219
poor habits to whatever to how to hack
things

185
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,290
that could be considered not legal %ah
did the National Security Agency

186
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,500
has been gathering records online sexual
activity in evidence

187
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,699
visits to pornographic web sites as part
of a proposed plan to harm the

188
00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:15,870
reputations of those from the agency

189
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,670
believes are radicalizing others through
%uh speeches according to a top secret

190
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:24,279
NSA document so this could be me

191
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:28,899
radicalizing you the document provided
by

192
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:32,149
Edward snow in identifies help personal
personal

193
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:35,220
vulnerabilities can be learned through
electronic surveillance

194
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,480
and then exploited to undermine the
targets credibility reputation and

195
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,220
authority

196
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,370
this has been going on

197
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:49,000
this exists today okay

198
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,290
so this is the only technical part all
really get into

199
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,019
I'll be pretty quick is the third party
doctrine

200
00:13:56,019 --> 00:14:00,949
which easily enough says that

201
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:05,399
%uh it

202
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,740
addresses voluntary incomplete compelled
disclosure of stored wire

203
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,839
and electronic communications and
transactions transactional records basis

204
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:14,230
says

205
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,709
if you use a third-party provider you
give up your

206
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:20,859
%uh your privacy you're right

207
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,250
up the Fourth Amendment protection with
that information the prom how does not

208
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,709
my constituents know that

209
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:30,250
my get elected I go talk to I try to
talk to as many as them as possible

210
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,079
meaning and knock on their doors

211
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,138
I'm not dumb I just searched or
one-and-a-half times

212
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:38,170
no one knew that they've given the
permission

213
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,949
other information being shared son make
them I

214
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:46,990
you know may be uninformed as I mean it
should be their fault

215
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,540
no if they're not if they don't know
this

216
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,199
that is not their fault it's not like I
should go tell hey you're giving this up

217
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:57,349
the assumption is what I'm basing on as
a politician on behalf of my

218
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,339
constituents

219
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:02,860
so let's focus back on montana why the
hell am I here

220
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,889
I heard that

221
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:10,189
%uh a hacker starts out as one of my
close friends

222
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:13,899
montana we have a citizen legislature
who serves the people

223
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:19,060
she suggested I look in a privacy issues
right after I got elected

224
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,290
this there was a very big huge void up
protecting our privacy in politics

225
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,290
especially with now the profit up data

226
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:31,660
no one wants there to be any lines of
what is right and what is wrong they

227
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,589
want to be in open area I love

228
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:38,730
obtain market cell so basically

229
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,570
the knots where the government doesn't
outliner rights do not expect those

230
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:43,870
rights to exist

231
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:47,500
expect them to be taken and that's why
the bill rights was there in the first

232
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:47,970
place

233
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,880
again where the right to privacy in
Montana's Constitution

234
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,560
which said Walter right to privacy is in
montana we better and acted policy or

235
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,770
else is going to be ignored

236
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:01,110
yield to question me try doing %uh

237
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:06,180
discussing was who owns this data so

238
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:11,540
we're talking about i'd I've spoken on
this one quite a bit of HP 400

239
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:16,280
the legislation I pushed not basically

240
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,110
nearly in still may have ruined my
future political of goals because other

241
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,300
relationships I

242
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,439
cut off with special interests
immediately

243
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,440
this was all prior Edward Snowden's an
essay leak so

244
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,720
Edward snow in an essay june fifth and
sixth I was doing this in January

245
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,450
five months before trying to push
privacy legislation to protect people's

246
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,130
alright so to be considered the Privacy
Bill of Rights

247
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,130
and it focused on legislation that

248
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,520
implied the information that %uh
information launch the individual

249
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,069
data subjects must be given notice when
information is collected

250
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,450
personal information may not be
collected without consent

251
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,170
and personal information may only be
used for the purposes stated

252
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,500
so this information belongs to you

253
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,760
not those who can collect it if they
wanna club did they have to give to your

254
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,660
permission

255
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:13,050
I had 37 signatures in montana we have a
hundred represent is fifty senators

256
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,649
at 37 signatures most the from the

257
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,060
Judiciary Committee for

258
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,879
a on behalf up this bill saw a walk in a
committee

259
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,920
to have my bill heard its

260
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:32,020
privacy bill rights over the first on
the country would have been

261
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,780
it would have changed or been the domino
effect the privacy free pass in one

262
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,440
state it will pass and more

263
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,590
I walk in the room I'm a conservative
Republican legislator

264
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:46,100
who's about limited government and every
angle and I walk in

265
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,990
every single business lobbyists is
standing in that room

266
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:53,620
and I haven't packed and they're just
raises stand-up

267
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,928
and tell tell the community how bad this
is for business

268
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:01,240
montana how anti-business I am how how

269
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,850
out a line I am as a freshman legislator
trying to pass something

270
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,899
on behalf of my constituents where the
montana retail Association

271
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,010
montana Telecommunications Association
multiple insurance

272
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:18,840
companies I'll dealers bankers hospitals
chamber commerce montana collectors

273
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,220
Association want at Association it was
amazing

274
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,980
it that room with a blown-up all the
problems in montana woulda gone away

275
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,770
immediately

276
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:32,780
so I i wasnt

277
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:39,780
yes I think it was debt collectors

278
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:48,480
on club if I'm correct I love more the
montana Collectors Association

279
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,530
thinkers debt collectors up proponents

280
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:56,010
so I was there door about I think 30
people

281
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,330
ready to put me in my place humiliate me
which they

282
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:03,799
were basically successful on doing who
is on my side I was

283
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:07,440
it was me I was told by everybody don't
do this bill

284
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,690
it's stupid it's gonna ruin you don't do
it so I did it

285
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:17,690
%uh I

286
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,810
but is really nice I walked in there

287
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:23,350
and I to proponents I'm a hacker friend

288
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:27,860
and i'd the ACLU occur but never in
thought about especially being from the

289
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:31,379
more conservative right and they were
the two

290
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,710
but spoke on my behalf it was awesome

291
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:38,040
I now have a really good relationships
with the ACLU on

292
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,600
data privacy so it was a good start for
that but still

293
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,199
is kinda sad when after that next week
and really want to go anywhere because a

294
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,670
everybody put you in your poli place
little bit Sun

295
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:54,050
so what are some the consequences sb400
I got the up

296
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:57,899
order the black helicopter award because
I was considering all the crazy for

297
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,130
being so concerned about data collection

298
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:05,580
hollow ut outstanding conspiracy theory
creation from the Man in the Yellow Hat

299
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,810
thank you those from a fellow
representative he also gave me a black

300
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,450
helicopter at my desk for the rest of
the session

301
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:15,800
on the focus so the 2013 legislation

302
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,909
continue though the HP 409 pass

303
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:23,860
and people some my close friends or
basically thought my political future

304
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:28,409
all possibilities were screwed that I've
went way too far as way to marry to this

305
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,230
legislation and I needed to just take a
few steps back

306
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,260
and I heard other people say I have
nothing to hide

307
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,280
wiry pushing this is not an important
and the whole concept I had to keep

308
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,220
trying to apply

309
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,440
educate people on does you may not have
anything to hide

310
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,780
good for you for being a perfect
individual but you still have the right

311
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,460
to hide it

312
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,780
and that doesn't always work in people's
minds and so I tried also

313
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,020
say fearing making mistakes especially
younger

314
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,810
%uh is a former self censorship I know I
learned from my mistakes I've done a lot

315
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,000
of stupid things

316
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,270
I'm the only proper politics who claims
not to be perfect

317
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,580
and you know what it's true I'm not
perfect

318
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:11,790
we're not perfect and sometimes making
stupid mistakes we learned a lot

319
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:16,430
about ourselves about life it's kinda
what makes I think our country great

320
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:20,170
odd as self-censorship occurs when
europe

321
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:24,860
appear for what you me do now or hurt
you in the future

322
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,469
and then the loss one is always licks
more extreme but I think right to the

323
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,190
point that

324
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,309
remember the Germans had nothing to hide
until they're trying to hide their

325
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:33,389
neighbors so

326
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:38,250
don't tires I'll try to hide anything
8603

327
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:42,230
was the next one again I'm trying to
make it as on technical

328
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:45,600
and straight to the point this was a
bill a senator

329
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,850
who is a democrat prison has said hey
you know it you really

330
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,500
got beat on this bill hobby try some lot
smaller he came up to me

331
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,950
and he said okay this is what we're
gonna do I do so I got a sponsor a bill

332
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,710
to require law enforcement

333
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:02,549
to obtain a search warrant before being
able to collect location information

334
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:03,899
from electronic devices

335
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:07,399
was a all the information knows only
location information

336
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:11,489
surn devices very narrow to the point as

337
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:15,909
also undefeatable in the sense that this
is a common-sense bill why wouldn't we

338
00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:16,500
pass it

339
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,450
it was short simple one-page emergency
opt out of life threatening situations

340
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:24,649
permission of the owner and order to
respond to 911 calls

341
00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:30,399
odd it was first in the nation and has
since been used as model legislation I

342
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:33,149
know Utah just pass it on to the sport

343
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:37,760
at Utah on Main a pass in 10 states pass
and other states to try to pass it

344
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,240
a sad thing that's happened with this
pillow resupply stalkers

345
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,940
a representa- from south carolina in
they had

346
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,580
a lot of law enforcement agencies say
this is a horrible bill

347
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,799
and if you wanna support child
pornography

348
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:55,168
support this bill and you know what

349
00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:59,440
it's not that important for them to try
this get this bill passed

350
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,000
so they killed in committee because they
want don't wanna be tied to child

351
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,720
pornography for the reelection

352
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,529
because the real elections more porn
than anything like this that's

353
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:12,620
lower-level low on the priority list
doesn't stop that though is the real

354
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,330
question

355
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:17,279
%uh know you get a search warrant and
then that location information still

356
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:18,049
obtainable

357
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:23,110
so no but they were ready to die on a
steak for this issue

358
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:28,199
so what it is P 603 do for me from being

359
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,440
considered almost unelectable their kid
trying to look for people the primary

360
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,740
during the last session

361
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,710
are ready to you

362
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,270
had two months later did you know
montana was a leader on privacy laws

363
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:43,680
you there did montana from the
washington post I woke up from a nap I

364
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,860
was taking I was not

365
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:50,139
proud the guy called me I've was like
playing off I was in action take a nap

366
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:54,610
at that time yes we do you know this is
my own I didn't know that

367
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:58,429
I did not know it be a headline for the
washington post with Montana's lead

368
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,920
states may demand warrants for cell
phone data

369
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,160
New York Times if you don't the
government to spy on you move to Montana

370
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:10,120
alright that's not true but im a
smart-aleck it's all take that headlines

371
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,090
from Yahoo dot com

372
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,899
and then this one was good meet the
Montana lawmakers been called the face

373
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,860
of online privacy rights the US

374
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,969
also little far but I'll take it

375
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:23,440
army I also afterwards got

376
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,060
those interviewed in up by Glenn Beck on
his TV station the

377
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:30,700
they flew me down did speak on behalf of
this issue which I really care we are

378
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,620
politically

379
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,800
he said he said everybody Democrats and
Republicans who supported the cycle

380
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,700
legislation

381
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:41,230
a good on them which is called the here
when it's from both sides dialing he's

382
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,160
one saying it

383
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,570
the last thing was recently I was
awarded a force 30 under 30

384
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:53,149
%uh wrist award which is crazy coming
from a small town being a guy who just

385
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,510
don't like the system 11 a stand up
against it

386
00:24:55,510 --> 00:25:00,920
oh yeah and some means and then montana
said you can spy on us

387
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:06,510
so and just for the people who are on
the other side of the aisle

388
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:11,860
they've made a fair okay

389
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:16,510
so we're gonna bring back to montana now
why is montana

390
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:20,050
relevant it's a great question

391
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:25,100
there's a million people there why am I
here speaking to you about this

392
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:30,889
all bring it down to a level help that
makes a lotta sense as montana donation

393
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:31,500
limits

394
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,080
right now mine are 100 something dollars
if I get a hundred

395
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:40,419
max donors I can likely when my race
it's very simple

396
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:44,850
California donation limits or about four
thousand dollars

397
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,928
soul you know what my mom

398
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:52,330
and my college buddies they can afford
to donate to me and trust me I make them

399
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,120
donate to me

400
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,699
%uh I in California

401
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,520
I people like me had no chance

402
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:05,000
unless I can so find unless I do have a
hundred people who can donate four

403
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,740
thousand dollars and I don't know just

404
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,929
can anybody hear donate four thousand
dollars to a campaign

405
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:13,740
just hell randomly want per your budget
no

406
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,900
that's why I thought are ash then we're
talking later

407
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:24,059
I nice to Montana House race cost
fifteen thousand

408
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:28,158
to twenty-five thousand dollars a
california house race cost $400 to $500

409
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:29,059
thousand

410
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:34,010
can go lower but a competitive one will
cost about that much oh we have term

411
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:34,490
limits

412
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:37,640
four sessions per house so eight years
in the house

413
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:42,280
years the Senate turned out %uh want
that this prize Miss California had term

414
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,240
limits as Walter

415
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,520
12 years total which i think is more
recent so

416
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,110
that's a good thing is you always get
people coming in up

417
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:53,250
what do with term limits if you know
you're gonna end in a few years

418
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:57,059
you don't mind standing up a little bit
taller for issues people

419
00:26:57,059 --> 00:27:01,260
and other areas where they'd of term
limits all say us not worth

420
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,539
knocking reelected for me I'll get
reelected screw I got the rest my life

421
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:06,070
to live

422
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:10,049
these guys they got their pensions to
gather so

423
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:14,179
montana again why suit the next owners

424
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:18,929
okay why is it important one thing the
montana has

425
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:22,760
decides that is is %uh very

426
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,299
Liberty libertarian minded legislators
on both sides of the aisle

427
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:32,049
I got the far left who completely agree
on these privacy concerns along with the

428
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:33,000
far right

429
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,530
and where the nope that's what makes up
the majority in the House and the Senate

430
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,970
the middle all the moderates only
someone like what's good concept for

431
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,240
security we shouldn't

432
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,480
limit who can gather this access and so

433
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,679
that's how I deal more in the middle but
these guys have principal

434
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:52,750
on your rights these guys have Prince
Paul your rights seems to be the one the

435
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,890
few issues I can get the far left the
far right together on

436
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:01,530
same page with and that's awesome I
recently spoke a few times with the ACLU

437
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:06,129
to the Tea Party you get those guys in
the same room not kept trying to kill

438
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:06,720
each other

439
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,290
and I did you just use accomplished
something texas is trying to do the same

440
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,460
thing out this book about an Ashley

441
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,790
on trying to get these groups together
cuz they have something that they can

442
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,250
work on and get pass

443
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:21,300
who woulda known it took a 26-year-old
Anna

444
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,629
the ACLU lobby person to put these ideas
together and we're going to speak to you

445
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:28,710
up so we have

446
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:33,340
we have a very big possibility a passing
legislation

447
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:37,010
that will protect to be the first in the
nation out a montana

448
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:42,010
that's big concept that a lot of people
are realizing at that I want people to

449
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:42,790
realize it is

450
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:47,389
again if we pass it there we pass it we
can pass it anywhere

451
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,910
has a lot of things a Senate committee
hearing was it's never been done before

452
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,780
it doesn't work

453
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,260
no oils done it effin awesome doing it
is probably good reason why

454
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,920
well you know what I think I can help
make it happen

455
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,340
sorbonne else can make it happen and
doesn't mean it's only Montana can't do

456
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:02,689
it

457
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:07,030
I just think that %uh since I'm there
crane relationships it's very possible

458
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:11,300
so what are some the 2015 legislative
goals

459
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,659
for our session 0

460
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:18,450
won the first these are all mine but
we're all working together on it

461
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:22,470
while first one's a strength this is
mine strengthening shield laws

462
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,670
concerning technology which is
protecting sources the press

463
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,830
when it comes to technology that's

464
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:33,050
very important %uh that's
first-amendment stuff right there

465
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:37,930
the next one is what I've been getting a
lot of statewide press on

466
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:42,440
which is requiring the option for event
data recorders to either be turned off

467
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,910
require notification notification now
it's kinda transition to

468
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:50,470
all require event data recorder
information to block the individuals

469
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:55,080
so I'm expecting a huge battle all this
three or four days ago I got called by

470
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,149
the main

471
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:59,810
special interest lobby for the
manufacture sane not only do we want to

472
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:00,800
support this

473
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,428
were completely behind you

474
00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:05,970
to ensure that to get this information
it's gonna require a search warrant

475
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,230
if you don't give it up that just made
this bill go from a ten to twenty

476
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:10,659
percent

477
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:13,990
up or maybe a youth fifty percent chance
a passing to now

478
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:18,559
85-90 percent chance passing what out it
been watered down

479
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:25,139
that is a huge deal so another one

480
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:28,850
is prevent the state you some automated
license plate scanners

481
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:33,178
and 2009 montana band red light cameras

482
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:40,179
yeah last session we banned

483
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:44,928
drone usage Limited is severely so now

484
00:30:44,929 --> 00:30:50,610
is time to also prevent the start-up on
me license plate scanners one good thing

485
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:51,590
about montana

486
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:55,439
is or so far behind we don't have them
yet so were gonna

487
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,919
bandit before we're committed okay

488
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:02,179
another one is all

489
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:06,379
facials recognition software san Diego
is starting to use this already

490
00:31:06,379 --> 00:31:10,080
and its they're testing it out there
trying it out so

491
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,289
I can bases my painting a picture and
know who everybody is in this room is

492
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,100
law enforcement

493
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,100
that's okay we need to stop that from
happening before it even gets

494
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:24,240
out us let another one I'm gonna try to
work on preventing the state from using

495
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,499
or vendors that the state can purchase
cuz I sloop or right there

496
00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:31,240
a we want to know this is the big

497
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,509
this is the holy grail old concert to
obtain personal information

498
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:39,090
I'm gonna try to San most simple way
possible

499
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:42,389
but still gonna start it's already
getting complex you getting a shoes

500
00:31:42,389 --> 00:31:43,459
lobby against me

501
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,539
say that personal data belongs to the
individual

502
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:50,139
and define what that personal data is it

503
00:31:50,139 --> 00:31:55,289
dow one is kinda the pipe dream but
sometimes if you have one to be chilled

504
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:56,149
the other ones might

505
00:31:56,149 --> 00:32:01,529
make it through so we'll see about that
reform stop asset forfeiture

506
00:32:01,529 --> 00:32:04,529
years know about that issue as much

507
00:32:04,529 --> 00:32:08,549
so Packers are when the cops come in

508
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:11,830
the break down your door they say you're
guilty for this

509
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:16,050
they get all your computers and they
sell off and keep the money %uh

510
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:20,370
and then they found out that you're not
guilty but the very soul of the top kept

511
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:20,830
the money

512
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:24,370
you have to spend thousands dollars and
suing them getting lawyers to get the

513
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,909
money if the what they've already sold
off

514
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:29,890
kept that's all we want to stop that
happens so

515
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:36,590
yeah yeah and then

516
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:39,889
continue just the thing with the search
warrants we've had one success there

517
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:43,220
of require search warrants for also for
information

518
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,470
all email information all social
information media your social media

519
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,290
information

520
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:51,450
all information if you want it get a
warrant

521
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:54,700
okay so let's pause right there

522
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,510
we're trying to do something the state
level bargain successful

523
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:02,040
other states are trying to do it it's
happening but

524
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:06,409
more the fed's doing nothing

525
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:10,620
the USA freedom act joke

526
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,030
its empty it's been slaughtered its the
100

527
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:17,710
over a hundred the sponsors have now
voted against it because it's a nothing

528
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:23,440
bill its I have no faith in our federal
government to be honest that's one state

529
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,400
politics

530
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:30,740
its through

531
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,160
but

532
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,190
saying that the government has checks
and balances

533
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:37,580
cracked federal executive

534
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,490
urged judicial executive legislative
there are also subject each other

535
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:45,730
now we're all working together odd
legislative branch was a small spill the

536
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,460
people

537
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,980
is no longer the people at the top
percent approval rating or lower

538
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,380
I think it's others saying that more
people would rather

539
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,590
are more people are more favorable death
then

540
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:00,179
are US Congress so that's not a good
thing her

541
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:04,650
%uh so the NSA but there is a text about
Thursday you know the NSA has its own

542
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:05,880
secret courts

543
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,900
that overseas its activities

544
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,990
that is also overseen by the NSA said
haha

545
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:15,109
hurts a joke right there on one

546
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:18,210
last 10 that is sex abouts is known

547
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:22,370
really speaks out because they say it's
not crack to speak up sometimes is that

548
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:25,639
up the people if you accept it allowed
to go on

549
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:30,940
you are as guilty as the rest of us what
he said

550
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:36,099
peanut gallery back there

551
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:40,279
all not assessed you're coming up here
in a bit

552
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:45,149
all that is necessary for the triumph of
evil is that good men do nothing I am a

553
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,449
complete believer in that

554
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:49,489
of so I'm gonna skip this one along

555
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:52,668
it's a little bit too close of call for
a

556
00:34:52,668 --> 00:34:56,248
100 yr eighty hungover individuals I

557
00:34:56,248 --> 00:34:59,839
so the firehall firewall freedom

558
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:06,839
is kinda where it comes down to we're in
a new age does not existed

559
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:12,499
ever with where our technology is going
and South the only a handful of people

560
00:35:12,499 --> 00:35:15,049
really can understand these concepts

561
00:35:15,049 --> 00:35:19,709
why am i speaking to you out of all the
places I could be

562
00:35:19,709 --> 00:35:24,078
all the people I can talk with
politically especially why

563
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:31,079
why here first saw

564
00:35:31,219 --> 00:35:36,660
all get to the second but I want to
dwell on it why am I here

565
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:41,499
odd most people really don't understand
the concerns and what this data

566
00:35:41,499 --> 00:35:43,218
collection can bring us to

567
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:48,979
were actually RT at worry been for a
while most people are worried about

568
00:35:48,979 --> 00:35:50,569
their cell preservation

569
00:35:50,569 --> 00:35:54,989
politicians are worried about reelection
it's true

570
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:58,489
they're worried about their financial
matters a personal agendas and

571
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:02,359
there's a handful of them we tend to be
the ones to rise the top politically who

572
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:03,609
worry about power

573
00:36:03,609 --> 00:36:06,709
they want it and they find their ways of
getting it

574
00:36:06,709 --> 00:36:12,160
and like I said examples USA freedom act

575
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,939
so who has the tools acers stand up to
our intrusive government why am I

576
00:36:16,939 --> 00:36:18,249
talking to you

577
00:36:18,249 --> 00:36:21,629
because you'll are some the few people

578
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:24,959
who I may be depending on sooner or
later

579
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:29,019
two stops on these atrocities I'm re:
speaking with hackers

580
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:33,339
across the state and world for helping
me on legislation

581
00:36:33,339 --> 00:36:36,609
to work on such things as voting
machines

582
00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:40,390
which if you have vulnerable voting
machines

583
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:43,808
that could be hacked you no longer have
a democracy

584
00:36:43,809 --> 00:36:47,520
because each boat doesn't matter you
have

585
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,840
a smart person who can just sway the
vote sir

586
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:55,140
hacked machines and change the votes
that's what we're already facing because

587
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,339
all are high commissions almost all them
are very vulnerable

588
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:03,510
so again who was tools assertive centred
tortures a government you do

589
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:06,910
you may be some the most important
people in the future

590
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:10,799
i misses disclaimer first

591
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,870
are as it is they are not suggesting
anarchy

592
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:18,319
angle hack everything and try to destroy
him blowing up and have a firestorm

593
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:25,320
Nahla dollar I'm sayin ash by

594
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:31,240
its bloods grabbed

595
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,580
going to love contended I'm in montana

596
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:38,520
I know a few people who have their job
bunkers

597
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,720
their guns their food all built up

598
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:46,750
they have more ammo then %uh than some
other stores are carrying right now

599
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:50,390
you know it's so it's a way of life it's
kinda people I represent

600
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:53,839
because I'm a far-right more libertarian
kinda guy so

601
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,500
good on them their races stand up if
there's anything

602
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,890
that they think is a Hill wrongdoing
that is what they're there for

603
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:05,000
are some all on their own world
definitely

604
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,100
is it the right to be definitely so

605
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,730
with that let's bring it back to

606
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:16,510
the data collection it is up to
individuals

607
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:20,360
I firmly believe this in our for fathers
believed as well to stand up to those

608
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,440
who abuse power

609
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,110
univers by our own government we all
know this data will be it has been

610
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:26,770
abused

611
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:31,509
but no no no until it sorry possibly too
late to what extent

612
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,700
when this injustice happens those who

613
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:38,419
those with the understanding abilities
will be the only ones who the

614
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,160
rest the population were rely on this is
especially true

615
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,049
all the data collected right now we have
all black male for those trying to stand

616
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,860
up for something bigger than themselves

617
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:53,100
we already have the blackmail against us
officers ready

618
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:58,180
waiting for the trigger to be polled

619
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:58,919
with that

620
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:05,920
I we'll leave it and I'll answer any
questions anybody may have

621
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,560
and if you want to donate you can donate
cuz

622
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,779
hundreds of dollars me ek have a huge
effect on my race but

623
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:23,700
it's not as much as four thousand
dollars don't think you're going to get

624
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,910
a boat out on me though

625
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:29,899
doesn't work like that any questions yes
sir

626
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,640
engine amount to those minimums and
maximums

627
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:39,540
max okay I wish their minimum suggest

628
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:43,810
is getting %uh should

629
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:47,440
anybody else just pass

630
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,680
mind a

631
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,739
yes there are I condone and Ike
accepting

632
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:58,099
12 pack tax hundreds of dollars before
impact out

633
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:01,279
so it's not a huge amount yet

634
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:04,519
all I can't nobody that's how packs were

635
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:11,519
I actually I'm amazed that there are
more packs

636
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:16,190
trying to push this type of stuff in the
data community because our packs that

637
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:16,759
i've seen

638
00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:21,269
for business for conservative principles
religious principles

639
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:26,999
not one to help push those behind those
who are pushing us these causes

640
00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:30,839
his pupils

641
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:34,849
all their all-pro about protecting it

642
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:38,569
almost all home about either defining
who the property belongs to

643
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:42,259
what's that defines as your property
which then defines as

644
00:40:42,259 --> 00:40:45,349
doing a search warrant to get its all
about the fourth

645
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:48,839
amendment except the freedom speech one
which is about first amendment that

646
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:53,499
is for the the not the freemen the press
which is also another early part 1

647
00:40:53,499 --> 00:40:56,660
well that's what it's all about and %uh

648
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,910
that's the one interesting thing about
these grainy its

649
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:03,899
I call a grey market data collection
multi-billion dollar industry which I'm

650
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,519
trying to put a finger in there I

651
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:09,629
of they don't like it because if we
start change in their system

652
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:14,009
that's a lot of money and what is money
going to again money

653
00:41:14,009 --> 00:41:18,390
is power so we don't really they don't
want that changed agree market

654
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:23,420
yeah were used you mentioned earlier you
to

655
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,690
you

656
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,710
produce month corners while

657
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:30,840
activity is your life there so I

658
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,130
this wasn't my legislation there are %uh

659
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:38,280
more experienced people carrying this
one were also freedom loving individuals

660
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:41,600
but I believe there was a

661
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:47,000
you think that these they could have any
weaponry they could be taking pictures

662
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,090
to use on land

663
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:51,670
they think I believe they need a search
warrant at the you were used for a

664
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:55,250
criminal case in the search warrant
wasn't there the data would be thrown

665
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:55,740
out

666
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,759
basically you can fly and many you
collect use and do on them as

667
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,700
extremely limited was the end result
after what you both

668
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:08,850
how chambers okay

669
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:13,390
you Paul shit you doll all

670
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:17,700
I old

671
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,189
a all so

672
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:26,810
yeah for you know your questions here

673
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:30,150
no California really playing as

674
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:35,360
I think I'm watching closely lately but
I think apostle the Senate a bill to say

675
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,470
even the fed's have to get search
warrants for

676
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:42,709
%uh information of californians that's
been collected so

677
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:46,090
my state my bill had passed

678
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:49,800
there was a man who put on it to save
feds are included everything

679
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,770
and it would've been vetoed immediately
so we kept it back to the state so the

680
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:57,070
first thing that you have to realize
States ten o'clock this information

681
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:01,720
and share with the feds organizations
Microsoft Google

682
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,980
they click the information companies
they stand sure the fed's

683
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:09,990
the feds don't collected themselves at
entities who do it for them

684
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:14,890
if I can limit the state entities that
do it I'm doing my part in my area

685
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:19,069
the problem is it takes to give us to do
it I in a few days on MuchMusic fusion

686
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:19,730
center

687
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,980
with colleagues across the board Tea
Party ACLU

688
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,050
up democrat on the republican

689
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:29,110
we're gonna mute fusion center which is
the entity that basically

690
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:32,620
is the collector at the state level to
share with the feds

691
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:36,470
harass them through the attorney
general's office what do you do in

692
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:39,640
how are you doing it why are you doing
it and we're gonna

693
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,520
where this huge amount to questions were
asked or see what the answer and if the

694
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,490
answer anything

695
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:48,759
again if I can stop them then there's
less information on the federal level

696
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:55,240
do expect them to listen to me no now of
course not

697
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,759
all do that at the state level on my I

698
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,890
once I get elected to congress I'll try
that and go down

699
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:06,710
in in flames but Justin demoss

700
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:11,090
almost said that and then are he almost
pass that amendment of years it

701
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:14,630
few months ago to be fun them almost
passed

702
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:18,550
I S and i've no faith in our Fed's right
now in our federal government so I'll

703
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,740
try do I cannot level I can do it

704
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:25,569
yes usually sell used

705
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:29,710
were here I have tried to little bit but
they're more

706
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:32,860
they're more pushing national things

707
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:36,710
non office that I know the montana right
now

708
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:40,980
if I can I've tried but it's a little
tougher so if I work with them right now

709
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,800
to get all my legislation ready

710
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,670
I can be like I said I can help push a
lotta stuff through the state level

711
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:51,610
hopefully so she was very well written
to have an impact nationally

712
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:56,620
but some groups have a love it inner
resources or I'd say so

713
00:44:56,620 --> 00:45:00,109
and there again their worry about your
supreme act to worry about what

714
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:03,900
DNS is doing but Moyes

715
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:09,220
yeah yeah I've spoken to a few times
anybody else a sucky more hands on a

716
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:09,930
backer

717
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:15,740

720
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,220

721
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:29,240

one security through obscurity and no

724
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:41,730
the state is an issue it we get paid us

725
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:44,260
legislature so we base the volunteer
