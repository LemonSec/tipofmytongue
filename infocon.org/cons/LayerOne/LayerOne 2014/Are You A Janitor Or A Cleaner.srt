11
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:50,260
and the thirteen years I'm a CISSP have
been a consultant for pride lost

12
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,230
8 does talk action ballot Bandai

13
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,300
as a combination of things that we've
seen throughout the years

14
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,788
things we victory in terms of how we can
give back to the community can

15
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:07,760
help poll and where we see some
weaknesses and

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,979
I'm at home I hi I am halsell I play

17
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,260
and information security professional
sometimes

18
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,680
done this for over 15 years I have
letters

19
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,710
and stuff so why we're here today

20
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,250
basically we're here to go ahead and
talk about

21
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,840
incident response I'm not going to read
minds slide we all know what's been

22
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,000
happening lately

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,630
incident response is actually become
much more of a focus

24
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,939
due to the fact that there've been a lot
of

25
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:46,189
high-profile breaches and due to these
high-profile breaches

26
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,689
its been amazing to go ahead and see

27
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:52,960
what has been happening as far as the
response from

28
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,350
we're going to pan test everything and
not do anything with fantastic verses

29
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,850
okay we actually have to guide do
something show

30
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,030
our talk we're gonna go ahead and talk
about

31
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,199
nm for shack where we have done had

32
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,040
and failed and how we're gonna go ahead
and move forward

33
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,750
a quote

34
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,680
to go I hadn't take a look at it's the
biggest problem we have within our

35
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,470
security industry today

36
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:29,450
it's the way we've always done thanks
are you can take nine stein's

37
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,480
insanity is repeating insanity the same
thing

38
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,790
whatever show

39
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,880
what we're here to go ahead and speak
about today is are you a janitor

40
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,160
when you deal with incident response
those are the people that are

41
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,380
have very content to go ahead well this
Ramage

42
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,890
box move on it didn't really happen

43
00:02:53,890 --> 00:03:00,869
shell incident

44
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,290
or

45
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,420
are you a cleaner show basically you go
beyond

46
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,720
reimaging the and boxes you actually
wanna identify root cause

47
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,280
you actually wanna identifiers hacker
know it's

48
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,069
know your attackers capability and
actually stop them from coming back

49
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:23,659
and this is basically

50
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:28,909
something that isn't usually done in
incident response usually all we do stop

51
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:29,590
the bleeding

52
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,370
and that's all we do and then we can
guide move on

53
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,030
which one are you going to be

54
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,959
the Shans

55
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,359
haha incident response life cycle

56
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:50,060
basically is a pic a role model its
preparation

57
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:55,260
identification containment ratification
recovering lessons learned

58
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,290
basically it's supposed to be

59
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,840
equivalent to a security development
life cycle which is you're always

60
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,680
preparing

61
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,120
it starts with the preparation you keep
going around

62
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,680
identify you contain it your movie

63
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,799
you do the recovery you the lessons
learned

64
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:20,000
which is post-mortem and then take the
lessons learned

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,139
and then you go ahead and go back and
rear all and prepare

66
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:28,979
again for your attacker the problem is
is

67
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:33,740
the attacks actually don't have a life
cycle and

68
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,760
we're not doing this at least we're not
going to add

69
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,680
and plane with the securely

70
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,910
security development life cycle and most

71
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,630
businesses just simply can't keep up
with it they're always going to go ahead

72
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,260
and go

73
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,830
while an incidence occurring we need to
go ahead and deal with it

74
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:59,068
up

75
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:02,180
once again most businesses will go ahead
and take

76
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,020
a look at what

77
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,080
their actual business goals are am I
gonna go I hadn't

78
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,198
deal with the attack or am I gonna go
ahead

79
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,960
and continue to suck it securities
people would say

80
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,370
an with that I'll guy hadn't

81
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,000
give you John shocker for preparation

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,030
thank Matt

83
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:36,880
mantra this a better body let's jump in
the preparation how are we preparing for

84
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,080
an instant or are we preparing curly
today within our company's

85
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,840
we talk about preparedness we talk about
in doing things are right when we talk

86
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,729
about security

87
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:52,150
but what are we really doing is a bit a
lot to read

88
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:57,210
but we gotta look at how we build
complex systems we can start out one day

89
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,258
and say hey I wanna build the world's

90
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:03,220
bass document retention system that's
not how we operate

91
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,120
we start out saying alan Wilson small
you build upon that to get something

92
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,610
bigger

93
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,240
no large system is ever gonna be created
with someone just

94
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,259
walking outdoor in saying I wanna build
the biggest

95
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:17,699
whatever right me for didn't start out
buildings so my traps

96
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:22,320
it can happen that way and what we have
two days we have complex systems are all

97
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,259
built up on smaller systems

98
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:28,500
smaller little your secret ease at which
built upon to make it bigger and bigger

99
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,509
with all that complexity comes

100
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:35,770
the idea that we can have problems with
and we can have on a bill is within a

101
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,210
weevil

102
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,530
we keep building on top a stylish Mb

103
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,698
produce problems with Justin complexity
alone

104
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:49,199
so what is not working with information
security today what is not working with

105
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,449
the way we're doing stuff

106
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:56,270
here's a short list and kinda sums up
where we're at

107
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,840
we don't really understand who our enemy
is we we don't understand

108
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,310
who is trying to attack us now is a
nation-state

109
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,650
is it's always a customer's upset with
what we do is it someone who's trying to

110
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,448
land intact for a bigger game

111
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:12,570
last year we saw a lot of attacks on
customers

112
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,620
that were leading up to a bigger one
they were going after that caspar rather

113
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,400
a customer of theirs

114
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:25,400
but I had make that and road somewhere
we don't really understand

115
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,169
than the nature and and buy stuff is
happening

116
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:32,320
when we don't eat and educate our

117
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,840
end users are developers about but
security is

118
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,760
how mean this room is a mess could never
have taken your developers aside in

119
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:46,139
and really can educate them on secure
development we're good at playing out

120
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:46,660
hey

121
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,400
there something wrong over there but
when we have to take the lessons learned

122
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,500
staff and walk back and say okay

123
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,880
we had an issue we need to go Educare
people we we fail right there

124
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,830
is done really of all time around
usually its business right they watched

125
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,500
move on

126
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,550
help get over that one issue let's move
on bus live another day let's all other

127
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,160
product

128
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,130
we need to stop them mentality take a
step back and understand what just

129
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:09,700
happened

130
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:16,200
how we can make sure really doesn't
happen again we are in active

131
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,500
sitting angry a perfect in all top
security I love this one it's

132
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:26,030
the observe and report right be have I D
S IPS system so we have now

133
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,659
turned on danger the famous monitor mode
because we have the idea that hale

134
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,919
we we won't stop the business from
happening by hey when something pops up

135
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,559
will check the logs will act on it

136
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,978
I may do that come on

137
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:42,080
as our hands in

138
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,589
it he is at a lake in the canton is
saying IPS

139
00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:49,380
systems at the Montreux become idea
systems and they become lost in

140
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,910
a deluge other logs are you don't read
laughs become

141
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,500
absolutely useless if you don't have
them actually doing anything firewalls

142
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,700
become useless when you're logging in
taxi now dropping packets

143
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:05,180
I know the business complaints hey we
don't wanna drop any real good customers

144
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,599
why how many

145
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,780
potential customers are you gonna lose
to make up for the class trip

146
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:17,110
angel breach right this is equation you
have to do how many customers does it

147
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,430
take to be denied

148
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:23,709
before it equals a cost if we do get
breach so much gusty be there right now

149
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:27,270
target right

150
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,340
how many customers what what is what is
any question how does it work for your

151
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:31,900
industry

152
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,600
staffing is a huge issue as well

153
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,770
we r inadequately staffed we'd be

154
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:43,490
really don't know understand how to hire
a security person

155
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,180
watch their job be we have no idea what
we would want them to be re usually a

156
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:47,630

without the business drive too much

171
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,849
hammy people in here have ever had
business tell them to do something that

172
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,060
they knew they should be doing

173
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,189
you know we have here we have this
mentality that the product should go out

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,280
weathers test now whether secure
non-indians to go out because marketing

178
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,910
pushing it out before its time

179
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:04,490

own group respond but how do we respond

181
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,030
to the public how do we respond to the
people our customers when we have an

182
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,709

00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,959
in STL seeming Tom to mistreat my face
because she didn't want to go through

309
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,220
security testing

310
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:29,190
said longer text in which to launch your
liking people don't like it when you

311
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,050
have a breach

312
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,889
people like you and your personal
information is expose a world people not

313
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,310
like changing their bank accounts
because

314
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:38,330
you couldn't figure out how to do SDLC
crassly

315
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,720
I can tell you the damage the damage
done by this thinking

316
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,840
far outweighs the damage am very proud
of being delayed

317
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,929
with the politics drives I hear this one
all the time

318
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:56,040
these quotes Russia taken from customers
my number said to me when we were

319
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,100
working through various stuff and
Sherman if you've heard these

320
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,459
day in and day out we can't let them do
this we can see here and say

321
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,130
Yemen

322
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:11,930
a chance conservatism a crash well then
we have another issue to fix before we

323
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:12,690
even start talking

324
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,350
security is wire we put ourselves and
shit position by real

325
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:20,290
were reprinted business in jeopardy
every time we try to do something

326
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,090
proactive

327
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,600
blast I love to hear this and this is
one my favorite

328
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:30,689
I only open tickets I know I can close
this was an engineer who was run

329
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:35,120
by manager who believe in efficiency and
they figured efficiency was measured in

330
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,510
tickets Open tickets close an average
time to resolution

331
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:41,710
and this is what that they can get you

332
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:46,090
agents in Jersey dude aren't they killed
the security hatch

333
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,310
they're thinking about him and my boss
Kenny on me if it takes longer than

334
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,220
Apple's iOS take it so

335
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:58,220
I'm just gonna close in our I'm not an
open it yes

336
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:01,750
this

337
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,660
well look let's put it this way do you
think the attacker

338
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,890
is bound by these rules didn't get out
there who's looking down he was bound by

339
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:10,720
these rules

340
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,460
this he has to go through change control
vast permission to run and map against

341
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:20,170
your box

342
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,900
yes exactly it

343
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:29,900
here's a great one billowed over

344
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:36,780
um its low battery debris but at Dover
get asked to install scum is fire on he

345
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:40,050
explains it everybody blames everything
on the final so he is gonna do it

346
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:43,389
and at the in a bit um and that their
plan

347
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:47,380
farrell did this is what happens this is
politics driving business decisions

348
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,680
you know or do something because
everybody blames security when she

349
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,420
doesn't work

350
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,580
even when it has nothing to do with
security right

351
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,060
nothing due to fire largest so we
stopped doing was proactive

352
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:02,080
because we don't wanna be held
responsible for what might happen

353
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,620
snow we going to we don't know how to
respond and these can ago

354
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:11,340
between and go with each other
University Maryland

355
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,919
an awesome one this she is

356
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,170
how they responded no not know if you
can read this in the back

357
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:22,770
but the response has been sleep well it
happens to other people so it must be a

358
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:23,730
trend happening

359
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:30,730
breaches are not a trend the it happen
to the guy next door so must be OK is

360
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,110
not a response to give to people

361
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:37,840
in fact this actually happened twice to
them and it was only after the second

362
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,060
breach in they actually fix the problem

363
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:45,200
but there's Ponzi is still shot lunar
that it's like hell

364
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,720
you know it happen sir but some must be
a problem and we just got swept up in it

365
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,790
now it didn't you didn't get swept up in
it

366
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:56,320
you didn't do what you're supposed to do
so rather than take responsibility for

367
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,050
you want to tell the public that it's
okay because it happens to everybody

368
00:22:59,050 --> 00:22:59,700
else

369
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,640
here's to medical instances in

370
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:11,240
anybody find the irony on this page the

371
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,290
thus the symbol there which is commonly
associated with with medical

372
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:20,310
people's actually the staffer Hermes
I'll a job in southern Italy munies

373
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:24,790
there is an army unit that actually a
adopted that as a symbol on some medical

374
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:28,180
personally followed whereas the actual

375
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,640
symbol for medicine the gotta messinger
apology is ace

376
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:37,720
staff with one snake not to you and
scanned the thinking they had here

377
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,210
Palomar health who got breached they
decide have

378
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:45,240
repulsive the surely your health
information has me is turning affairs

379
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,590
purposes whatsoever

380
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,800
even know they had an employee who lost
to

381
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,419
unencrypted USB sticks with over 20,000
patient records on

382
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,910
this month same thing

383
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:02,600
Franciscan Medical Group another lost
laptops with and 35,000 patient

384
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,449
information by hey we're for sure that
it wasn't used in any way possible

385
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,470
bad at all or a hundred percent risky
free

386
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:14,390
my questions was a single user going
with that many patients

387
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:18,300
unencrypted on US peace agreement on a
laptop thing in the car

388
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,370
why are we not doing our job to make
sure that doesn't happen

389
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:25,409
and why are we responding to a breach
was saying hey

390
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:28,550
we know front and out

391
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:32,470
are no shadow of a doubt that your
information as we we can make that such

392
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,180
occasions

393
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,590
those assertions are Natsumi we can
quantify we don't know

394
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,929
for all we know they could be using it
right now

395
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:44,260
customers come to us to look for the
truth they come to us reassurance that

396
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,120
their okay

397
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,100
thank you know tell false information
like this is not something that we want

398
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,030
to start supporting

399
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:54,780
the IRS

400
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,510
this happen just recently in the
interesting thing was this was

401
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:00,700
a case for an employee to the laptop
home

402
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,020
and add 20,000 records a IRS

403
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,520
employees date on it that go slight from
the car

404
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,200
and this was a response again

405
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,860
their comeback into him no evidence it's
ever been you strain affairs for peace

406
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,479
why is an employee carrying on twenty
thousand records of its own employees

407
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,560
all laptops in the front in the car this
is just a temp less per

408
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,970
right what a alright

409
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:36,050
of the got it

410
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:39,080
okay while ahead I know

411
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,669
that they're not the poster child for
doing things a cracked way but you

412
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,820
realize that these people have all our
personal information they are custodians

413
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,580
for every single simpson's

414
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,939
social security number and banking
information going back for as long as

415
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,760
we've been working

416
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,170
so they can't figure out how to handle
data responsibly why should we be okay

417
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,390
with them telling us

418
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,670
now we have no evidence to indicate it's
ever been using improperly

419
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:06,150
right merco picking a college

420
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:11,170
Kenyon College District after nine
months is still 100 million theirselves

421
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:15,180
they were sucking on politics more
within with an IT director who is

422
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,700
moving out and no one willing to pick up
this

423
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:25,700
baby as it was that intermediate they
figured at we have breached want

424
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:32,980
like the box reinstalled as a was put
back into service don't passion and kept

425
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,350
going on and on and on

426
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:38,110
lost one of my favorite line

427
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:44,729
we're in this together not fear we are
extending a 10 percent discount

428
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:49,930
we like you love all your financial
information but hey

429
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:54,310
will give it 10 percent of and come back
to our stores and run your credit cards

430
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,780
again

431
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,139
p has burned I'm sure if we know how we
have reached

432
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,620
right i think is most awesome

433
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:06,300
owes responses decide without taking any
response

434
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,060
sorry for what they've done we on the
room no hear what happened how it

435
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,139
happened said no

436
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:16,280
understand that and to hear their
response here its

437
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,730
kind of insulting knowing that they they
played fast and loose

438
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:23,120
with their security controls and in a
bit they thought LaHaye let's capitalize

439
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,479
on South rush sale

440
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,400
let's keep your back and/or stores so
talk about change how we gonna do this

441
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,220
anybody read

442
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,950
buckminster fuller suction got some
great

443
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:43,800
books like Spaceship Earth and the at
the idea said

444
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,889
change is in cannes is come without

445
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:51,090
breaking but we consider normal without
breaking the trans

446
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:55,159
developing something that people have to
move to make it the new version

447
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:01,020
and get really old to DB networks to
study

448
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,570
along with the up online stupid
sixty-five percent

449
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:08,629
and the customers they have surveyed had
a single injection attack

450
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:12,090
okay

451
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:16,189
to counter forty eight days to detect 60
days to remediate

452
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,190
208 days haldol

453
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:23,490
those two thirds of the year you spent

454
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:29,360
owns before you do anything about it let
that sink in for a minute

455
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,219
208 days as 208 days on security admin

456
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,650
punching each day reading through logs
doing his daily duties

457
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:40,100
all the while your information been
pilfered out the back door

458
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,889
for something that is easily preventable

459
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:47,010
some thats but in all our purview to do

460
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:50,870
it's within our own job description to
prevent

461
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:54,260
and on average is taking us 208 days to
fix

462
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,290
so how do we fix is a star following the
money

463
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:04,680
businesspeople executives

464
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,330
your management they understand dollar
state donors and hyperbole

465
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:12,220
they don't get this technical stuff they
don't get computers

466
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:15,580
naked dollar stake in San seeing a
return on investment

467
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,780
how much money magazine's spendin was
again a save me

468
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:24,629
we're good the tech industry im talkin
hyperbole we gotta go oh my god APT

469
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:29,410
the executives in our sanity there the
whole

470
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:33,090
but I don't get it then they know
letters say can

471
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:39,010
kinda read but they don't get APTN we
don't get finance we don't talk dollars

472
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:42,070
and sense we can't come down with the
store there's a reason why marketing is

473
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,830
so throw a

474
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:48,030
200,000 our party and i cant buy a
firewall marking is graded telling a

475
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,180
story that's what they do

476
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,810
we don't tell stories that's what we
need to do

477
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:56,520
we need to start telling stories means
for attaching monetary values to what

478
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,210
happens

479
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:01,550
stopping defensive like it's something
that we did wrong you can't blame a guy

480
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,629
who couldn't defend against an attack
because you cut his budget by

481
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:08,720
it's only five percent he can afford to
buy anything are you hiring people who

482
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,290
you know you coulda hired four for the
job and they're overworked

483
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:17,030
underpaid and can burn out you can't
fault that we got stopping defensive

484
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:20,020
over the stuff and starts up to the fact
that we need to tell story we need to

485
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:20,750
get the funding

486
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:27,750
we need to be like marketing

487
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:28,290
no

488
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:34,740
nanos not do that blame the there's a
stretch for me so it's kinda simple

489
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,610
castle solution verses casa an adverse
event

490
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:43,060
persons a cost to doing nothing is
there's always a casa doing nothing

491
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:47,450
people think that doing nothing is free
but generally doing nothing always cost

492
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,830
a lot more than doing something

493
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:55,830
says manTech and now

494
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,530
I know a chance A&M pana Monday when
they got to get an extra the school

495
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:02,090
website called a data breach had
occurred %uh com

496
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:06,310
its pretty awesome at and making the
story happen

497
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:10,440
you do a survey if elements questions it
comes back to you with numbers

498
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,000
numbers are you can point me to a emails
and over your boss the same work

499
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,780
according to Symantec drink and this is
what it cost to bring up breached

500
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:22,570
every lobsterman don't think there was a
gardener is involved

501
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:27,409
Gardner was involved with their write
you a check right away it's not too far

502
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:28,570
off base now

503
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:32,669
and that's the scary part the server
they have you saw the questions they ask

504
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:33,950
you are on point

505
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:38,310
there within reason and the numbers you
catch are pretty damn near what BRT

506
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:38,909
would be

507
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:45,910
use it to your advantage users in your
storytelling create your story

508
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:53,490
can we stop calling them advanced inch

509
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:58,330
everything is an advanced persistent
threat thank you

510
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:02,939
then is anything advanced persistent
threat

511
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:06,779
and at a Charlotte are so advanced four
years after the term as crane

512
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:11,179
your created wire we knock on me as
advanced as they are

513
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:14,820
should they just be persistent threats
or should they just be normal

514
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:21,820
day love life it's gonna happen we can't
go about attacking these things the way

515
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:25,610
we always have

516
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,990
it's not working it didn't work for
years ago it still doesn't work today

517
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:34,890
sandboxing doesn't work is sandboxing
only applies to sandbox a half correct

518
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:39,070
you know fire I doesn't have an image
for whatever you're looking at

519
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:44,799
it's not gonna text threat the stuff
we're doing today is the same stuff we

520
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:45,250
did

521
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:49,010
you know twenty years ago and a virus
hasn't changed much according to

522
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,158
semantic I think it's dead now zone

523
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:59,159
hannah is an and point dead long live in
point we need to start doing things

524
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,730
differently we need is to identify her
attackers are

525
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:08,080
going after them and stopping at its
source thank you

526
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,370
see his timing back into what the hay
firmer already starting

527
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:18,678
dealing with nurse that people are not
remediating today

528
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:22,279
we don't have time to take in
remediation business wants us to getting

529
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:25,399
back to normal as soon as possible just
get back to their daily jobs

530
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:28,418
member the job description we saw he had
about what

531
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:32,460
fifty different ass they wanted to do
daily everything from right policy down

532
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,409
to

533
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:38,620
install new hardware because we can all
do than a day remediation spa not for me

534
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,070
to get back to doing it we need to
figure out

535
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:44,918
what happened fix it and then go through
the lessons learned portion that where

536
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:45,890
we understand

537
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:52,890
how we can be better I love this one
sink in for a bit

538
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:56,879
because when you can understand what
he's saying he re

539
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,539
you gonna realize that for as much as we
invest in security

540
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,850
we're still getting beat by the cheapest
thing they can find

541
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:09,799
on the bottom the cutting room floor to
attack you with again these are

542
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,980
businesses they wanna buy a low

543
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,480
and sell high they don't invest too much
money in in

544
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,570
did the game if they can kinney return
on investment

545
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:22,480
the last batch a target cars sold for a
whopping

546
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,949
35 cents a card but at their height

547
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:29,388
they're gone for fifteen dollars in 33
cents a card

548
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:35,639
calculate how many cards a happy made a
bundle money off it but still business

549
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:39,889
they still gotta control cost in a
stolen a profit so far been beat by

550
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:41,349
whatever they can scrounge about like

551
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:45,419
care couch cushions are not taking out
their bankroll then I can go spending

552
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:46,908
and 10,000 nationalist

553
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:50,270
I E 80 day now now don't offer an S O N
64

554
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:57,270
his for all still vulnerable to it now
four years later

555
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:02,940
so let's are working harder as for

556
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,619
already smarter every tells at work
smarter not harder attic in our industry

557
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:08,079
the problem is as we work

558
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,150
really smart we just forgot how to work
hard

559
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:17,420
we don't know where the attack come from
we don't know what the attacker years so

560
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,640
we don't know who was behind the attack
but we can tell you

561
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:24,270
all about what's happened on reddit
netzer we spend our days learning about

562
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:26,369
stuff we spend our days practicing

563
00:35:26,369 --> 00:35:29,400
but when it comes to dance we follow our
feet

564
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,160
these were not used to it and we're not
giving a letter to reach an

565
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,649
to do all we need to do to

566
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:40,280
protector sells for camp Peninsula box
for business doesn't want us to do

567
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,950
anything that's been roughly once voters

568
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:46,450
security is everybody's job

569
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:51,549
if you have someone inside your industry
or inside your company

570
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:55,349
who is not taking secure the way should
there should be a former billion self

571
00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:58,430
you've got a guy on your team was and
they're down running

572
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:01,770
average free app he can undo his work PC
in

573
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:05,630
know but every Trojan he should be dealt
with as we deal with any vulnerability p

574
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,609
is a creamy workers who Department

575
00:36:07,609 --> 00:36:10,788
those being pushed off another war
cannot be done

576
00:36:10,789 --> 00:36:15,230
it like those attackers a freer
non-aligned in a single goal for Nana

577
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,240
liner business bowlers chemicals

578
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,720
we can operate efficiently ever having
to waste our time go after people who

579
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,770
just don't get it

580
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:28,220
We Need to Talk meant that as a
vulnerability in itself we need answers

581
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,240
but hiring

582
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:33,549
did

583
00:36:33,549 --> 00:36:40,549
always higher storm troopers record
except the catch you with beans

584
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,100
source for the I back in teen

585
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,310
its air I can tell you it's

586
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:52,520
right there AC home makes a right there
see

587
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,130
we can still be individuals to work as
part of a team they can still be a park

588
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:59,410
in security community and work in these
teams under

589
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:03,220
a developers Inc level we're working
with but we need to maintain their

590
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,100
position being

591
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:07,700
right in the middle the word team
doesn't get held up with that high

592
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,020
without it being there

593
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:13,820
you can still be an individual his to be
for me what you believe in SLE firm the

594
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,970
concepts you have

595
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:19,120
and not yielding but still be apart the
team educate help them understand what

596
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,750
your position is and where your

597
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:25,980
values lie but your responsibilities are
just like them you have responsibilities

598
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:30,580
a lot as we don't explain this we don't
explain to people why we make decisions

599
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,529
we make we just just say

600
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:35,970
no it doesn't work that way people feel
that is

601
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:39,799
its abrasive he comes off defensive a
donor stand by your saying now

602
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,720
open to compile let him know your secret
sauce is and be

603
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:50,720
that I i in the were team

604
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:56,650
and lastly as I leave here in turn it
over to Matt

605
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:02,230
we gotta start fighting back thank you
john

606
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:09,020
show

607
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:13,940
we see that john has been able to guide
me illustrate many things as to

608
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:18,510
lie things are happening I'm actually
gonna go back

609
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:22,790
to you actually looking at the anatomy
of attack

610
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:27,390
we're gonna actually I had and pretty
much

611
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:30,690
go back to you the beginning

612
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:34,170
from show we're actually not

613
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:37,920
doing the preparation but the Anna
Meares

614
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,720
basically your attacker on your
infrastructure

615
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:46,709
have no world's they don't need change
management to go ahead Ron

616
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:50,090
any scanning tools if they crash

617
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:54,560
Shermer while the crash ever are
probably not going it acted

618
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,710
I'll they definitely don't use checkbox
settings in their tools in

619
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:03,480
then I have any rules show

620
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,430
if you go ahead and take a look at what
I was speaking about earlier the

621
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:13,100
preparation and now identification what
isn't working for identification

622
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,410
we simply go ahead and buy things

623
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:19,819
that shared a that

624
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:24,740
I'm going to alert you if %ah
something's going on that we need to

625
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,370
know about

626
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:29,950
apparently a learning isn't good enough
love because

627
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,799
if you look back at the store gave ten
percent of our

628
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:39,760
forty thousand March yes forty house in
a lurch

629
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,450
basically yesterday I was gonna leave

630
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:49,120
40,000 a forty thousand alerts don't
wake you up

631
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,170
them what is how we take a

632
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:56,310
we take all this technology that we buy
week I hadn't said it

633
00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:00,130
and forget it and

634
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:04,150
at the very worst we don't have an
escalation process it's

635
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:08,069
worth anything because at forty thousand
alerts

636
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:11,910
should have that been escalated to
someone who actually would have

637
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:16,308
sad this is bad good

638
00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:21,059
effec she take a look at this and it's
like

639
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:25,500
how do we usually find out that there
was a breach

640
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,490
crab dish hours

641
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:34,859
hi this is a three-letter agency yeah we
found a password on Penn

642
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:39,980
urinate and we logged in and this is
what I've heard

643
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,230
the last three times later I while

644
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:47,059
we can talk about it but the authorities
contacted us

645
00:40:47,059 --> 00:40:50,730
and apparently we had in have to pee
Shurmur

646
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:54,049
and that FTP server

647
00:40:54,049 --> 00:40:57,500
I yeah it didn't have a checkpoint or
anything

648
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:04,500
but for had a root alrighty then

649
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,490
yes yes it did needed capture the
traffic

650
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:15,490
just another

651
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,100
another fun one per license

652
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:25,390
the email workin Wiley blacklisted

653
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:29,000
I'll we've been

654
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,370
now well I sent

655
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:35,470
enough Nigerian spam to go ahead cover
about

656
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:39,049
the US re times or

657
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:42,960
or stationary now now if you if you she
pays Penn

658
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,440
craps probably already got Sharma the

659
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,160
show basically what we felt we go ahead
and do

660
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,160
is we have never ever Kat

661
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:00,080
an attacker in action if we have what
would you do

662
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,810
%ah things that I go ahead and do what
i've seen

663
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:07,660
attacks if I'm lucky enough to be able
to cash it an interactive

664
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,859
is I needed no what

665
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,960
the level a skill

666
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:18,230
that my opponent has I visited dragged
her an indirect method

667
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:22,230
if I can go ahead and do this and have
the time

668
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:25,590
you always have the time you should be

669
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:29,070
pretty much doing a formulation on your
attacker

670
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:32,170
always going to leave behind at least

671
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:39,170
the very least an IP address if you're
lucky you have a nice fingerprint

672
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:44,550
what we've got a haden felt the I hadn't
do here's

673
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:49,180
guy had in in the preparation phase
actually take a look at

674
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,558
are real physical assets and

675
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:57,319
do some classification people do not
know the actual value

676
00:42:57,319 --> 00:43:00,750
what it is that they're going to had
been trying to protect

677
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:04,349
show let's go ahead and install

678
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:08,410
any shame it's going to be awesome it's
going to solve all our problems

679
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:14,899
let's feed it everything forty thousand
alerts

680
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:20,260
on garbage Jets garbage show

681
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,380
basically another thing that

682
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:28,210
we felt the jewish identify the actual
pivot points

683
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:31,950
when you're taught to go ahead and do
penetration attacks

684
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:35,009
are things that you need to go ahead and
do one unity

685
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:39,300
need to guide game can activity an
action you're gonna jewish

686
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:43,980
work I get to the good stuff and how
many times I have to go ahead and do it

687
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,410
show depending on

688
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:53,828
the actual have it and what not you'll
be able to go ahead and see the

689
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:57,559
actual skill and it won't be an appt

690
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:01,559
three

691
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:05,829
settles that I used to go ahead and
identify people I believe that

692
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:09,859
you have the capability in your
organization a guide map things out

693
00:44:09,859 --> 00:44:13,619
if your enemy does not have

694
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:17,640
if your enemy doesn't have change
management and everything else why

695
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,220
should you

696
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:22,379
I have an IP address for saying I had to
use tear it apart

697
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,220
figure out everything I can about the
actual attacker

698
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:29,669
I need to know how big is a sidewalk

699
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:33,239
I need to know how big this guy s up

700
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:37,069
a lot of people actually go ahead and
look through their logs and I look at a

701
00:44:37,069 --> 00:44:38,308
single IP going

702
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:44,880
al while I found the attacker that are
actually realize how big the guys

703
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,559
show why not go ahead and scan your
enemy

704
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:53,809
why not guy had and take a look and

705
00:44:53,809 --> 00:44:56,890
look at watch

706
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:01,819
the enemy does peopled out Asia jisko

707
00:45:01,819 --> 00:45:07,650
forty thousand larch alright when I do
with it

708
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:10,630
things and i actually use for things hi

709
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:14,310
if I can't actually identify weren't the
actual IP czar

710
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:17,320
a tapas cheap

711
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,850
you can actually I had throwing bro I D
ash or

712
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:23,960
anything else in there just a guy hadn't

713
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,260
figure out what the heck's going on and

714
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:30,400
can emphasize this enough a lot of
people

715
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,290
don't do things the old school way and
don't use pen and paper

716
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:40,230
but I get smart and I decide that I'm
gonna add shortcut thanks

717
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:43,840
protect myself am I just take pictures
of everything

718
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:47,670
up becomes evidence

719
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:51,930
he actually might lose your Asha for
whatever

720
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:58,930
long meant to that takes to guide your
search and cast and what not story

721
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:04,490
where companies

722
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:08,709
for that part

723
00:46:08,709 --> 00:46:10,618
but prettiest economic monitor

724
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:14,650
passwords up

725
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:18,259
alrighty then

726
00:46:18,259 --> 00:46:23,939
share containment plan you have been
breached

727
00:46:23,939 --> 00:46:27,629
I'll what's gotten just unplug the
machine

728
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:31,049
and our even large

729
00:46:31,049 --> 00:46:35,849
much guy hadn't this isn't an actual
dashtop machine

730
00:46:35,849 --> 00:46:39,359
this is in production even better idea

731
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:44,288
well we have that dr Shaw right it
totally hasn't been patch for

732
00:46:44,289 --> 00:46:50,009
ninety days but arch let's go ahead and
subject that to them because

733
00:46:50,009 --> 00:46:53,670
if we want patch before we're definitely
not patched in

734
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:57,189
the hot dr Shaw sorry sale

735
00:46:57,189 --> 00:47:00,808
even more things for your attacker to
God

736
00:47:00,809 --> 00:47:05,249
play with but well we're going ahead and
doing that will guide Ramage

737
00:47:05,249 --> 00:47:12,249
box just backup or faster

738
00:47:13,939 --> 00:47:17,999
as you're gonna have two times three
times mahler village

739
00:47:17,999 --> 00:47:24,040
heard

740
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:28,759
I'll we would do that Aguilar

741
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,180
it would be pretty proud it would be
true pride

742
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:35,299
now now yes

743
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:41,520
up here

744
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:46,800
called

745
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,420
awesome show

746
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:54,930
lot of people out actually I and flush
out their attacker

747
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:59,270
ob when people yet

748
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:02,880
of phishing emails %ah

749
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,470
when I do it usually thrown why actually
wanna

750
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:10,709
reason why lawton as if I'm running an
app

751
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:14,820
I might be lucky enough to have ap Aug
Sep can actually I had

752
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:20,220
Revo my attacker at the very least

753
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:23,759
I actually can go ahead and create data

754
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,370
that I can go ahead and at least find
show

755
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:30,970
what can I make that unique even if my
developer shock

756
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:34,370
I can guide make fake user names that I
can identify

757
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:37,799
I def liking I had no other the hash

758
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:42,650
on a weak password I used feed Fisher
awesome I get more IP addresses

759
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:46,880
I now know what this guys coming out

760
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:52,860
me with her Tagaris

761
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:57,500
you can obviously three years large just
given

762
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:00,510
you max cause them to identify
themselves by

763
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:05,460
what you feed them fish its same reason
with password

764
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:07,920
reminders

765
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,770
just used ask you where your first
junior high school

766
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:14,339
action answer you just know what the
answer

767
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:18,078
missed defeat the enemy token

768
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,450
used later may try to use

769
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:25,839
but more importantly when I actually go
ahead and feed this information

770
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:30,140
what you can actually do is you can go I
had new can actually feed it

771
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:33,450
in SLO I can do these one at a time

772
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:38,118
at the speed of what I can do human
lines or can actually God

773
00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:42,079
write a script to go ahead and flood my
attacker and see if that flight actually

774
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,140
comes back

775
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:46,740
am i dealing with a human behind the
keyboard

776
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:50,259
are my dealing with bought that actually
just gonna go ahead and send it right

777
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:50,950
back to me

778
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:54,299
you need to nail is

779
00:49:54,299 --> 00:49:57,450
is this human or shift or is this

780
00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:01,210
automated if its automated usually it's
easy enough to take down

781
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:04,280
attack spark player

782
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,799
type feel like fury

783
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:12,509
responses back as chances are the park

784
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:19,510
Korean Starcraft how

785
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,069
im

786
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:26,640
I can see yeah about that that's
probably true

787
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:32,509
that show basically in assessing the
attackers capability

788
00:50:32,510 --> 00:50:36,100
you after blamed all these things about
the attackers

789
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,210
I can obviously tech all your IP
addresses

790
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:42,490
and anger had and look

791
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:46,669
at the sidewalk capabilities are they
actually using slashes are they using

792
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:50,600
marash %ah attackers have gotten a lot
better

793
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,420
and the fact that they know that
everybody does

794
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:59,420
chill IP location actually known people
to actually go ahead

795
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:03,530
and set up an attack based in the same
data center

796
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:07,760
and at the same cider block that you're
under should actually looks

797
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,810
like the spammer is actually Shannon
from a legitimate

798
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:15,890
forged matter because I'm in the sign
same IP ranges you are

799
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:19,650
sale are smart enough to go ahead and do
that

800
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:23,570
that's when I god do Sam some

801
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:27,510
I sent I'll don't be afraid to go ahead

802
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:31,690
and start ripping your attacker art
they're definitely doing it to you

803
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:35,770
and it doesn't take any time at all cell

804
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:40,500
once again guidance can

805
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,710
feel free to go ahead and get direct
with your attacker after you go ahead

806
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:45,840
and identify them

807
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,840
it's kinda funny to go I hadn't

808
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:53,390
if all else fails when I finally
actually know where they came from

809
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:57,609
send him an email would you kindly I had
knock it off

810
00:51:57,610 --> 00:52:02,090
it can happen

811
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:05,150
or you can go ahead and deal with up

812
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:10,370
the ISPR provider haha funny thing is is
that when Adm

813
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:14,310
I'm a call to the sky I said

814

more cool I'm a

832
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,530
you're going to ask her national housing
that

833
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:38,530
here yeah

834
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:43,910
all

835
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:50,640
could be fun years I had another
incident where there were some

836
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,879
intellectual property that was
supposedly leaked

837
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:00,530
where provided a single website how my
god there's a poster to a movie that

838
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:01,660
hasn't even been out yet

839
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:05,740
I'll we wanna had and actually found

840
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:09,270
the watermark to damage compared it
against

841
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:13,580
the one that we knew that was good and
after we knew that it was an Argentine

842
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:14,840
league from OSH

843
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,490
game was on sale when I hadn't

844
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:21,569
found that the sky posted in many
different forms in

845
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:26,510
farms Canali IP addresses and yeah I had
a nice letter come in Tom

846
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:32,560
sale anne's same email address you
always use for every form shall

847
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:39,560
it's not that hard to find them best
part is actually fine in his home

848
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:42,870
IP address after we directly email them
same

849
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:46,170
yeah it was really cool and he wrote me
back from his house

850
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:49,740
and that actually had a picture his
house

851
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:54,040
its from Skokie IL here's Damon

852
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,210
rest these are the people

853
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:01,340
these are the people getting past these

854
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:05,900
all scary trend p.m. all because they're
not bound

855
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:10,470
or but they're not bound by these these
business decisions are being made

856
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:13,620
not bound by the

857
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:16,660
people around us something to work with
adult plans we do

858
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:19,990
you're doing stuff like post here

859
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:23,799
of arms his obviously

860
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,400
not prize thinkers

861
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,630
but the family past us right because our

862
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:32,940
IDS is alright yes learning are

863
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:37,280
firewalls don't have the proper roles is
we can't let the application die

864
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,089
now have 80,000 alerts instead a forty
thousand we

865
00:55:41,089 --> 00:55:44,520
just can't bother to look at share

866
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,790
las partes lessons learned well if
you're

867
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:51,720
doing things differently should actually
be doing your intelligence gathering

868
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:56,709
to turn your attacker skill set
understanding the attacker

869
00:55:56,710 --> 00:56:01,849
understanding the murders usually its
money and I hadn't

870
00:56:01,849 --> 00:56:05,829
not be afraid to go I hadn't hit them
back create automated tools

871
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:08,910
I love lace talk on our

872
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:12,790
teacher wife new tricks it was awesome
and our

873
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:16,609
basically feel free to add newshour

874
00:56:16,609 --> 00:56:21,240
a lesson to learn about similar
attackers that could possibly I had

875
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:25,180
and do things to you that you should be
blocking %ah

876
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:29,950
preemptively before actually come at you
show

877
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:33,230
we get a last part and

878
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:37,260
pickerel which is lessons learned while
usually they take my report

879
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,540
find a circular ban thrown away

880
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:44,349
sweep it under the carpet doesn't solve
the issue

881
00:56:44,349 --> 00:56:47,390
hopefully what you'll be doing is

882
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:51,308
fine I hadn't everything that you wanna
had dead

883
00:56:51,309 --> 00:56:54,640
as far as learning about your attacker
your rear alling

884
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:59,420
and looking for the SamTrans you should
be able to go I had

885
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:03,000
and take the same trends and now you
know who's attacking you

886
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,290
and seashell are things and make sure
that

887
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:10,079
you're actually making things happen
just

888
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:13,299
fire in existence just fire spend just
fire

889
00:57:13,299 --> 00:57:20,089
need learned in the past present and
management billion dollar plan to it and

890
00:57:20,089 --> 00:57:23,520
with the lessons learned week under
threat intelligence

891
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,130
the bus routes threatened Telligent she
could possibly

892
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:31,160
deal with is the ones that are happened
to you

893
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:35,470
by people knocking on your door 80,000
40,000

894
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:38,669
millions of times do you really have to
pay for one

895
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:41,819
yet free a in all free every day

896
00:57:41,819 --> 00:57:45,160
the old and your company right now is
ones

897
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,288
you man your own device you can buy

898
00:57:48,289 --> 00:57:54,220
from anybody you watch it's not golden
you have and layered Spurs

899
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:59,558
and what your machines are tell you
right and it basically that will go

900
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,509
ahead and conclude our talk

901
00:58:01,509 --> 00:58:08,509
thank you all question %ah

902
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:16,240

a stop at bearded today

909
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:40,470
also a user go ahead figure out

910
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:45,279
him

911
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:52,280

and I think once Mikes then

915
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:08,410
ninety percent of the time when when
when I've dealt with these

916
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:12,480
if I Rana and maps can again see I P
that when I had

917
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,650
me credits not nobody's how
