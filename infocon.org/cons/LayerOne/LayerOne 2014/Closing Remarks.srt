1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,019
Allah is annoyed back there somewhere I
just saw is screw back their stats to

2
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:18,240
shop this school year

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,869
anybody who's contributed like you know
thousands of dollars every year for the

4
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:22,289
task

5
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:28,789
last 10 years to make this possible
should be after US career and he just

6
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:31,550
went to the party's not here

7
00:00:31,550 --> 00:01:00,930
0 is here somewhere there's one that's
standing in the middle of us this one

8
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:12,330
people make it this year his status is
quite a bit flexible bunch about it

9
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:20,600
alright here's dinner ground with so did
you guys enjoy our 10 year anniversary

10
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:36,649
of the other people on staff at as ten
years and I've been nine out of 10 later

11
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:46,110
ones are eight out of nine their wounds
technically and more on that later I

12
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,130
really wanted to try and do something we
haven't done before for this year and in

13
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:59,369
a number of things this year we really
brought a lot of stuff to the content so

14
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:05,250
the first thing I wanted to talk about
was the Q backs launched her go so how

15
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:14,200
many of you saw the key back to lunch we
know so far as much pictures show you

16
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:21,160
talk about

17
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:27,609
so that's not a thumbnail that's like
literally the resolution of context but

18
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:31,850
we don't take it for granted right like
wi-fi send data rule lot of data really

19
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:38,450
quickly but all the images that were
sent down on Saturday were all at 300

20
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:47,670
pod were talking like 320 by 240 240
resolution but he backs finally broke

21
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,510
like all the havoc seem have been trying
to go above a hundred thousand feet we

22
00:02:51,510 --> 00:03:00,239
finally broke a hundred thousand feet we
did a hundred and fifty thousand feet

23
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:07,150
it's been a long journey we've figured
out how to send back pictures and

24
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:14,430
hopefully somewhere maybe your house is
a lot of clouds but we got beautiful

25
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,940
pictures as it was flying up there we
don't have to recover it's now somewhere

26
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,770
in the Pacific Ocean

27
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:27,130
he signed it will give you money good
luck played out and hopefully I mean she

28
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,510
does one do another one next year

29
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:34,510
yeah yeah hopefully video through an
attorney to live streaming video ads

30
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:41,570
flying up so central to make it flow so
we can go across the United States cool

31
00:03:41,570 --> 00:04:01,380
I guess the next contest that will just
talk about quick it's hard to explain

32
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:08,450
was the application how many of you had
the pleasure of seeing our code yeah did

33
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,540
you guys like it

34
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:16,539
yeah so this is the first contest that
every single participant has told me to

35
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,829
go fuck myself so

36
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:24,349
that just makes me very happy I feel
like we don't get that response then

37
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:26,688
we're not doing it right it's not just
me its all the rest of the amenities

38
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:34,050
John stand stand stand back in the back
but we all wrote really hideous code and

39
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,740
all the worst possible languages we can
find including like nineteen seventies

40
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,210
medical programming languages which I'm
told they're still in use I'm sorry for

41
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:48,378
any of you who after work in that field
we did some enforce some impure assembly

42
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:50,629
you know everything under the Sun

43
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:55,000
the winner thanks sorry if there was a
reference for banks are we would make a

44
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,300
whole goddamn contest on it but
unfortunately it's too ugly and nobody

45
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,930
wanted to document it also in that
language comments are strictly not

46
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:10,940
allowed so should give you some idea of
that but the winning team was mosey

47
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,830
which is a Cal Poly Pomona student team
has won a stand up and say hi

48
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:21,229
yeah yeah

49
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:28,610
so there was a total of 15 problems I
want to say you guys solve six to eight

50
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,280
of them remember offhand the second
place team was the North Spacelabs team

51
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:44,309
and they did really good third place was
an individual player hot dogs who did

52
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:53,810
really well in total we got something
like fifty registered teams is also open

53
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:58,100
remote players CTF time dot org was put
season they want to list it because

54
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,210
we're not part of the CTF ranking scheme
but we hope to fix that and I will do

55
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:08,690
some really horrible contest for them
the first on the list for anybody who

56
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,450
wanted to know what the ASCII game was
written in this cold months and it is as

57
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:17,320
disease worthy as the name gives it so
look that up solve the problem will

58
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,000
probably reenable the website sometime
next week if you just wanna grab the

59
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,330
problems in trying to solve them also
showed us to JAMA love no space for

60
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,169
finding a bug in the scoring system
which was running her from getting first

61
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,250
place for a while

62
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:41,630
anything you want to say about the next
contest in a similar vein was the first

63
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,430
time we've done this was capture the
flag by Dec 949 Francona come up and

64
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:51,780
talk about it

65
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:59,789
for a ride up about CTF and I kept
saying hey Frank the write-up I'm gonna

66
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:03,639
go straight if you don't give it to me
we ended up hosting frank's verbatim

67
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,040
thing in the programs and if you're
offended I really don't care cuz it's

68
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:29,090
really funny so I'll let frank talk but
they're okay so the idea behind this ETF

69
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:35,060
Lake modern CTF is really hard you know
it's not your bad reason but it's just

70
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,100
like there's a lot of really hard
exploits mostly focused on reverse

71
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,400
engineering and tendency to just trying
to kind of a macho about who can do the

72
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,400
most ridiculous exploit every bad but I
mean it kind of gets boring after awhile

73
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:57,549
because it winds up being a 1% thing and
there won't be no for connecting soon so

74
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,880
I'm not saying they're not hackers
because they're just focusing on this

75
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,550
one is it's very obvious that they are
most of the people who want it going to

76
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:13,150
these things are fucking military
contractors and shit this is yeah I

77
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:21,820
guess so go you little bit so apparently
this causes resonance that's interesting

78
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:27,570
this doesn't whatever but yeah a lot of
this ETF games these days also had this

79
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:32,640
really weird gentlemen's agreement it's
like the other players don't act

80
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,939
scoreboard

81
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,210
Don't Tell hackers hackers fucking
stupid strategic hiking is really

82
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,760
fucking badass and I love it it's really
fun but late because quals

83
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,370
protects the actual CTS from you know
all the plebs that don't know what the

84
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,270
fuck you're doing it's anyone's of being
the only like the one percent of all the

85
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,970
fucking ridiculous crazy hackers out
there

86
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,370
wind up getting you know the funds which
is basically cheating hacking and I just

87
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,200
cant say fuck that that's tenet silly

88
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,280
hate that so that's why did basically
designed this puzzle you know a lot of

89
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,550
the puzzles are simply mean only 200 was
fucking route or the hit was haters

90
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,439
economy San Diego if you know anything
about that you know it's all based on

91
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,880
that fucking passwords so a lot of the
harder puzzles are designed to be hard

92
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,680
requires skilled at it was scaled up
Lake one of the trivial and doing it

93
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,109
again I'm sorry so I mean one of one of
the tribune 101 was really easy I mean

94
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,360
they're blank our rights

95
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,880
exactly there you go you just scored a
hundred points so hard at things like

96
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,040
unpacking 500 was a single RDG take-home
crypter which is something that a bunch

97
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,550
of people on the underground use it it's
kind of hilarious shit in it but it

98
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:50,780
still sucks enough to be usable for the
competition so you are if if anybody was

99
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,250
able to get that unfortunately they
didn't they would have gotten you know

100
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:59,180
the name of it existed to be hacked Lake
one of my favorite parts of doing this

101
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,699
was if you made a 404

102
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,840
I set it up so that there was a 404 page
they're basically any time you headed

103
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,060
there are a lot of ways to hit it like
giving a wrong answer would make you hit

104
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:15,219
the 404 page so I went up happening is
if you hit the store for page in your

105
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,410
HTTP headers would be a special header
called eczema dingle berry and it was

106
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,540
just basically tell everybody your
password so usually usually this isn't

107
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,640
that much of an issue unless you're on a
switch network which skid row is in the

108
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,860
scoreboard is over HTTP also your
session is just a B 64 cookie of your

109
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:39,280
username and password so by design
everybody is a target so if you want to

110
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,370
really win the game you really have to
play dirty by designer else you won't

111
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:49,130
win this is a small thing of the past of
some of the awards you can get as you

112
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:54,670
can see the dingleberry award was the
most awarded thing in the game followed

113
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:58,420
by the shameful word which is basically
winds of giving points to the scoreboard

114
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,520
and then you may notice here that the
next most scored thing is a thing called

115
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:09,760
the relocation the competition you're
pretty much losing when you broke into

116
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,800
other people's accounts with that
password and then there is basically a

117
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,290
thing to do

118
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,240
the puzzle click on it says
congratulations you want it is but this

119
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,389
is now take it away

120
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:22,110
you feeling your team name on there
scoreboard you get a hundred points they

121
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,139
lose the puzzle so they would have to
restore the answer eventually you

122
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:29,870
wouldn't be allowed to do another
evacuation for another minute but you

123
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:34,949
would still basically get points out of
that so sometimes noticed that you know

124
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:39,949
the game was really happy couple others
are poisoning was hilarious

125
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:44,490
some people didn't like one dude
actually mention solvent Acme 400 which

126
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,069
was another underground packer and I was
like whoa that dude actually solved it

127
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:52,300
and then I looked in the database table
and it was gone to someone revoked it on

128
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:58,990
someone so someone actually came up to
me and was like dude dude what is this

129
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,360
is which network do everybody can see
the traffic if you do it that way was I

130
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:11,300
guess he was like fuck it just blew me
away that there is like that there is

131
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,920
there is hackable infrastructure it was
great but there is there is one of the

132
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,490
things one of the reasons I designed
this competition the way I did was to

133
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,529
have one of these most absolutely
beautiful moments happen

134
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:26,110
surrender that I was talking about 200
was just like root or on a Linux box

135
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,120
blah blah

136
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,600
like dot profile had haha fuck you exit
0 so it wasn't really easy login you'd

137
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,100
have to figure out how to get around
that part but after you figure out how

138
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,269
to it's really easy to get around but I
mean after figure how to get that you

139
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:42,519
have root on a box and because there's
all this shit you can play due to each

140
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:45,910
other maybe you should try tunneling to
the box of people can see your traffic

141
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,870
anymore

142
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,940
might might be some food for thought but
this one under 400 I have a better idea

143
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,339
I'm just gonna run across job on that
box to be safely steals everybody else's

144
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:59,550
points and basically screwed with all
the other teams and just lose my laptop

145
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:05,359
and walk away cuz i fucken one and
that's a wonderful using this god damn

146
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,089
this one is compromised system is
fucking the real scoreboard if we can

147
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:15,670
work beautifully it was great it was
absolutely wonderful so let's talk about

148
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,920
the winners

149
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:26,589
so there are two categories of winners
the alcoholics were the people who

150
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:30,649
scored the most points and the heroin
addicts with the people who scored least

151
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:33,940
points because you get negative points
there's going to be a really negative

152
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:39,130
person so with the heroin addicts the
top of the chain with negative sixty

153
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,750
three thousand five hundred and two
points

154
00:13:41,750 --> 00:14:05,649
digital sure those books apparently so
come up and get a book shop class that's

155
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:16,139
a good price shipped ok and the winner
of the SKIDROW CTF with seventy 6328

156
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:21,199
points these SKIDROW scoreboard
unfortunately the SKIDROW scoreboard

157
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:28,630
can't win so unfortunately the
scoreboard is not as Indian entities so

158
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:32,000
it's not technically qualified to win
any prizes were the competition itself

159
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,610
so in second place in second place with
twenty five thousand nine hundred and

160
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,209
fifty eight points team Vande

161
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:46,008
who utilized to utilize the wonderful
wonderful rooted box to actually

162
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:47,009
accomplish

163
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:51,290
trouncing the rest of the people in the
competition it was absolutely beautiful

164
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,569
so congratulations team van who also
wants to give you some all plugged open

165
00:14:55,569 --> 00:15:10,140
CDF which is in inheritance from us you
like to give a shout out yet

166
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:18,660
so yeah thank you very much guys will
see you next year was a lot of fun we'll

167
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:22,449
definitely have to do this again with a
lot more planning it's going to be

168
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:27,180
probably a ridiculous competition I want
to see more like absolutely ridiculous

169
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:32,089
things that thing with the root of boxes
beautiful absolutely beautiful thank you

170
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:41,760
very much I forgot to mention diop first
and second place come get a book and a

171
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:50,939
shot glass you'll need it for the
drinking after the weekend the next

172
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:59,130
contest is the tamper evident contest so
in previous years that the basic premise

173
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:03,640
of the temperament contest has not
previously we would give you a cardboard

174
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:09,630
or some kind of box or container and you
would have that for 48 hours to open an

175
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:14,689
incompletely reseal into any challenges
or or secondary boxes are to share boxes

176
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:19,740
inside of it in the goal is to give it
back to us looking exactly like how we

177
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:25,600
gave it to you might seem a little
easier than it really is this year John

178
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,400
and I being big fans of what we have
dubbed intelligence sport it's like

179
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:37,360
locks board we did the room so what the
room was was a literal hotel room where

180
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,800
instead of giving them a box we gave
them access to the room for 30 minutes

181
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,620
because we're even crazier than that we
also had we give them instructions to

182
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,840
find the man with the briefcase
handcuffed to his wrist Skyler here

183
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:57,500
later played the cobbler in this tale of
intrigue and mystery and the cobbler

184
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,640
gave them each a burner phone which is
the most drug dealer phone we can

185
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,100
possibly find

186
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:11,790
so this guess what this costs this cost
$5 and it has 20 minutes of airtime and

187
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:22,869
it requires no transaction besides the
initial $5 purchase and activation so

188
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:28,540
I'm sure that John and I i know i felt
about when we went to buy these in San

189
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,860
hey we might end burner phones that
require no money whatsoever and the

190
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,850
least amount of airtime possible we only
need this is the clerks feel like we

191
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:45,879
only need it for an hour tomorrow

192
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:54,400
from the town was extremely helpful once
when she sold at six of them she told us

193
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:01,950
when we get more access to other CD ESAs
cosas que six wasn't enough so anybody

194
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,630
who's a fan of The Wire will appreciate
the burner phone a think so eventually

195
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,630
they got a call on their burning home in
a random time and said you know you to

196
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,600
meet your contact at this location at
which point they have 30 minutes to

197
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,879
tamper everything in the hotel room the
goal was that the there's a bad guy in

198
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,600
the hotel room and you want to get all
the information about him and who is in

199
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,790
contact with and what they're doing and
all that kind of stuff so we monitored

200
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:32,460
all of this for liability reasons and
hilarity and we have some footage which

201
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:51,720
allege on-air a first-team entering the
room with sound on their senior

202
00:18:51,720 --> 00:19:14,220
wide range of professionalism is
competition there's one team of Google

203
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,960
glass recording the entire hit and latex
gloves is beautiful this is teamwork

204
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,929
like this are simultaneously each
tampering something he's easily

205
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:33,460
communicated then right back to work
this is the scope ok logic goes faster

206
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:41,000
how much how you also watch the guy in
the back as a way to get back to that

207
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:57,390
later right step on the murders so they
may have it I just have that just took

208
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:04,390
over there he brought the safe and put
it in the shower and then left for sport

209
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,400
operative in the world

210
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,919
he's been like this week shots he
doesn't do a thing the whole time

211
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:19,450
same guy from earlier just hang out this
team leaving the room there are 23

212
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,460
minutes late so they've already been
been killed as far as the story is

213
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:30,210
concerned they leave

214
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:45,450
already the most careful thorough team
in the world

215
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:59,350
surveys are trip wires in the room we
down now we have a hero he's entered the

216
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:15,689
room this is sick had Delta Force
catalog in the walls when we got it was

217
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:23,169
not you it was not it was just a blue I
but pretty good I that's that's what we

218
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:29,370
have for you and the other walls so we
hope will help them have you played

219
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:34,760
enjoyed that that contest again and
again next year we'll probably do

220
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,309
something equally crazy

221
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:44,220
intelligence for will continue front
desk yes the whole hotel will be in play

222
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:50,049
actually the original idea we break up
second and let them now

223
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:53,500
original idea was hired as regard to
knock on your door if you set the alarm

224
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:58,480
off and you wouldn't know if he was
there legitimate leader not

225
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,390
we're gonna instructed to say why are
you for a sawzall wearing latex glove in

226
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,020
the dark

227
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:09,929
the reason we can do that has the hotel
does not have security on staff during

228
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:32,390
the day just got done your homework
Skyler or so because I'm total

229
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:38,450
idiot every year eugenia male couple
days before in a psychosocial and he

230
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:42,260
said oh we got this we got this room for
the contest you could sleep in there you

231
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:48,120
have to be at the time usually sleep in
their suspect about that we had one team

232
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,139
come and they give us their debrief and
john was awesome posting the debrief

233
00:22:52,140 --> 00:23:01,250
really really good they said in the butt
plug do it do it Johnson founder ok ok

234
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:08,530
with either immediately after they were
done we all ran into the room where the

235
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:13,970
fuck is the public have you been in any
of the hotel rooms if you look in the

236
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:18,170
wardrobe the bathroom there to help you
address attorney that you pull out the

237
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:21,860
bottom drawer doesn't come out of the
way you can sneak your hand behind it

238
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:32,219
and was convinced it was something else
and I grabbed it I pulled out and was

239
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,250
very clearly a butt plug

240
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:38,410
so you are so deep

241
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:43,420
TIGI TIGI insisted he's a mystery solved
mystery solved must been one of the

242
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:49,460
other teams I said no it was lubricated
and guilty because none of you would

243
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:56,410
think to do that

244
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:01,530
that was definitely a moment to remember
in the tavern got test likely we did not

245
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:08,690
involve any video that one I still
maintain it was probably one of you but

246
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:18,100
makes for a nice story either way but
John's like to the scoring well I'm not

247
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:31,689
a moron so I remember that dan Tendler
and Mr Bob 1

248
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:40,600
dance dance team won because the the
actually collected all the intelligence

249
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,039
is just ripping everything I'll be
getting in and getting out they were

250
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,320
also the least funky team we gave teams
code names and then we call them he said

251
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:56,460
what's your code name I don't know and
so we're like what's your real name so

252
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,750
we had a thing if we can get real
information from the contestants they

253
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:04,370
would lose points because what kind of
operative does that there was also a

254
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:08,268
team who didn't get the phone call and
other stuff I I maintain that

255
00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:13,559
shenanigans on their part three tests
all these phones and whatnot but I hope

256
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:22,860
your level of tradecraft levels up next
year the belt buckle in the closet just

257
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:29,229
as Beyond's one team research the
absolute fuck out of his belt buckle so

258
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:32,090
there was a little Journal of the guy
who's in the room he said you know I

259
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,769
have high blood pressure thing about
getting a cat release stress and they go

260
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:41,620
the belt buckle was made in Los Gatos
which means that

261
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:48,370
and we're like a fucking belt buckle
guys but they didn't they didn't assess

262
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:51,209
the value of the top secret documents
that we have a place in the room

263
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:55,070
belt buckles cover though you wanna know
anything about that belt buckle we got

264
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,020
you

265
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:01,760
nevermind who's killing who is paying
off who we really hope you guys like it

266
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,790
we got a lot of really good feedback on
the contest this year congrats to Dannon

267
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:14,960
company 404 winning I know Mr Bhatt
headed out but congrats to all of you if

268
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,800
if you wanna know your full scoring for
your team to send myself a John an email

269
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:28,530
after the conference will be happy to
send you all the points values next we

270
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,779
have ham testing how many of you to test

271
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:35,129
well that's good just three people
passed and three people raise their

272
00:26:35,129 --> 00:26:36,809
hands

273
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:42,090
Jan and all the guys who helped him out
with had a really great job again they

274
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:45,099
want to do it again next year so sign up
early if you want to do that so they

275
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:47,149
know what to expect

276
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:51,478
we also had the lock picking packing and
hardware hacking villages did you guys

277
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:59,359
enjoy all of those additional airline I
feel like we have a pretty serious

278
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:04,019
hardware hacking village I don't know
about you but whenever I decide I went

279
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:10,629
from later once I could use really nice
equipment so I'm gonna let em and

280
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:15,189
Charlie start talking we got a ten year
anniversary slideshow last 10 years of

281
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:18,889
Larry wants to enjoy some of the photos

282
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:53,099
passed out people take over badge for
everybody who order will receive their

283
00:27:53,099 --> 00:28:07,649
badges you need to know of anyone about
the smell is an accomplished

284
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:44,900
last two days coding and it's it's
amazing

285
00:28:44,900 --> 00:29:35,830
indicate here decided to download it on
overnight on the wireless which turned

286
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,800
out to be a bad idea

287
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:52,139
400 bytes hours so it's kind of fun so
we have all the environment the one on

288
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:59,510
the right there

289
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:34,450
so we've been working on this is last
year 6 revisions of the bad you see on

290
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:38,640
the topic as read six is actually read
one of the board this board right three

291
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:46,010
days ago we'd ever see me about it like
a Saturday hours shipped out Malaysia

292
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:54,350
Malaysia decided that on Thursday there
are days in Malaysia their holidays in

293
00:30:54,350 --> 00:31:00,639
the middle of the week that mean that
Thursday's actually Monday and get them

294
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:07,440
to my house and so they got banned by
FedEx which we can get to in times of

295
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,060
the day our time which is a couple days
ago

296
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:17,429
building them he tested or even built
one because we completely redesigned

297
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:19,960
five of the revisions of this page

298
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:26,450
processor processors altogether because
each stage because we want to go faster

299
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:36,000
processor and we went through 50
rigorous process at 268 the 210 so

300
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:48,280
so this time what we've done is Ed we
can move up and down and select all the

301
00:31:48,280 --> 00:32:05,610
different functions in a record the play
it back if you put a sponsor for the

302
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:15,550
budget which was not easy to change
their name just before we decide which

303
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:23,870
is great because we do it again and this
is the age at which everyone gets one of

304
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:30,290
these this allows you to capture a chess
hid my fair election stuff ti stuff

305
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:37,139
there's about a hundred or so different
types is caused this can read this is a

306
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:43,820
much larger memory 512 K visit the
original post mark so you can store more

307
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,580
little yes he called on it as a speaker
which is the most important thing is

308
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:52,780
because of anyone seen original problem
I have one or is it can do is study and

309
00:32:52,780 --> 00:33:14,030
it will find studs in and gave it costs
and costs as it was I didn't tell it can

310
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:24,980
be programmed to the USD

311
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:41,700
virus fairly has a virus us there's 2012
the FPGA one is for the processor once

312
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:50,500
its initial flash you can upload the USB
OS X for Mac is also quite enjoyed so

313
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,400
this can be plugged into an Android
phone and you've got a full solution

314
00:33:53,400 --> 00:34:13,109
inside Android iPhone users does have a
joke

315
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:25,369
yuri ASIC the components the back of the
disease however three amps 500 million

316
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:35,980
look we're also going to change a couple
of things in the way that can scan about

317
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:46,580
205 killing range and 13.5 six is fixed
so we can actually sweet different

318
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,899
ranges

319
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:59,359
normally 1646 in no longer fixed so you
can scan is successfully six so it's

320
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:07,910
pretty good because we don't know what
caused you know all the time so it's got

321
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:11,399
extra features but it does other things
like say the stud finder is to something

322
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,520
I was kind of like this this will kind
of worker just water no space going to

323
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:22,730
put this thing on the wall here we need
to stud finder and it totally worked for

324
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,230
other applications

325
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:28,310
I think it's going to come in real handy
because it works in silico so there's

326
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:36,060
there's a frequency generator much much
higher so there's a whole bunch of

327
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:43,460
things you can do with replay attacks
people to bring back next year we got

328
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:47,359
them as we want to keep working and
trying to class next year

329
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:56,180
space and try to get people more
involved can do it can take micro or

330
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:18,109
mini USB both on and choose the cable
cars breaking broken I mean different

331
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:25,660
things to just show how insecure is we
we recently had a better come in order

332
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:43,299
to seize her like you come in and they
came in with this system we got from

333
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,700
this foreign country

334
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:56,859
ok that's great but i guess im trying
but next year's budget gonna be

335
00:36:56,859 --> 00:37:00,529
different this time last year that was a
huge mistake

336
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:09,640
huge mistake

337
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:14,560
gonna do

338
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:31,400
under-age yeah the bad for that year was
unbelievable finish the Christmas

339
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:39,280
everything year 2011 by the sympathize
aboard that was a lot of fun really

340
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:48,720
knowing used to like to bring you ice
crystals and that was her first

341
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,580
electronic parts which is also a fall
airboat this is a full about it later

342
00:37:53,580 --> 00:38:08,130
the black placeholder badges doubt on
board for this badge if you come see me

343
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:12,380
afterwards I'll give you the hell
everything goes on there was only meant

344
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:18,750
to be handed out but we need something
personal project of mine for this

345
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:40,520
product but the bigger 11 processors and
I'm using the mall tonight like Queens

346
00:38:40,520 --> 00:39:58,740
everybody I know it is really fun I
think it'll be fun badge the problem

347
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:06,049
with this message is that there's no way
out later one yes cuz we didnt many we

348
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:09,770
have a pic emplacement to pick in places
and my husband's converted into a

349
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:19,680
sweatshop finish

350
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:43,419
so building a mini quadcopter

351
00:40:43,420 --> 00:41:10,260
attack in beautiful so maybe maybe
flying RFID so guys like the the

352
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:18,309
ten-year slideshow anything lots of
memories we couldn't do this conference

353
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:22,660
without all the staff volunteers
especially all the sponsors who helped

354
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:26,720
find the dinner that we had last night
along with the party did you guys enjoy

355
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:40,149
that I had a lot of money so I kept
showing up with big handfuls of black

356
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:46,799
ships but but we really want to thank
all of our sponsors and our plan

357
00:41:46,799 --> 00:41:53,730
sponsors we have advanced Systems Group
privacy and NTC as well as big round of

358
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:59,660
applause for them

359
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:05,430
our sponsors were massive labs to work
on foundation wall of sheep and Apple

360
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:30,549
conductivity and hackers for charity so
aside from sponsors aside from all the

361
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:35,990
people who hosted events in villages we
love you all come out every year and

362
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:39,609
support us and have a good time if
there's anything you think we could do

363
00:42:39,609 --> 00:42:46,210
better just let us know send us emails
talk to me in person after this we all

364
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:52,280
hope you join us at the 23 be shot party
so if you google 23 me shop can figure

365
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:58,059
out directions it's like a contest you
have to figure out how to get there will

366
00:42:58,059 --> 00:43:03,119
be a nice big BBQ at the 23 hackerspace
which is a lot of fun in and of itself

367
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:11,970
doubly so pounds upon pounds of smoked
meat or you can go to Charlie's house

368
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:14,069
and help finish badges

369
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:24,530
anything else next year's annual
probably be back here because we're

370
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:33,830
having a blast it every year

371
00:43:33,830 --> 00:44:05,710
well that's probably better for us

372
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:14,410
you talk this morning it was like a
witness is the only took us all so

373
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:26,540
interesting side doing all the right
things to do then I'm gonna completely

374
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:31,089
ignore than that the moroccans and make
the stupidest thing that could possibly

375
00:44:31,089 --> 00:44:32,009
think of

376
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:40,349
absolutely and the best movie immunity
is Kevin Hart right onto home my God

377
00:44:40,349 --> 00:44:51,390
look after you so easily drag this out
for another half an hour but I think

378
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:55,509
