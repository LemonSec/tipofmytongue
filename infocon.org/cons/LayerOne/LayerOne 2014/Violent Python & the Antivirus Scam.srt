1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,119
for March

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,529
I'm glad to be here show I got a bunch
of other stuff

3
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:10,490
just ordered the end if there's time
which I think there will be bomb

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:14,320
but the most important thing is to
humiliate any buyers companies are gonna

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,650
pick a lot of people today

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,929
awe-struck shambolic to church ecology
ever just go at each other girl hacking

7
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:20,359
and

8
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:23,699
Melbourne houses and stuff like that um

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,249
so brilliance anti-virus and I hear

10
00:00:27,249 --> 00:00:30,339
the penetration testers always abusing
saying it's a piece a garbage

11
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:34,860
and there sometimes even exploits to
come in through the antivirus take over

12
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,519
your machine

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,060
but most rush including me have a little
people use anti-virus anyway because I'm

14
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,380
sure it stopping you from a lot of
attacks but the question is exactly what

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,300
is stopping

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,440
to the surest perfect and it seems like
if you make an attempt to get past image

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,010
knowledge be get past if you go to the
vendors to try to

18
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,120
mix have this all made clear to you you
get this any virus is dead

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,239
and the Muslim Russian company says
you're gonna move Irish hi percent

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,120
efficiency so

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,030
much that's not helping you very much
she go to the sky

22
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:09,460
which the public facially any buyers and
she might be in is very clear speaker so

23
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,460
he explained

24
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,109
calabash I can broadcast this is a very
influential talk

25
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:17,818
the mega-hit on and gave explaining what
anti-virus Chandu

26
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:21,030
I want can't do Sean gonna change to
play dish

27
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:28,030
sure you can hear each should play

28
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:39,240
for

29
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,780
well I missed

30
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:49,780
Christian strange

31
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,850
your

32
00:01:54,850 --> 00:02:01,850
stick

33
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:15,310
shaft

34
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:22,310
well

35
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,519
will just carry on watch

36
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,100
hey

37
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,590
are anyway I'll tell ya what I remember
him saying cuz very interesting she's

38
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,489
trying to explain

39
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:44,750
wide the antivirus industry could not
stop stuck church

40
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,900
and what he says is that there are

41
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,720
two kinds from our there's time our
written by James Bond which US

42
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,570
infinite resources and he owes John
jenny has all-state

43
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,700
backing him and that's why they can't
stop it cuz ur any fires

44
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,429
what they can save you from is just an
average dog the just wants to steal your

45
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,800
money

46
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,120
and this is my impression many hours I
thought

47
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,610
she's like a big tall wall in a locked
door

48
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,709
only somebody with special skills to get
through and %ah

49
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:18,900
show let's carry on see what happens.
your show if you try to make something

50
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,670
really lame than any buyer should know
about

51
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,250
on you can use Metasploit to make an
attack user measure

52
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,940
payload you can just make any check you
want the ship lost when I could think of

53
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,180
was by GP

54
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,269
just started listening port shuttle
shallow mission gorge

55
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:36,090
arm show you can used the extra man did
it will create

56
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,360
execute herbal when those cold right
there for you that you can just put in

57
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,940
and run

58
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,130
and if you do that any partial catch
latch thank God I mean what would be

59
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:45,630
good for

60
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,720
couldn't catch dash pictures appear in
detecting ish

61
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,140
and arm here's morton detecting it

62
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:57,548
but if you take look at what martin has
detected usually check to do is packed

63
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:00,239
Jim Harrick 34 shop

64
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,670
and if you look up what Norton has
detected it is much less reassuring if

65
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,319
you think about it is detected

66
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,768
distinguished patch using Metasploit pen
testing software

67
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:13,280
show apparently was not able to
understand that this team was making a

68
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,790
list

69
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,469
porch and offering a shell only noticed

70
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,989
pack and that's just her being that
makes you think the lani by Richard

71
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:22,770
stoppages

72
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,599
not stop it by these intelligent as I
think it should be and gosh initially a

73
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,580
partial

74
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,320
everybody's any fire she pick it up 37
of 49 H pretty good

75
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,710
on show other questions holeshot you
have to be

76
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,520
to be double shot and a immediately

77
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,870
to shelter dumps I think you will art

78
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,770
show what you have to do arm any entries
in this book

79
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,799
file Python but after a couple years now
this action book people recommended it

80
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,729
to me I used in my class last semester

81
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:57,800
you must use homework %um turned down a
bit more that would be good

82
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,720
they're working on anyway on so much

83
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,810
try to sheik stuff past any buyers
conditional demonstrating

84
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,020
start to finish it's not very hard shell
by NCI G feature first you have to make

85
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,500
this message plate payload

86
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,490
arm and in compiling the Pythons here's
my instruction church

87
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:21,270
there's the Metasploit payload just
going to pick

88
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:26,729
Holly collection image thing I'm going
to college home

89
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:29,880
stranger listening to me should rush

90
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,670
much college player one

91
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,820
March sure this makes Chico

92
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,700
not a Windows execute this is the
all-important

93
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,140
different church and now if you examine
one ish made

94
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,710
where one is made distinct

95
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,260
which is just taking the binary that
would've put in a Windows execute a ble

96
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,320
PE format

97
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,110
and putting in she show I do following
the book is like

98
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:00,520
convert tuition up I saw which is not a
lot just to do

99
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,349
Italy latched of and then you put the
stuff on the top

100
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:11,750
amperage

101
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,730
be jewish and at the bottom

102
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:20,290
pay close attention you are close to
Prince

103
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,400
menu punished sure this is how you
become change much

104
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,000
usage casting matched up in memory

105
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,940
as a blocker data and then execute each
patch

106
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:39,050
shashi ash and then I copy it to my just
chomp

107
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,600
trying to encourage %um rituals to work

108
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,740
K

109
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,090
now

110
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,440
tragically Russian just watched a sheer
are some good

111
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:58,760
and there's nothing I just created there
it is my evil Melbourne okay now I have

112
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,990
to compile the stuff

113
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,810
to make haifong into Windows execute a
boy

114
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,510
takes a couple steps to set that up but
winner John

115
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,469
you just have pipped when working on
Windows I happen to be doing on server

116
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,510
2008 Renault

117
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,789
particularly good reason arm sold

118
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:19,020
this thing usually a pipe on compiler I
can use shellac just put them on my just

119
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,430
stop

120
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,700
and then here I can do

121
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:29,400
back much large action

122
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,520
hi install on file no conscious March

123
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,719
show that's my Windows command line

Dodge

131
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:12,200
if I run the stang you can challenge
done by using a command prompt

132
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,020
additional do

133
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:20,020
match dash minus a.m. height more

134
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:27,419
it is listen on port 4444 on all too she
peered rush

here's my IP address 192 168 119 191

136
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:34,770
shelf I go to my colleague Linux box for
example

137
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,149
which would be

138
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:41,990
this one I can just connect to it on
that porch

139

NRG rush

140
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,910
such as June catch on on each

and no I mean much show the one hundred
more control because this man hours

144
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:06,130
piping outer shell which is obviously
not a good thing arch

145
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,360
show you would expect anti-virus to
catch that and Dutch

this michelle has Kaspersky anti-virus
and I'll ship which compiles but a

150
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,709
national

151
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:32,520
completely over much we preach on that
same time but objection and I wanted to

152
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,209
be able to demonstrate more than one
inch I'm in this talk show

153
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:38,670
on arch there we are

which each dish dash ministers me me

155
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,339
when the ship are when the Sun with any

159
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,050
okay ago jim don't complain yes

160
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,649
when you run it antivirus

161
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:09,649
to top up and do something about

162
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,660
there we go can access it and region can
access discuss the Anne barge block

163
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,969
which is what you expect so Kaspersky
can catch that dangerous behavior

164
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:27,550
but the dangers behavior is not very
nice shirt again went 32 generic stuff

165
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,880
it's not really understanding very much
about she go back much largely

166
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,970
talk about to speech show that much
perhaps reassuring if you make

167
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,100
really really lame malware ill get
clutch

168
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,410
now when I first thing I did me this
mission up to virustotal

169
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,410
initial totally full Marshall an hour I
showed you

170
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,329
is not detected by ritual at all one
other 50 and that's a very lame

171
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,830
false-positive looking heuristic
detection so I shed

172
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,890
the scrutiny March vendors bunch church
do a good job at all

173
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,150
and Dom sold nor is paying attention on
Twitter

174
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:03,439
and to most potluck Norton xio changed
well one really grew the company should

175
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,510
try blocking our

176
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,230
and Martin support immediately came up
injured I'm sorry you're having a

177
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,900
problem

178
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,970
product what can I do for you like
instantly Russian well

179
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,980
was being review and European plates me
I refreshed

180
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,490
this is a good company choices well now
that you mention I don't you block to

181
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:18,940
stop

182
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,730
usual arm are well I'm not sure initial
about the Shocker me a pretty day trial

183
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,460
your stuff

184
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,420
but he told me get a good ish in
Anchorage if you really installed

185
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,810
it would really like that stuff because
we have actually futuristic detection

186
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,469
which buyers total does not have I
should okay what she

187
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,170
commute 30 day trial needed and as you
can see Kaspersky blotch

188
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,430
and Martin bottcher jew with their
powerful heuristic scanning

189
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,510
show that was true so not much

190
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,710
Python version Orton round one and
Kaspersky wenge to

191
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:52,650
an ash dust at least on the early March
injected but when you take a look at

192
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,310
what age really detecting it's not quite
a reassuring

193
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:58,800
show hi put that on Twitter Russian well
I was complaining about not

194

00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,360
tell me how

200
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,540
and Julie told me how all you have to do
is delay the on-chip

201
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,410
and if you delay because it just

202
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,640
run the heuristic scanning all the time
just Raj for the first few seconds after

203
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,490
nap watch

204
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:33,150
and chill arm all you do is you had this
one line to the Python challenge to show

205
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:33,650
you that

206
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:38,819

which

219
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,859
well can happen China confused WordPad

all

225
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:09,190
the one more nasty thing my changes made
to see no consul compile she can't you

226
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:09,650

227
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,709

00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,500
fresh energy continue

231
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,380
and then search specialist show jewish
try that stuff on a machine protected by

232
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,640
powerful anti-virus

233
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:35,339
change

234
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:38,440
manner ago replace the old one

235
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:44,019
church down here go to my eye

shipping %um automatically

240
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,910
brought my lunch line anyway this one
here

241
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:15,920
on a law firm gonna wait long enough for
this to happen but Kaspersky will stop

242
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,969
it but yeah kasperski's just options

243
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:22,959
the delay does not allege but it falls
short show you some screenshots

244
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,170
and I can be more like emotionally each
other glorious you a peach usual

245
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,180
so I'm our children %uh morton a vast
Microsoft Security Essentials cannot

246
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,170
find it without delay.

247
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:37,130
arm Kaspersky stock and Kaspersky chef
so something smarter than just just for

248
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,980
a few seconds program's execution

249
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,640
I'm not sure exactly what show then I
have another one I tried about a month

250
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,079
ago

251
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,689
on into stage with no delay and at that
time

252
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,450
everything failed even without delay
show I think what happened is not

253
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,260
has improved their product launch and by
the way occurred to me because what

254
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:59,230
Mon Ami the social conscious protesting
ish and I never checked his tool

255
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:02,490
short write-up secure in a few blocks
listing

256
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,920
just fun jewish secure not secure also
does something richest

257
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,969
I'm not by Trustmark accomplish secured
is not recognized

258
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,950
all Xikar is grunge blotch anything that
you

259
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,589
the dishes are not trust this
application it is

260
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:21,550
a not commonly used applications is the
Conway Twitty get like a

261
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:25,399
I kept specialist the Apple Store match
it was not in the Apple Store

262
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,860
it's a foreigner I will not rush so this
makes you safe

263
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,310
as long as you never did Albany softer
anything new but that you'd like a

264
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,560
pretty extreme things for people are
going on a Windows machine expect a

265
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,270
little more freedom

266
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:41,449
but of course aged blocked so I this
point I polish to challenge the

267
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,190
antivirus

268
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:45,790
people on Twitter and put it on my
website saying all right why can't you

269
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,469
block this thing this thing is remote
for Shell

270
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,830
arm calling out phoning home to be
controlled

271
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:55,150
and um nobody answered me much more

272
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:58,740
got better about a monthly so I think
some word got back to number

273
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,670
somehow did such why she arm Norton got
a little more effective in blocking

274
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:06,209
thing she was able to block the
particular 1i put up there

275
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:10,920
before you didn't immediately for the
two-round attack

276
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,429
so Michelle rounds he should be with the
delay Arjun

277
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:18,970
on this one here is one phones home
which is better than the money just

278
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,809
listening port because listening port
partially blocked by your corporate

279
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:22,490
firewall

280
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,420
phoning home University GB is better and
show you that you just

281
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,470
creator for cheesy PN PN Cali and
converted into Python compile each

282
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,720
then you have to listening shell machine
to be the controller

283
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,990
and Martin kept financial occur in the
Delete you

284
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,160
pressure the kitchen Kaspersky can still
find it

285
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,460
show on at this point I got

286
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,600
happy which much are someone hatch

287
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,050
Krish Dahl at shipping for each

288
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,580
has lashed line now last line is one
which mention corporate anti-malware

289
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,260
protection

290
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,040
she arm the only 2i know of our Fire
Island National I know probably only

291
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,200
these things like that your hundred
thousand dollars a year and the school

292
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,090
snatch things off with your network and
checking back to their servers running

293
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,100
in a virtual machine decide if it's good
or bad

294
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,830
before letting it go through which
pretty bloody awesome on although I

295
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:18,510
really think about these all firearms
she she doesn't actually block it

296
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,670
just let you know it was bad later
because they can't we'll on

297
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,920
but with this is the only product ever
seen actually figures

298
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,270
what is correctly Metasploit executed
identify cover shell

299
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,940
these guys actually can do well I should
they were all who which is not a sturdy

300
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,350
popular Jewish

301
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:37,149
that doesn't seem like a national too
much on

302
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:41,100
fire I I kick any action can you guys a
fire I would like to Chesham

303
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,279
an hour that would be caution they want
I asked mister

304
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:47,720
ocean leadership Mitchell you for
testing is your free sample ish there

305
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:53,730
they got nothin Creek show on China
cannot say why would fire ish

306
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,500
but decided let's try to attack on the
keylock well

307
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,799
I'm chewing team ready keylogger I just
googled

308
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,940
code four years old somebody wrote I
thank you order long ago shisha what

309
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,350
happens

310
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,918
if I just a clash and I just nation

311
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:14,399
a huge mansions push to keystrokes to

332
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:23,860
about that

333
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,649
I've got here's the People's Champ is
one goes to my shirt I'll do

334
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:31,939
okay Iran Evil 6 a.m.

335
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:38,450
on this machine I got the closest

336
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:45,450
church maybe which

337
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:53,320
right area there

338
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:58,139
cash this check it out okay pesticide it
was fine

339
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,190
okay that reassuring a dash

340
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:08,510
Kaspersky tries to church discussed
firstly did not check

341
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,690
would change Tom

342
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,900
make her feel more tension I think
please try another one here

343
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:19,940
arm me another machine up your wrist
antivirus astrid

344
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,700
be aggression national large

345
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,270
I'm highly doubt the Kaspersky

346
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,860
really protected certainly didn't do it
earlier today when I gestured

347
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,969
I think what's going on its management
virtual siege at a time my keystrokes

348
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:40,260
are getting a little my mouse movements
are not getting proper response

349
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:46,100
boy there's glorious Martin running and
Microsoft Security Essentials

350
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:50,159
also running telling you everything is
fine show

351
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:57,160
there's my evals okay

352
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,570
there now on I run it okay show you
fresh

353
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,020
enter when you shake some stuff call
where one

354
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,190
Norton don't care

355
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,220
the fresh ever again

356
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,980
annotation up on the Internet and shows
you in a brush

357
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,040
show that's a keylogger thats about the
worst thing that could possibly happen

358
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,240
Norton doesn't care Microsoft Security
Essentials doesn't care

359
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,880
and I've tested everything I could think
nothing from Carol

360
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,160
nah I'm now James Bond and so are you
here's f-secure doesn't care

361
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,360
here's the people he orders chili stuff
future tell you everything is fine

362
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,449
I tried Kaspersky nod32 every moment
thing that came to mind

363
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:41,750
on and nothing does anything about this

364
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:46,250
so you know my %ah I'm kind of a rigid

365
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,500
the antivirus industry seems to me I
imagine they were locked door

366
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,250
with the guard and what I think they are
like 34 halt all

367
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,800
wall she please don't go on the arch
touch above the argument

368
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,970
if you just go to a jewel and click
create exploit

369
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,770
default mode they'll stop that but if
you go even one each of the map

370
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:07,800
you're like me who no clue what could
this we're building by: the computer

371
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,169
the Python cool a catch-all listing
shell I can't watch keystrokes flying

372
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:13,030
off to pitch in

373
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,790
no he was in place so I'm hoping for
better

374
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:20,389
and therefore I'm here chaining them
thinking much about now

375
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:24,710
me check my time home all

376
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:28,370
watch good March show

377
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:33,060
I can try to pick on more people feel
kinda bad about picking on four th

378
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:36,639
cussed forty is cool I've been be a far
more classes or college

379
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,660
and was the all generation firewalls
people blocking things by

380
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,910
port numbers and stuff and some other
students turned rebel should you know

381
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:44,210
this is garbage

382
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:47,330
Palo Alto this is Charlie Arctic yeah I
know

383
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,460
kinda stinks but I can get my hands on
any stuff

384
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,370
she started complaining and finally 14
came through in a chippy 30 fireball

385
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:59,879
each 300 bucks each you guys rock
gunship trading that we're gonna teach

386
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,130
people forget farrell's now Palo Alto

387
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,330
has been changed to give us some stuff
supposedly I'm still signing

388
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,889
legal contractor damage

389
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,230
apparently knuckles measures really
gonna help lol to 140

390
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:13,560
modern firewalls people can work on
that's much better Joe

391
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,100
the first for the firewall koresh was to
try to break

392
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,129
which a mature is exactly what they had
mine but um

393
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:24,330
this is ipv6 firewall and let me show

394
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:28,840
arm are strictly sure that not like most

395
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:33,100
firewall products these days you dislike
which enabled but it is not

396
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,659
arm is not in the gully

397
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:40,050
you have to do it indium am

398
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:43,399

host machine here on the ok biatch

402
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,470
and I have to disconnect from wireless
network

403
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:02,090
which can be a little bit clumsy because

404
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:06,020
the resolutions launched catchy

405
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:10,500
listing have to coach average

406
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,200
debt thank you and display ish and I
have to teach

407
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,290
down to something better for a moment
back in 15 seconds

408
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:21,430
but in 15 seconds I can usually turn off
to work

409
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,490
March now we can research

410
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:30,260

411
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:37,260

00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:05,000
called launch 64 think after the puter
fisheries Chu

468
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,380
to Russian looking out should be one
runner ever charged per second

469
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:15,889
I ever touching 355 shop I go back to
the forty cage

470
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:20,209
do this diagnosis it's now all
configured Address Changer

471
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:23,730
355 which is what should show that's
fine

472
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:27,330
as far as you go which but if I'm
another window here and Jenna flood

473
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:31,720
which is flawed

474
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,450
router to shake sheesh used to

475
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:38,400
a church I go back to hear

476
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:43,290
freshwater nothing happens if I go to
the

477
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:48,659
consoles here and click on Start nothing
happened she each

478
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,950
frozen if I try to refresh it nothing
happens and watch even more fun is if I

479
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,830
P gage

480
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:59,850
its debt

481
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:03,689
candyman chirpy anymore because that
flood

482
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:08,520
and this is show much suboptimal I can
kill the firewall the firewall supposed

483
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,680
to be protecting you from things like
ipv6 plunge

484
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,890
and I would say it's not doing should we
stop the flood

485
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:19,860
ima watch you stank Cup should control
she that stops the flood

486
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,760
now the ER status the interface changed
a little bitch

487
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,010
after twenty or thirty seconds will
recover

488
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:30,500
least as my previous church

489
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:35,220
well that's kinda boring much critical

490
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:39,080
the other panels richer over here she's
like the freshest

491
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,560
Knox not available and this one chick
course chose Chu

492
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:48,020
across China March I think it will
eventually recover

493
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:52,780
all arm in parity is just eventually
cover millions to

494
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:56,070
tell you what's happening here this is
probably not a fair church

495
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:59,149
because why would anybody tried onward
rush honor

496
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:03,290
fireball buddy notch what'll ever she
fire will change in

497
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:06,960
yeah

498
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,430
well well now you have a good point
there especially the world like a virgin

499
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,040
change

500
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,379
but this seems to me like something you
would not do by accident which injury

501
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,310
gotcha Covered

502
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:19,700
meet you by religious page arch back

503
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,550
my glorious forty get his back and if I
look over here for the performance sheep

504
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,180
usual old memories alright

505
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:28,740
and our show is back however it's not
really back

506
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,060
it just looks good because if you take a
look here

507
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,360
and detached ish and trying to shove the
shop

508
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,719
teachers she what's happened it was
diagnosis doctor

509
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,840
diagnosed ipv6 address change

510
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,459
sheesh ipv6 address change

511
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:49,320
relish to take a while

512
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,030
show now that is what

513
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:57,350
I asked to do right I should listen to
router advertisements auto configure

514
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:00,419
but I'm just resolve the attack

515
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,630
you know most operating systems to
washing up about this Microsoft finally

516
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,940
wised up after about three years being
humiliated

517
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,470
arm many versions when actual washed up
the day we'll ignore 'em after but first

518
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,330
had rushed

519
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:16,030
my company real pads are there any
network anywhere but

520
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,470
the 48 just has that many and other
things fun is the writing team

521
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:22,760
on this is what many modern version
elections job on English attack because

522
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,580
the running to catch the end result
Lynch

523
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:28,139
she ipv6 routing she was diagnosed ipv6
route

524
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:33,590
wish

525
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,970
okay bash is similarly

526
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:39,970
essentially infringe and I think I
actually exported this to an Excel

527
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:40,690
spreadsheet

528
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:43,980
it had something ridiculous like twelve
thousand or seventeen thousand entries

529
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,559
now

530
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,770
show on which is pretty much what just
next

531
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:51,190
shoe actual documents attack German
Polish videos about such

532
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,410
because the routing table just goes
limit so all the FortiGate

533
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:58,140
appears to be alive again in ensuring
pangs it has in fact

534
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,750
taken essentially causing permanent
damage by filling up large quantities

535
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,660
which

536
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,230
memory with you she was garbage and the
only way

537
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:09,300
that I found to get to fix that is to
reboot

538
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:13,169
although you might possibly be able to
turn off the ipv6 or configuration but

539
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,240
I'm gonna rebuild rich

540
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,280
and anyway like a 60 I'm YouTube video
dish

541
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:22,129
passionate secretly FortiGate she uses
you guys give me hope our feast of

542
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:25,240
apaches possible disclosure huge shy

543
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,910
Sasha I can be chance to fix it and I'm
a shell learned a lesson

544
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:33,090
used video splash pages to Microsoft
instructions

545
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:37,500
screenshots code that was always to time
within 12 hours they could be produced

546
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,700
videos really work people watch your
video on the computer exploits other

547
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,179
cheap within 12 hours

548
00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:46,990
reproduced exploit they should chronic
for putting out new firmware

549
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:50,250
and about two weeks ago I said you know
the security conjure coming I'm

550
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,570
true like to talk about this constantly
videos hidden forever

551
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:56,909
are you going to have a net and a pic
pretty soon and I got nothin

552
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:01,380
sugar and orange show I hope they don't
said the guy jiggle my farrell's back

553
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,580
but they've been pretty cool about it so
far so on and we show you

554
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:10,250
the arm the other one so this was unfair
attack

555
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:14,668
to be dish it decisions you turn on that
automatic configuration

556
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:19,080
and that is a pretty sure thing to do
any show would be more appropriate

557
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,449
suggestion under this condition

558
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:27,449
on a ship my firewall come back up yet
hedge

559
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,009
harsh

560
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:36,470
shown

561
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:43,469
ago time anybody any questions Osher

562
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:47,480
a cheesy if you want to get that stuff

563
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,070
it is change clashed on the info shush

564
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:55,240
evil DXG which put if you're a texan
right now I'm

00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:58,350
church the shamash clash

in full jewish evil the achieve highly
encourage everybody please download the

567
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,550
stuff and run it and see what happens

568
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,630
arm if you find

569
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,640
anything that stops dish please let me
know

570
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,640
as far as I'm aware there's nothin
should have a hundred thousand dollars

571
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,259
will stop this ultra super powerful
attack and um

572
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,290
the short code is about twenty like a
python

573
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:27,290
mostly being last yard story your ha

574
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,770
yet yeah

575
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:40,410
ya

576
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:43,660
it will be interesting I know 40k also
supposedly

577
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:48,589
stop now we're but they're impartial and
I don't think they have any respect

578
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:52,009
yup the usual actually

579
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:56,099
pick up the stage Tom well maybe the
column well

580
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:59,890
see how bad their tax return

581
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:03,299
that that around our views to the sea
like

582
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,710
fireballs back sheesh if I get the

583
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:11,210
to screen here to refresh for me all
good

584
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:17,060
art show you what happens when you turn
off that surely

585
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,529
address on the configuration here's my
sheep you down my memories down that's

586
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:20,940
good

587
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:26,010
she going here you cash again and I got
taken some commands again

588
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:30,800
Richard there which moved to the bottom
if I could find

589
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,109
good arch

590
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:41,109
configure system integration sheik okay
convict

591
00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:46,990
which

592
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:47,870
ipv6

593
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:52,100
sheesh shit each all just

594
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:56,420
way any intelligent person word so now
is not

595
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,710
or configure IP address sure if I do
diagnosed

596
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:03,890
and which there was diagnosed

597
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:07,040
ipv6 address change okay died sheesh

598
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,670
ipv6 trash wish

599
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:15,250
okay should now it has and Russia
remember should be four

600
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:19,250
but no more there and now if I hit with
the flood

601
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,660
it is not gonna how to configure any
trash therefore

602
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:26,720
should be fine you would think sure if I
go here

603
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,529
and I should flood again I go back to
the four th

604
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:34,720
let's look at the page actually page

605
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,759
Marshall inch so it's a lot better than
before it's not just chilling thing did

606
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,510
much if you go here and look

607
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,830
at your CPU 200 percentage show

608
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:50,930
that's not exactly good now this by the
way is what Microsoft calls patch

609
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:55,009
now arm Microsoft almost every version
like shocked when does

610
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:59,380
Vista and later died the blue screen of
death when confronted with this attack

611
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:05,390
and Microsoft Word on ipv6 readiness
update November I think 2013 maybe 2012

612
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,799
and their patch

613
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,550
would get should ish now extended the
blue screen of death just push the sheep

614
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,320
you two hundred percent during the
attack

615
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,920
but when you stop the attack recovers
which I have to admit is better

616
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,520
the nothing arm stop the attack your

617
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,310
and I'll swatched any will in fact
recovery chichi

618
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:28,600
immediately went back down to 0
Solutions basically strictures Mike shop

619
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,100
product

620
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,470
but I sure don't think this is fiction
the firewall be and

621
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:36,790
we had another firewall around we have a
shock and SonicWALL actually has

622
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:40,250
option in the GUI to ignore router
advertised each

623
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:44,250
not just not follow configured but
straight up ignore them and when you

624
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,490
check that box

625
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,790
it just doesn't noticed looks like it's
not even happening

626
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:51,800
which is one of the teachers show that's
what I ship

627
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,140
84 videos church

628
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,390
22 conditions with your configuration
turned on of course the SonicWALL spurge

629
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:01,879
but if you preach if you don't your
router advertisements to Sonic was

630
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,880
burned about like this

631
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,220
but if you ignore them the SonicWALL
doesn't care chose to wait and efficient

632
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:06,618
manner

633
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:10,380
and just fine and I said 248 you guys
need to put in that box

634
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,400
have some options just throw them away
and they said they're gonna but they

635
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,920
haven't done it yet as far as I can tell

636
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,510
home arch selection like abuse

637
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:22,880
four th mom are very nice to give your
stuff but they do need to pass their

638
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,630
stuff so this doesn't happen all the
time

639
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:29,269
arm arch and there may be a new firmware

640
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:32,229
up by now they didn't tell me the
problem is I could not figure out how to

641
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,730
download back up the firmware

642
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:36,750

657
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:40,650
she this the most common mistake my
shoes do on projects usually skip step

658
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:41,180
one

659
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,680
which is like usual actually tried
windows in a rush to general

666
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:08,380
pushing further Nash

667
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:12,049
just one

668
00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:15,599
desman

669

she which kinda but I P six genetic and
he said

671
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:30,439
what about fished shit stuff what are
you talking about this 24

672
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,349
usually have ingested schiphol study

673
00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:37,650
were testing because Microsoft as cash
Windows XP

674
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:41,799
against this tape Ashley 7 sure 2012
churches 8

675
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:44,869
obviously a cash distribution didn't try

676
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:48,059
which he wouldn't shut up alright
finished all the budget

677
00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:52,059
national average watched right should
find will try to shut you up in

678
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:55,980
as you can imagine that's not what
happened so

679
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:00,099
are I'll

680
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:03,230
this is actually question america tak

681
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:06,650
II thickest this is having to restart
because

682
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:09,910
by Jan restarted after last night active
list

683
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:13,609
my just to come up here this is actually
pretty bad I noticed something which are

684
00:42:13,609 --> 00:42:15,000
my angel chelcie anecdotally

685
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,279
I've been making a lot of fresh sheets
to test DNA Marshawn make sure nothing

686
00:42:18,279 --> 00:42:21,539
else right jewelry store brand new
windows 7 sure to pack 1

687
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,269
it dentures 137 up each huge tall

688
00:42:25,269 --> 00:42:28,368
a fist church back want to change 79

689
00:42:28,369 --> 00:42:31,490
each and it's like four years old show

690
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:36,149
apparently this is not the only patched
Microsoft did not bother to get benched

691
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:41,480
and you know item of anybody honors as
you used to be on people use US Army

692
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,519
up to Windows 8 koresh but um the

693
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:49,589
anyway the check to clear the support
right XP which it and apply for this is

694
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:50,190
a big deal

695
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:54,170
if this change not reach into place it
seems to me that is reasonable for

696
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:56,079
people to expect Microsoft patch

697
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,240
but anyway that's not what happens

698
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,410
so arm use my Cornish mister

699

about sure that's the problem arch now

721
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:45,100
range hopefully that will enable

722
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:49,980
I know about

723
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:54,520
deserted carrier now Chawla configuring
4567 addresses

724
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,380
its hearing the ipv6 package which is
what I want she

725
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,800
should now I go here nation that flood
East sure

726
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,800
and now what you got

727
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,520
you gotta get machine national team go
in there start button does nothing

728
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,190
arm you can't do a bloody thing

729
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:17,720
I meant to start cash manager but if I
had you just see the task manager just

730
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,509
even distinguished absolutely dead and

731
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,830
even more fun much chili attack that was
maybe

732
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:28,410
15 chechans and edged

733
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:33,240
but which great comeback I may or may
not jive have the patience to wait for

734
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:33,819
sheer

735
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:37,100
if you can get a little bit action

736
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:41,040
if you right click Cash Warren County
maybe twenty or thirty year old benchley

737
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,790
ensure you can open task manager

738
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:46,970
show you sheep use a hundred percent and
it will stay at a hundred percent

739
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:50,129
forever I waited sixteen-hour

740
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:53,619
first time in four hours the next time
it never comes back

741
00:45:53,619 --> 00:45:56,770
and you can unplug the cable show your
face is gone

742
00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:00,970
and just regions forever the only thing
you can do is pull the plug out you

743
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:03,230
can't do normal shutdown you get your
body thing

744
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:07,480
um just really extremely effective you
know so here I am

745
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,590
the point which transfer decal Microsoft
patched all

746
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:14,859
huge show the kinda need to patch pissed
at you or the need to tell us that this

747
00:46:14,859 --> 00:46:21,859
is no longer support

748
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:29,070
11 2008 01

749
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:31,810
ha Jin try 2008 r1 I

750
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:35,860
maybe it is also been shipped I tried in
our Chu I know the IP shredding shopping

751
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:36,700
is there for larger

752
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:40,319
but you're right I i think I did it
right on 2008

753
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,450
didn't kill to nurture yes

754
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:47,850
each it does make such at Porsche noting
shooting on

755
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:51,569
try adding a patch from 2008 into best
customers once occasion

756
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:54,840
you really spoke to do mike is a
pro-choice use Apache on the verge

757
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:58,650
that's not always chain I haven't
creation of track

758
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:05,230
but John anyway she's like Microsoft
tell us what to do occasionally solution

759
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:05,550
best

760
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:08,790
or just admit you don't care if an
investor one the others when I would

761
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:09,310
like to see

762
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:12,770
check out the video shown ash um are

763
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:16,380
check my time I think I stock up on it
I'm

764
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,610
good 1351 after show you a couple more
things okay shock

765
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:22,810
they don't make too much is known about
this is 2010 show you know there's no

766
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:23,430
real issues

767
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:27,160
partial disclosure there so you see
Shane occurs last one largely

768
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:31,430
I got in my head about you're gonna
start fining security problems college

769
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:36,000
with Jeremy authorization I can't run
own skin or anything but I still felt

770
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,540
like I could go put apostrophe

771
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:40,950
into your LG ago she injection lame
stuff like that

772
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:44,890
and I used torched find him just like
the script kiddies

773
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:48,109
and I found the China college open
sequel injections

774

808
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:33,920
no but in a trust

809
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,350
the usual which anyway on our show

810
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:41,150
there their creation for this disaster
this already happened americorp a

811
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:42,200
community college

812
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,220
they got infected didn't do anything
about it the

813
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:48,799
Nord all the warnings network team
saying look you are running a compromise

814
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,570
sure for importing student data and
everything else

815
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:55,780
you can't just pretend it doesn't matter
and after a couple years they've really

816
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:56,690
got hacked again

817
00:49:56,690 --> 00:50:00,890
and this is the future UC Santa Cruz I
guess I'll be your gibberish

818
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:04,560
line comes up usually no idea nobody
told us you anything

819
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,570
so that's the way it was cursed after
nine to 10 months into anything we're

820
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:11,050
still running on a compromise Shurmur
this is not good

821
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:14,330
that's what their security staff told
them and nobody care so

822
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:18,029
anyway if you want to be the stuff just
a shame plaster info

823
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:21,210
the evil advanced GPT tools there

824
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:24,370
and Tigers hands-on project tell you how
to do a list of

825
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:28,890
show off and the slides anything else
you want I think that shit the questions

826
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:29,140
by

827
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:36,130
its

828
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,460
I don't know

829
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:45,310
yep you'll II yeah

830
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:50,040
he the most

831
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:53,759
these are detected by recognizing them
at all the only way to check

832
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,950
stem is by a very the only did

833
00:50:56,950 --> 00:51:00,759
just by notching the dared not and old
familiar file

834
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,820
used running microsoft word or something
that would have secured does

835
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:08,160
I'm not quite sure the other ones too
but thought the delay

836
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:13,170
gestures of the heuristic scanning show
apparently that is a feature of Norton

837
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:13,620
which

838
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:16,720
are back god's little body tables knows
about

839
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:22,180
the chum Norton checks for sure
unconscious patient behavior but only

840
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,259
refers to scheck

841
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:28,990
and after that nor the church and
apparently so much less secure because

842
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:29,450
the

843
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:32,560
final product evil download I can't
fight any

844

whatcha all the usual anyway got a large

875
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:34,350
while I dredge huge

876
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:38,000

885
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:09,730
like the timestamp is we call their
forcefully funny

886

lecture doesn't stop this one for some

887
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:13,450
reason

888

901
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:06,550
