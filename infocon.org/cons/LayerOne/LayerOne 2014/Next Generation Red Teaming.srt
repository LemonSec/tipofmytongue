1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,040
mission red teaming by

2
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:14,629
such you guys hear me right said okay

3
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:16,110
from

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:21,050
its alright can you guys hear me OK

5
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:25,200
in the back I hope might run out to
Slusher

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,470
so I as was said my name is Robert Wood

7
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,210
on going to be talking to you guys about
Sydney kinda

8
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,309
not necessarily I anything
groundbreaking here but I you know

9
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:42,459
just expanding on what a lot of existing
industry approaches to

10
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,370
red teaming is I'm so I am the practice
tractor its original for %uh

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,349
are Ready Mix us services I've done all
sorts

12
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,350
you know crazy security assessment stuff
like I'm sure many people in this room

13
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:55,770
have

14
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,430
of have done at work done any everything
from you know

15
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,219
Nintendo Wii U two Xboxes to mobile
devices to

16
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:06,289
web app stubbed up you know

17
00:01:06,289 --> 00:01:10,039
breaking the bank so I could stuff so
that is me

18
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:14,950
our agenda for today are going to be
talking about you know kinda basis what

19
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,850
is red teaming job you know how it's
perceived in the industry how

20
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,080
of now I look at it and not you know how
I would urge everyone to look at it

21
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,298
I you know we can have course

22
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,200
chat about that if I if anyone has any
questions

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,500
drop the talk just operator and arm

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,860
I interrupt me we will talk about point
I'm risk

25
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:44,560
reliance on why that's a bad thing in a
lot occurring up an autocrine approaches

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,670
the elements are building a successful
red team whether you're bringing in

27
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,030
somebody to do it or you're building on
yourself if you're

28
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,490
working in a large organization arm
bring software into the mix

29
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,908
we'll talk about why that's important
and we'll talk about the concept of

30
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:00,399
continuous redeeming

31
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,050
what it is why bother that kinda stuff
so

32
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:10,590
%uh getting started Iowa is red teaming
really so it's essentially

33
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,440
as opposed to I know a traditional
penetration test which you never in

34
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,140
smell your accreditation testing

35
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,070
of we're gonna look at a you know a
target wet weather it's

36
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,090
web application whether it's a mobile
device whether it's

37
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:28,040
%ah you know some kinda network and were
essentially gonna take that target we're

38
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,019
gonna tend to identify every kinda

39
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,230
problem everybody every flaw I

40
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,480
every kind a boner believe that we can
relative to that target

41
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,980
writing on the flip side is a goal based
testing process

42
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,410
job you know were at work were
essentially emulating

43
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:49,140
an adversarial role world adversary jobs

44
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,119
ideally we want to be more min
organizational assessment as opposed to

45
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,920
targeting that

46
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,170
that one specific thing be at the you
know the game console the mobile device

47
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:58,980
whatever it is

48
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:04,840
arm moving past that will we're gonna be
identifying how an organization response

49
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,010
to a simulated attack so obviously

50
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,250
were simulating what should be a real
world attack but you know of course

51
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:10,850
we're

52
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,510
were controlling and very I haley Sweet

53
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,018
we think it's predictable manner dear
organizations like a fine is so

54
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:18,700
predictable

55
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,190
arm were also going to bring in a lot of
different elements of an organization

56
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,390
in today into the testing pictures so
how their employees fit in the

57
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,910
organization how their network supports
different business processes

58
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,160
of various software that their releasing
themselves and/or

59
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,959
are supporting critical critical
portions of their business

60
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:41,370
and also you know physical facilities
all that good stuff

61
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,220
arm and you know ultimately to

62
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,459
to essentially sum up what writing
really is

63
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:52,250
we're going to evaluate how an adversary
will actually attack

64
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,269
any given goal arm so an adversary
doesn't really care about finding

65
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:00,610
across a scripting on you know some

66
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,760
on some website day care about using
that cross site scripting

67
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,560
or whatever vulnerability it is to
accomplish some goal

68
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,320
whether it's get access to customer data
whether it's you know cause a denial

69
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,010
service condition

70
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,039
whether it's me or whatever their
colours

71
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,820
odd very daycare by using the
vulnerability to achieve some goal

72
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,460
so this graphic I hope you guys can see
it okay

73
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,440
kinda job its it's a little bit jumbled

74
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,790
apologize for that but essentially I I

75
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,360
urges think about a red team assessment
is sitting on top any given

76
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,800
up any given testing activity so we
think I've any the silos on the bottom

77
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,200
here

78
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,630
as a basic testing activities so we have

79
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:49,180
we have some web application stuff we've
got network stuff you've got physical

80
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,410
of physical facility testing social
engineering testing

81
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,230
and the list goes on essentially go far
very basic

82
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,710
typeof assessment to a very advanced
type assessment in that specific target

83
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,180
and any the silos might represent a
penetration test

84
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,450
on you know her security assessment
going from you know

85
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,020
maybe a vulnerability scanner an audit
all the way up to a full-blown

86
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,580
a penetration test a red team
assessments arm

87
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,640
is gonna build on that essentially sit
on top of all these

88
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,010
all these different service elements and
depending on where you're at

89
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,590
relative to your goal arms are stepping
through an attack path we may pole in

90
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,080
different

91
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,289
different testing activities to
accomplish that goal

92
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:35,080
so anyone who's ever seen

93
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,969
a job you know you do talker in our
conference presentation are writing is

94
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,570
probably seen this very basic band
diagram

95
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:46,750
the electronic social physical %uh Ben
diagram

96
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:51,740
elements of a red team on the Riccati
more issues kinda splash on there

97
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,360
because I'd

98
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,970
I urge everyone to kinda think beyond I
just doing

99
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:59,470
electronic social physical penetration
testing

100
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,610
because really if we if we just look at
that stuff all we're doing is is just

101
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,820
doing a multi-faceted penetration test

102
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,190
arm so just just a step there really
quickly

103
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,050
job an electronic is anything anything
in the technical

104
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,160
I'll technical space so we've got
software whether its web applications

105
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,280
are thick clients

106
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,869
or Web Services on you've got network
infrastructure you've got

107
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:29,470
wireless networks at physical facilities
mobile stuff social

108
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,979
is anyway did employees interact with an
hour organization so you've got

109
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:37,849
arm you know attackers going after
employees to using fishing techniques

110
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:42,169
I calling them up trying to get them to
reset password or provide sensitive

111
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:43,080
information

112
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,729
%uh interacting with them there some
kinda I amor chat feature

113
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:50,359
are men and then of course all the
stupid stuff that people put on social

114
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:50,810
media

115
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,680
I'll sure we've all seen that's physical

116
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,069
the physical domain is anything
involving a physical facility where an

117
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:01,440
organization is located

118
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,599
so you've got access control
technologies

119
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,990
elected the RFID badges you've got
business

120
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,870
business processes that facility how an
employee or vendor

121
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,960
or you know visitor might get access to
the to

122
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,080
facility you know what if I what if I
work for

123
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,389
acne banking ash I'm an employee and I
shop and i forgot my badge at home that

124
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:24,969
day how do I get into work to

125
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:28,509
you know how do I get into work for the
day or do they turn me away and tell me

126
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:28,800
to

127
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,430
either go home and get it or you sick
day arm

128
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,539
and you've also got you know considering
how

129
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:40,610
%uh you know guards were kinda at a
certain facility excuse me

130
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,699
are they outsourced are they you know
willing and able to use force if

131
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:45,719
necessary Dec

132
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:50,979
%ah in all things that an attacker or
security consultants gonna think about

133
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:55,520
on so the other activities
reconnaissance is kinda the glue that

134
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,000
holds an entire red team

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,120
are together so it's important in any
pain test arm

136
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,319
getting into a ready-made becomes way
more important

137
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:08,029
are essentially with with Bri lab
adversary emulation you've got attackers

138
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:12,630
constantly kinda profiling your your
organization you know studying you

139
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,710
learning about you monitoring changes
things like that so

140
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,508
you know if we wanna effectively emulate
them we have to we have to do about

141
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:23,479
whatever connaissance ourselves and
there's lotta good tools and frameworks

142
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:24,310
in

143
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,550
odd stuff out there to to facilitate
that

144
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,340
are essentially just information to get
you started

145
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,600
job business process analysis so

146
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,370
this is really arm looking at at various
processes that support

147
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,419
an organization whether it's you know
how do they do

148
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:46,569
how to the issue her on board new
employees how do they do

149
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:51,660
employ your password passer return
employee or customer password resets

150
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,810
are their technical are there strictly
technical

151
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:58,459
processes for doing this or can you
involve a lot like a customer service

152
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:58,980
rep

153
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,350
arm looking at

154
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,450
of threat intelligence and threat
modeling so this is where

155
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:10,420
if we're emulating a very specific
threat be it a criminal organization or

156
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,469
you know one of the hacktivist group arm
or

157
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,770
rival rival competitor herb rival
company something like that

158
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:21,120
are we want to look at what other
capabilities whether water their

159
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,250
objectives what kinda visibility do they
have into

160
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,620
into the organization and then we can
count 'em use all those

161
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,870
antecedent conditions to predict attacks

162
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,060
%uh we won also be able to use

163
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,670
red teaming or you know really any
penetration testing but specifically red

164
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,089
teaming

165
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,410
given its its broad scope as a way to
evaluate

166
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,719
incident response capabilities about
organizations and not just a texan

167
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,000
but also how they actually respond to an
attack once they

168
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,290
one said Donna identify armrest
management is knots

169
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:59,189
indeed traditional sense that you might
think about risk management so really

170
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,200
this is using how an organization

171
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,570
risk ranks different components and
organization

172
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,640
and using it against themselves soul
walkthrough

173
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,660
of waterson area later on in the talk

174
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,900
where where we did just that and
Broadway social engineering

175
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,800
is odd you know something I'd I'm other
big advocate of minutes essentially

176
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,040
arm social engineering in the sense that
we're not going to go after joe shmoe

177
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,319
or you know marry an HR we're gonna
essentially go after a brawl

178
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,180
so this ties back into the business
processes so we're gonna social engineer

179
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,839
a CSR supporting password resets

180
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,560
for instance are so essentially when
we're looking at that password reset

181
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,619
process we're gonna

182
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,710
app that out workflow and we're going to
identify

183
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:48,600
you know weakness either we controls are
missing controls

184
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,450
that all essentially mean any employees
or any human sitting in that spot the

185
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,250
CSR

186
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,730
may be susceptible social engineering
attacks so

187
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,779
putting this all together and do you
know

188
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:06,800
a composite attack job a walk you guys
throughout a little scenario where we

189
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,829
I we're working for a defense contractor
palm

190
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:14,470
a few years back ants essentially

191
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:19,220
%uh you know we it was a full-blown
organizational assessment were emulating

192
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,960
either a terrorist group or arm or
criminal organization that would have

193
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,540
gone to the extent of

194
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,550
you know physical physical access
facilities us official

195
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,870
ya you know technical capabilities

196
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,550
arm you know the list goes on the
capabilities

197
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:40,029
resources that we are available to us
are that we're supposed to be emulating

198
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:43,580
aren't so we we started off as as you
might imagine

199
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,200
doing all the external operator level
stuff you know

200
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,520
trying to get in throughout the network
weed is a basic fishing

201
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,360
arm everyone's pretty well aware so we
didn't spend too much time on

202
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,150
I perimeter stuff in a fishing always

203
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:04,040
you know reveal some access but we wanna
go farther than akers fishing is only so

204
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,670
much fun

205
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:08,160
arm so we showed up we did a few
physical

206
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,120
while you know what what we disagree
Khan on the on their headquarters

207
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,580
switches up in San Francisco and Dom you
know look at it looked at a few offices

208
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,450
that they had spread throughout the city

209
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,490
and %uh we decided on 1 %uh

210
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:26,010
one bruise that we that we really liked
which is where the FedEx stuff comes

211
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:26,620
into play

212
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,640
are so we essentially got one of those
big

213
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,770
Pelican cases is about as tall as a
stable

214
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,639
maybe

215
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,310
about his about as deep as well

216
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,329
and I'm we have one of our one of our
small

217
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:46,199
smaller ploy ease arm getting there we
got all dressed up with

218
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,029
you know employee uniforms that we had
%ah had one of our guys in

219
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:53,990
really care about you know brands and
stuff and copyrights

220
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:57,100
made up so we stuck in the box

221
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,190
we wait and I should've worn it but I
need to get a tailored

222
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,260
I we went out and got fed ex sure it's

223
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,310
and we got you know buncha magnets and
stuff for amman custom critical

224
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,810
FedEx division put him on a bunch of
bands showed up for their hand-held

225
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:12,800
units all the stuff

226
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,410
we're a little FedEx delivery app on so
we show up

227
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,350
and just walk into the the defense
contractors

228
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,769
front doors and they're like oh okay you
know custom critical we've never ever

229
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,740
received anything from custom critical

230
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,180
hi I'm a red flag mom so

231
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,810
that would have an indication number one
I we also did not have any kind of

232
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:33,250
desert

233
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,250
designated recipient that would have
been red flag number two

234
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:41,920
however on they thought it was so cool
that they're getting this massive

235
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,709
delivery %ah we said you know it was our
instructions that you're gonna get

236
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:49,869
a percipient %uh you know the recipients

237
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,470
is gonna come tomorrow you'll have keys
to this

238
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,750
to the locks the dummy lock center on
the front of this thing

239
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,410
on then you should be all good to go
city you know they got all excited they

240
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:02,339
will impasse all their security

241
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:06,670
brought it into a storage closet which
ironically was right next to all the

242
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,060
their

243
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,339
executive offices so our employees
weights like 30 minutes

244
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:14,750
and we've we drop it off right at the
end of the day so ever left

245
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,930
I really saw the executives left he pops
out

246
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:22,489
gets out a storage closet and nope none
in the executive officers were locked

247
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,380
because they had

248
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:27,319
you know kinda but the the actual
approach to

249
00:14:27,319 --> 00:14:31,279
to security so that the hard parameter
soft gooey inside so

250
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,040
arm so once we were inside the facility
you can

251
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,019
Rowntree arm and that this was this was
all a case in their headquarters which

252
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:40,610
of course

253
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:45,320
you know there's no network segmentation
across offices so didn't really matter

254
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,120
on so he pops in each in the executive
offices

255
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,560
uploaded a bunch of the pomp logs arm
under each

256
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,760
each executive's desk and us we had a
team out in the parking lots

257
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,300
I'll who were you know we started doing

258
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,229
network testing with this access on
didn't have any kinda controls that

259
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,210
prevent us from getting shells on and so
forth

260
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,880
so we did some scanning din reliever
reveal anything

261
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,040
Chu useful on but we found one
application that that appear to be home

262
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,060
grown because it just

263
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,250
it looks like it was from the 1990s and
job

264
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:21,380
so you know we start looking at it and
it

265
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,290
there are some messaging on the front
page indicated that it was used for all

266
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,370
their operational command control

267
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:32,330
on so centrally this company handles
kinda battlefield analytics

268
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,640
and so the they deploy

269
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,110
operational engineers are they embed
them into military units

270
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:44,870
and throughout the world and she
obviously they don't want these people's

271
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,320
identities known all

272
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,830
you know the they can to keep that stuff
under wraps but it was all a bit was

273
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:50,660
manager here

274
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,910
arm so you know this this

275
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,390
appear to be our our new high-value
target arm

276
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:01,850
so you know naturally the first thing
that we try on the login page was

277
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:02,390
innocent

278
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,970
sequel injection and when you know it
like the basic

279
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,350
Arctic or one equals one on the password
got us access to

280
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:14,340
to an account arm so with that access
were able to get

281
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,510
%ah we're able to get covert operation
on ploy data

282
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,330
on actually had some source code stuff
in bed in there that we can

283
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:26,930
that we could see allow mom there's all
sorts of stuff store in this app so

284
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,640
you know just an example of tying all in
this together and of course they didn't

285
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,560
have any kind

286
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,300
%uh they did not have any kind of
monitoring

287
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,800
controls within the facility or on their
network

288
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,250
other internal network rather that would
that allowed them to detect are

289
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,080
the written the attacks that we're doing
or respond to them arm

290
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,870
so f course you know creating this
boxing getting the Fed Ex uniforms all

291
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,870
that talk about

292
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,980
two weeks time arm and that was you know
with us working on other stuff

293
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,079
often you know dealing with other
clients as well so it's not like

294
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,760
this was anything that a very
sophisticated group that would go after

295
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,260
this

296
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,569
defense contractor I wouldn't be able to
do so

297
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:13,639
arm and you know just just kinda follow
up with that with the

298
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,130
the incident response assessments arm

299
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,189
essential you always want to be able to
work with om wanna work with your client

300
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,809
sponsor

301
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:25,010
on whether it's you know a high-level
executive that

302
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,610
that knows about the the initiative
ready min issue going on

303
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:32,559
you don't want to work directly with the
the incident response teams

304
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,190
or the IDS you know application
monitoring teams the log monitoring

305
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:36,740
teams

306
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,040
on your sensually evaluating their their
affect us

307
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,389
us you don't want to tip them off the
you're about to you don't wash some big

308
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,740
attack you gonna just click scan on on a
scan tool on just let it go because

309
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,260
all that all the crabs easy to identify
arm

310
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,270
you know i i Durand you always want to
because a lot of this happens in

311
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:56,910
production

312
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,630
I just kinda cover yourself and also to
tie back into their

313
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,990
their detection capabilities you always
on a log all your you know your source

314
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,669
and target

315
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:08,140
data what kinda test you're doing at the
time

316
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,340
arm you know how things responded just

317
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,510
kinda take notes you can do and I saw a
spreadsheet format

318
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,309
whatever that you know whatever tickles
your fancy job but

319
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:21,660
catalog how things are responding to the
attack you know

320
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,970
if you poke something how to respond arm

321
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:31,290
and of course the same dip yes

322
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,389
job so head

323
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,370
yes so are you know all typically

324
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:40,129
I'll typically you know record all my
like from running everything through a

325
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,640
proxy I'll save all that on daily basis
and

326
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,510
and submit on this is more for %ah you
like when you're doing

327
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:51,330
I like looking at its like something a
business logic or something

328
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,340
that might not be readily apparent
through just proxy logs

329
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,919
arm be at the more day to you can but
you can gather in S&M provided the and

330
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,820
the assessment to cross-reference the
better

331
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,189
job so the

332
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,810
shorthand is really really comes in
handy for physical security testing as

333
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,190
I'm sure you can imagine because

334
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:15,640
you know there's no proxy for that job
and also once you're in

335
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,820
so once you're on the internal network
there once you

336
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,500
obtain access to some kinda sensitive
assets and you're here

337
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,150
you know trying to get Italian up
because ultimately getting in

338
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,860
and getting access to the asset is only
half the battle a lot you know

339
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,870
attackers need to be able to get that
stuff out did actual tree agency wanna

340
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:38,719
not you know analyze exultation controls
whether they had some kinda

341
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,430
you know watermarking or anything like
that that might

342
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:47,980
trip you up so the existing industry
approach

343
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:52,620
job this is sadly what it looks like it
a lot of cases

344
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,520
job so if you go I'll ands %ah you know
you're looking at its

345
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,650
you do talks anything like that a lot of
it breaks down to

346
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:04,140
up you know MSF update create some kinda

347
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,420
arm loaded up PDF for something combined
that win

348
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,700
a phishing attack and maybe you show up
on site and

349
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,659
and Sheena drop some USB's in the
parking lot and that's about it

350
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:20,269
arm you know and and else the ready for
poor and say we pop some shells

351
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:23,460
you know we're awesome and then Nelson

352
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:30,460
the other finance guy send you an
invoice oh he just walked right out

353
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,200
he was when he was wearing the so the
question was how did our 100 are

354
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,090
little guy was the Wii stuff in the box
get out of the office because he was

355
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,158
wearing the

356
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,799
employees uniform is actually just a
jacket of that was

357
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,070
in their case essentially as good as a
badge once you're in so

358
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,100
arm so he is a village walk out the
front door and

359
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,610
and meet us at the pizza place in we
celebrated

360
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:01,840
arm so can anyone tell me what is

361
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,549
what is wrong with this approach job you
know just at first glance what would you

362
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:10,129
me know what pops out at you is you know
what comes up short

363
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:13,210
it is very sad

364
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,080
a very short-sighted so

365
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,830
essentially beyond their a lot of
attacks today take place the application

366
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,699
layer so

367
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,779
you know if you think about if you think
about software and how we use software

368
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:27,260
and

369
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,870
in today's world you've got all the the
Internet of Things you've got mobile

370
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,299
app's you've got all this

371
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:35,629
you know like if your tests if you're
still my phone

372
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:38,690
job please donot understand my phone

373
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,179
but if you were to steal my phone and
you were to get access to you know any

374
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:44,330
number about the password and stuff that

375
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:48,199
that may be cashed her you know whatever
the all the zaps do

376
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,370
on there's a lotta census stuff that
gets control

377
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:57,209
been handled by by saw for nowadays so
you know it's are banking information

378
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:00,539
on you know you've got sequel queries
can add you know

379
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:04,029
going into databases fetching data
display it back to us all this

380
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:09,590
all this crazy stuff arm and ultimately
relying on very quick win techniques

381
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,860
like popping a shell

382
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,110
on some random employees box or you know

383
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:19,059
getting getting one low-hanging fruit
password from an employee in a phishing

384
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:19,639
attack

385
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:23,570
that stuff doesn't really tell us much
about the overall security posture

386
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,600
an organization says you've got a fifty
thousand employees company

387
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,110
and you know I'm able to get marry an
hr's password but I can't do anything

388
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,520
with it

389
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,740
then it's not that useful from attackers
perspective

390
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:39,390
arm and ultimately that approach also
doesn't really tell us how an

391
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,070
organization

392
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:43,250
sponsor attack so you know in doing the
sayings its

393
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:48,290
it's definitely an ego boost to to get
in and and do some cool things in

394
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:51,440
%uh you know proved that we can steal
much tougher

395
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,390
you know break into a bank whatever it's
cool it's fun are but ultimately we're

396
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,410
doing it to help

397
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:00,760
make organizations more secure whether
you're doing internally making yourself

398
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,990
more secure proving a point whatever

399
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,520
on you want to be able to improve after
you know after the fact so

400
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,760
are and party that of course is in the
in the incident response

401
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,390
and also we have no understanding with

402
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,520
with just looking at the network and
social layers we have no understanding

403
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,530
of how an application portfolio fits
together

404
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:26,820
comment again I'll get to that with the
with the risk management area later

405
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,560
so you know I wall I won't read this to
you but this would essentially be

406
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,980
an example Ave a reliance on point I'm
risk

407
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,020
%ah scenario that might be used in a arm

408
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,200
generating Assessment so this is like
the

409
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,270
the traditional approach for a lot of
firms unfortunately

410
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:50,050
so setting up a successful red team

411
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:53,370
arm so I mentioned earlier the threat
modeling

412
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:57,860
so always consider the threat model and
the threat actors when you're doing

413
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,290
these kinds of assessments

414
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:03,480
so we do in a lotta cases with
penetration test but I would urge you to

415
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:03,970
take it

416
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:07,830
a step further and so when you're when
you're scoping out these Converse

417
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,080
aspin's you don't you don't want to just
be thrashing around looking for problems

418
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,389
because then we'd

419
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:16,070
we shifted to the world just you know
basic penetration testing

420
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:19,139
we want to essentially star with the

421
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:22,780
the assumption that we're going to
emulate a very specific adversary

422
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,910
you know again the criminal organization
the rival

423
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:31,090
the rival company something like that
and then we consider what that objective

424
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,000
are what that actors objectives are

425
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,330
you know whether it's us steel I P

426
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:40,178
other its you know steal con up
confidential customer data

427
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:43,510
source code whatever the case may be arm

428
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:46,620
we also them we went there one a map
that too

429
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:52,080
that specific tractors capabilities and
then we wanna Matt for the map that too

430
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,720
actual risks that we identify throughout
the course in the Writing Assessment

431
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,340
so you know having all that stuff laid
out matrix

432
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:03,539
allows us to essentially have a little
bit a traceability

433
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:07,658
to identify you know very high
likelihood attack pass that have a very

434
00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:09,320
high likelihood of occurrence

435
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,178
so you know an attacker wants to do this
they can do this

436
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:17,029
and all these things have you know we've
identified all these things that could

437
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:17,799
go wrong

438
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:21,190
and are wrong with your organization so

439
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:25,419
given all those things this is very
likely to happen that's essentially the

440
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:26,260
idea behind it

441
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,600
%uh you also always want to consider
business goals interests when doing

442
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
these kinds of things

443
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,320
so this is a really good scoping
activity hot to handle

444
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,990
right up front so are you know what is
the business hoping to accomplish

445
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:43,409
up from this what are their overarching
business goals

446
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:47,049
you know maybe it's provide a secure
platform for a

447
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:50,139
you know people the login play games or

448
00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:54,649
a you know provide the US government
with the most

449
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:58,299
you know cutting-edge researcher you
know what I'm the cases

450
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:01,990
and then you wanna you wanna create
risks that that

451
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:05,130
directly impact those goals arm

452
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,690
moving in moving beyond that you always
want to consider the bigger picture for

453
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:11,370
any restore involve so

454
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:15,620
this is this is more or less a long
lines identifying security-related seem

455
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,840
so if I'm

456
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,120
if identified repeated instances love

457
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,489
let's say a sequel injection to run an
organization

458
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:27,019
arm yunus trying to try to think about
what's

459
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:31,659
I will first what the impact %uh any
given successful exploitation of the

460
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:32,929
sequel injection as

461
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:36,850
how that affects the organization as a
whole and not just that one application

462
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:37,158
that

463
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:42,269
that you're targeting but them water I
what are the possibilities for what is

464
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:43,419
the possibility that

465
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:44,669
sequel injection

466
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:48,759
or you know Lacombe input validation or
escaping

467
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:51,779
or any other controls exist throughout
the organization

468
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:54,789
arm so look for these themes

469
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:58,039
and see if you know if you identify
couple love

470
00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:01,429
a couple of issues if you can
extrapolate that and say this is

471
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:04,909
this appears to be an issue across your
entire organization

472
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:08,649
because a lot of a lot of these bigger
organizations with

473
00:27:08,649 --> 00:27:11,918
you know five thousand applications %uh
you know

474
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,129
you can't you can have a very broad a
broad sweeping impact

475
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:19,908
when you find find these kinds of things
so

476
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:23,639
I'll we are ready kinda touched on this
a little bit with the

477
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:26,709
the attack surface in at right now so I
won't

478
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:30,789
I will not real down into this

479
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:34,359
and months

480
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:39,259
we also can't do that sweet does anyone
have any questions up to this point

481
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:45,480
test

482
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,210
so upbringing software and a picture so

483
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,279
s you know like I like I mentioned
before software

484
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,690
is you know everything happening at the
application layer is

485
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:00,590
is really what's handling a lot of the
sensitive stuff that we that we have

486
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,820
are going on both those consumers and
enterprises

487
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:08,668
on so whether it's equal where easy to
page content that's a spider page

488
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:12,129
stuff on our mobile app's and its
software not only

489
00:28:12,129 --> 00:28:16,178
you know at very high levels and enough
for me ap sir web sites or anything like

490
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:17,169
that but

491
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:20,779
drawing down into into the operating
systems up

492
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:24,169
you know all the way down the stack on

493
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:27,809
application portfolios in a large
organization may range from

494
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:30,820
you know anywhere from one to 10 using
some of the cell

495
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:35,399
off-the-shelf software or can range up
to several thousand applications so

496
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:39,859
%ah you know I've worked with a few a
few large multinational banks that have

497
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:43,408
like for five thousand applications just

498
00:28:43,409 --> 00:28:47,399
it's ridiculous how much stuff they have
going on and they have no idea how to

499
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:48,080
actually

500
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,509
you know manage knowledge is kinda just
is

501
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:53,820
a vicious exists in the world

502
00:28:53,820 --> 00:29:00,820
hands dips so

503
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:04,690
big question was we have issues with
scope creep on we have

504
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,850
my work with organizations at the size
with you know several thousand

505
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:08,580
applications

506
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,699
are not really so essentially

507
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,179
job in doing this you don't necessarily
need to test every little thing

508
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:19,830
arm so that's really where we benefit
from you know

509
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:23,119
missing missing out on the scope creep
Rob if we

510
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,099
if we did have to test every little
thing it could be an absolute nightmare

511
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:26,939
intake

512
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,269
years job sad to say but

513
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:33,729
essentially with the with the Gold Room
process

514
00:29:33,729 --> 00:29:37,149
actually wall getting dead like to slide

515
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:40,219
a nice little scenario involving just a
bank

516
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,960
are such a bank where we're able to use

517
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,840
several key applications to get to our
goal kinda neglect all the

518
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,119
all the noise bomb and the last bullet
on here

519
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:55,139
you know scanning the network with the
traditional approach is not going to

520
00:29:55,139 --> 00:29:56,469
give you the complete picture

521
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:00,269
on and on the flip side scanning just
not are you know testing just the

522
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:02,679
application where does not give you a
complete picture

523
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:06,349
we really want to test that complete
stack then we want to test the employees

524
00:30:06,349 --> 00:30:07,479
a support that stuff

525
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:10,619
the facilities as employees said in job

526
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:14,619
your business process they support it's
really about testing you know that whole

527
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:17,949
holistic picture so

528
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:20,999
the risk management portion of it so

529
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:25,499
the high-risk and low-risk applications
so

530
00:30:25,499 --> 00:30:29,109
a lot of times and not in these large
organizations you have assets whether

531
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:29,809
they're

532
00:30:29,809 --> 00:30:33,690
are session cookies or credentials or

533
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:37,049
%uh you know whatever the case may be
some kinda some kinda processor

534
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:38,729
functionality that shared

535
00:30:38,729 --> 00:30:42,940
arm you have these things that are
shared across multiple applications

536
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,549
so you know WWW dot actually bank dot
com

537
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:50,690
may have the same exact credentials as
marketing acne bank dot com

538
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:55,479
up for whatever reason precious how you
know a lot of these organizations

539
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:57,020
architect themselves

540
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,830
arm sub-domains in a lotta cases provide
a very very good

541
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:04,090
avenue for phishing attacks and in
particular re

542
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:08,449
page rewriting phishing attacks I am and
also

543
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:11,550
odd in across a poor customer support
roles can also

544
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:15,110
come in very handy in these guys
assessments but essentially

545
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:18,879
in going after going after risk
management

546
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,690
%ah risk management approach is
essentially what we're doing here

547
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:26,950
is taking taking away that's an
organization risk ranks there

548
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:31,660
their application so in the in the acne
banks in area we've got www to acne bank

549
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,430
dot com

550
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:36,220
may be there their flagship ap that's
where they put all their time their

551
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,540
money their efforts and securing and and
having all their

552
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:44,730
defenses whereas the marketing site or
the promotion site for instance I think

553
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,460
it was actually promotions that we

554
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:50,580
that we use in this particular attack
they may not provide any kind of

555
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:55,949
defenses or money or resources towards
defending their promotion site %uh

556
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:59,380
but it's on the same exact %uh top-level
domain its

557
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:02,950
you know handles the same kinda bad
assets and

558
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:07,590
descent this next composite attack
scenarios essentially takes advantage of

559
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,270
just that

560
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:13,350
mom so what we had here was a red team
for another hour

561
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:17,350
it was a it was a very large
multinational bank and we had a

562
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:20,919
low-risk applications promotions to Acme
bank dot com

563
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,580
the head never got your any kind of
testing arms essentially this

564
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,810
organization took

565
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:29,550
they broke their applications down into
high medium low risk aP's

566
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:33,370
and depending on where they where they
got categorized

567
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:37,060
that kinda that kinda drove how much
testing

568
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:40,790
you know so if they were high high-risk
ap they had to go through several stages

569
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,350
static analysis

570
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,939
at a pen test and make sure any high and
medium

571
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,940
%uh issues were immediately prior to
noon

572
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,710
push to production and I was very kind
of you know

573
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:57,400
hands-on detailed process to get an app
into production

574
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,420
a medium a medium risk capital little
lower

575
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,490
and a lower risk Apple is essentially
people can just write whatever they

576
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,590
wanted to publish in

577
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:08,510
job and unfortunately that a lot of
these things that

578
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:12,740
fell into low-risk category job so this
promotions

579
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,600
this promotion site did end up falling
on the sub main a very high profile

580
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,310
application their flagship

581
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:23,139
ap we did a lot of week we did look at
the high risk at pretty

582
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,130
pretty in depth we found some things
wrong with that but nothing kinda

583
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,720
glaring jumped out at us

584
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,770
arm so the approach that we took are we

585
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:35,100
you know this was that this was a full
scope application heard

586
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,719
full scope red team we didn't even have
to do any physical testing because we

587
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,080
just

588
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,980
you know we just need to in this case
are so what we did was

589
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,890
mom you know prep for social engineering
attack we found a whole bunch

590
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:53,090
employees names %uh took advantage their
mail servers that affect the wearable

591
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:53,909
send

592
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:57,100
send mail from their mail servers and
invalidate anything

593
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,280
um so we put together a phishing attack

594
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,530
thats taking advantage of a cross-site
scripting

595
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:06,950
a flaw in this promotion site and we

596
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:11,168
created this bonus program so you know

597
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:14,600
wat process site we're rolling out a

598
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,790
you know I'd very kinda

599
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,960
for stage bonus program %ah

600
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,050
you lucky employees have been selected
to participate in it

601
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:28,890
%uh come to our link Angeles actually
get all the details and have a chance on

602
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:29,469
roll

603
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:33,699
where y'all have you know she has earned
a in a 10 percent quarterly bonus or

604
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:34,408
something like that

605
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:38,379
arm so in the in the mail with that we
sent from

606
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:42,049
from their mail server so in all their
validation there was

607
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:46,200
you know it bypass all ish spam filters
all that stuff came from an admin

608
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:50,658
%uh admin at acting back dot com email
address

609
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:54,040
a redirected them to our promotion site

610
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,620
I exploited the cross site scripting and
of course

611
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,950
%uh love their session cookies and
whatnot for not using

612
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:04,689
you know any the issue to be on the
flags are all spoke to the parent domain

613
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:08,130
all the stuff that you know would
normally be ranked is probably a low or

614
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,070
medium risk in

615
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:14,020
you know very targeted assessment and if
these same things were flagged on

616
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,420
you know assessment

617
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:19,329
just promotions would probably have
never ever ever been fixed

618
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:23,510
our you know nobody would be cared about
it obviously because things have room to

619
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,609
sit in first place but

620
00:35:24,609 --> 00:35:28,190
mom so the cross site scripting payload

621
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:31,230
posts all that stuff to our servers

622
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:34,890
and then rewrites the page and displays
them with know kinda

623
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:39,200
some info about our bonus program and a
place for them to give us their domain

624
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:39,970
credentials

625
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:44,308
so we catch a lot of people's domain
credentials we

626
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:48,630
got project for 45 on on a said or say a
little over five hundred

627
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:52,040
arm 500 domain creds and

628
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,220
subsequent session cookies and its

629
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:58,839
arm we attempted to then get on to the
VPN

630
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:03,180
these so the VPN for all employees was
guarded by multi-factor authentication

631
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,540
so we kind of hit a dead end with that

632
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,770
%uh through some other rekon we found an
admin

633
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:13,200
bpm which which did not %uh for some
reason

634
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,290
enforce ma multi-factor authentication

635
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:19,730
so %uh fortunately summer the
credentials that we

636
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:24,220
that we end up collecting were odd you
know did fall into the admin category:

637
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:28,709
so we were able to get access to the
admin network of 37 BP on with those

638
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,480
credentials

639
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,520
once we have that level of access we
found that there is a bunch

640
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,680
internal laps also on that that same
top-level active bank dot

641
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,069
dot-com domain essentially were able to
use the session cookies

642
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:45,599
to bypass internal multi-factor
authentication

643
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,250
portals Ange you know get access to

644
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:53,520
all these internal money trading
customer support

645
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,280
%uh typeof applications and we found the
world you know transfer money where able

646
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,250
to modify customer records

647
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:04,430
do all this crazy stuff up you know on
their internal network

648
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:08,730
just just as a matter of you know
attacking this low-risk application

649
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:12,740
and using at to caterpillar way through
through this organization

650
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:18,729
so is can have a bad day for them but
you know they learned a lot so that's

651
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,680
good

652
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,990
mom oh and of course throughout the
entire thing they had 0

653
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:28,060
again 0 detection mechanisms and

654
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:32,290
figure I job because of course when we
are attempting to get access to the

655
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:32,660
admin

656
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:38,770
BB and we had no idea who is actually at
Mintz so we went through maybe like like

657
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:41,980
eighty loggins before we found a in
admin

658
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:46,369
VPN and you know of course nobody shut
us down anything like that

659
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:50,720
so I

660
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,919
the concept of continuous retaining
something that

661
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,750
you know really interests me and %ah
essentially building on the idea

662
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:02,730
from in all the continuous network
scanning

663
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,960
you know like 10 guys like tenable are
offering the continuous application

664
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,960
scanning

665
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,859
people like Perricone white hair an HP
on a Mandar offering

666
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:15,390
bomb so it's essentially bringing in the
holistic

667
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:19,560
the holistic testing process that that
is red teaming

668
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,960
I lease from Remo perspective and
combining that with the continuous

669
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,960
testing processes that all these
different services

670
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,369
vendors offer and it's not something
that is even close to being bill

671
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:36,420
as of right now we're still are trying
to wrap our heads around it jobs as one

672
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,010
introduce it to all you guys in case any
of you guys

673
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:44,550
I like a that is an awesome idea I think
I can build that way faster and you just

674
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:47,500
go do it because personally I think
there'll be a lot of value

675
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,850
and having something like this available
to people

676
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:54,509
and I personally would love to have it
open sourced on

677
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:59,210
but essentially are continuous are
continuously monitoring how an

678
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:00,100
organization

679
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:03,839
you know the kind oppressed that goes
out to an organization so all the

680
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:07,970
all the elements open source
reconnaissance suppress the drives

681
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,730
attention from a hacker on changes in
network devices

682
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:15,980
you know do incorporating all at the the
network scanning so we can identify

683
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:19,060
you know all passions

684
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:23,970
you know missing updates changing
configuration sets things like that mom

685
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:27,890
doing this we can evaluate risks as they
as they come out over time

686
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:32,270
us a weekend you know in a production
environment we can detect changes and

687
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,000
risks

688
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,480
new vulnerabilities %ah much closer to
real time as opposed to waiting for a

689
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,380
pre-scheduled pen test to occur

690
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:43,740
on you know said device so essentially
if we open this up on an entire

691
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,660
organization

692
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:48,600
and just have something turning through
an engine just churning through

693
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:52,610
we can identify things you know network
network related issues

694
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:57,380
open source related issues you know
people spouting off on social media

695
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:02,580
or application related issues relative
to some new application functionality is

696
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,230
pushed out

697
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:06,770
closer to real time yep

698
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:13,770
on ours

699
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:29,618
so so

700
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:33,770
party letter arm and partook partook
former so it's not

701
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:37,079
it's not so much different from up from
the

702
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:40,369
existing approaches that are out there
with regards to the application and

703
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:41,140
network layer

704
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:44,828
%uh scanning perchance so essentially
what

705
00:40:44,829 --> 00:40:50,049
%ah what division is is combining those
two things as well as the reconnaissance

706
00:40:50,049 --> 00:40:53,259
that way we get the holistic holistic
perspective

707
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,400
so really what we what we end up with
right now is

708
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,030
you know some ops percent or you know
some gonna consult

709
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:03,849
running are just networks or you have
like Wallace

710
00:41:03,849 --> 00:41:07,250
doing continuous monitoring and all that
stuff goes into one bucket

711
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,339
that you know may be one person
organization gets to

712
00:41:10,339 --> 00:41:14,828
its then you have another team or
consult appliance doing application

713
00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:16,589
where stuff that causes another bucket

714
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:20,240
and only you know a few people have
access to that and you don't get to play

715
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,879
any this into the bigger picture

716
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,130
because you know a lot of times he's big
organizations to stop talk

717
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:30,049
you know network people don't talk to
software people saw for people like

718
00:41:30,049 --> 00:41:33,930
the hell you network people we're not
talking to you are not showing our

719
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:34,700
results to do

720
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,118
so you know these these

721
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:41,789
this lack of communication and then you
combine that with the

722
00:41:41,789 --> 00:41:45,059
you know the open-source issues the
reconnaissance based issues

723
00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:48,859
arm we just don't get to see the bigger
picture so it's really all about seeing

724
00:41:48,859 --> 00:41:49,819
the bigger picture

725
00:41:49,819 --> 00:41:53,589
from all perspectives as the is the idea
behind

726
00:41:53,589 --> 00:41:59,670
yep

727
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:00,000
you know

728
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,350
operations he seems

729
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:07,360
show up in your mom working on it so

730
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,850
mom see the idea was arm to have

731
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:15,080
have a continuous scanning engine so you
know scanning is a is a good part about

732
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,850
but of course that's all automated

733
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:20,470
and then also you know leverage that
with something you know normalize all

734
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:21,129
the data

735
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:24,880
and created you know create some kind of
framework that weekend

736
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,090
you know dashboard create all that

737
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:31,720
job her push all the information and a
dash borders in a summary tables

738
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:35,230
and then on top of that give by give
consultants are

739
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:40,030
you know a red team for incense a a
platform for collaborating and

740
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:43,660
you know kinda consuming those results
and if they see something that's you

741
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,350
know string that's worth talking on

742
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:49,339
are give them an avenue to you know like
a call strike kinda by collaborative

743
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,400
testing environment

744
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,850
so bring that one-two punch this

745
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:58,299
his hope you join cost I've

746
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:01,740
from oil he our symbols

747
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:05,819
I'm so the thing

748
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,160
so we've considered I

749
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:12,879
you know of course like I said this is
this is so far beyond you know anything

750
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,190
it's that even ready to be monetized her

751
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:19,570
our bill or ready to ready for low are
much more less an idea

752
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:23,070
on but we were thinking abouts up like a

753
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:26,220
back a one-time costs one at one time
but %ah

754
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,379
ever occurring subscription model so
sensual you open up your entire

755
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:31,080
organization to

756
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,740
this and you you paid bimonthly basis
and you just get

757
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:39,540
you know reports on results and stuff

758
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:43,490
kinda populating your dashboards you
know you continue to pay

759
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:47,020
pay by the month in you just continue if
i text

760
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:51,660
%uh but we haven't really solve the
problem itself

761
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:55,629
I don't know I am that is the idea that
so

762
00:43:55,630 --> 00:43:58,970
%uh you know as actually %ah leading
range this

763
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:03,169
arm you know obviously the application
on the network stuff can be

764
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:06,920
look very largely automated there there
is automation

765
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:10,090
engines behind both these things that
exist right now

766
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:13,100
arm and very expensive appliances om

767
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,920
so you know really the idea is

768
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,990
combining the network stuff the
application stuff

769
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:24,149
and that building out just a little bit
more and that feeling then to some other

770
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:26,810
kind of collaborative testing
environment on

771
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:29,810
and rolling back on the one arm for a

772
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:34,290
true continuous %ah ever serious
violation because really

773
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:39,310
the idea behind you know getting away
from the point I'm risk reliance

774
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:44,100
side the whole you know why bother catch
phrase is you know an adversary is not

775
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:44,960
just going to

776
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,920
attack you you know next week you know
next Monday

777
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,180
at noon and then whatever's wrong at
noon next Monday that's all they're

778
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,379
gonna care about and their

779
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:57,520
they're never gonna look at it again
until you know maybe next year when you

780
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,590
next saw to comes up

781
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:02,380
they're going to be looking at you you
know all the time if they if they

782
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:06,260
really are you know the true advanced
persistent threat typeof adversary

783
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:09,300
they're gonna be looking at you you know
next Monday

784
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,750
next tuesday next Wednesday they're
gonna be looking at you over time and

785
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:13,180
they're gonna

786
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:17,049
tussle you trying to find at least past
are that path of least resistance and

787
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,000
your organization

788
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,590
on so it's essentially trying to push
the envelope getting into that true

789
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:27,860
continuous adversary emulation and it
looks like

790
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:30,930
I rifled through these little faster
than I normally do so

791
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:34,350
job if anyone has any other questions

792
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:40,200

and I got cocky ants now we're

803
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:17,430

804
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:21,060
some training videos and all that we
want to use footage from the

805
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:25,380
from the actual test and on several
occasions that we've got Andy

806
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,480
on previous occasions we had

807
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,800
and of course equipment failures has my
boss is cheap and buy cheap stuff

808
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,310
job so on this is that my

809

my oil company by the way so ob shows up
in

810
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:43,110
someplace in your some remote place in
New York and job

811
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:46,720
so the third time I got in

equipment weird issues but cams

813

course called security which

821
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:22,570

state troopers and so

822

some testing at their more

833
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:03,250
strictly controlled engineering
facilities and of course those were not

834
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,730
as easy to get into

835
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:07,910
