1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,050
some other languages in the application
contest

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,220
so if you're playing here's a hint

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,760
500 points particular individual

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,299
the programming language is named after
disease

5
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:17,180
and when and when you read the source
code you'll

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:20,820
agree there's a there's a

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,260
challenging won a contest that I'm
giving him four so that every aspect

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:24,920
axis

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,910
for access to set him named after
disease

10
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:34,300
the programming language involved good
luck so

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,180
besides that we have for superior for
the next %ah called your hip a certified

12
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,200
are you have a compliant and Bob just
killed someone

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,610
I am its now

14
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,250
that's objective-c actually is

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,770
the disease and there's actually a joke
about that

16
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,110
in natural inge but I am

17
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:04,110
are handed over to bar seven again big
round of applause hi

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:13,280
so she once

19
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,530
I curse hand charm that offend anyone
here but if I do fuck you

20
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,680
miserly now I I'm not bob

21
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,399
so if you are law enforcement you
probably should leave now

22
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:29,909
arm some you might have seen pieces in
this

23
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,399
I I might have done this talk about

24
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:36,220
I was six months ago there's been some
more research and we'll talk about the

25
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:36,700
research

26
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,979
according to lawyers Camberley present
on it

27
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:46,280
but all get turn so home I am NOT the
jewish a

28
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,679
arm run a podcast all grumpy sack I'm
jaded security on Twitter

29
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:56,289
doing this program fifteen years om
aside pen testing one on the telcos are

30
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:56,940
doing its

31
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,670
some you guys who think you're illegal
cuz run display and consider saucepan

32
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,310
testers

33
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,960
we didn't happen despite back to just
yup drying out there

34
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,810
obviously don't care I'm so disclaimer

35
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,000
narrows soft airy none this

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,590
as ever happen nobody's been pop
nobody's died

37
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,720
nobody's still may be sending their pH I
just someone else

38
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,910
arm yellow could get into and

39
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,680
a salon it strips I don't know why

40
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,750
like I really didn't feel like going out
and looking for images

41
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,680
besides respect copyright laws some
summers some regards

42
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,019
I'll fuck you the G

43
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:42,780
some cool

44
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,060
so my friend bob was diagnosed with
cancer in 2012

45
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,230
not dying nobody gives a shit don't cry

46
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,298
don't feel sorry never Bob had a biopsy
sohn ecologist Scott

47
00:02:55,299 --> 00:03:00,450
PET scan and %ah star treatment bob's
lifeline him to get a second opinion

48
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,798
at in other facility rate so in order
for bob to get his medical records that

49
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:09,769
he pays for rate he had to jump to rush

50
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:15,980
hopes to get the stuff done so problem
with that is stare

51
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,170
really wasn't a formal process at this
place like he signed a buncha forms and

52
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,018
nobody could figure out where these
forms Collins faxing them in

53
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:28,109
yes faxes starting in 2013 while this
was in 2013

54
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:34,540
he faxed Omni doing any responses are
some conversations with lawyers and d/a

55
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:40,620
so so we're gonna going to some
theoretical somehow Bobcats

56
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,799
taking his own stuff home because so you
guys all remember the healthcare dugout

57
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,930
fiasco right its

58
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,229
said that that robots that taxes still
up it's been like what nine months

59
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:56,769
fucking ridiculous at school

60
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,190
bay yet they don't have to be have a
combined apparently so

61
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,489
just going to wonder tests

62
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:06,579
still fucking up like I I just don't get
it like

63
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,590
these are the guys that want enforce
regulations i

64
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,359
Micah fuck it Dave Kennedy can ride that
thang I'll

65
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:17,030
so help us have this weird happened
doesn't actually

66
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:21,159
see you have to implement the controls
daunting have a really says is that you

67
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,610
have to do a risk assessed

68
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,660
hum who here works in health care

69
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,710
risk assessment sir easy ray yet just

70
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,590
a whole fucking checkbox ship that you
don't really have to do anything just

71
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,780
like we looked at it

72
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,229
this fucking awesome I'm sure this is
legal

73
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:44,760
whatever fuck after I'll say yes so I

74
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,479
the secure a 150 essentially say that
you have to

75
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,349
sure that the whole CSS people should
CIHI this fall

76
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:56,600
hom administrative as a call technical
safeguards are there to cover for

77
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,419
companies

78
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:01,359
covered and he's is kinda weird chill
because technically everybody's covered

79
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:01,930
any

80
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:07,740
by if you're not part of a if you don't
exchange Shah

81
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,990
if you wanna change phia over over

82
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,820
cultural Cheick form that's not back
actually for example it is your small

83
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,690
mom and pop shop

84
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:21,210
at Justins taxes you not covering most
companies are most workers are covered

85
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,030
and he's right

86
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,619
arm so health care doctors clinic
psychologist

87
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,940
mercury that you got the picture I'm
more than likely

88
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,880
your company every if you work in health
care you're covered in

89
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,449
om you will be pop

90
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:41,039
by I have never this is the well

91
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,229
so this talk is this the stock is
focused on the on

92
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:47,960
one major health care provider in the
north in the Northern California

93
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,310
however bob has visited other health
care providers

94
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,150
buzz background is about fifteen years
ago he started to hit the practice

95
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,440
consulting company like when hippo is
just you know

96
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,750
a wet dream in clinton's last night on

97
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,289
he knows have he knows health care he
knows how to get around things

98
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:13,469
so yes so essentially privacy insures
that the price the primacy your protect

99
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,760
information and social justice Eli

100
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,920
rate you never gonna get your health
records that sucks

101
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,910
om and again something you see have seen
this and you'll find the research like a

102
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,270
line

103
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,010
I do have a giveaway at the end so KS a
pay close attention

104
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,140
as giving away a Raspberry Pi

105
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:37,680
not really sure what versions I had in
my bag and I don't need it

106
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,860
it's 512 Meg I lost a bunch before

107
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:46,840
yes check with you I by arm

108
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,140
it's gonna cost you a blow job at least
whatever

109
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:56,010
okay problem solved moving up %ah

110
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,060
yes I'll something you have seen pieces
this and there's

111
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,490
some really cool researched at we might
have to turn the cameras off and we'll

112
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,000
talk about that when we get there and

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,080
at some really fun stuff I'll be a

114
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,109
so hipper requires each company for from
a risk assessment thats all you're bound

115
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,580
to do.

116
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,250
yacht have to implement shed you just
have to have a risk assessed

117
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,750
iremos controls are just small meaning
dad

118
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,980
you don't necessarily have to implement
the control that

119
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,140
would be best practice you just have to
comply controlled and auditor would be

120
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:28,830
cool with

121
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,909
who knows in order here they'll sign off
on any

122
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,520
anyone here trust with now nobody
typical

123
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,960
just say no they fuck it should object
target

124
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,570
target charge the but never

125
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,090
I say a so I can

126
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:53,030
I'm not can expect you read this but
fine print is adjustable ownership card

127
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,619
everything is adjustable the only thing
that's actually required is performed

128
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,920
the gap assessment performed

129
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,120
risk assessment writing it up and hey we
do their due diligence work or a

130
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,040
its

131
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,790
so security standards generals covered
in

132
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,350
in covered entities and business
associates must do the following: sure

133
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:19,260
this confidentiality integrity and
availability of all trying protected

134
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,219
health information

135
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,430
%uh the covered entity or business
associates creatures he's maintained a

136
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,100
transmits

137
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,729
the reason I'm reading that as you'll
see please violations in that

138
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:31,199
security standard at this one major
health care provider

139
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,529
so we all know compliance and security
ray

140
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:38,409
with the GRC you check boxes right we
all know that this is the basic minimum

141
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,189
to come to protect us from

142
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,060
legal litigation colleges right you
check the box he did your due diligence

143
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:45,250
its core a

144
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,990
charged check the box right he may just
checked the box insure good

145
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,200
some have branched off

146
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,290
and I know summer you've seen a way

147
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,180
just wait for research way logical
things

148
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:04,099
lot circle things I'll and there might
be a nap in the works is a log n

149
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,210
would look into I'm so yes a bob sitting
in the waiting room

150
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:12,190
scan idea to start planning things right

151
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,279
like you know I issue let me give me my
PH I

152
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,709
skull fucking steal it way school

153
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:21,770
mine ray my buds bob's body

154
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:27,520
he just wants to shed some say he set
some boundaries to protect himself from

155
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,060
legal complications and maybe and no law
enforcement

156
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,900

really feel like doing your shit

161
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:54,180
day yeah so any facility on the campus
is free game

162
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,270
meaning that if they might have a
pharmacy a couple blocks away that

163
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,910
nobody stare

164
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,160
connected same backbone no its cool

165
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,850
I'll make no determination

166
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,709
determination by single instance which
means that a finally saw one

167
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:14,219
problem I saw one reference doesn't
necessarily mean something happened

168
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,260
right so we're gonna

169
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,050
bring him back bobs gonna

170
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:22,849

insurance information

185
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,240
she can definitely look at what your
diagnosis is

186
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,050
arm there's a risk assessment

187
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,370
Corey so bob was a check

188
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:35,149
and bob is a dick but Bob Skinner be
dick you're somewhere else

189
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:39,510
his this just way too easy so bob was dx

190
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:44,530
for chasing USB rate we all know how

191
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,870
we all know how the surgery nose spray
by knows that this isn't hard

192
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:53,460
Tia swings school targeting her iPhone
cuz that's not hard either

193
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:58,320
so bob was upon the contest solar array
hey Winnie

194
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,420
now now pensaste

195
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,709
but an actual game page respond just
wants to fuck with them deposit asshole

196
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:12,710
I was a dick so bob's will seek and

197
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:21,250
Kors again bob's Dec so the facility
offers free WiFi for guests

198
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,680
call right wpa2 for hospital staff

199
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,920
day day buzz my FI

200
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,479
local get to what we use that for inside
so this is the only time in my life

201
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:36,990
where

202
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,550
well in bob's life where he found this
fucking thing useful at all

203
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,410
but there's really no use case for this
thing at all

204
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:49,910
but your yeah Pokemon 27 might have been
the past

205
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,800
maybe but whenever I am alone

206
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,949
by I was in the pineapples his ship it
was in the bobs Bagan

207
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:02,460
Bob decide to use it the one time and
for so

208
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,490
funny thing about SSL so other haps

209
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,840
bob was able to know bob was able to
notice that all their

210
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,060
caps that were on the wired network

211
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,859
I'll will look at that the site sorry
all the app's

212
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,940
on the wireless segment use SSL so
obviously the

213
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,610
she didn't wanna do any man the middle
not to say that he might

214
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:28,620
now I down him he might've in a couple
places but

215
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,300
you know a saucy scoring campy to

216
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:38,589
so why well bob had to which blood work
he mighta found alive rj-45 port

217
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:42,569
carbon head in there

218
00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:47,430
just in there behind that play

219
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:53,638
just in this is a live image up could
apply this laptop

220
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,939
right but then you know its kinda
obvious like in the

221
00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:02,029
dumbass receptions analyst at she might
she pry wouldn't

222
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:07,790
I'm gonna hurt too much credit if

223
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:12,730
only there was a way home use

224
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:17,869
way to put some things you know to hit
some attacks

225
00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:21,800
without being noticed so that will
anchor think it's

226
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,490
20 twenty thousand million LS sixties

227
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:30,529
apparently tell me more

228
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:34,170
so I dirt because up on gay

229
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,670
I surged in security at the time it's up
there I it's not just me on Twitter site

230
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,889
to have the image up there

231
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:42,889
on such as running Linux armed guy after
cap

232
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:48,259
yeah season 1 finale IC so yes he's
really really cause

233
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:52,089
if you plug into a wired network you'll
take the pop pop yeah see

234
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:55,439
ill go out and map the environment look
for all the IP's

235
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:59,839
look for all open ports and then just
locally index every file a confined

236
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,459
now awesome its

237
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:08,388
open source in March really it's kinda
like focus but better

238
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:11,499
much much better

239
00:15:11,499 --> 00:15:15,819
and on top of that its decentralized so
you can drop

240
00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:19,469
couple rash these haven't talk to each
other

241
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:23,529
and index to a cloud instance not that
Bob did any of this

242
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:26,839
he's not actually anything just you know

243
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:32,170
searching right so many data is the NSA
says men it is safe it's not private

244
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:39,170
yes he for to wish

245
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,480
so basically what bob did was

246
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,680
every file that indexed he you some
basic logic to just

247
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,280
not check to see if he if bob with bangs
that the day that he found this pH II

248
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,980
nothing advance just some bullshit magic
stop some parsing

249
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,930
looking for Social Security looking for
the word diagnosis looking for the word

250
00:15:58,930 --> 00:15:59,380
name

251
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,160
looking for anything that would be PI or
pH

252
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,250
rate because at this point you're
violating

253
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,630
the agreement you have in place with
your custom with your

254
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,800
users with your patience that you're
protecting your data

255
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,459
because you're not so if it found
anything it was just send the

256
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,720
one still number one because we're just
counting how many

257
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,730
record to confine my issue

258
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,790
winning make it rain baby I am

259
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,800
so bob drop flock six long

260
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,180
7 to restore this was your

261
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,180
two are still up as a like a week ago I

262
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,420
Bob might check the client's interests

263
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,689
be a tour still somehow amazingly
plugged into much

264
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,420
on fuck happened so on to wear one

265
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,650
Sabah founds found some other cool shit

266
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:59,840
so apparently all those absent were
using a sus on the wireless network

267
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,550
right use have heard network says

268
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:06,690
mold legacy consulship yeah

269
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:10,560
school me no

270
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,679
no arrests

271
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,939
so I can Bob started person did because
blobs attack rate like you

272
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:24,939
X this is in water hoc

273
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:31,110
so bob found something really stupid
like I'm hoping that none of you

274
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,459
actually have to much

275
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,670
carruthers on fuck and my shoe

276
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:42,320
baden given anything this is from alive
rj-45 port

277
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,919
that might have been in the waiting room
school right

278
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,160
nobody does this

279
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,200
whenever a

280
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,810
its cool at school whatever

281
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,050
yeah yeah it's your

282
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,790
it's from the movie hackers hackers
hackers

283
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:11,790
artist right now sure

284
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,850
sure

285
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:20,149
so I'll Bob found something else
interesting so para leer ask these new

286
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:20,959
power i

287
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,340
and those little power banks expense USB
extension cords

288
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:29,470
apparently are in use to allow my sister
be plugged in

289
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:32,950
from that lock box cuz you can lock
console

290
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,470
right you don't want anyone touching the
tower but the mouse

291
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,899
can't really plug into the tower sees
little USB extension

292
00:18:39,899 --> 00:18:46,899
that's cool so Exelis fun

293
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:58,519
so i didnt to pop in actually have to
look to their network text or anything

294
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:00,360
cuz he had access to the wireless

295
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,658
and their word right and guest wireless
see where I'm going with this

296
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:12,659
winning

297
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,890
so after five months that was five
months ago

298
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:24,500
so 11 months to restore party so it
since December there on the important

299
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:24,860
one

300
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,790
and I don't think they employed them
dust-up it was power plugged into a spy

301
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,540
broke Isner's

302
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,500
shit but yeah I do I don't have a
current number and how many records are

303
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,280
but there are only about fifty five
hundred patients at this place

304
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,740
some pretty sure I got repack Bob got
everything Bob

305
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,430
Bob whose body was in

306
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:52,130
worst bobsled and that's his last name

307
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:57,840
Bob slim so bob was on the Panthers game

dick so in order to avoid any adverse
reactions the start of chemo

353
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:17,230
really fucking slow really really slow
like he got like 10 hours just sitting

354
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:17,630
there in

355
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:22,340
thinking about what fuckin I do if the
wifi was faster

356
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,459
you know cell phones work by Kim I'm not

maybe I'll read reddit in use my OCD
powers something else

359
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:40,169
but so so what's shocking is bob Bennett

360
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,460
so bob starts looking at things

361
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:48,160
search really looking around the room
have you ever looked around the room in

362
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,830
the hospital

363
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:54,159
this whole lotta things there a key to
fuck with the oxygen gas and there's

364
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,530
things you can play

365
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:58,649
but there's a lot of things you have
access to Lake

366
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,940
and crash carts in the room late locks
and hard to pick

367
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,460
surprised right but that easy

368
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,530
its easy arm

369
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,530
so IV drips there Cherie

370
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,590
apparently there's a

371
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,129
remote consul for this fucking thing and
it uses serial teather

372
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:23,790
but it's really stupid like it's

373
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:28,320
really dumb there's no password on it at
all

374
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,620
show ob-gyn wanna join me by you people
will get into what bob can do in

375
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:40,620
your so Bob might've bought this exact
machine on e-bay

376
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:43,580
and that's where the lawyers said that
he can talk about that

377
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:48,220
bull talk about it for dead to

378
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,549
so she I just hope your

379
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:58,549
because I'm not bob llama day

380
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:04,830
just I'm I'm not that big a dick so
these are fun right Bluetooth USB

381
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,879
Aiken bugs easily drop on these on these
fucking things

382
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,299
because I was like what 10 bucks and Ali
Baba over

383
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:14,350
yeah we'll get into the act sacking

384
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:21,350
might have to turn off the cameras so
this is great

385
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,940
I'll apparently I the

386
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,970
barcode scanner doesn't Dalian port it
blue screened

387
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:34,140
for you

388
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:40,530
but Julia because you know its 2013 at
this point I guess now announced

389
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:45,190
for timber until you're not a fuck ties

390
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:49,289
to be honest I don't know what I did
with them I I really don't know if US

391
00:25:49,289 --> 00:25:50,289
can I have no idea

392
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:54,090
happen the regular party actually

393
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:58,070
is a might be a one-party it has

394
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:05,070
I'd winning

395
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:10,080
the memo

396
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,418
party K seriously

397
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:18,080
manage passwords clearly that machines
for staff use

398
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,189
so that mission was wide open for 45
minutes

399
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:26,590
forty 5 minutes

400
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:29,010

hospital with unknown sural back doors
had been dropped

406
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,189
PHP would be to would-be attackers for
taking an

407
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,670
you guys know pH eyes worth way more
than a credit card in the black market

408
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:54,970
rate

409
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:59,950
make wish more credit cards were like 30
cents display

410
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:04,980
Ukiah five dollars record release thanks

00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,400
by but the exact same model

422
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,900
on e-bay with the console software

423
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,130
an up parent me

424
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:05,250

at school we're all friends here I A

427
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:16,240
nah it's fine

428
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:22,980
as whatever its cool at school at school

429
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:26,170
that's fine norse no worse

430
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:29,850
where are we 0 some Bob got

431
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:34,699
the software all speaking which a buddy
of mine

432
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:39,600
some us know would like to would like me
to would like bob to bring this I V chip

433
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,560
So Def Con

434
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,830
so we'll talk but I guess after if you
guys on the self medicate

435
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:48,000
at school I'll but yes a side note

436
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,170
okay so bob but this trip bob spent

437
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:54,220
eighteen hundred dollars on it is what's
best

438
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,460
and whenever point being bob has
insulted

439
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,770
I am but it came with a console software

440
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:05,840
which for an probably for Windows 95 I
am

441
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,090
so from the IV drip which is

442
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:13,090
really slimmed-down BST colonel you can
establish

443
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:16,550
tell Mac connection to the machine
learning the consuls

444
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:22,510
software the machine running the consuls
software and

445
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:27,200
of my own been able to figure out how to
track it back to pH

446
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,430
means this summer the bigger hospitals
actually use them on their own thing so

447
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:35,580
they can shirt from the nursing station
see you have access to

448
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,710
whoever's hooked up to whatever IV drip

449
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:43,810
Marc Maurer

450
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:47,690
sugar-free marching our year

451
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:52,060
your could be worse I really don't think
you can dive

452
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:56,230
morphing over overdose can you okay
whenever

453
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:01,150
okay so maybe that is one way to kill
somebody combined with

454
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:06,650
combined with the remote access that you
have from the parking lot I

455
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:13,650
Bob just killed someone from the parking
lot

456
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:34,220
chic

457
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:47,070
this

458
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:04,000
so

459
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,820
Bosch training we

460
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:14,990
work on mobile you walk into a health
care provider

461
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:19,740
it'll automatically identify all open
access points

462
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,760
run yes across town sheesh see we can
get

463
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,890
along with the combination somehow sent
to see if that hospital or healthcare

464
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,390
facilities been pop before

465
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:34,210
and just pop morning if you should do
