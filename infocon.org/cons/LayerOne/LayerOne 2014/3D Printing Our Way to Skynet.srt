1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,020
um

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:09,450
so a couple things I wanna you know just
clear cut off the bat

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,200
a lot of what I'm going to be talking
about has the focus has changed a little

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,059
bit from what I had incited

5
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,640
the pamphlet I was kinda hoping to get
this dot about up and running

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,760
between now and then but you know much
like the layer one batch I'm still

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,930
working on it so

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,550
but I did bring a lot a train gets this
is kinda the

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,308
a little bit a personal reflection on 3d
printing

10
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:36,019
building is machines making parts and

11
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,809
arm just kinda where we're at as far as
this technology is concerned so

12
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:45,780
quick little show hands around the room
anybody here using 3d printers

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,800
affectively right now

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,910
I

15
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:54,000
so I love those who you with you that
just raise your hands how many have you

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,840
would see

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,609
3d printing is easy I

18
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:03,570
alright nice houses juneau guys else
know God so

19
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,310
um you hear about 3d printing the news
just about every day

20
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,460
Eagle gets a 3d-printed beach and ducted

21
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,220
3d-printed foot you know there's all
sorts of crazy stuff like that here

22
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,789
more more every single day but you never
really see these things out a lot

23
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:25,240
so there's we're starting to approach
this

24
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,899
junction in technology and its

25
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,619
just starting to materialize range from
all arise and that's what I'm trying to

26
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:33,869
show you guys here so

27
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:37,320
anyway I'll about about this blows up on
stage um

28
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,789
I'm a party 23b shop on Fullerton if you
guys know what's good for you will be

29
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,939
heading to the after party down there

30
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:48,169
shortly after the stalker shortly after
the next talk which is the last one of

31
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:48,619
the day

32
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:52,810
so yeah like I said get over 23 be
that's where the parties at tonight

33
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:57,060
um a little bit about where I'm coming
from I have

34
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,009
been almost entirely mechanical
background I was working on cars with my

35
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:01,990
dad growing up

36
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,530
and which trade school as a reason she
shops all the time so it just kinda see

37
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,140
natural

38
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,288
and was kind of an interesting side
effect

39
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:12,988
learning machine shop is turns out

40
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:17,650
CNC machinery is almost exactly
identical to 3d printers

41
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,700
so it just kinda naturally took me down
that way I

42
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,920
work for a SolidWorks reseller I do 3d
Caden tech support all day long so

43
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,958
I I am lucky enough to say I get to work
with 3d printers almost every day I have

44
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:34,909
some really fancy want my office I walk
by all day long

45
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:40,030
its it's definitely a privilege to be
able to work with

46
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,109
the scanner cutting-edge or extruding
edge technology I guess

47
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:48,650
so interesting story about how I came
into it

48
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:52,090
the five years ago are still working in
a machine shop just

49
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,739
pension buttons away on the on the lave
making part after part

50
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,010
all as thinking to myself as I can do it
there's

51
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:02,608
there's a much better way to make things
II figure this out

52
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:05,819
you know there's there's just more
efficient way to do this so

53
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,458
I'll to make a long story short I wound
up

54
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:13,579
at the Saltworks reseller who also deals
a 3d printers and I happen to be in the

55
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:14,840
right place at the right time

56
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,699
and I was just having lunch with
technical manager one day he's like a

57
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,459
Chris

58
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,910
here you guys might need a 3d printer
your hackerspace

59
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,030
my eyes cup size basketball sign yeah

60
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,199
so I ended up having drive up to San
Jose

61
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,299
traded the guy case a nice beer for it
was

62
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:37,629
a backdoor special kinda company will
treat

63
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:40,720
anyway moving along so

64
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,720
if you're not intimately familiar with
3d printers there's a couple a different

65
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,870
technologies out there

66
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,959
I'm just gonna give you a quick little
breakdown um

67
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:53,190
so what these things really do well

68
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,659
is the change the way we manufacture
parts so

69
00:03:56,659 --> 00:04:00,569
the old school way making a par you'd
start out with a

70
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:07,569
needed get a little more booze in me

71
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,170
so the old school way making parts

72
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:17,310
is you would start out with a big block
a solid material and take a cutting tool

73
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,449
and tell it connect the dots all the way
around until it cuts down into your

74
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:25,229
desired shape that's what you call
subtracted she

75
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:29,270
what 3d printers do is the kind of work
in reverse their additive the start from

76
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,820
nothing

77
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,909
and lay down the very first layer move
up a little bit and so on so forth you

78
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,680
guys probably get the idea but what this
is

79
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,430
really revolutionary about his how it
changes the way we manufacture

80
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,810
both in terms of iterative design both
in

81
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,830
terms like the entire design cycles so

82
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,800
the a typical manufacturing process
nowadays is

83
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,360
you design a pure parten 3d cat software
and send of the design to China because

84
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,080
that's where it's cheap to make these
parts

85
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,440
you know whatever plastic little
trinkets and six weeks later you get

86
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,650
your parts back from China you know nice
little injection mould

87
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:09,870
but you screwed up on the prints used
you mister dimension are missed a little

88
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,830
channel and it doesn't work so you gotta

89
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,859
start all over you know revise your
prints and it out to China and six weeks

90
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,520
later you have your brand new park so

91
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,659
you can imagine going thru even one
iteration

92
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,020
this is challenging but typically go
through a few I'm not sure how many

93
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,289
geyser in the business is actually
making parts but this is

94
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:31,469
this is a everyday struggle that us
manufacturing

95
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,979
each have to deal with all day so with
these 3d printers do

96
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,020
is first the localize manufacturing

97
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:42,190
and the rapidly increase your turn
around time so

98
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,389
I had a couple a project I was working
on around the shop the last few weeks

99
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:45,880
then

100
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,659
I'll I have some parts in Girl show you
in a little bit but I had to make a

101
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:50,690
revision to the park

102
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:55,360
and instead of having you know wat two
weeks I waited another six hours after I

103
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,190
punch some buttons and ban here's my new
partner if it's the second time around

104
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:04,550
so home it it was really kinda small
saying I just a little plastic printed

105
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,190
part but

106
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:09,210
the way it it completely takes the

107
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,219
effort or the busy work at making part
it was really quite a phenomenal thing

108
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,449
however

109
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:19,430
with these 3d printers even though the
democratize printing a little bit make

110
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,240
it easier for designers to

111
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,710
pick-up parts that you know we're

112
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,198
challenging to manufacture previously
you still have

113
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,740
a bit of a challenge as far as the time
factors concerns so

114
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,449
I'm that's why the single rapid
prototyping machines are not necessarily

115
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:38,440
rapid manufacturing machines you get a
scaling

116
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,110
a penalty that trying to analyze some
members here in a minute if you double

117
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,260
the size of a park

118
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:51,030
you square the surface area but you cube
the volume so you getting exponential

119
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:51,599
penalty

120
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,760
based on the size of your part small
small volumes pretty much quicker than

121
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,560
very large volumes and that just happens
to be a factor

122
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,470
these fused deposition modeling machines
maker bot style that layout

123
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:07,789
one-dimensional lying you know layer by
layer

124
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:10,820
now with a few different printing
technologies

125
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:15,900
you get more each tight printers that
lead down the entire sheets

126
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,049
material all at once and those actually
had a volume metric

127
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,370
increase the larger your parts are the
faster the French because they're

128
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,500
printing and tear sheets all at once
instead

129
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,639
one single dimension so

130
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,680
as far as the development background 3d
printers kinda the origin it all goes

131
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,510
back to

132
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,800
just after world war two when

133
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,590
america america was starting to become
domestic

134
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,719
manufacturing powerhouse for making
airplane parts

135
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,990
just party tank parts all sorts crazy
stuff and we decided that

136
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,240
you know is a little tiresome for
everybody's grandpa to be tracking

137
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,380
handles you making these parts all day
long

138
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,789
I'll let sodomy the stuff so raisa
computers also brought the riser

139
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:05,310
computer numerical control machine CNC
machines

140
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,940
right here it's picture day old school
of milling machine so

141
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,780
once scientists were able to figure out
how to keep your eye sees and she goes

142
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,609
oh wow this

143
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:19,060
makes much easier to manufacture complex
parts you know it's

144
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,510
it's a terrible strain on the operators
wrists to be crackin handles all day

145
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,539
long and can have them

146
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:28,090
instacare Korea so thirty years later
people

147
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,569
you know develop the idea little bit
better so that's when you see the birth

148
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,900
of 3d printing machines in the
mid-eighties

149
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,549
3d Systems actually a local company
other up in

150
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:42,270
percentage Nana Seneca readers

151
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:46,260
that area so there they're pretty much
the progenitor

152
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,110
the 3d printing technique be the you
stereo lithography machines

153
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,650
totally different types are using I'll
like cured

154
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,980
do resident kinda trippy machine anyway
so

155
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:05,030
back in the mid-eighty's 3d Systems
standardized 3d print I'll file standard

156
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:08,329
if you guys have ever worked with STL
file formats

157
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:13,180
their their really weird very basic file
type all it is is a point cloud it's

158
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:13,900
describing

159
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,630
three points in Cartesian coordinates
and a triangle drawn between them it's

160
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,350
just a point cloud with Nash's

161
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,960
so you can imagine if you import things
incorrectly you get you know

162
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,790
discontinuous measures and that's a

163
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,180
the challenge in a completely different
talks anyway just

164
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,270
keep them keep that in mind so

165
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:35,630
few years later stresses comes around
and the

166
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,430
revolutionized the fused deposition
modeling

167
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,469
technique the majority the printed parts
I have appear

168
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,790
um that's the Rep rap style

169
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,589
pritchard essentially a generic CNC
machine

170
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,530
instead of having a spinning tool on the
head it has a little plastic extruder

171
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:56,850
kind of like a computerized hot glue gun
laying down layer by layer

172
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:01,950
so 1997 stresses comes around you know
builds up the technology and only a few

173
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,940
years later

174
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,050
the repre- project starts to gain some
traction

175
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,140
and you know all it's been history since
then

176
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,720
me from the rep rep project we cover
maker botched

177
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,010
and us basically what allowed 3d
printers to and Charlize

178
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:23,270
news collective consciousness

179
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:26,680
so as far as where the industry stands
right now

180
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:32,069
kinda strange thing with maker bot be
sold the Stratus is for $400 million

181
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,290
dollars of stock and options I don't
think urs cash last year

182
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:40,079
but was straight assist their the
800-pound gorilla on the block right now

183
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,460
the

184
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:45,840
have about 50 percent market share and
big things are starting to come down

185
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,080
pipeline it's really really phenomenal
um

186
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,490
were still at is strangely virgins

187
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,050
this technology right now it's with
these 3d printers it's very much like

188
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:56,760
the

189
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,750
early days of computing back in the
seventies you either have these

190
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,880
large boxes that not everybody can
afford to have in the house in their

191
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,300
home

192
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,640
or you have these home built hobbyist
pieces of equipment that

193
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,930
yet to tinker with you get your nerd
friends to you know just operating even

194
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,099
then it's a challenge but

195
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,100
we're starting to see this gap close
very very rapidly

196
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,400
army one oven each side effects

197
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,550
does this represent project and the
intense

198
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:31,459
economic curve that you see with these
three printers i mean you can buy these

199
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,860
things online now for seven hundred
dollars are still obviously a challenge

200
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,960
to model for

201
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,700
and a challenge control but for them
basic unit you can get it for

202
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,280
you know relatively inexpensive so

203
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,910
one thing that still holding this
technology back is

204
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,709
the learning curve so regardless up the
integration of technology on these

205
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:56,460
things being you know hardware and
software and understanding

206
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,350
you know robotics on a basic level most
people

207
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,110
lack 3d cad: skills to make these tools
really useful like

208
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,980
3d printer and everybody's home is great
all you're doing is printing stuff off

209
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,710
thing ever stray like oh here's my
little bunny here's my little you know

210
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,890
right great but what makes these teams
really

211
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:19,270
incredibly useful is the ability to
create shapes

212
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,250
will you say oh you know I need
something to hold my

213
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,680
main its pasta sauce jars up on the wall

214
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,469
you can draw little shaping an hour and
a half later you have that exact little

215
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,540
practice you need for

216
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,439
whatever you're doing

217
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,150
and I just a focus what I'm getting at
is

218
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,900
just hasn't been a killer after devised
for these printers

219
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,079
there hasn't been anything that really
you know strikes

220
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,410
everybody's heart this is ok you know I
need to get this right now it's going to

221
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,380
be easy for me to use in its going to be

222
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,390
something that's useful and fulfilling
so

223
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:57,650
we still have to see what Kane integrate
this technology in a very useful way

224
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:04,650
more beer

225
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,970
so plenty of room at the bottom you guys
ever hear about this from richard

226
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,930
fineman this is a pretty interesting one

227
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,729
so in 1959 richer finally gave a

228
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,959
the talk about nanotechnologies
basically considered the father of

229
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:25,969
nanotechnology

230
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,490
and to summarize what he's getting at
you saying that

231
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,490
there's no real reason

232
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,220
in the laws of physics that we know that
you can't assemble

233
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,899
things molecule by molecule atom by atom
obviously the

234
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:44,519
technology changes a little bit you know
gravity isn't as important to force

235
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,600
but surface tension inventor all sources
become worn for

236
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,160
important on a small scale but what was
really compelling about his argument is

237
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,860
saying there's no reason that we can a
simple things

238
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,790
on a very small molecular scale and
you're starting to see the very

239
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,069
beginning so that today

240
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:04,709
arm everybody's familiar with Star Trek
replicators

241
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:08,800
some you're probably Reds annual
Stevenson in the past I mean age is a

242
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,469
great book

243
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:15,139
if you haven't read it yet and just
about every genre sci-fi has some sort

244
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:17,209
of replicator technology

245
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:21,279
in bed inside a minute and we knew

246
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,680
when you really think about like the
passions the human heart like

247
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,540
getting to replicate our technology is
probably inevitable

248
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,839
happenstance inhumanity right there's no
reason that

249
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,100
we will not head that direction it's
it's only inevitable

250
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,050
probably not in our lifetimes but we're
going to start see the beginnings

251
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:42,160
such things just because the dramatic
impact that

252
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,480
these machines in this equipment can
have in our day-to-day lives

253
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,930
where media just if something's
important going on

254
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:55,930
don't ask for Cup T the Hitchhikers
Guide have you heard that

255
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:04,529
so

256
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,860
to reiterate these 3d printers are

257
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,770
a fantastic convergence of technology
you know it wasn't that long ago that

258
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:16,890
we didn't have the Internet in our
day-to-day lives much less

259
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:20,149
in our own very are are very Paul these

260
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:23,820
this robotic technology is becoming more
accessible

261
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,820
easier to use the software is getting
better every single day

262
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,200
and it's inevitable that these things
while

263
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,880
they may not appear in everybody's
kitchen they will probably be on

264
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,520
everybody's street corner or post office
or

265
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,810
library something like that there
there's such

266
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:46,089
an amazing deft usage in utility for
these machines that people are just

267
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:47,120
starting to discover

268
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,420
this technology is sold new that we're
just beginning to figure out the uses

269
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,329
for this stuff one compelling argument
is

270
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,839
that of singularity with computing power

271
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:02,300
increase following Moore's Law and
basically the

272
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,729
the slope of the line approaches
infinity

273
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,930
by about a year 2040 now that doesn't
necessarily say that the robots are

274
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,849
going to take over in consumers all

275
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:15,190
or you know they say oh that's about
Winnie complete

276
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:18,800
computers will reach the power the human
brain whatever the heck that means

277
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,029
but I think the more generalized
statement in this case

278
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:27,580
is to say that beyond this this event a
singularity

279
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,910
when that technological curve reaches
infinity we can't see beyond the horizon

280
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,920
we can't

281
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,020
even imagine the impact or the change in
our way of life

282
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,459
I mean everybody seen how

283
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:43,989
3d printer parts are starting to show up
in biology and

284
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,140
medicine you know 3d-printed years that
are attached

285
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:52,650
rats walk run around or 3d printed gains
made out of sugar lattices crazy stuff

286
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:56,030
right now

287
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:02,520
so change it up a little bit show your

288
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:09,520
will slide show few things we've been up
to

289
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,939
so this was an interesting experiment II
was

290
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:17,069
able to go through a few weeks ago at
the shop I needed to make this big 3d

291
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,889
prints bracket to hold onto

292
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:22,220
big electric motor and a

293
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,230
spent about it our designing this up any

294
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,290
chattin the afternoon printing up the
park

295
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:33,418
only to find out that it didn't fit and
I was battery get pretty

296
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:37,660
upset just and that I realize I was like
wait a minute

297
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,980
I didn't make this the way I'm used to
making these kinds of shapes like

298
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,260
with the tools I have at the shop I
could probably hackers out

299
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,120
in the better part about afternoon by
hand but it's going to require

300
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,678
all my attention all of my skill and the
moment i cud too much material of

301
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:59,330
it's true I can't put it back right so
when I messed up the Spartans pirated

302
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,340
get upset like a typically do until I
realize

303
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,340
I didn't make this the same way I i'm
used to play

304
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,620
a touched a button and walked away and
have lunch right like it did require all

305
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,590
my skill

306
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,699
all my attention so when I screwed it up
it was like

307
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,580
home and I II measure want to cut twice

308
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,059
that's what happened so anyway the

309
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,690
here's here's an example of where that
part was specific onto you

310
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:30,000
so I had to make his second iteration
the sponsor appear by the way

311
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,240
um my second part I adjusted the size
the holes and made a

312
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,940
been little gasket rather than printing
out the entire park just a check right

313
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,190
I'm

314
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:41,799
I'm learning from my mistakes I'm trying
to figure out hey how can I make this

315
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:44,760
tool useful how can I make parts in ways
I've never made

316
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,520
so I just double checked my measurements
the holes match up and saying okay

317
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,639
bingo ready to go and

318
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,669
an afternoon later actually I let the
spark print overnight so

319
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:01,210
I was done tired and frustrated in just
got the design out for this one ready to

320
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:01,650
go

321
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,309
an by the time I show up the next
morning parts they're ready

322
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:09,549
you go and it's really hard to explain

323
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:12,990
or express the revolutionary

324
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,200
design techniques that are allowed with
3d printing the ability to do this in my

325
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,380
garage without

326
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,370
a massive

327
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,899
sheen shop without you know be on serve

328
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,590
experience and and skill involved in
this it was

329
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,449
it was completely mind-boggling to me to
consider that

330
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:34,520
this is so easy to do nowadays of course
requires some tools in a little bit of

331
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,309
skill set

332
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:39,040
but thats its easily attainable by
anybody in this room

333
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,680
and the stuff's just getting better more
bail every single day

334
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,030
so there's a finish part

335
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:49,889
all boxed up there all bottled up to the
little of parking area

336
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,360
few other parts here some

337
00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:00,020
defied and see

338
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,540
so much as you guys ish

339
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:09,639
checked out any 3d scanning lately I
don't

340
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,330
departing here a compact anyway so just
a quick little anecdote ish

341
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:19,879
how I held my mind was blown about being
able to produce parts this way it was

342
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,450
just

343
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:25,420
completely unusual and unknown to me to
be able to

344
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,950
just give all that frustration up saying
hey

345
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,950
all the effort that is typically
involved in this is just

346
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:39,950
dawn I can't forget about

347
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,740
so asked a question earlier how many you
guys using your printer's

348
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,240
affectively arm again

349
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,640
that's really the challenge even with my
own printer which the right resources in

350
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,299
the right tools at a hackerspace these
things are challenged to keep bringing

351
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:04,990
just because

352
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,100
their finicky their machines then

353
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,820
there's a lot of different angles that
these things are are coming out so

354
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:16,470
picture appear was when I took about
three or four weeks ago I went to go

355
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,620
visit Noisebridge up in San Francisco

356
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:23,408
and this is the pilot 3d printers they
had over in the 3d printer corner and it

357
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:23,919
kinda

358
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,490
it took a little while for me to process
all this information but

359
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:31,220
E what it boiled down to was that hey
these

360
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,130
these Rep reps in these maker bot came
out a packer spaces

361
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:40,210
you know ish if there is any premier
hackerspace anywhere in the world

362
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,330
Noisebridge can

363
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:46,360
you know jokes aside it definitely draw
some very creative intelligent powerful

364
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,189
mines

365
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:50,370
and ish at a world-class hackerspace

366
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,809
I that a world-class hackerspace

367
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:57,649
they can't get these machines up and
running reliably how can

368
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,860
anybody in the public be expected to run
these things reliably

369
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,939
said just got me scratching my head
thinking about that like what's

370
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,590
what's the big challenge why what is the
utility in these things if they just sit

371
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,199
dead stacked on top of each other in the
corner

372
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,620
so like a smidgen earlier there's a
couple layers obstruction

373
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:20,479
that that keep this technology just
barely out of reach

374
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,200
so when I was building the Sprinter here

375
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,649
it definitely helped have access to a
machine shop in

376
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:32,629
machinists knowledge because hey I need
to have bunches screws a certain sizes

377
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:34,440
in all the rails need to be

378
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,460
exactly perfectly the same size and

379
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,440
you know ish you're focused and really
dedicated you can do that at home with a

380
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,320
file but it helps to have a little bit

381
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,799
more extensive resources to get these
machines right so

382
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:51,080
I guess what I'm getting at is this is
hard

383
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,820
3d printers are hard and

384
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,320
and long yeah

385
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,389
Yuki you can't see in this picture here
but there's actually a

386
00:23:01,389 --> 00:23:04,708
just off to the right there's a 3d
printer has like

387
00:23:04,709 --> 00:23:08,519
36 inches a busy travel who knows
something is up for it its bridge

388
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:15,519
so

389
00:23:16,459 --> 00:23:19,619
kinda leading at the same goal with
these

390
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:22,999
with these Rep reps this is really

391
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:27,899
where this technology becomes diffuse
through

392
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:31,619
humanity through society it's through
users like

393
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:36,718
us people that have a passion to tinker
and explore and figure out what these

394
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:39,690
things are useful for like this is
what's really going to drive this

395
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,719
technology into the mainstream

396
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:47,359
if it hasn't already reached at and it's
really empowering with the

397
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,739
open source a home

398
00:23:50,739 --> 00:23:55,919
worldwide references that you have on
the Rep rap website about being able to

399
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,129
you know just directly download all the
files necessary

400
00:23:59,129 --> 00:24:05,649
even then it's still a big challenge
because nothing is unified there's not

401
00:24:05,649 --> 00:24:06,319
one

402
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,259
complete ecosystem of course you know a
few people get these things up and

403
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:10,899
running in

404
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:13,958
after you know 12 months toiling away

405
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:17,569
blood sweat and tears you'll hear
everybody with a 3d printer just oh yeah

406
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:21,928
that machine has a bit in my heart and
soul in it like literally there's

407
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:28,929
chuck's be so was that

408
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,179
well you know those 10 rain you out like
a wet cloth earner

409
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:39,320
don't get me started but what I'm
getting at is their users

410
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,389
there's a bunch different challenges
just keeping this out reach

411
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:45,860
and is mostly because there's this is a
combination

412
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,840
three printers are combination ever few
different esoteric technologies you need

413
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,780
understand robotics

414
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,470
3d cad: and she code

415
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:59,309
and on it just how just after access to

416
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:02,500
pretty wide diverse resources to make
these things

417
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,500
fully utilize the following day to day
life

418
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:09,659
so exploring on that a little bit

419
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,380
just building these things as a little
tough Lake

420
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,900
so so this adult about up here this is
actually

421
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,450
be one on one other more advanced
designs

422
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,730
3d printers it's been out about a year
and a half designed by a Google site

423
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:25,400
engineer

424
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:31,010
and while these files were all available
for me to find online and

425
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:34,559
downloadable is still quite a challenge
to get

426
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,649
everything you need all under one roof
army

427
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:41,950
my particular challenge was the bill
materials completely wrong like the

428
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,039
documentation is

429
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,789
watching you need like 700 bolts
different sizes you can imagine that's

430
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:49,860
little bit expensive when you order the
wrong parts from McMaster Carr

431
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,479
so near just a little personal
experience just

432
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,530
the hardware is challenging enough I
mean Lake

433
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:59,690
you have to search the internet pretty
hard to figure out that you have to

434
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:04,049
assemble the triangle sliding them all
in together at the same exact time you

435
00:26:04,049 --> 00:26:04,570
know it's

436
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:08,030
is just little details like that that
are left out

437
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:11,799
the entire process a building these
machines makes it tough to do from a

438
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:12,889
grassroots level

439
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:17,870
and beyond that another quick show of
hands around the rim how many you guys

440
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:21,489
out there do 3d cad: have any style you
open ask after

441
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:23,080
salt works for AutoCAD

442
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,428
whatever alright so maybe 20 percent %uh
view on a good day

443
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:31,080
and like I was saying before that's what
really

444
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,470
empowers is technologies having the
skill to be able to you

445
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:37,679
build the shapes and make things

446
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,750
directly useful to you right away arm

447
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:45,960
another interesting to a another
interesting

448
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,470
problem with these open source machines
is getting the software tool chain

449
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:51,340
correct so

450
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,629
with my clothes source big box machine

451
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:58,120
luckily I have the right software to run
it its own

452
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,199
close Source engine that all I do is hit
slight Senate figures up my tool path

453
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,950
automatically

454
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:06,000
I have like three different options
where with the

455
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,059
Rep rap style machines you has just

456
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:12,320
gigantic diverse ecosystem all sorts of
despair

457
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,950
programs that are a challenge integrate
effectively

458
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:21,289
so again you going back to the problem
with documentation and support

459
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:24,970
how do you get these things altogether
from a base-level

460
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,899
even with your friends like I said these
things while we hear about the more we

461
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:30,969
know about them we don't really see the
mountain

462
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:35,680
out in the wild

463
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:40,010
so we were lucky enough 23 be to get
that

464
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:45,140
big use Stratos is 4k spear kind of an
interesting story behind I'll probably

465
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,160
tell you guys later

466
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,580
um so they just bought a maker bot for

467
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,379
ish the vast unbelievable some of four
hundred million dollars

468
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,660
but really when you consider the market
out there that's just

469
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,820
tiny little speck like make about don't
pose a threat to any of the big

470
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,169
manufacturers out there

471
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:07,550
mostly because you know they're low
dollar their

472
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:10,590
low and and nobody's really using them

473
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:13,840
in groundbreaking ways I mean every once
in a while you hear the story out there

474
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,330
like

475
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:20,530
all child with cerebral palsy has your
3d printed XO skeleton something like

476
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:21,670
that you know those are

477
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,940
those are definitely out liar cases and
very compelling ones

478
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:28,270
but very rare do your stuff

479
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:32,090
like compelling uses like that every day
and

480
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:37,970
be on just the her to expand on the
expense problem with these machines is

481
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:41,440
the fact that they lock you down such a
proprietary environment you know yes

482
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,540
it's nice to have something that works
all the time

483
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,139
every time but obviously it's a chance
to figure out why

484
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,670
works nicely every single time there's
obviously a lot of

485
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:54,850
fine tuning and tweaking that's what

486
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:59,560
you know makes strap money and

487
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:03,020
1e interesting experience I had with my
machine is

488
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,700
even though my machine is

489
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:11,080
built by the correct people on service
by the correct people have tech support

490
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,649
online like even then east of problems

491
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:17,980
and last year I made the mistake putting
some

492
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:22,780
bad unknown materials through it and
clogging up my print heads in this scare

493
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,660
the bejeezus

494
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:30,010
me so here we have the culprit you can
see right there on the right hand side a

495
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:30,600
nice little

496
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,659
clogged nozzles on this is the heart but
the machine missus

497
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,070
the most important part in this machine
and

498
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:41,129
also the most irreplaceable part they
obviously don't make these they don't

499
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:41,700
sell these

500
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,490
don't want you to keep the old machines
around so I had one shot at getting you

501
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:50,250
thing fixin my heart was pounding a
little bit like all this is so cool in

502
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,550
dollars rectum

503
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:57,000
useless so when I sing a hackerspace is
is

504
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,010
it allows you to think outside the box a
little bit and

505
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:04,540
after I took a look at this as like okay
I know what I did wrong I

506
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:08,428
the the material I was using has a shelf
life

507
00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:12,340
and it's only good for about two years
until it sucks so much moisture out of

508
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,309
the air that it doesn't extrude the same
way and that's what happened here just

509
00:30:15,309 --> 00:30:16,860
got clogged up and pounded in

510
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,149
also so never having seen this before

511
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:24,490
kinda figured it out 23b to just pick
this up to a power supply

512
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:28,010
in till the entire block heated up
enough that I could take out the entire

513
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,120
chocolate proof

514
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,889
crazy fix unbelievable that it worked
but luckily we were able to get the

515
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:34,520
machine

516
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,679
repaired and back up and running and
it's been running about a year since

517
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:38,520
then so

518
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,370
I'll never make that mistake again if
putting shit material through there but

519
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:46,860
just just be warned that's that's when
the bigger complications with 3d

520
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,419
printing is

521
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:51,490
in general is just having a good idea of

522
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:56,530
your material quality you know does
their even fetus little slick a boil on

523
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,129
the outside is the diameter change at
all

524
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:02,809
and that's important for these little
extra motors like if you have varying

525
00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:04,379
diameter filament than the

526
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:08,660
extruders get locked up in thing stopped
working so

527
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:12,910
again this goes back to the argument
that these these machines are so hard to

528
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:13,670
use because

529
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:17,110
there's just so many different layers
you know if the software is not causing

530
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,590
you trouble the hardware is causing you
trouble or

531
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:26,590
I am you once in awhile they actually
work

532
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,450
so

533
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:38,720
when it really gets down to is that in
order to use these machines effectively

534
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,610
you just gotta use them like I'm not
trying to dissuade anyone from

535
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:46,679
not having a maker bob because it's
really useful tool like

536
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:51,210
it's like saying well why would a very
basic computer back in the seventies do

537
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:51,870
me any good

538
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,870
you know why widow very small
calculation

539
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:59,870
benefit me when I could have somebody
crank it out by hand on adding machine

540
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:00,300
like

541
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,570
okay that's that's probably a little

542
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:07,360
all of in left field but I mean even
just for printing

543
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,240
trinkets like a little tiny things that
you spend on

544
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,640
told hours every day running to Walmart
backing for to go get

545
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,700
right like with the street corners start
doing

546
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,890
is replacing those needs in your life

547
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:25,190
and you say hey you know i good as
hackerspace all the time has a

548
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:28,740
trying to work in 3d printer and I bet I
can make a very basic shape that will

549
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,260
make my life slightly better

550
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:34,020
n you do that over and over and over and
suddenly it's like cocaine

551
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:37,790
now I see the utility on these machines
now I see what they can do for me

552
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:41,450
so I encourage you guys get out there
use these machines

553
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:45,040
so

554
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:49,210
again the only way to figure out these
machines to

555
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:52,540
to really make them useful in your life
is just getting out there and

556
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,680
running some party now learned some open
s cad

557
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,860
learned the thing ever since fireman
there's couple great website out there

558
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,929
that i download on my 3d models of a

559
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:05,700
grab cat is wonderful pardon me I had

560
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:10,120
probably best the my best success with
using crack at this rate downloaded a

561
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,120
bunch a teasing out Scholes and

562
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,629
r2 d2 officer really the ecosystem
starring

563
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,780
diverse if I enough to making useful for

564
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:25,220
trinkets on one other thing we're
starting to see with the software world

565
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,530
out there

566
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:29,790
mention I work with salt works all day
long that's a pretty

567
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:33,700
pricey cad system but what we're
starting to see out in the industry

568
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,240
is we're switching from a client base

569
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,040
user model to a more network-based sass
model so instead of needing to

570
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,740
by the five thousand dollars all works
license and having a crazy

571
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,440
rig to run that on now in the near
future we're going to start to see these

572
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,490
technologies open up and become more
accessible because software and hardware

573
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:56,140
is becoming

574
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,179
cheaper and easier to use so AutoCAD
right now

575
00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:04,690
has some arm cloud-based 3d modeling
technologies and it's really a matter of

576
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:05,540
time until

577
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:09,840
you have several different options to
choose from

578
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,090
as far as advanced 3d modeling for a
very

579
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:17,909
reasonable or 3 price online I mean if
you're willing to dedicate the time to

580
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:18,310
learn

581
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:21,619
open ask add go for it you know that'll
make these tools

582
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:25,960
evers so much more useful to you own

583
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,340
so as far as what the

584
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:32,340
the big mainstream industries turn a
lookout

585
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,379
look like is Stratus is

586
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:39,810
is starting to gobble up all the little
manufacturers

587
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:45,779
he just acquired a 3d-printed bureau
nearby called solid concepts

588
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:49,720
they were the ones that were in the news
recently for the 3d printed metal gone

589
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,859
I'm not sure he saw that

590
00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:54,918
deal with a crazy laser sintering
machine cutting-edge technology but

591
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:55,440
whatever

592
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,460
um couple other things were starting to
see some patents expire so

593
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,080
along with the maker bot acquisition D
patton

594
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:08,880
that stresses holds for the enclosed
heated build chamber

595
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,550
I believe that just expired so now even
though maker bot is a subset

596
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:17,290
stresses other companies are going to be
able to start to utilize the technology

597
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,210
to get

598
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:25,210
you know that much further down the road
better more proven technologies

599
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,960
so all the time people asking you know

600
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,360
what what materials to these printers
working and

601
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,340
for the longest time was always EBS
plastic lego classic car

602
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:47,060
plae poly lactic acid even lower in
material but you my

603
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:52,360
last 18 months on the job i've seen a
dramatic increase in the availability of

604
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,340
these materials

605
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:57,290
arm definitely out of the high-end
machines but that just means that the

606
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,210
low emissions are going to policy

607
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:02,730
what we're starting to see is not only
ABS plastic but

608
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:07,020
polycarbonate and biocompatible
materials

609
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,470
um we're starting to see some that are
chemical and temperature resistant

610
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:15,970
anti-static arm the fancier resin
printers can

611
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:21,390
print some amazing shapes out of are
multiple materials up multiple times you

612
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,990
can even have rubber-like materials a
different shore hardness is because

613
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:25,720
they're able to

614
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:30,299
dither the materials throughout the
print its really really quite phenomenal

615
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:34,330
what this technology is just starting
and figure out and

616
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,980
again it's such a new implementation of
the second largest

617
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:42,510
that we haven't quite discovered d most
effective uses what makes

618
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:45,990
our lives you know radically different
outta you know

619
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:49,270
quick little 3d-printed Park it's still
the wild west

620
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:54,050
so again I encourage all you guys to get
out there and start using some

621
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:58,410
3d printers yourself if you're not doing
them um every Thursday night we're

622
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,370
starting to have

623
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:02,670
a 3d printer night over a 23 be so she
geyser

624
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:06,300
interested about the technology anchors
at you come by in

625
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:09,540
usually there wrenching working on stuff
so

626
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,590
um yet just get out get your hands were

627
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:15,980
you know use these machines and figure
out what they're useful for because

628
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,850
just just like learning the skill
lockpicking the first time

629
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:23,140
the skill is useful to you it's an
incredible

630
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,529
valuable resource that you'll go back to
time and time again and press your

631
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:28,230
friends

632
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:35,230
I'll that stuff so creepy dolan okay
this is a little

633
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,990
will timestamp you just checking on how
we're doing got some more pictures for

634
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:41,350
you

635
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:46,580
I really want a fine at risk in my body

636
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:50,840
article so

637
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,360
this is an interesting culmination of
the technology and

638
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:58,430
this is a scan of my body job she was
the one that hooked me up with the

639
00:37:58,430 --> 00:37:59,899
printer in the first place is

640
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,930
the the technical manager for three you

641
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:07,710
printer service bureau so this guy deals
with these all day every day

642
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:11,830
and he came by the shop a few weeks ago
and I was talking about the things

643
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:12,590
you've been doing

644
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,910
and mister bodies don't know when you're
back there

645
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:19,759
mister but came by a few weeks ago and
says hey let's do some 3d scanning

646
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,300
ourselves really crazy thing

647
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:26,550
and we went out to Best Buy picked up a
Microsoft Connect and downloaded the

648
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,190
free

649
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:32,220
Microsoft SDK for the connect and we
were able to 3d scan my body just

650
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,270
sitting in the chair.

651
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:38,200
yet it was slow my hardware was an
optimized for this but with a hundred

652
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:38,569
dollars

653
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:43,260
commodity hardware freeware use connect
to be able to accomplish this

654
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,210
you know within moments we were able to
get in nice solid watertight

655
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:51,030
3d model do just sitting right from me
and a half an hour later we're

656
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:55,020
we were able to 3d print the spark and
this guy's mind was blown

657
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,820
the schedules with three friends all day
long he'd never seen technology like

658
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,900
this like you see

659
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:04,710
3d scanners all day long online you know
what's the next engine cost that comes

660
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:08,110
along with the makeup artist three
thousand dollars right and

661
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:12,050
this one hundred dollar Microsoft
Connect can keep up with every bit as

662
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,400
long as you have the hardware they can

663
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:20,400
running its quite phenomenal

664
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:35,860
and over you guys don't gives me the
creeps

665
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:42,370
so extrapolate this information a little
bit right like

666
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:47,259
ten years ago nobody heard about 3d
printing maybe tiny little blip on the

667
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:47,970
radar once

668
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:51,390
while nowadays are starting here about a
more more MORE

669
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,950
like I was getting at earlier this isn't
going away anytime soon

670
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:58,189
we're going to see this every day all
day in

671
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:01,960
unbelievable ways this is still the
seventies of computing you know we got

672
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,340
twenty twenty-five years advancement
'til the stuff become so good that we

673
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:06,840
have

674
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,060
you know 3d printing some molecular
level

675
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:14,390
robots that can how to assemble
everything you know on on a moment when

676
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:15,200
he knows

677
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,899
you guys read sci fi you know what
what's capable in 15 years ago we can

678
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,630
album that everybody would be walking
around with an internet-connected

679
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,770
smartphones

680
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:27,810
sure enough you know society just drives
technology down that way because we need

681
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:28,840
it for some reason

682
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:34,070
in it's really hard to are you a reason
why we

683
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:38,560
do not need 3d printing it just changes
the way we make things to change the way

684
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,390
we need things to change is so many
things about

685
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:48,390
the way we make in our life that just
need to jump on the bandwagon right now

686
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,740
you need to see where this is going to
do in chief how it's going to change

687
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,669
your life now

688
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:59,220
again what's let's be on the horizon
what's

689
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:03,100
which passed the point where we can see
how this technology is going to develop

690
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,540
so this is

691
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:12,040
a 3d printing silicon I just found this
on the internet I don't even know

692
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,710
Thursday

693
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:17,120
associated with this but men's is
microelectromechanical systems

694
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,390
this is where 3d printing and really
take off this is where you start

695
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,109
building those

696
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:26,020
you know nano-scale box armaments has a
little bunny here with a little scale

697
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,560
its fight micrometers

698
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:33,210
and just for a sense a scale five
micrometers is a sizable red blood cell

699
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:36,230
so this is technology that's

700
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:39,610
you know fifteen years behind us we can
do so much better than this

701
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:43,990
today you know what are we going to use
this for you know the little tiny

702
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:44,259
you know

703
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:48,120
nano nanite box that fly around in turn
you in a pink

704
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,830
who's like that's that's probably not
what's going to be

705
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:55,960
just down the road but you know what
what are the implications

706
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:00,890
being able to manufacture on molecular
scale what does this do for

707
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:04,069
way we make everything in your life hard
to say

708
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:07,850
um

709
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:11,400
so one interesting thing that we've seen
these

710
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,030
three preachers use for as far as the
additive

711
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:18,300
I'll laser sintering technology is army

712
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:22,110
630 rocket parts now

713
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:25,230
with the laser sintering technology

714
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:30,290
are using is finely powdered metal and a
high power laser beam to

715
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:33,620
scribe out every single layer well
didn't use it all together

716
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:38,430
but what's neat about that is suddenly
you can work with medals at were much

717
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,270
more challenging to use

718
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:44,080
in any other way titanium inconel

719
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,569
and stainless steel I'm very very
challenging

720
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:51,830
materials to cut away with a traditional
tour much

721
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:55,190
easier to build up from the ground up
using a laser sintering she

722
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:59,120
and this others all ties in with

723
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,630
like who's going to figure out the
killer app what's the

724
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:06,750
what's the next great application with
this technology I mean were able to

725
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:10,410
to build rocket nozzles with complex
geometry is

726
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:14,290
with about five percent of the
traditional effort nowadays and

727
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:20,070
same thing is true for airplane parts
and medical parts

728
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:24,250
you know the more this technology is
getting used the more dramatically

729
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,810
change the world underneath their noses

730
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:30,290
arm the desk at prior project

731
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:33,520
you guys in should use seen shaped like
this right

732
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,140
so interesting anecdote with this one
dis

733
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,310
the shit doesn't work the stuff is awful
army

734
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:46,509
even West's the right technology the
right machinery

735
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:51,720
it still requires gunsmiths skill to get
this thing working

736
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,950
even then it still plastic can you guys
have seen enough Wile E Coyote cartoons

737
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:56,819
to know what

738
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:03,820
when you shoot a plastic gun right so
anywhere he baffled that which

739
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:08,970
with the exact same machine the Death
Cab project us with

740
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:12,850
the right software that the dugout
project has I can get this thing work

741
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:16,040
there were some dimensions that we're
off and

742
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:20,920
I had a buddy ravine that was always
talking guns as we know is challenging

743
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,110
me on the subject so

744
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:26,040
IMU I said I finally cornered him I said
hey ish

745
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,509
if the guy that's in charge this Death
Cab project 3d printer gun project igi

746
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,970
so gung-ho about power to the people

747
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:38,379
and giving this out to the masses why is
he not releasing the engineering files

748
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:42,140
it it doesn't have the dimensional
information all it is is a 3d point

749
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:42,759
cloud

750
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,140
this mark right you know why can't I
scale it or see what size is supposed to

751
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:47,470
be

752
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:52,720
and my body says hey Chris do a little
bubbles features me so I

753
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,149
get on his screen teleconference and he
pulls up a

754
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:00,290
SolidWorks model of the 3d printed gun
ago you

755
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:03,310
dog did you seriously spent all this
time

756
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:08,060
reverse engineer the spark because
better I'm a poor grad student in

757
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:08,910
Wisconsin

758
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:12,390
and I just volunteered to help out on
the project and they said okay

759
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:17,819
so I got to talking to him and I said
okay okay I'm not much for going guy

760
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,940
I meet a lot of parts and this thing
looks fucking

761
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,300
we're right like this doesn't look like
any I've ever seen what the hell's wrong

762
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:24,790
with us

763
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:28,080
and my buddy says you know it the funny
story

764
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:32,190
from the mean designer in charge is this
project

765
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:36,790
head she had an electrical engineering
background he'd only been using 3d cap

766
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:40,230
for about six months leading up to this
project so

767
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:44,260
and I just just a little wonky looks
like its gonna hurt somebody

768
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:49,190
so was set

769
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:51,870
I it's going to hurt

770
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:58,870
the user yet head

771
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:02,170
so there's a reason why

772
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:05,840
you haven't seen CDC's out the wild like
you you heard people make a stink about

773
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,390
three different guns but there's

774
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:12,160
never once been a single problem with
these out in the water that's because

775
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,299
they don't exist its

776
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:18,710
unicorn right why would you use several
thousand dollar machine to make a sub

777
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:19,450
par par

778
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:22,620
when you know the actual gun parts are

779
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:26,350
hundred dollars who knows so it's just

780
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:30,390
its it's a completely no argument is a
all we got to regulate

781
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:33,900
3d printers cuz I can make farms know
they can't

782
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,980
they will never they just don't work me
um

783
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:41,290
when he just thinking we are sure you
see is you know

784
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:45,250
yes okie three printers are beloved
double-edge sword like oh my god people

785
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:46,290
can certainly

786
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:49,670
3d print parametric domains hosting
world going to come to you

787
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:53,690
there's there's very few

788
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:57,080
bad things that come out of these
machines like how awful could be the

789
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,590
worst thing you could ever do this like

790
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:02,240
3d printer Warhammer figurines gonna be
mad about copyright

791
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,600
what's really compelling which

792
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,710
what's going on in the world is the
Smithsonian is starting to spend a lot

793
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:12,640
of time and energy to see 3d scan older
models

794
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,259
actually inside at the smithsonian they
only have about one percent have their

795
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:22,300
entire collection on display at any
given time and wish

796
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,350
3d scanning in 3d printing what that
does

797
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:28,790
is it allows the public to have access
to

798
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:32,820
all love those exhibits all the time

799
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:36,610
and if you have access to a great 3d
printer you can have it in your hand in

800
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:37,350
afternoon

801
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:43,990
what does that mean for the world right
hard to say week we're not seeing that

802
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:44,819
every day but

803
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,050
its that kinda technologies available
today

804
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:54,309
and I think that's the most exciting
part all this so

805
00:47:54,309 --> 00:47:56,630
what is this all going to write Lake

806
00:47:56,630 --> 00:48:02,390
okay okay we've seen a couple in a
dystopian sci-fi movies were the robots

807
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:06,509
take over the world or need humans for
our resources our energy right ever

808
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:11,430
who does who knows where this is going
to lead us right

809
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:14,589
its it's inevitable it's going towards a
path I've

810
00:48:14,589 --> 00:48:18,270
you know increasing technology but

811
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:23,369
what I would say in conclusion is that
what are you best learn how to talk to

812
00:48:23,369 --> 00:48:24,440
some robots

813
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,680
you know learned their technology so
they don't find a reason to you

814
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,640
execute UN they might you be around
because your useful repairman our

815
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,290
printer

816
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:38,980
you can scratch them on the back in ways
other robots can so um

817
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:42,559
I guess I'm about ready I'm good on time

818
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,200
can't see here I have some 3d printer
parts appear that I've been working on

819
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,439
you guys are walking a combined
inspecting asking questions

820
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,990
I guess I can open up the floor for any
particular questions an

821
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:56,279
I I actually have some prizes in the
back for

822
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,730
any questions and the best question wins
this r2 d2 models so

823
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:04,400
let me let me let me go get my little
baggies unknowable

824
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:11,400
dual Q&A

825
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:48,619
Buehler him

826
00:49:51,819 --> 00:49:55,320
low

827
00:49:55,320 --> 00:50:00,290
called greedy

828
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:05,540
e world

829
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:09,009
yeah crazy free

830
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:13,130
long and Nessa

831
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:16,870
really funny the mission was is Tim

832
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:21,290
to paraphrase is the real killer app
hang up the cost of materials

833
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:25,430
so yes there is a pretty significant
material cost

834
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:30,960
for me with my industrial box it cost
about five dollars a cubic inch so

835
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,650
part like this this is probably a fifty
dollar part altogether so

836
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:40,890
its not expensive but it's non trivial a
specially if you screw stuff up

837
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:46,190
so if you're working on a maker bot on
the material costs about $1

838
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:49,260
fish that it would be about ten dollars
worth a plastic so

839
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:53,320
thats that's the way we're starting to
see things develop as the materials

840
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,930
become more commonplace

841
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:58,330
as the use becomes more common

842
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:01,860
then we'll probably see much more
dramatic

843
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:06,830
drop in prices touch

844
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:11,740
there

845
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:16,589
alright from home

846
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:23,590
me

847
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:28,540
little and one people

848
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:32,550
he was all me the more solver

849
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:34,920
song is room hooligan

850
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,530
all cool I

851
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:42,630
middle area

852
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:45,640
alright so I do you have these pictures
here

853
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:48,930
game you just sick people um

854
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:53,149
so I i'm I made this mistaking more than
once

855
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:56,609
Irish printed out some parts thats I've

856
00:51:56,609 --> 00:52:03,609
deal measure quite so accurately key can
just second mean accessthis

857
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:12,890
me here's yesil a boy anyway

858
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:16,829
um had always fun yeah

859
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:20,460
um what so my problem was

860
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:24,700
I would take a picture love the ball
hole spacing in import

861
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:28,118
the picture in this all works now just
basically space

862
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:32,920
out the the holes I'd say okay you know
I'm have been known to mention here and

863
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:37,150
I consider them all at a known to
mention taking just a picture isn't

864
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:37,700
enough

865
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,740
even with unknown dimension you actually
have to take some measurements across

866
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,109
the little holes in

867
00:52:42,109 --> 00:52:45,160
that was the same exact thing that I had
happen with my big

868
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:48,440
3d printer bracket I tried to do the
same thing with the new dimension in the

869
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,990
holes are wrong so I just had a

870
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:56,990
measure twice cut once 00 all

871
00:52:58,339 --> 00:53:02,480
okay yeah thats that's that's a more
specific question

872
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:08,319
um so that had to do with the slicing
software misinterpreting

873
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:14,299
the now thanks had to do with a slicing
software misinterpreting the wall

874
00:53:14,299 --> 00:53:15,589
thicknesses at the park

875
00:53:15,589 --> 00:53:19,089
so what I ended up seeing was

876
00:53:19,089 --> 00:53:22,980
the wall thicknesses were smaller than
the minimum value

877
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:26,349
and that cause some errors in the
slicing software

878
00:53:26,349 --> 00:53:29,760
and seats

879
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,230
that's the part I'm just tryin I don't
think I had all the little a diagram

880
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:34,160
saved for it

881
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,240
so yeah whoops

882
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:44,240
there's the park but I don't have the
example you're talking about yeah

883
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:51,230
folded in problem with me

884
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:54,250
million you learn in

885
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:55,890
P hmm there

886
00:53:55,890 --> 00:54:01,480
learn yes actually I experienced a more
specific area it's a

887
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:06,200
layer 8 Pepe kak air so there's just a
short between the headphones that

888
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:13,200
that's my own problem you get the dog
face

889
00:54:26,369 --> 00:54:28,869
use whatever you think you'll use

890
00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:32,869
like even if the most base level
cheapest thing as long as you're getting

891
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:33,880
your hands dirty

892
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:37,760
go for like how much more can I possibly
encourage

893
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,210
like you're gonna have to start at the
bottom in do a little bit of frustration

894
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:42,150
but

895
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:45,510
more you use it the more you learn your
own the more you'll figure out what the

896
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:46,210
stuff is

897
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:53,210
really good for the 80s

898
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:05,990
you where you're going still

899
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:11,390
this with a yellow little

900
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:15,480
home we'll see he's old

901
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:19,660
see you gain new problems the molecular
scale

902
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:24,770
and it's not something I necessarily
extra mile but using office to use

903
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:29,240
call where you tryna assemble things
molecule by molecule suddenly

904
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,759
the individual molecule you're
manipulating sticks to your manipulator

905
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,800
in a much different way than you're used
to seeing on a macroscale

906
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:41,060
so like is that I'm not an expert on
man's arm nanomanufacturing but

907
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:44,299
you start to see problems that you don't
necessarily see

908
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:51,300
in our scale Frank reference

909
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:55,680
lani mine

910
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,879
technology like this point and

911
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,470

assault with intent to murder line

line

914
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:12,730
leave you I leading technology and maybe

915
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:18,290
and will and win the both million is
directly correlated

916
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:23,050
you their difficulty or of that vision
zone

917
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:27,160
one may latham whenever needed

918
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,680
so that was that number with lenses

919
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:34,020
environmentally all lasting a

920
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:37,210
being out there let you be shade

921
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:42,210
wat consider a post scarcity societies
Star Trek society where you have

922
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:46,090
molecular assemblers then you probably
also have molecular

923
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:49,720
disassemble urs you would think that the
two were probably going hand in hand or

924
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:50,069
wrist

925
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:54,250
they don't go hand in hand if they don't
go hand in hand well then

926
00:56:54,250 --> 00:57:01,250
make that make that should work I can't
think of a good one of hand so hey you

927
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:06,080
got you got a new

928
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:13,080
you got a new mission in life them

929
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:17,880
time and money like meltdown

930
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,030
all

931
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:22,630
are scraps to you problem is fine

932
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:26,310
same are you familiar with a great leap
forward in China

933
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:30,810
its so

934
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:34,860
back at him now decided it would be
great idea to reorient

935
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:38,680
a industry in China and say hey all you
had a cultural workers yarnell

936
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:42,649
steelworkers and you are now a meltdown
your farm tractors and make steel

937
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:46,330
problem is you don't get high quality
steel love melting down your tractors

938
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:50,759
so requires a little bit more expert
Eastern

939
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:57,760
just say oh let's not all this crap

940
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,230
don't

941
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:10,550
so I actually have a interesting example
a hybrid machine

942
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:15,730
good one so hybrid machines if you're
not familiar are combinations C&C

943
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:19,300
machines and 3d printers so they can 3d
print the sheet

944
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:23,830
and also mill out or cut out some the
features

945
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:28,930
combining the best to both technologies
and what's really cool about those

946
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:32,480
combination hybrid machines is suddenly
you have

947
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:35,800
access to basically any she

948
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:40,040
you what you are you have to take a lot
of china manufacturer you have to take a

949
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,509
lot of skill set to

950
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:45,430
produce a correctly but its

951
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:50,220
it's really a compelling argument for
what's just down the road was just down

952
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:50,660
the road

953
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:53,970
what was just around so

954
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:58,100
sample sup so what this does is it

955
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:02,040
it builds up a 3d-printed part on a
metal base

956
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:06,090
using a a big high power laser and then
it comes in

957
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:10,610
afterwards with the CNC milling machine
and finishes of all the perfect surfaces

958
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:12,300
you know the threaded holes and

959
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:15,580
very flat surfaces that a 3d printer can
do so well

960
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:19,060
it's what the CNC machine does well so
um

961
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:24,590
I just a different way to look at it is
with CNC machinery and 3d printers

962
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:27,600
their their complementary technologies
the

963
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:34,600
augment what the other does well use a

964
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:45,840
figure all well people widen the

965
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:49,570
really because you're a moral

966
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:56,570
good

967
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:01,980
up

968
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:04,450
prototyping and Jimmy still

969
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:08,480
were you technologies

970
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:14,650
age matter implementation alright

971
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:18,220
last year the Uni we hear

972
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:25,220
good you

973
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:31,790
I
