12
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:53,699
stuff recently

13
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,519
I'm a primary job is researchers

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,020
fine underground which is ever make when
he every month

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,500
again once again a encourage people to
harass me on twitter

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,640
so this stock is going to be talking a
lot about

17
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,030
what happened with a mainstay there's
been a lot I'm uprising last year so

18
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,170
it breaks down for that piece of a
little bit shop a little bit an

19
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:17,970
introduction

20
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,929
made sleep some the goals in tents in a
little bit more details as to when

21
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,229
how she you the sorter information I am
talking about think you're right into

22
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:27,880
the lake on the SkyMall leaks

23
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,548
if you aren't familiar with a dying
overs much as they can explaining what

24
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,020
they were

25
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,210
but they were released this last
december 2013 unity my conclusions

26
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,789
but the scandal eating into focus not on
the entire breadth and what they were

27
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,140
but

28
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,520
like the hardware but the software in
Matt now where BC at the installed

29
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,740
some wifi tax they had some cellular
network based tax

30
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,210
so to understand what's going on

31
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,360
getting sent was involved it's pretty
easy

32
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,420
because is our Privacy surveillance
stuff is a is all about those who spy

33
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,880
and as he gets by Don genes which group
your part of

34
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,679
by I'm in a primarily focus on the
concerns of those who are spied on

35
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,880
because in a diff tech to defend against
those or spying

36
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,579
yet take minute think about why eighty
spy spy

37
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,750
information is values a simple premise

38
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:21,470
information can be used for good can use
for bad there's more legal practices for

39
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,890
information collection things like
protecting people

40
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,690
protected from harm can get the
information that they need chip you know

41
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,290
something up

42
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,040
if you know that there's gonna be a
missile strike in certain location the

43
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,560
people if they know that they're gonna
move from their location no longer be

44
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,100
effected

45
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,590
no longer be directly harmed %ah Picasa
progress siad

46
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,060
if information is not keyhole II ended
in a friendly

47
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,080
anticipations out LD contained in
protected and given away freely that we

48
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,040
actually grow as a society in a better
way

49
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,609
in a better way there's also a moral
values regarding

50
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,640
spying on other people being used as
blackmail you can use it against people

51
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,660
you can use to try to coerce people into
taking specific actions

52
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,049
you cannot use it with profiteering you
can steal intellectual property from

53
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,750
other companies using your business
there's a

54
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:09,710
interesting try and or even more about
conflict really what happens

55
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:13,980
US laws and even global laws is no
countries figured out

56
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,250
the proper mixture of protecting
individuals privacy

57
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:22,580
protecting your company's companies
intellectual property

58
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,820
you know copyright without without them
overlapping excited infringing conflict

59
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:27,420
with each other

60
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,790
in here in the US yet the special happy
thing a free speech

61
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,609
where we can only save you know she
claimed free speech to rent a saying

62
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:35,950
about this person is free speech

63
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,549
release not because its conflict with
personals persons perhaps

64
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,769
prided actions the right to be left
alone orite

65
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:46,130
corporations but we call it a little
property copyright

66
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,579
trademark things like that it's as funny
conflict up

67
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,640
it's something that I have with another
talk they talk about but

68
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,910
it a personal interests in mind now and
talk about today

69
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,470
them full disclosure one same had

70
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,019
at least one point I'm in my life
probably more had been under

71
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:05,230
surveillance by the FBI

72
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,450
what's question already I don't know if

73
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,570
similar to flee request into which they
said you have no record at you being

74
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,130
under investigation by the FBI

75
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,019
to which I remember s where I remember
actually talking to the guy

76

I know his name I also fighting as a
Lowes

77
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,340
tin foil hat wearers your conspiracy
theorists if there's no hard factual

78
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,770
evidence behind your story under your
claim

to me but if your story as the flash

81
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,590

tin foil hat I forgot my call tin foil

83
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:49,560
hat this time around but just 13 a quick
explanation

84
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,040
said is about 10 years ago not twelve
years ago now 2002's when I was under

85
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,750
investigation

86
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,600
apparently at the FBI and found out one
day because

87
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,380
I was sitting in my room as them with my
grandma as any you know

88
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,620
18-year-old afterward and I see my
grandma coming in I come up

89
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,700
to the main near living room that
they're my grandma is with two guys in

90
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,320

92
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,590
I found out that you're my grandma she
she sat there and everything

93

windows and cheese place all 0 they'd

95
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,360
never had to shuffle the cards again

96
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,900
and the FBI agents can lead walked up
start questioning her because her name

97
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,489
was all

98
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,550
on all the internet accounts a species
and so on and so forth they thought she

99
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,590
was the target

100
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:40,099

104
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,940

of an impact this whole experience had a

123
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,590
big impact on my life but

124
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:56,090
and no conspiracy theorist I a way to
remember that I can actually consulted

125
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:56,700
for

126
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:01,200
movies very sleazy it features hackers
infected gains

127
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,810
here she told me that he's the guy who
would show the people like how to set up

128
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,140
a hacker gained look like a mic mother

129
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:13,289
that was my room I should be in that
sweet sweet like movie money

130
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:17,470
in a set that just like my beginning
that's my story to get a little

131
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,100
in a full disclosure on to what where
where I come from one talking like you

132
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,540
on getting the proper straight and
Justin happen to me

133
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,090
but this is a good example what I'm
really looking for

134
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,640
2010 something's working in the car and
found a GPS unit strapped to it

135
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,900
takes it out and played takes it out on
a short while later

136
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,500
some law enforcement people shot his
house and say you have something that's

137
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,010
ours

138
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:44,849
this actually happen in LA a

139
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:49,110
this is the only major story that I can
recall the last ten years or so

140
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:54,090
debt actually showed physical evidence
%uh a US citizen being spied upon

141
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,859
with actually show with his lead in some
spine material was

142
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,310
and high-value physical evidence more
than anything else

143
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,120
and also course since then the fed's
denied any involvement in this and they

144
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,710
can adjust

145
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,750
the whole story Kenneth some sites in
nothing I don't know if it was something

146
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,940
I was manufactured by journalist but it
was a good story

147
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,750
into the secret shop which is a physical
well look like a GPS tracking unit back

148
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,539
in 2010

149
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:19,620
so games with their surveillance camera
leaks

150
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,169
these were a syriza reach that were
leaked

151
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,849
indicia legal and

152
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,960
$33 in December 2013 you can call to
talk

153
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,799
are tons details were given how these

154
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,159
devices would work someone can just
quickly brush over how the devices were

155
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:36,599
marked

156
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,710
would work just saying gonna get an idea
but that's a long hour long talk greeks

157
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,520
planes

158
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,750
individuals things accurately
everything's working are they buying

159
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,140
computers cellphones everything
imaginable

160
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,420
the imply its source any implied that
the source

161
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:54,660
appears to be snowed in the tune of
scenery we referenced as a snowed in

162
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,959
related nique but actually can find any
credible sources that

163
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,529
explain that it was from snowed in
sneaks which is important nikkei's

164
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:06,500
knowing where the leak came from
validates whether or not it's legitimate

165
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,760
Corsini at the spying agency no spy
agencies gonna say yes that was ours

166
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,569
oscillation

167
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,020
try get into it because it's an implied

168
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:23,380
leak ending because the source is not
really validated in my opinion

169
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,260
most in this is the reason why give
their stocking was really why did all

170
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,900
this research is mostly because

171
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,400
a angel a thought experiment enjoy
speaking about

172
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:36,390
if there was a theoretical way to
actually do spying in this manner

173
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,029
how would one defend or to take more
specifically even better detect

174
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:43,459
that that's fine surveillance was taking
place nationally with a focus this

175
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:44,130
hockey's

176
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,120
on starting up these are a series of
hardware bugs

177
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,360
user Rachel reflectors segment is what
they were called

178
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,750
are apologies I don't have my presenter
notes hehe here

179
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,220
but from memory the ad

180
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,720
these various devices call to the stand
out of RO

181
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,450
rage master charger yard they would
there would be little bugs are embedded

182
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,580
in in line two systems like your VGA
cable

183
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,709
or your not your USB bus your keyboard
directly

184
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:17,869
imitating your keyboard or your audio
you like a microphone

185
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,170
for your audio in the BBC amplify the
signal that were being sent so

186
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:26,130
your VGA sin single uncertainties in the
all school 1970s tempest system

187
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,380
they were just in like but this little
device in line

188
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,400
with your VGA cable TV like the wanna be
a

189
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,620
one other the break like to be the red
line to make a little red signal

190
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,530
any they would Heather another system
remotely that would listen for the RF

191
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,069
signal sent from the small device

192
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,440
any BC reconstruct always showing up on
your monitor

193
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,470
albeit only want the red signal was was
what was claimed to be used but that's

194
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:49,960
enough to get

195
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,310
image as to what's on your screen and
it's good idea

196
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,290
up other things that you keyboard and
stuff like that same idea the GCC put a

197
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:57,760
bug

198
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,450
in line to listen so there the day to be
past between your keyboard

199
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,170
in your computer and I just send that
data already are signals

200
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,199
there some claims that that the

201
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,390
they would use a reflector so they have
to send a signal to the device

202
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,930
for you to get the day the signal
backing the device although they don't

203
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:15,969
go into any details

204
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:20,090
explain how many his works so there's
also Belk lanes in going to have to take

205
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:24,710
radio frequency Eunice leader but all
these devices had a similar

206
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:29,890
fact that now know he's a racist is the
devices

207
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,250
but going back to the our stuff how
would you protect our stuff just

208
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:38,270
should all just tin foil room right
having an affair in a cage

209
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:41,420
nothing will get out in I remind you
that

210
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,880
that's not the point the stock by the
stock is not had a lil

211
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,200
explicitly defend and/or give you a
magic bullet

212
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,560
like rock that will prevent tiger
attacks or snake oil sales pitch

213
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,689
I will magically make things that happen
this talking actually about

214
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:00,950
knowing you were being targeted by
source doing Hyderabad city sending

215
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:04,360
RF signals over your into your room to
it too

216
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,850
a foreign place you know why you
something likes of were defined radio

217
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:11,900
up which day and one more papillion
releases the hacker risk board

218
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,120
where are you may see program

219
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,280
software program at the tell this device
listen in on as many

220
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,130
as much inspection are of such as you
can you can listen in on it let's say

221
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:26,670
you have a keyboard that you believe is
bugged

222
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:30,170
reno is but we know it's bad and you

223
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,530
wanna be able to find out that any date
is being sent off

224
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,569
you would simply enough power of that
device

225
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,600
not plug in your keyboard a mouse
whatever it is and the CGR spectrum in

226
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,600
your room in wheat

227
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,930
power on the device in it now easily
seen our special spikes

228
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,609
it surged eight innings in a large
section that you got you can't

229
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,320
physically see

230
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,230
now you suffered radios telling you yes
these things are going off that one of

231
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,210
the devices of

232
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,570
now you know that there's something
physically there

233
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,860
energy probably be smart in crack open
the device and look for something that

234
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,640
doesn't belong

235
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,060
going to the

236
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:08,709
learn more hardware bucks for days data
exfiltration what the reporter was

237
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:13,130
cut mouse which is 1g three with your
ability USB bus

238
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:17,840
attacks he would be the love I saw the
input in line and USB bus either

239
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,460
in the cable on the USB headers are in
the use the chip in your in your

240
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,080
motherboard

241
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,210
begins he was entertaining that was it
this is an actual picture that this is a

242
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:30,950
the gym a wifi card with a Ginsu knife
than a maid are against it was just a CE

243
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:35,290
it attached you wifi card anyway to
Kennywood strangely enough it would

244
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:38,969
interject in your wifi card ain't
theoretically

245
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:42,240
setup RF signals as to which wifi card
was sending out even though

246
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,110
probably that's what the wifi card is
designed to do your

247
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:49,490
then there's howler monkey in fire walk
which in the Chesapeake

248
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,830
targeted different things either you
know your firewire your directly on your

249
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:53,400
motherboard

250
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,740
new just get in line with the bus on
your hardware

251
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,340
listen to the data that's funny cricket
at that level and send it over

252
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,640
radio frequencies to be sent back to her
central collecting device

253
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,699
again these are theoretical things I'm
just glazing over then quickly to

254
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,580
explain how they would work in how you
would find them

255
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,650
skipped

256
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,550
that

257
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,569
on again all those as well those are all
our FB so you would use exacting

258
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:23,300
half board or suffer defined media to
take them are

259
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:28,089
purses another one continuing make

260
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:32,380
for my milk the %ah

261
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,519
another way for that up for these taxes
you the taxes are persistent compromise

262
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,070
tax

263
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,690
we have all seen easing happy be seen
the security community ways

264
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,800
these are related to hacking your
motherboard BIOS

265
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,849
or now where on the low-level sectors in
your

266
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,600
are great that's what the things we do
dodd surge

267
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,519
YZ G tag component that would actually
hack your device

268
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,120
me take repeated it found that things
were busy changing

269
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,279
would easy somebody got removed to
install itself again

270
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:06,410
because you get axis tracking you gtech
level RBC GT headers

271
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:10,180
or similar for your device they all have
different names

277
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,310

quietly saying I don't know that is to
eat a head injury

284
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,920

called many different things for

with a device for with has a G tech
device

288
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,120
you typically use these when you happy
others and it's really

British traditionally used primarily
during death process per device

290

just bc feed it your processes like
yours

293
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,880
you processes you can write the editor
to the firmware

294
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,160

you talking to the J taking this number
one way to Sir packing in the system

301
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,360
you get the CPU response in BCC don't
fear

302
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,000
will slow the process over this BCG
takes serial port

303

it's as fast as I can see report you
know just the lead-up you all the time

304
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,180
we need

305
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,790
or you can push towards the device from
1842 onto its chips

306
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,230
on these exist in many different ways

307
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,550
for many different reasons ecology take
XTP your

308
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:13,589
wanna most people use them for

309
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:18,730
ex parte tacking your CG tag attached
opponents to try to dish

310
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,420
the the EDRM type style thing for Xboxes
and other councils

311
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,650
because you get the CP level access
again this is exactly what the

312
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,350
theoretical spy agencies were using

313
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:31,889
yes if you can plug directly into gtech
enter on a motherboard you pinged on the

314
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,700
system as long as you have access to
that

315
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,140
anyway communicated that device to let
CPU sample databases direct access the

316
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,640
CPU

317
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,070
where you can see here are on the left
Orbea

318
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:47,360
yeah from you guys is that is what a GD
device that's akin to GTECH and it would

319
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,340
probably look like

320
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,959
anybody here believes that a device
plugs any to a computer

321
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,970
look something like that is OK you
probably should rethink your

322
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,080
yours need you your line of work

323
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,360
any other advice and some

324
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,060
we age single think looking into what
you can't identifies gtech hunters

325
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,060
it should not probably in all cases she
never be there unless you put it there

326
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,600
you can take it off and see if somebody
shows up at your door saying

327
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,659
you have something that's ours the basic
idea I can show through

328
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,770
every example of what these would look
like in every different at the

329
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,490
motherboard RouterBOARD

330
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,880
I mean board but this picture's a good
idea about how to detect it

331
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,100
measures need to figure out what's wrong
with that picture

332
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:34,370
it looks like it belongs it looks like
all the other chips

333
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:41,370
but it doesn't belong

334
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,240
let the bass eighty

335
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,820
with those yet edgy is the open up your
computers and look at them

336
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:50,090
internationally if you're not
comfortable with doing that you probably

337
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:50,970
again chin

338
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,740
on a computer be here pic kind of our
job to open up the computers and look at

339
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,480
them just say

340
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,530
I did or did not find disputed by
starting to make eight acres

341
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:05,639
the train it's like me the cookie

342
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,780
are that's the most important thing

343
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,690
and UN meeting that's what that's the
joke was

344
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:17,710
sheesh on but if you find one

345
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,220
its can effectively our jobs funny
because everybody else in the world is

346
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,340
following all these conspiracy theories
about what's going wrong in how these

347
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,600
leaks are finding all this information
in

348
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,429
so far today an interview to rate this
are so fortunate nobody has come forward

349
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,780
to say I found this device

350
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,790
plugged into my hardware albeit somebody
in china teapot BC I but a Cisco device

351
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,360
and it was

352
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,459
infected just like many years ago

353
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,510
we all complain everybody in the US is
up in arms because they were bike

354
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,030
walkway routers and they're all

355
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:51,190
infected who's in checking we don't even
know and nobody is finding these things

356
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:51,440
in

357
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,650
so far L clarify an obese come forth
with a Cisco router or anything that's

358
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,430
allegedly been infected with any

359
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:01,040
surveillance just the US is but he's
mean States things that

360
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:06,120
is that none that I see presser getting
take care before they can afford

361
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,030
that's also not a problem a dress in
stock in order

362
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:15,280
nor take any liability for so into that
somewhere

363
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:21,580
experts yes place

364
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,449
knows my locals get locked into my sons

365
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,620
suitcase weird fusing arm

366
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,760
there's a the continuing it's not my
call

367
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,960
and I'm not going to make any statements
like many other people had to say if I

368
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,880
commit suicide it was my own fault

369
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,460
gmail

370
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:45,860
suffer exploits mostly suffer exploits
are expressly

371
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:50,129
targeting see swap for a week mike was
for was felt all

372
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:54,090
defense arm I don't have minutes against
I can tell you exactly which ones they

373
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,590
were but I'm easy target things like

374
00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:00,070
hard drive firmwares and/or motherboard
firmwares

375
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:04,110
things like that with special bus
operates plate in which is what

376
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:08,139
was quite annoying is in all my review
on this I can't find any definitive way

377
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:08,650
to see

378
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,390
this is the way to know the firmware on
a physical device is been infected

379
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:16,770
aside from reflashing your device
weighty

380
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,980
if you've ever reflash devices from
where you find that it's a very slow and

381
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,980
tedious process

382
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,790
and if you only reflash the devices from
way back to BC standard defaults you

383
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,300
don't know that anything bad happen

384
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,070
when you have to do instead is make a
copy update the firmware on the device

385
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,530
which

386
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:36,190
takes time and then reflashed inane get
a copy from the manufacture that's not

387
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:36,980
been tampered with

388
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,000
do a comparison in Uniondale validate if
perhaps you're from where

389
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,500
devices yes yeah

390
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,510
we get our city do the theoretical dance
all day long

391
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,360
is this question is when it really
controlled the manufactures website

392
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,600
where you download copies

393
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,719
somewhere in an obvious now which do is
dance in the back and forth we'll never

394
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,090
know

395
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,790
then we'll never know if if they were
able to in fact a

396
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,680
major technological company in the in
the US or anywhere

397
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,260
abroad but there was in fact every
version is the firmware no point in time

398
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,560
that would be a very magnificent
operation would cost a lot of money

399
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,669
because that means that every employee
at all times ever had

400
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:18,680
chance to review the source code would
all either

401
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,110
overlook or ignore or be paid off for be

402
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:25,679
morning the air the obvious potentially
malicious

403
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,280
segment the code mind you that's not
let's ignore the fact that

404
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,059
CV easy at least every few months about
back doors that were

405
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:36,408
intentionally install the software and
software easy secure in the first place

406
00:22:36,409 --> 00:22:36,679
in

407
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:43,679
is reviewing yes yet in

408
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,439
split having certain after the process
began it as long as they have a proper

409
00:22:49,439 --> 00:22:53,439
seizing any one person inserted as a
review process heading up in there from

410
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:53,719
where

411
00:22:53,719 --> 00:22:57,379
once a person needs that access goes
away because that extra-special step

412
00:22:57,379 --> 00:23:00,438
in the peace process would be done but
again

413
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:04,369
that's persons there and even buried it
deep down the code just sit there

414
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:07,769
we've also seen things where you can say
bugs

415
00:23:07,769 --> 00:23:11,709
in open source software existed for a
very long time they'll be very

416
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:15,849
damaging to anybody who's running that
version officer suffer the head

417
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:19,639
introduced to it again

418
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:23,629
so if you're biased missionary CF card
attacks to your device

419
00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:27,428
there's refashion device is also another
system call that she p.m.

420
00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:30,439
is trashed form just platform modules

421
00:23:30,439 --> 00:23:34,549
are the directions on the laptops up as
as well as some routers

422
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:37,929
will include this device this is very
interesting device I don't have a lot of

423
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:38,669
details on it

424
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:41,889
having a look at TPM K

425
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:45,119
tickets been a long time explaining how
it works but short

426
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,938
today and trying to cover broader
subject TBM though basically

427
00:23:48,939 --> 00:23:52,459
easy trip to chip that is installed in
line in the motherboard

428
00:23:52,459 --> 00:23:56,549
and during the process the startup
process election Queen aka to chip

429
00:23:56,549 --> 00:24:00,539
KKK old systems ET the CPU the firmware

430
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:04,319
and all their validate everything bcz
md5 hashes

431
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,489
insane yet like this is this is coming
back with a cracked responses

432
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:13,039
so nothing has been modified some each
crop

433
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,459
Daniel entrance very loud

434
00:24:16,459 --> 00:24:20,269
those are picking up the air body on the
in the video recording is being heard

435
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:22,089
noises Commission said that while

436
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:25,799
take some reason dishes ur there to

437
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,809
be a TDM

438
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:32,418
the computer chip that now BC clear the
firmware

439
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:36,499
the the CPU and other hardware devices
are at a low level

440
00:24:36,499 --> 00:24:40,009
in your physical hardware and will
validate that the devices you come back

441
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:41,889
with a cracked responses to its please

442
00:24:41,889 --> 00:24:43,928
this

443
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:46,240
intentional to like a DRM system

444
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,120
potential did to detective somebody's
modified hardware educ

445
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,939
begin with x-box PlayStation modding
these are two things will exist for

446
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,020
those two each in obese fucking with the
hard work is in beta

447
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:00,160
mission be changed are you also find on
laptops

448
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,100
an FDA very few hours but there are
issues around as a no have these

449
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,840
and as long as performers up modified
this

450
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,730
this ship doesn't throw any what they
wanted me to take something has been

451
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:12,280
modified

452
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,200
chapters warning in the setup process
and you can address that is needed

453
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,010
although again its raise your hands not
up because the first thing

454
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:23,530
the first thing so many would say is
that they can just fuck with the TPM

455
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:23,899
chip

456
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,130
yes the fuck with it we meet reality a
new air

457
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,380
any series about hash responses that's
what's going on is grease

458
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,419
in the whole thing is kinda cyclical
argument

459
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:38,380
while let's just saw a TPM chip TPM chip
can see me on cell so on so forth

460
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:43,570
a partially with firmware again effect
is you can be certain TV n shit does a

461
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:44,649
great job on his own

462
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:48,230
fast in a fast job on its own you get
the check that something was

463
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:51,490
in properly reflashed on

464
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:55,549
but reflashing yourself piling up in the
firmware and as long as the manufactures

465
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:56,639
not in on the take

466
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,580
her point copier from a from them doing
comparisons

467
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,299
now email for certain if something is
happening again this talk is trying to

468
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:05,280
get people to think about

469
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:09,440
how you would address these things and
if somebody were to come forward to say

470
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:09,970
look

471
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:13,750
I just more ordered a bunch love robbers
from company X

472
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:17,100
I got them all and he said they were
from version explain X

473
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,719
ain't I can't find any firmware versions
from the corporate website actually

474
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,990
match this version

475
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:25,720
now with that story as opposed to it be

476
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:29,429
certainly what's already been reported
as as a story is

477
00:26:29,429 --> 00:26:35,440
I think this could be happening billion
briefly in the WiFi devices

478
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,470
I can I am gonna go quickly to the
section is really entertaining

479
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:41,429
results Perrone they're called nights
and he finished the year with the after

480
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:42,080
these pictures

481
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,639
next an easy appears to be a laptop and
a pelican case

482
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,730
and sparrow appears to be a wife i'd
everything

483
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:53,030
that was released in these the dish
legal thing

484
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:56,610
regarding at these these leaks about
their BCS game all leaks

485
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:01,110
everything about wifi was beamish
everything you'd ever seen

486
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:05,520
Def Con or layer 1 or any other year the
these other security conferences

487
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,090
there is nothing special about wifi
hacking in the government is simply

488
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:12,000
probably just going to the conference is
being held at Radio City doing

489
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,240
installing a

490
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,450
giving it a cool name expel nightstand
them

491
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:20,490
I don't know if a comment is played the
pickle the limit they're like

492
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:24,230
luminous install playing at pelican case
keep calling

493
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:29,570
five hundred thousand dollar project but
finishing up

494
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:33,149
categorically an cell phone bugs 18 a
check me

495
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:36,900
time probably quick community

496
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,040
cell phone bugs %ah this two sections of
them

497
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,960
there's the base station bugs which the
end various names

498
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,910
cycling crostini BSR type those are all
just

499
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,930
cell phone the station attacks which
again

500
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:56,150
like i just mentioned if you gonna be in
nineteen even following

501
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:59,630
hackers conferences in community things
we all know

502
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:03,890
be papers already been released on how
to build your own broken the station

503
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:07,120
and its all the cell phone base station
bugs doing

504
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,860
the intelligence-gathering agenesis
water which can examine these are all

505
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,360
systems NBC just follow people cell
phones and/or ABC liquor

506
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,379
a built-in cell phone with all the tools
we need to do network monitoring stuff

507
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:24,280
indeed maybe like the poem but much
bolder

508
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:29,300
all these releases from there 2006 2005
to meet much older technology

509
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,669
chemical to think that they had it at
that time by

510
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:36,500
again it's nothing that today current
technology don't absolutely have

511
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,260
with the base stations is gonna very
entertaining there are

512
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:44,220
there's one way to find out if there's a
real bass fishing in the area I

513
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,800
it all this a college program tower
Chandler Kinect our carry

514
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,879
hence finish it easily kinda being
worked on and designing for enjoyed

515
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,980
but it's a simple simple idea is that
you

516
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:59,300
go to an area you log in that area as to
what cell towers you're seeing

517
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,470
signal strength is and you come back at
a later point I'm

518
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,410
any you look in that area DC

519
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,710
but someone tells you sing in the rain
guess what there's a new cell phone

520
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,320
tower

521
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,090
you may hear me have the identification
Emerald Bay station in your area

522
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:16,639
he seem to find a certain cell phone
towers following you around

523
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,570
your validation that there is a broke
cell tower in your area

524
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:23,649
it's a simple idea there are

525
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:26,790
already programs in the injury market
and for iPhone as well

526
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:30,330
at I looked it up one of the guys who
started the injury

527
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,100
project before Google body actually
designed as one of his first programs

528
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,469
was

529
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:37,950
eight-hour a cell tower logging system

530
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,520
record recording system army some
questions that's good

531
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,180
yes begin

532
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:52,180
be ideal

533
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,730
somebody engine I'll

534
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:04,340
back I don't want to this won't work

535
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:08,800
at all just changes all the time spent

536
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,710
oh yeah

537
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,890
yet but I don't wanna is a listing is a
soft our network isn't static animals

538
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,500
around everything's kinda Radic

539
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:23,340
but kinda would one specific your e.t.a
example from to sell them I pop up even

540
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,189
if it's my neighbors

541
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:27,780
might be a false positive but I kinda
might wanna know when offenders whole

542
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:33,540
is popping up in my disunity all the
time all in all just fuel people's pain

543
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,070
I L

544
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:38,320
much more yes isn't

545
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,590
especially think the best example was
eight min explain this is somebody

546
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,570
making a result our program a team in
New

547
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:48,030
new towers come up in their their
immediate response was

548
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:51,550
what I tried on the street like back to
work and you know you're going to

549
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,520
encounter like 10 new cell toppers

550
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,180
probably just on your way to work if
unified 10 miles away on

551
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:02,350
yeah it's not foolproof it just did

552
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:07,949
up by 26 at one point in simi democrats
a picnic by bad

553
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:13,450
deeper with pictures are terrible are
still make the program when I get around

554
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:13,870
to it

555
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:17,610
just up arm

556
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:21,959
any now done ATC

557
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,520
status meter disapproval

558
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:31,210
is give me is gizzy no Busby's idea

559
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:35,600
the other stuff with that the cell to
cell attacks which were called

560
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,280
intelligence Genesis water which can %um
those things actually

561
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,590
unfortunately are really gonna be things
that you Azia

562
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,959
you know as a defense detection method
you're gonna really be able to do a lot

563
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,000
against because it's a universal device

564
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,320
that's able to communicate with your
cell devices towers in your area and

565
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:51,889
skilled

566
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:56,120
pulled it off the towers soul cellular
networks a really good

567
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,189
example to stop to explain to you that

568
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:04,110
the basis idea dead you are using its
third party service

569
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:08,060
tea for communications or details the
you need to remind yourself that

570
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,169
third-party service Kennedy Mweene time

571
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,700
these experts in the US be subpoenaed
more there have a warrant out

572
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,820
for if you have one of the information
they can be subpoenaed for the data

573
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,330
regarding

574
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:20,710
yourself network calls this is an image
cellular networks

575
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:24,070
your Facebook status is your email your

576
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,210
et cetera and so forth your even your
private

577
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:32,070
DPS that you buy from whatever company
that sells media services that company

578
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,500
themselves can be subpoenaed

579
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:38,330
and they can install system that bull
will be obliged by the courts to install

580
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,050
system to monitor your traffic

581
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:43,450
and remember that when there is an
exception

582
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:48,090
other third-party between UN whatever
this the radical surveillance d

583
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:51,730
is you have pretty much no control over
what that their party does

584
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:56,600
there something call they get warned
canaries things like that with me tell

585
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,879
you every day there is not

586
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,920
want up for your arrest there's nothing
hunt requesting information about she

587
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,920
there's not a wind

588
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,300
namely don't send anymore you're shit
%uh

589
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,870
the system's really in practice nobody's

590
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:13,000
awareness explicitly using them in or
with somebody

591
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Norwood I feel comfortable going to an
iced tea or if I were the a speed

592
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,470
somebody's like he can you tell me if
there is a reason Lake

593
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:22,620
can you tell me every day there there is
not one to miss the reason and you

594
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,439
cannot tell me make movies action at
work at the deal because it's

595
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,379
financially not feasible so that's the
problem

596
00:33:31,379 --> 00:33:34,789
%ah and also so yeah because that
third-party argument

597
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:38,490
because she more than likely everything
everybody in this room is done

598
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:42,480
probably requires a third-party for
communications to to be finalised

599
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,789
to be terminated with the second party
are

600
00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:50,090
you number of second all times
mississippi make my slide for haptic

601
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:54,789
top sec for anybody's genuinely
concerned about these things I agree

602
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:57,299
with all the promises a operational
security

603
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:02,600
but up the enough into the stock because
this talk is about detecting

604
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,730
not take millions about very much not be

605
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:08,819
detected which is good for the use
end-users

606
00:34:08,819 --> 00:34:12,489
for those who concerned about being
spied upon those who can certainly be

607
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:13,270
doing this fine

608
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:16,399
if you're concerned if you're being
spied upon different argument and

609
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:17,759
nationally with the ideas uses

610
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,770
validating to show for everybody as
opposed to giving

611
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:27,139
the left journalism maybe some
conclusions for the stock

612
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:31,280
is a enjoy the thought experiment in the
discussion that these

613
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,740
me sees that all these leaks that have
come up this last year

614
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:39,689
have a brought up focusing on the ages
Hosley

615
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:43,540
enjoy all the facts ma'am in the
decision that he brought up it's been a

616
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,489
great year for

617
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:49,859
for those people that are concerned
about privacy as a policy that bugs

618
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:53,190
is the bugs are detectable and if
something is physically detectable

619
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:57,109
it is the you can write about it eating
give a journalistic are

620
00:34:57,109 --> 00:35:00,480
like a journalist originals write an
article get released

621
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,980
because that's much more evidence than
here see

622
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:08,859
when I feels perhaps I'd gone to
conferences for last 10 years and I can

623
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:11,569
talk about some stuff that I saw this
guy gives the radical talk on

624
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:14,810
I'm just gonna say some surveillance it
is doing its lot less

625
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,930
defining gives an experiment getting

626
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:21,750
discussions lot less impactful than when
some she comes up and says

627
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:24,900
have this is good advice was yummy this
but this blows

628
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:31,900
yes

629
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,359
perhaps

630
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,650
Adam

631
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:45,060
Kingdom nor my label for a meeting 50
Kenya

632
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,190
illegal actions and/or to me forward
this means

633
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,730
I will state though that historically
last in usurping the

634
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:55,660
everybody likes to say there's been more
whistleblowers imprisoned in the last

635
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,270
ten years

636
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:59,310
by a certain the US government

637
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:03,000
administration but also remember that
majority of those whistleblowers

638
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,970
actually don't survive very long
sentence

639
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:10,709
especially in income when you compare to
the last 20 years I've CFAA violations

640
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,840
where people are going to yessir many
many years

641
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,010
the majority the whistleblowers we go to
jail for

642
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:21,900
couple years water geez which you can
choose you can go to jail for two years

643
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:26,100
or you can go to other countries which
are recaps enemies the

644
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:33,100
who s for indefinite periods of time
there's am

645
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,119
there's definite yeah is recursive
leaking information

646
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:45,300
there's whole entirety argument

647
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,950
argument there but as long as you're not
aware this difference between the

648
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:52,990
information to you you work thank you
many

649
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:56,020
it snowed in just needed lease today

650
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:59,980
powerpoints whatever mall bullshit as
opposed to

651
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:03,080
releasing it easy I just found this
device

652
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,350
I did not know it was associated with
any specific government organizations

653
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:07,339
just Energy's

654
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:11,230
the fuck is going on perhaps I was being
spied upon by for all I know

655
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:16,070
Chinese the Russians yugoslavians no
cambodians the Canes

656
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:20,320
419 scams which really trying again to
my email you don't know

657
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,170
if you just licensing just device eating
the corporatist

658
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:29,210
if work to be easy well as my worry

659
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:33,150
its competitor and that's different than
whistleblowing you

660
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,530
being involved see teamster by

661
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:42,850
lady trust do you wear to question for
you

662
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:49,850
it

663
00:37:56,789 --> 00:38:00,079
that would be the argument for
operational the a city cannot effect

664
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,759
account detector defending SEC Nexus
mean to you live within

665
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:06,769
I'll I'll give you the bread say each
developed

666
00:38:06,769 --> 00:38:10,319
technologically developed nations have a
its

667
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:14,910
US if the US its Russian its chain a
whirl technology developed a very much

668
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:18,420
/strong canceled infrastructure you're
under their their control

669
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:22,519
this is alluding to man to talk about
history privacy

670
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:26,470
where I'm not trying to draw any direct
connections but

671
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,709
technically in 1770 Z was a big deal
when

672
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:33,990
the main form of communication was p
easily

673
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:37,169
a wiretap bull effectively wiretapped

674
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:43,089
back again and mail sent between the US
colonies was being routed through London

675
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:43,549
for New

676
00:38:43,549 --> 00:38:47,079
clear reason except for while obviously
what was happening

677
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:50,759
when they found out it turns out the one
other regional amendments

678
00:38:50,759 --> 00:38:54,309
hits should I don't know it in the
tainted twenties

679
00:38:54,309 --> 00:38:58,130
anonymity 14th or 16th amendment was the
man regarding federal

680
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:01,910
is a federal crime tip with somebody's
me that's why that actually exists that

681
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:02,730

resources does a lot of Kansas remorse

687
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,039
plus open source hardware

688
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:27,819
actually sorry a solid answers hardware

689
00:39:27,819 --> 00:39:31,308

695
00:39:49,779 --> 00:39:54,710
actually the whole the most definitive
source for the SkyMall leaks I found

696
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:57,789
again it seems like most lethal
referencing

697
00:39:57,789 --> 00:39:59,779
their leak but Neil

698
00:39:59,779 --> 00:40:02,940
determination issue with the fortunate
the source those leaks from

699
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,480
which intelligence agency which source
came from from their own

700
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,650
suspect Detection woodson bullshit state
