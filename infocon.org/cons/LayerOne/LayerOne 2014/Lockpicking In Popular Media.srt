1
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:03,099
you're awake

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:10,100
the surprise for us actually today
appears to be Sunday

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:15,509
I'm not have had a reliable source that
so

4
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,490
did you guys have a good time at the
party last night our cat that's good

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,639
that's good so today we got a lot more
stuff for you I

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,340
if you're in the capture the flag or DFS
cation contests

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,269
those are both going on the schedule
says the end at 2 p.m.

8
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:34,680
I am but I think we might extend the
hours until 4 p.m. or so

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,680
so I just ask about in the contest

10
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,750
points be nothing happens

11
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,340
it does it open and that's phenomenal

12
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:22,620
she then gets cock hot by the killer who
turns out to be her lover

13
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,790
and she stands the client as he makes it
clear that

14
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,560
though he loves are you will murder and
she speaks truth rate to his damn face

15
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,540
anyway

16
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,700
all this is mostly to say the murder
sure it was a much better show than you

17
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,548
remember and you should give it another
chance

18
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:42,019
but this is also an illustration a
couple my favorite things about

19
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:44,890
lockpicking in film television books
games at center

20
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,980
that it can be a real tension driver you
can actually contribute to the story

21
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,910
what's happening

22
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,940
one of the easiest ways to get things
right

23
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,730
when you're picking locks is to have it
fail cuz

24
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,670
think about all the times you tried to
pick a lock if you figure out the

25
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:06,059
hides more often it probably hasn't
worked and that can be great for a story

26
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,620
you can get cut by your ex-lover

27
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,220
which could be parsed incorrectly be you
know what I mean

28
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,319
so and Skyler town I've been thinking
about all the service %uh for quite a

29
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:16,839
while

30
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,180
I've been picking locks her about eight
years

31
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,769
I am and I started thinking about
lockpicking in film and television and

32
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:25,579
then eventually

33
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:29,859
certain lock/unlock pickings role in
society as a whole

34
00:03:29,859 --> 00:03:32,959
anamensis them about security technology
and on and on my mom

35
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,430
I'm if you had a dot com to the end of
my name you can actually find out about

36
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,049
my research project some

37
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:41,750
vessel Technol today lockpicking popular
media is one of the big three them

38
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,160
trying to tackle for this year

39
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,680
the other two you are I am redefining
the origin of the lock proposing a new

40
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,510
theory for how the lock entered the
world in the first place

41
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,660
I'm the research is done some to
strengthen that together in a published

42
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,660
and the Allentown collection is an
incredible collection

43
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,760
blocks maybe the most important
collection blocks ever assembled

44
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,099
those held by the Allentown company and
thrown away

45
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:06,230
in the late fifties I'm thankfully

46
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,470
I had two thirds vote went into private
hands 30 but went into public hands and

47
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,079
another and one of the previous thirds
was recently

48
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,780
donated to museums I'm working with
sweet recommend and tell your story that

49
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,640
but

50
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,760
I am those two research projects are
what we would call loss leaders in the

51
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,500
retail trade those cast me a lot of
money and I'm not getting paid to do

52
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:25,900
them

53
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,320
however if I can get somebody in film
television to hire me to tell them all

54
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,900
sorts cool things Melaka decade from the
other projects so

55
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,870
I've been thinking about this in dept
Lee I'm

56
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,010
hear some of the reasons I'm second just
yelling about this on Twitter

57
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,539
I i'm sick after eating things to
different shows

58
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,650
thats really an effective in its just me
complaining as most and that's all it's

59
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,510
never productive

60
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,120
is never productive just me being a dick
I

61
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,070
additionally I think they actually have
some legitimate in saying that how to

62
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,880
communicate

63
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,040
be ideas and lock picking I am in some
the storytelling elements in film

64
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,890
television

65
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:05,099
cetera my only formal education after
high school was at a theatre

66
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,090
conservatory

67
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,510
I wasn't Roman television for a while
lotta stage staff

68
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:15,150
I am and so you can just roll in and say
get it right

69
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,750
after all and say here's some strategies
to make it look correct

70
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,950
that don't break your budget and still a
liar actors toward the world la

71
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:27,510
some I think I can actually genuinely
translate these ideas to that audience

72
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,240
very well

73
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,260
and finally and I

74
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,420
this is very genuine I believe the
portrayals security in film

75
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,090
TV box center have a deleterious effect
on securing our culture

76
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,190
at the very least security perception

77
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,710
culture sir it all started Dexter

78
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:52,060
I am as watching Dexter and recognition
a lot of people I was just watching on

79
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,670
Netflix as a couple seasons

80
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:57,510
I late to the party and by

81
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:01,789
the second episode I was already
tweeting at the

82
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:06,169
producers so this missus right from the
opening credits and there's a couple

83
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:08,650
things wrong with us but the most
important thing that i think is wrong

84
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,960
with it that if your gonna go

85
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,150
wave you know kind of brand X lock the
Defiant that's on his door

86
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,810
why would you go with the Dexter lock
for Dexter

87
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,800
Kaman its brand its India

88
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,250
next exactly I I am

89
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,889
so also just look at the bidding on acix

90
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,020
that incredibly flat betting this is
gonna come up again in a second but

91
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,900
that's it shitty

92
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,628
just all-around terrible lock okay so I
hear

93
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:40,400
higher of a just a few of the things
that I noticed about Dexter before I

94
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,948
actually stopped watching it because I
was going crazy

95
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:48,979
this is really important because the
sets the stage for the reason that upset

96
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:49,699
me for the rest

97
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:52,599
the thing I love the time we see people
doing dumb things locks in film and

98
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:53,279
television

99
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,639
they're not supposed to be experts but
Dexter particular threat the first

100
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,250
season

101
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,009
so it's like picking locks and talking
locks and acting like he knows all sorts

102
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:02,039
cabinet locks

103
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:06,229
the basic premise is that he's a pretty
good luck figuring his fire from

104
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:09,990
a like master lock picker but he knows
his way around stuffy nose what sort of

105
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,440
oxygen in choosing

106
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,729
so at one point I'm needs to pick into
the evidence locker

107
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:18,750
and when he roles any realizes its

108
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:23,550
to shitty deadbolts on top of one
another and that is way beyond his skill

109
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,460
level right now

110
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:29,080
I am sir the first batter went crazy I
went crazy when I

111
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,339
that anyway I am and at this is a dish
to terrible spoiler but

112
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:37,400
yeah I am

113
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,940
the Ice Truck Killer who i think is the
main killer in the first season however

114
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,580
the turns out to be his brother

115
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,990
something like that thank you I am picks
his way into Dexter's house in fines is

116
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,500
little slides blood on them or whatever

117
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,560
and Dexter is stunned

118
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,560
stunned that this man was able to pick
into his house

119
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,109
I think that was literally the opposite
I stopped watching a

120
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:09,089
I am anyway sup

121
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:12,669
by I think said just

122
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:17,289
never stopped being angry I am a few
months later though

123
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:20,929
as I begin watching other shows I and
realize it's just

124
00:08:20,929 --> 00:08:24,299
everywhere and and somehow I just hadn't
really been paying attention until

125
00:08:24,299 --> 00:08:25,619
Dexter can invade

126
00:08:25,619 --> 00:08:29,219
a jarred my brain about it I just
started keeping a list

127
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:32,409
I this is my Criminal Minds lock
slip-ups dot txt

128
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:36,328
I am handbags the Criminal Minds Burn
Notice

129
00:08:36,328 --> 00:08:39,399
the there's so am i five elements for
other people

130
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:43,860
I and size are keeping this list myself
and I had a bunch of different exiles in

131
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,230
a much different computers anytime
there's watching something

132
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,339
I would take note of what was going on
I'm eventually realized I could crash

133
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:53,949
there is this a little bit so I just
only do the survey that if you would

134
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:55,180
like to you can bookmark

135
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,519
so anytime you're streaming something
you see something happening with locks

136
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:01,959
accurate or inaccurate you can record it
for me I

137
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:06,910
it is at Lock dot GD slash am I'm like
to Jesus my URL shortener

138
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,059
I and we've had many fine contributions
to

139
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:14,469
vs survey so thank you all I look
forward to more in such time

140
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,449
contributions and

141
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:22,949
I'm okay so here's some things that you
can look out for just right off the bat

142
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:24,609
if it's a pin tumbler lock

143
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,829
do they have to tools do they have the
tension wrench and the pack

144
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:33,050
very frequently they do not I am if you
want to go a step further

145
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,199
no matter how many tools they have

146
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:39,269
does the plug turn does the lock

147
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:44,439
operate with the pics the same way you
would expect a lock to operate with the

148
00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:45,029
key

149
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:48,790
and this is going to start driving you
nuts now that I'm trying attention to it

150
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:54,079
but anytime almost you anytime you see a
lock picked in television film et cetera

151
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:58,849
just think about how the lock would have
behaved if you would opened it with the

152
00:09:58,850 --> 00:09:59,439
key

153
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:03,000
the plug would have rotated a bolt would
have moved

154
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,339
something would have happened you would
have just jammed a couple of pics N

155
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,529
ready

156
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:10,850
to them and then opened the door that

157
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:16,860
its us this isn't gonna be a good talks
and is gonna keep getting myself madame

158
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,730
and and racing I'm and finally does it
just seems like magic

159
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,470
I there are a couple have terrible
examples in this a lot a lot of the time

160
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,879
some wheels lock up to something put
some random 2on2 take it out and then

161
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:29,680
the door opens

162
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,388
I so if it doesn't seem like there's any
mechanical way in which this could have

163
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:34,410
been successful

164
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:39,449
it probably wasn't alright so there are
good examples there bad examples they're

165
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:40,800
ugly examples to

166
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,410
borrow from the classic film I am Burn
Notice

167
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:49,860
when they're focusing on a lock when
they're using a lock for one of their

168
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,230
I am like cutaway deep explanations have
a concept

169
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,569
actually do a nice job they also have
some

170
00:10:56,569 --> 00:11:01,748
the worst lock lingo any show that you
ever watch just the most ridiculous

171
00:11:01,749 --> 00:11:02,660
terms

172
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,360
the you've ever heard that have nothing
to do with blocks in the talking about

173
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,009
them but when they're focused on them

174
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:10,720
they do a good job in particular the
episode where they deal with pumping

175
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,899
was excellent so I am

176
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:18,439
what's the main character's name Michael
Michael walks into

177
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:21,889
this Safa silly that he needs to have
deeper access to

178
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:25,720
I'm he manages to borrow a key from the
bathroom

179
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,750
from the secretary have some woman that
he needs to

180
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,430
I don't know bring to justice cell

181
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,620
he gets the bathroom key and this is
great beginning the bathroom key

182
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,809
he now has the key way that he needs he
knows what he needs to build is bulky of

183
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:46,569
so this is just clever on the face of it
and the right way to go about this

184
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:50,069
I am when he gets the scheme there are
several things that he could have done

185
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:52,059
but he just walks and a building that
occurs when a

186
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:57,689
vs even goes through the whole process
and explaining with slightly silly

187
00:11:57,689 --> 00:11:59,500
language but still fairly accurate

188
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,600
the and the process of making a bomb key
but this moment here

189
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,850
on-screen is phenomenal

190
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:11,029
especially because it never comes up in
the narration

191
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:15,509
they're just getting it right so what
you see here

192
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:18,929
is the key that he's took for the
bathroom

193
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:20,329
stacked

194
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:23,609
on top of a blankie he is then

195
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:28,699
marking the spacing with a Sharpie so
that he gets the spacing

196
00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:33,359
exactly rate when he hand files the ski
and even to some people are telling you

197
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,259
about bumping

198
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:37,369
that doesn't even really come up much
and it doesn't come up in the nation

199
00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:40,699
but that is such an important step
because if you're spacing is off

200
00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:44,540
you don't interact with every pin at the
same time and then pumping it is

201
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,299
essential

202
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:49,309
the you collide with every pin it wants
so the spacing is super important

203
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:52,738
and they're just sitting here silently
on camera

204
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:56,939
getting it ready and that made me so
happy

205
00:12:56,939 --> 00:13:02,259
and then you know they go through a test
run a bit with a lock for that is built

206
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:02,899
himself

207
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:06,069
and finally and course works on the door
itself and you can seize even

208
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:09,170
using a bump am I here and additionally

209
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,299
in his workshop I should have grabbed a
freemen this when he does the test uses

210
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:15,360
the heel laverne a shoe

211
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,790
which is something that a lot of people
max world so you can use pump amor

212
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,420
I'm so it's just really nice the whole
way around somebody really did their

213
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,059
research

214
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:26,350
and they made sure that not just in the
script but in the shooting a in the

215
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:26,839
Framingham

216
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,419
in the editing a bit they got everything
that was important is just beautifully

217
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:30,819
done

218
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:34,410
okay sup the back I am

219
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,649
and high five is a great shows called
spokesman is over in England

220
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:41,279
I actually like it a lot especially
because they're just completely cavalier

221
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,959
about killing of people that you watch

222
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,419
which is a great quality initial arm

223
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:50,040
however the frequently resort to magic

224
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,759
as is the case with their really cool
steampunk looking

225
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:59,899
electric pick gun I am so the guy slides
the needle in

226
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:04,569
below the lowest ward so it's not
actually interacting with any 10

227
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:07,819
its gets at Mason flush in that same
position

228
00:14:07,819 --> 00:14:12,479
puts his thumb on what the frame before
it just looks like

229
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,499
I don't know that anyway disperses them
down

230
00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:20,709
and you just way too many here like

231
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:22,258
campaign you here

232
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:26,029
the most ridiculous I

233
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:30,620
sound avail Oct being violently opened
by a key

234
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,600
a bowl to being thrown very very hard
but the plug never turns he just pulls

235
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,490
the thing out

236
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:40,449
he doesn't even turn a knob in the end
he just puts his shoulder into the door

237
00:14:40,449 --> 00:14:41,680
impressions open

238
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,099
I am such pure magic they are constantly
and this is a

239
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,269
they're constantly picking lever locks

240
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:53,579
with pin tumbler tools just jamming a
couple have like half diamonds in a

241
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:56,540
lever lock and then again like
shouldering a door open

242
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,740
give a lecture stores don't even work
correctly such sorry

243
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:06,589
some and then just the very bad some
munchies I wrote about this irate about

244
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:08,240
some of the stuff sometimes at

245
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,470
TV picking decor I dot com which I
pressure to put up some

246
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,470
I'm but I i wrote one about mister monks

247
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:20,000
ruining my night so he and his cohorts
get trapped inside a ver

248
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,139
vaults at a local bank I'm he had gone
there because the place had been dropped

249
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:25,810
and he was very concerned

250
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:30,699
because in a safe deposit box at this
bank was the last piece of jewelry that

251
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:32,920
he had firm is dead murdered wife

252
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,439
this diamond bracelet you cared a lot
about it see want to contribute services

253
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:40,219
of course he is going to friends get
trapped inside the vault

254
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,899
and hilarity and ensues band that being
in there for i think im the time line at

255
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:47,329
the episode about two days

256
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:53,650
all because if this lock

257
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,910
yeah cell

258
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:01,360
this lock was on what looks from the
outside like a breaker panel

259
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,910
that they think might have some sort of
emergency phone in it or something or

260
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,250
some means of communicating with the
outside world

261
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,920
cell they spend two days shooting at

262
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,569
staring at it and then just flopping
around in desperation because there's no

263
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,520
way to open the super high security lock

264
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,480
now so enraged was i'd

265
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,650
that I went out and and purchased one of
these various like

266
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,990
this exact one so that I can Vincent
their

267
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,220
watching the episode again just trying
every combination

268
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,240
now all admit that I didn't get it done
before the end of the episode

269
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,480
but I got through every possible
combination will in

270
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,450
two and a half hours which wasn't even
super fast on my part but they're in

271
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,460
there for two

272
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:48,140
days and here's the horrible part here's
the part that is really tragic

273
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:52,020
a lot of the the thruster mongers

274
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,400
him trying to let go his horribly
murdered waves that he's on a life quest

275
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,220
to Lake abandon find the killer

276
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:02,270
so I feel you should tell that guy to
let that go just

277
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:06,260
that's great chill that man anyway I am

278
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:13,260
the user diamond bracelet to saw through
it

279
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:18,948
works straight and isn't tragic and
horrific im really sad

280
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:22,909
at all so that was terrible somehow I'm
watched I love monk anyway them

281
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:26,880
I am alright so I does any of this
matter okay so under showing examples in

282
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,850
complaining and talk about how you can
do things get negative things bad fine

283
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:34,178
I'm presence in the program I wanna go a
little bit beyond that I actually think

284
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,980
that this does matter I really do
believe this contributes to

285
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,960
security thinking as a whole I am in an
episode

286
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,570
a the closer which is another show that
actually quite a bit

287
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,789
I Brenda Leigh Johnson is picking into
some door like she frequently is

288
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:53,110
she usually has ample stools correct
which is great actually okay with most

289
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:57,260
they're picking in the show the few
times that it's come up when I'm not OK

290
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,500
with whatsoever though

291
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,230
is that in this episode I believe it was
the second episode of the sexes and she

292
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,299
picks into the store

293
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:06,649
and then later in the same episode

294
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:13,649
when investigating a crime scene says

295
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,770
cell she had just picked the lock

296
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:22,110
then went to some sort of murder scene
and said

297
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:27,040
well no signs of forced entry no other
possibility but that they knew their

298
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,730
attacker

299
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,570
which is after up and here's the thing
right

300
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,210
this really does permeate this idea that

301
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,630
nobody picks locks for crime

302
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,980
completely permeates people in this room

303
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,059
many %uh view have probably thought this
yourself

304
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:50,480
the fact is in america we don't
investigate the lock

305
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,600
we don't look for two UL mark analysis
so many cops know how to pick locks

306
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,270
not have them bring the locks to their
forensic department staff a look at I am

307
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:04,330
friendly with I masti troopers in the
friends X lab for

308
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:08,949
many many years in his many many years
he was never once brought a lock

309
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:13,080
to investigate never once we just don't
do it

310
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,090
and when we have on TV

311
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:19,860
in every friggin procedural someone
saying oh no signs of forced entry must

312
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,240
turn on the attacker with you you're
constantly

313
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,419
when it's when every procedural the gets
into the ridiculous nitty-gritty

314
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:29,350
forensics and forensic bullshit

315
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:33,980
various biological forensics and and
every other thing

316
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,460
when did you ever seen a lock analyzed

317
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,230
on a procedural crime show and therefore

318
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:46,610
we as a culture can't imagine that this
would happen

319
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:51,070
the number provide the number friends ex
tax:

320
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:55,389
who can tell a story about oh you know I
was involved in some sort of crime scene

321
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,500
in the persons are looking into CSI this

322
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,820
because the nature of the crime nobody
says that about locks

323
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,530
on their place is broken into they don't
say all came just from my lock down your

324
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,160
crime lab investigated because they
don't know the lock forensics is

325
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,140
possible well

326
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,399
this handsome gentlemen

327
00:20:11,399 --> 00:20:13,658
will tell you the most definitely is I'm

328
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:16,820
possible if you don't know datagram runs
lockpicking friends ex ta common it's a

329
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,559
phenomenal say and he chose

330
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,059
amazing work I'm providing open
information

331
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:26,190
about tool mark analysis related to
locks

332
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:33,140
some 30 all my complaining over many
years actually started to have some

333
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:38,440
opportunities to interact with media
people producing media various forms

334
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,200
I'm a very first introduction to it was
at the Sisters in Crime conference which

335
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,289
is this phenomenal collection

336
00:20:44,289 --> 00:20:50,379
I love I am I female crime novelist may
have some brothers in crime team is

337
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,100
mostly women

338
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,709
crime novelist to get together in New
England every year for their out their

339
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,620
crime bake

340
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:00,110
I am and I got to go there to talk to
'em actually about forensic spaced

341
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:01,678
entirely on datagrams work

342
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,070
and the way that it was structures that
I would explain an entry concept

343
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,918
and then would cover the forensics left
behind by that entry and this kind of

344
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:09,710
people

345
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,559
were enthralled with this and had really
been exposed to the idea to market

346
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:17,559
else blocks before and then afterwards I
had phenomenal conversations

347
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:21,370
many of the authors might now have the
opportunity to consult on a small

348
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,379
handful a very

349
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,090
well-received books so this was the
first time that I had

350
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:31,610
the opportunity to inject some sense

351
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:35,559
into any sort medium and was incredibly
exciting

352
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:39,820
I'm not long after this by chance again
I want up on a TV show on History

353
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,389
Channel

354
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:44,010
picking some watch them attacking the
maalox and I spent four days on set with

355
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:44,379
them

356
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,779
acquiring prepping consulting I'm
preparing

357
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:52,639
safes and I pin tumbler locks show
called sliced

358
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:56,678
it isn't on the air it is a mere I am

359
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:00,019
but the whole idea was the cuttings
apartment inside of them

360
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:04,240
is going to call a tip but it was mostly
a show about their incredible cutting

361
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,480
tools provided by the sponsor Husqvarna

362
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,659
and they were crazy like amazing sauce
I'm so they would slice a safe in half

363
00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:13,240
and say I'll look at this thing look at
this thing look at this thing I think

364
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,130
that's how it works

365
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,860
so I was the guy in the back for
prepping all the things to be cut

366
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,678
I'm picking up the locks appropriately
so that they would open when they needed

367
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:22,430
to

368
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:26,180
I N and doing all in this staging in
this is my first introduction to the

369
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,190
idea that we could

370
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,760
get things right by staging the properly
ahead of time by explaining the core

371
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,800
concepts to the

372
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,470
the camera crew producers I didn't do a
great job a bit but I spent a ton of

373
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,420
time with them completely for free

374
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:42,570
and then in the end here's the animation
they provided for america lock okay

375
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:45,810
I know this clearly isn't animation
Minister stole from Adam gonna talk you

376
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,750
through it a little bit I'm

377
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:51,800
alright so sheer is

378
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,870
roughly a sheer lie I'm okay this is
what they're calling the unlocked

379
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,919
position for several in these pants

380
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,380
where the keepin' is still clearly
blocking the shear wind's

381
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:07,490
that's impossible every single driver
been in this lock is a mushroom him

382
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,550
which would add Thomas lock to lock in
at least one

383
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,710
fairly solid early serrated Penn in
order not to completely f-ed up

384
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:17,840
additionally arm vote pins are being set

385
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,860
into their proper position wall the key
is still being inserted

386
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,750
the way that the animated this was as
soon as the key enters the lock to the

387
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,840
first position

388
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,629
the first pin is set and never moves
again which isn't how

389
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,830
locks keys work and the second one so on
and so forth

390
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:40,730
and anyway it was just the horrible I
spent half a day with their animators

391
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:44,510
working through this stuff and this is
still what

392
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:49,540
went to am print it's very frustrating
as actual teaching class at Ohlone

393
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,260
College

394
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,000
after a semester while back and I use
this animation other animation put

395
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,520
together

396
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,690
as a tester the classic to pick apart
for me worked very well

397
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:02,970
for that I recently did nothing for
Najia that I think might be a lot better

398
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:06,390
we'll see I am and I also along the way

399
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:09,840
had the opportunity to speak to a lot of
game designers

400
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,770
which is very exciting I don't have a
ton on this right now but my main

401
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:13,620
headlines

402
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,659
games Angry bada hai o for making game
called cracked all about safe cracking

403
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,880
and picking locks

404
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,160
high school setting I'm really fun great
art great group of people

405
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,500
on DeLonghi workshop with them

406
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,500
just again for free because I wanted
more of the stuff to

407
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,679
to be out there in the world beginning
right my main headline about games I

408
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,500
don't have a ton more on this last
attack my main headline ills

409
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,260
whether or not there's a lot of accuracy
built-in bear missing

410
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:44,379
so many incredible game mechanics if any
have you have picked locks in

411
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,720
any sort of competition setting if
you've seen what TV in all I'm has done

412
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,250
with his incredibly like fan-friendly

413
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,549
I I'll bring a warrior or

414
00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:55,969
I

415
00:24:55,969 --> 00:24:59,259
he's got another one out I remember the
name I've lock was it

416
00:24:59,259 --> 00:25:02,429
black bag yeah I just

417
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:06,289
incredible events the bring in all sorts
of different mechanisms in different

418
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:07,319
methods Ventre

419
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:11,168
they're being completely overlooked by
the game industry I'm and these could be

420
00:25:11,169 --> 00:25:14,509
great things I mean do just for a very
quick example

421
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:18,049
I most of you probably know soda can
shinning beer can shipping you cut a

422
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,639
small shape at a soda can

423
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:23,569
and you can just like credit card and
adore you can slip the latch back on a

424
00:25:23,569 --> 00:25:24,229
padlock

425
00:25:24,229 --> 00:25:27,929
imagine if you were in a game and you
literally had to try and a soda can and

426
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:28,829
you just had to make

427
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:32,239
fairly accurate shape and I helped yet
with the mechanics citing an inch

428
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,559
but literally just these like little
puzzle piece situations to get through

429
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:36,168
something

430
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:42,879
there's so much sinking in the style a
video game for a lock picker already

431
00:25:42,879 --> 00:25:47,039
especially when you come to the that DIY
non destructive entry stuff

432
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,089
that has been completely overlooked by
video games right now and I think could

433
00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:50,819
be awesome

434
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:56,009
ok the one other big things that I
realized as I got to

435
00:25:56,009 --> 00:25:59,009
I'm contribute a little bit TV a lot to
books

436
00:25:59,009 --> 00:26:02,379
I and hear their with with game design
stuff

437
00:26:02,379 --> 00:26:06,539
was that these moments in popular media
on a walk

438
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:10,879
or lockpicking it's deeply involved can
actually genuinely contribute to the

439
00:26:10,879 --> 00:26:12,269
stories being told

440
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:16,159
couple in great examples so

441
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,579
sneakers phenomenal movie my favorite
scene in sneakers

442
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:24,329
even before I learned how to pick a lock
was when Robert Redford

443
00:26:24,329 --> 00:26:27,879
is walking up to the door I love the

444
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:30,998
I A the name of the company you

445
00:26:30,999 --> 00:26:35,859
thank you on so he's walking up in the
actually pulls out appropriate tools

446
00:26:35,859 --> 00:26:36,859
they're locked tracks

447
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:40,119
and you see this look on his face when
he sees it

448
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:43,658
and it turns out that in front of him as
a keypad lock

449
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:48,649
digital lock his pics are going to work
and so he and his earpiece is talking to

450
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,139
mother's back in the van

451
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:54,668
dan Aykroyd doing an amazing job I'm
using its key padlock you give them

452
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:58,159
whatever information you can mothers
just like tearing through manuals like

453
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,069
ripping like going crazy trying to find
some bits of information that he can

454
00:27:02,069 --> 00:27:02,489
offer

455
00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:07,239
tell me get through this lock in the
immediate and they go back for this

456
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:08,170
reference going

457
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:12,180
okay alright with a trident right

458
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:19,180
it's worth a shot I don't have the last
three weekends the door in

459
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:23,430
I'll I was the worst make its the door
in

460
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:27,940
and it's amazing in this whole situation
with it isn't just this great little

461
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,330
comedic moments

462
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:33,669
it's demonstrating the the nature love

463
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:37,400
rapid change in pen testing up having
somebody in the banner on the phone or

464
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:37,820
whatever

465
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:42,090
I once in my life thinks the datagram in
JK got to be the guy on the other end of

466
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:42,629
the phone

467
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:46,220
I and i got to pretend that I was mother
and contribute almost nothing to what

468
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:46,830
they were doing

469
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:50,060
I'm but it was still a lot of fun I am a
and

470
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:54,260
it's just this it's a phenomenal moment
that speaks to so much more than a

471
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,480
little bit of comedy that is that has
drawn out a bit and its

472
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,720
its ice us so many have you as soon as
you say Robert Redford with the pic I

473
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,130
hope to see yet and it's it's great it's
a great but if story

474
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:12,210
so another one of my favorites in a
certain goes back to the jessica

475
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,000
fletcher model

476
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,100
I is in the show rescue me it's not a
great show I am

477
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:21,649
this guy's eminent member right now
trying to get into his ex-wife's house

478
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:25,930
I think to retrieve the watch that
belonged to his father some to this

479
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:26,430
effect

480
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:30,670
just needs to get something out there is
no longer as a key to it however he does

481
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:31,320
have

482
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,780
somewhat packs and just his manner with
the lock picks to begin with make it

483
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,820
very clear that this is very new to him
this is all done in silence

484
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,970
believes like open saying he doesn't
really know what's going on inside a bit

485
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,680
but it takes at a couple of tools any
any starts going to work on the lock

486
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,800
and nothing happens and then when he
pulls his hands away from those %uh view

487
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,790
he'd pick locks you know anything about
them there's this wonderful little

488
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:54,100
moment for you

489
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:58,310
we realize he's been working on a lever
lock the whole time but on my game I

490
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,870
five it's not successful

491
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:06,419
he still gets N

492
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:12,110
oh wait no he doesn't an ass he's
standing there bleeding having just

493
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,540
broken the glass

494
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:17,200
he looks around realizes he's in broad
daylight

495
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,540
and their people not too far away is on
the side of the house but still this is

496
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,899
like a suburban neighborhood

497
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,690
any walks off and in subsequent scenes
as hand is bandaged

498
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:31,170
he's demoralize like the the fact that
this window has been broken comes back

499
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,370
in movies like this is just such a good

500
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:38,840
and it's all all in silence but it is
such an impactful

501
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,909
moment in this character's whole

502
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,980
arc this interaction with us like

503
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:50,210
beautiful doesn't just have to be

504
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:53,250
Eddie Murphy standing at the gate rush

505
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:58,710
not rush hour 2 a Beverly Hills Cop 2
pop unlock openly zappa some blame

506
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,850
I was a terrible for LeSean horrible
acting alright

507
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:06,020
I have any beer at the Great Brain books
I know 207 the bottom screams this is

508
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,639
the great brain at the academy

509
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:12,240
great brain at the Academy is a great
book the brain box in general or a great

510
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:12,680
book

511
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,310
i many years after I learned had a pic I
suddenly had a memory

512
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:19,810
but I'm pretty sure that great brington
something crazy walks on point and i

513
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:20,980
cant remember what it was

514
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:24,970
by means to find additional copy of this
and what he carries out is this

515
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,830
incredible wax Pat attack

516
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:30,340
my in my life have been dreaming of
carrying out a wax that acting reel

517
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:30,939
explain it

518
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,290
i'm for many many years I in fact have
written some

519
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:37,510
entirely ridiculous lock fiction in
which

520
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:40,580
a skinnier me a handsome version of
myself

521
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:45,210
I manages to open some chest once owned
by

522
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,559
Louis the

523
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,399
15th was like Smith 16th 16 I think
sixteen locksmith

524
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,730
I'm by carrying out a leg spat attack on
it its terrible

525
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:57,640
you can find on the net okay here's
what's happening

526
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,179
I am I this wells set

527
00:31:02,179 --> 00:31:05,660
in the late eighteen hundreds in a boy's
boarding school

528
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,990
our the great brain has been stuck to
the use warded

529
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,929
cheese and lox throughout the place
which is very reasonable

530
00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:17,520
so what he does is he manages the
through this

531
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,629
amazing elaborate feast seeing with his
like eleven-year-old buddies

532
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:27,559
they you know distract a priest the
stage people in each of the corners they

533
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:29,070
like really carefully

534
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:33,860
you know go through the zones in this
place until they can get the keys block

535
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,120
that door for a little bit

536
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,090
he goes into the bathroom gets a bar of
soap and makes an impression

537
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:42,189
the key which is pretty cool to begin
with

538
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:46,970
then return the key get back and think
the soap off to get back on the fang

539
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:52,300
knows God is his bar soap but she hides
underneath the statute next day

540
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,678
slick 3 a process next day

541
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,700
he goes back to the statue was nobody
around he gets the

542
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,290
bar of soap he goes out into the yard
during some sort of free period

543
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:05,360
sits on the far side to victory will a
couple of his friends

544
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,719
sit at the base of the tree like having
conversation them as normal

545
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,960
as he wiggles from the piece of wood

546
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,080
achieve it matches the impression the
bar soap vs

547
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,139
his whittling whittling whittling he's
talking about vector is actually pretty

548
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:18,760
proficient

549
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:23,179
littler but this particular lock has
relatively intricate warden is having a

550
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:24,660
difficult time with the middle bits

551
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,679
so he does his best to reproduce the the
impression

552
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,840
axo this is what's called a box

553
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,600
towards these are actually photographs
from that the Allentown collection and

554
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,149
working on

555
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:38,470
I so this is a box awards you can see
V's

556
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:43,230
middle protrusions throughout and all
that's happening in awarded lock

557
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:46,600
is that inside the lock you'll have
these protrusions

558
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,428
the corresponding record Lee to the
negative spaces in the key

559
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:54,100
so this is the key in the lock

560
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,810
you can see the same pattern cut into
the key

561
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:00,159
and then you can see the words actually
coming through the key there

562
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,740
cell he's doing his best to reproduce
his word key

563
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:09,170
out of the piece of wood they've and
carry out another elaborate haste seen

564
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:12,780
working on a I not easy to see

565
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:17,170
walk in an area where they can where
they can try out their key without worry

566
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:21,150
of discovery for the most part they
still keep people watching he tries the

567
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,820
key in the lock it doesn't work

568
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,080
he's not at all shocked by this use
detailing it too was previously

569
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,120
I miss against a three now so what he
does

570
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,419
is he coats the face of his

571
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,420
almost finished key with the layer of
wax

572
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:40,420
he allows it to dry peace moves it with
his ninth

573
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,740
he inserts a back into the lock turns
again

574
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:48,310
pulls it out as soon as it stops and now
you can see marked in the wax

575
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:51,409
the area that he hadn't yet removed with
his knife

576
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:54,990
he proceeds to k2 to remove that area

577
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:58,840
coated with wax again inserts a time
stops one more time finds another war in

578
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,530
a little further in a locked because the

579
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:04,379
this warning system is uniform often
you'll see them placed

580
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,650
in different areas up the up the
interior

581
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:12,179
the box words goes through cuts out that
place clears the wax off in the key

582
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:14,510
works perfectly now is a key though is
working a walk

583
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:19,190
and this is a book aimed at like middle
schoolers and this is several days and

584
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,490
the whole idea with the Great Frame

585
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:25,810
is that you're showing children these
tiny acts

586
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,540
genius from a child which is incredibly
empowering and particularly when it

587
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,480
comes to mechanical oxen awarded keys
that a lot of people

588
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,480
all specially children would have been
aware of at the time that this is being

589
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,190
written

590
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:39,840
this is awesome it demonstrates the

591
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:44,000
the the credibility love the up the main
character

592
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,620
an action and gives another sort of
notch in the belt this is why he's

593
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,620
called the Great Brain this is why you
love reading this the slights

594
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:55,139
this stuck with me having read it when I
was probably ten

595
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:59,230
and came back up in a memory for me when
I was learning about locks much later my

596
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,220
life

597
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:04,410
alright so there many different ways
that you can get this right number one

598
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:08,609
you could just learn how to pick I and
this has happened very rarely but the

599
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:12,420
examples of her awesome where an actor
and actress or a director has just said

600
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,450
we're going to pack

601
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:16,560
hers ocular phenomenal documentarian

602
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,000
I in the I

603
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,190
the film camp that he runs when he's
teaching people all have the skills to

604
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,170
be a

605
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:28,710
filmmaker teaches people to pick locks
alright

606
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,970
also a camera angles doing camera angles
appropriately

607
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:38,230
can now I can lead to great result I
will show a nice example that I you can

608
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:41,010
also prep the locks those trying to do
for the Fox it's laced

609
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:46,390
I and there are Burn Notice or does this
in a nice way but you can go a lot

610
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,920
further within this i think is the big
area

611
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,500
where people are really lacking is that
you can really prep locks the

612
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,480
to carry out a great effect I'm and
finally just using the right words and

613
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,880
phrases the language

614
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,650
all locks and lock picking is so
horrible most popular medium

615
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:06,040
alright so Terminator 2 Judgment Day
Linda Hamilton

616
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,509
insisted that if they were going to pick
locks use going to do it for real

617
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:14,660
so if you go back much Terminator 2
Judgment Day when she's getting out of

618
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,500
her restraints

619
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:19,350
she actually gets out of her restraints
and they just give her the amount of

620
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:19,819
time

621
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:24,480
on film keeping it rolling to make that
happen and certainly she practiced

622
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,730
but so what her character have so she
knew what to do

623
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:31,620
she creates a tool for herself to pick
early adverse trends which doesn't

624
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,370
legitimately

625
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:38,049
it actually happened on Sat that's
awesome robot and Frank

626
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:41,280
is a great movie this is recommended to
me by I am

627
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,770
by Lizzie I

628
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:46,460
from 303 I think many you probably was
no of him phenomenal picker

629
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:50,530
I am he recommended to me with little
hesitation he said

630
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:55,610
this great film terrible acting and it
really is a start right off with the

631
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:56,480
classic

632
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,330
picking a lever lock with up-and-comer
tools

633
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,390
like literally the very first scene I
managers can I

634
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:06,750
stays horrible throughout his teaching
robot how to pick locks

635
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:11,070
service for novelty alone it's a lot of
fun I'm because he's a cat burglar and

636
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:14,110
this robot that supposed to take care
becomes a scabbard assistant

637
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:18,400
and its beautiful but at one point they
do something

638
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,480
that completely redeemed for me made me
so happy

639
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,940
there's a scene one of the first ones
Reese teaching

640
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:29,420
the robot how to pick where he is
talking through it he is talking through

641
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,290
the as both hands up there as you as you
would

642
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:35,730
the lock is mounted on a basin we are
looking at the back and the lock

643
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:40,920
frank's inflame robots in frame he's
giving this great speech

644
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,030
and on the lake important line and this
is happening like twice

645
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,960
my life teaching people to pick locks
where all save the theme they need to

646
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,770
know about picking a metal slide open
and it's the most amazing feeling in the

647
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:54,300
world

648
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:58,750
but on that most important line with the
fundamentals picking a lock

649
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:02,720
you will see the back the plug actually
rotate

650
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,040
because the entire time is sitting there
he's just

651
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:11,790
doing this holding on to a key and then
when he needs to he turns the key but

652
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,300
from the back it looks like he picked it

653
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:18,570
everything used its great I don't need
every actor to be a Linda Hamilton

654
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:22,100
I just needed to be staged correctly
that the rate things happen and this was

655
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:22,350
a

656
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:25,600
re little scene and it's a great movie
robot and Frank you should Netflix

657
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:30,009
and and finally we're gonna go back to
that Dexter bumping episode

658
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:33,630
the law the key works on the first bump

659
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:37,640
and it all looks perfect and I want
frame by frame by frame to watch as he

660
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,060
began to put the key in the lock

661
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,430
vans I know it's very hard to see

662
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:46,640
but I'm certain tracing the pics for you
right here mass

663
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:52,089
is not a bump key this is just the
correct key for the lock

664
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,060
and Matt's rate thats

665
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:59,400
perfect I am you know again I obviously
tweeted this I'm the you know I'm

666
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,190
I'm one of the few nerves that would
take the time to try to figure this out

667
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:06,290
and this is just a beautiful way to do
it and and make it all

668
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:10,810
look and behave entirely legitimately
now been one to go a step further

669
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:14,390
they could still use the bump key and
then reach you there lock

670
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:17,759
just a match monkey which would have
been extra badass by

671
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,280
you know I'm still very happy with this
again I'm and finally the lingo so I'm

672
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,100
gonna show you a couple

673
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:26,920
example phrases 16 walks on the entrance
door

674
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:32,080
that seems totally fine right except the
context that this was

675
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:37,650
the people at Criminal Minds were trying
to describe it to the police

676
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:44,650
why this guy was a security nutjob could
have stricken 6 pin locks man

677
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,509
on his entrance doors Jesus

678
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,710
I am you most of you probably have six
blocks in your

679
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:56,400
doors may be 5-10 and I am here's
another one seems entirely reasonable

680
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,680
feel the clicker the pins while he was
working on a safe

681
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,620
I

682
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:10,850
and like the race to get that affect
their I

683
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:14,400
and finally so this is actually pretty
good book bags really good storytelling

684
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,750
people been recommending it to me for
ever the lock artist by Steve Hamilton

685
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:22,590
people been recommending to be forever
exit seem like very realistic

686
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:26,540
I'm descriptions safe cracking
lockpicking so on and so forth

687
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:31,050
and their lot in my kids truth in them
but the very first page in the book

688
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:35,260
very brief introduction and technology
means to the the locksmith

689
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,510
that Steve Hamilton worked with him as
he was working on the book

690
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:45,510
says out great things are close enough
to be good for storytelling

691
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:49,390
but not so close that this could be used
as a manual

692
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:53,210
because they were concerned about that
and therefore as you go along there a

693
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:53,630
lot of

694
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:57,050
jarring just beat that makes no sense

695
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:01,160
and completely takes a nerd like me that
should love this book

696
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,940
completely out of them

697
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,980
and I don't need an exhaustive
description

698
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,230
a love how you carry this thing out
outside of something like the great

699
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:12,550
brain where the joy of it is exhausted
descriptions you don't actually want

700
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,190
that

701
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:16,700
you want some technical aptitude

702
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:22,120
and you want appropriate terminology and
I think that's plenty for storytelling

703
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,430
but there is a lot of clearly
intentional

704
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:29,100
funkiness you're there just-completed

705
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,230
I am so do this and as I was saying my
other research projects

706
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:38,290
I am lose money on the Allentown think
I'm going back and forth between Chicago

707
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:41,660
and Connecticut regularly where the two
thirds are held in public I right now

708
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:46,109
spend my time there blow my money on
that because I am desperate to see these

709
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,520
things brought back together in
reexamine someday

710
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:53,570
I am so my hope is that the projects
like Best Buy putting together a genuine

711
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,020
and comprehensive guide

712
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:59,440
to how to properly handle locks entry
and all sorts of fun DIY things that can

713
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,290
be incorporated

714
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:03,810
putting together sample dialogue that

715
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:08,410
make sense it's to the point inflows in
care Jersey right in the center center

716
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:12,109
being able to put that sort of guide
together I think would be he

717
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:15,690
genuine assets to people in the
community and to that end

718
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:19,720
I am teaming up with a master yo yo West

719
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,279
I

720
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,980
kept winning to the point that I believe
he created

721
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:31,079
the trifecta you championship something
like that I'm but I feel bad cuz anytime

722
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:32,430
I'm working some units trying to you

723

728
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:57,430
means knows maybe nobody

729

do I think that occasionally the media
intentionally getting it wrong

756
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:53,839
so as not to introduce anybody to his
concert to teach them how to accomplish

757
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,220
those

758
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:57,939
I think the bed is occasionally
certainly the case it's clearly the case

759
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,400
in the lockers and again

760
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,060
this is a book where anybody that
doesn't have the

761
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:06,070
like pure mechanical knowledge blocks
you would read through and would be

762
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,500
phenomenon you really love it

763
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,850
it really only takes I think experts out
at the moment as reading through it

764
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:14,520
I and so if you're going to do that I
think they do a nice job it

765
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,730
I do think that occasionally happens but

766
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:21,100
based on that the them well it's it's

767
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:24,500
amassing quickly but based on the
anecdotal evidence I have from my own

768
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:28,730
and watching have stuff and from all the
people that have contributed 22

769
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:32,600
now three years I have data on what
they've been watching

770
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,990
I'm able to watch those clips it has to
be ignorance

771
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:40,200
leg the majority of it has to be
ignorant because it is

772
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,200
it's not changing things so as not to
teach anyone

773
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,439
it is just like barefaced ignorance or
leasing this

774
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,000
the majority of the time that said I do
think that

775
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,520
that there are at least a handful of
people but very considered

776
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:59,270
do it do without the deeper explanations
I'm in fact that may be why

777
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:02,250
not all of the very clever things
they're doing on camera made it into the

778
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:02,820
narration

779
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:06,590
Burn Notice I wouldn't be shocked by
that units

780
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:09,840
yes

781
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,859
might be on the right was on the cutting
room and that's a very good point

782
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:16,470
yeah they they may have found the
correct lane on the cutting room just

783
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:18,790
for PC or whatever other reason we've

784
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:25,640
Lawson additional narration alright I
post my script I'm so sorry you guys

785
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,750
from bad to say bad things about
MacGyver

786
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:31,660
I

787
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:36,490
I want to preface this by saying that
when I finally sat down to watch the

788
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:37,680
episode of MacGyver

789
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,580
that as a lock person had been
recommended to me at every conference

790
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:45,359
and gone to buy super enthusiastic
conference attendees

791
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:49,799
I loved it I thought it was a great
episode I thought it was a lot of fun

792
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,630
there's like drug-addicted professors
son has been neglected men's up almost

793
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,410
killing himself on a pile of loot

794
00:46:56,410 --> 00:47:00,328
p.m. which is great I

795
00:47:00,329 --> 00:47:04,549
the services BV hell week episode where

796
00:47:04,549 --> 00:47:07,869
the various physics students have to
from

797
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:12,299
assembled barricades on their doors and
by assembling those barricades there

798
00:47:12,299 --> 00:47:14,749
trying to keep out their fellow physics
students

799
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:18,959
made are timed in their ability to enter
that students really

800
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,400
self I am

801
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,450
this fellow rate here

802
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:28,470
I think he might be the disaffected
youth

803
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:32,730
I and the smarmy looking fella back here
is the smarmy youth

804
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:37,200
I many as a lot of amazing smiley faces
I assume that that was the entire

805
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,549
casting call their dislike

806
00:47:38,549 --> 00:47:42,099
look like you're a little better than me
and I just said something dumb

807
00:47:42,099 --> 00:47:45,339
shoppers are trading I is so good at
that anyway

808
00:47:45,339 --> 00:47:50,499
so this guy has barricaded he has
assembled and remember the exact number

809
00:47:50,499 --> 00:47:52,169
like 15-20 lakhs

810
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:56,470
on his door all deadbolts and they all
have the keys in them I know that's

811
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:58,980
difficult to see but then she'll have
the keys in them already

812
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:02,390
but what he is done is he has locked

813
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:07,009
some and he is unlocked others celeb at

814
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:11,109
as you go through and try to like unlock
oh and he is affected the handedness 'em

815
00:48:11,109 --> 00:48:14,150
so did you turn counterclockwise on some
a locket

816
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:18,749
if you turn clockwise on some it will
Oct so that you can just turn the mall

817
00:48:18,749 --> 00:48:21,799
out I am and so this is barricaded

818
00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:25,190
you know to try as much as you like you
have all the keys good luck

819
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:29,700
but just from the pattern be difficult
sir now their couple things I want to

820
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,480
say at the outset if I were approaching
this problem there are few things that I

821
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,710
would do number one

822
00:48:33,710 --> 00:48:37,869
I in additional inspection the rather
play here

823
00:48:37,869 --> 00:48:41,970
on the door isn't like perfectly flush
or overlapping

824
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:45,839
so with a piece of paper I think the go
through pretty quickly determine where

825
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:46,640
all the bolts are

826
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:51,859
number one and if you may be arriving a
little I will get a kinda close not a

827
00:48:51,859 --> 00:48:53,558
resolution may be overlapping a little

828
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:58,410
even then piece a paper and these
flexible piece plastic I am really fan

829
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:03,399
prime make this happen number two if
you've ever thrown a deadbolt

830
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:07,089
rapidly over and over %um

831
00:49:07,089 --> 00:49:10,558
I don't know why you would okay so if
you ever throw deadbolt

832
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,259
do it rapidly over and over and over
again and what you're going to feel

833
00:49:13,259 --> 00:49:14,359
pretty quickly

834
00:49:14,359 --> 00:49:17,670
is that from the Kiva you're holding you
can actually determine whether or not

835
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:18,819
you've walked remarked

836
00:49:18,819 --> 00:49:22,400
you can she ripped you can feel it I

837
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,369
and you know maybe you don't have a
great the first time you just do a

838
00:49:25,369 --> 00:49:29,150
couple a times before very long you will
know that you either unlocked or locked

839
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:30,119
back door

840
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:34,039
so really just in reading that threat
all the locks would have been totally

841
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:34,690
fine

842
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:38,430
annually guns are pretty quickly so
here's the solution they came up with

843
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:42,618
mass cell

844
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:47,599
that's a hike in magnet the goofiest
like Trap House lookin magnet you could

845
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:48,680
get your hands on

846
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:53,960
I am so smarmy dude has the magnet and
in his hand here's a little pouch

847
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:58,479
a metal filings Excel

848
00:49:58,479 --> 00:50:02,558
he lays the magnet on the dorm in
proximity to

849
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,859
the blocks which are probably brasser
casts Inc

850
00:50:05,859 --> 00:50:10,440
keep that in mind I am you know for the
sake of argument will say that the bolts

851
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,529
are steel but thats

852
00:50:11,529 --> 00:50:14,769
gonna be a pretty crazy magnet I and he
then

853
00:50:14,769 --> 00:50:20,189
apply is the filings along a strip of
tape so that he can see them

854
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:24,009
because he is magnetized the bolts
ladies and gentlemen

855
00:50:24,009 --> 00:50:27,809
and so he continues to do this through
outs

856
00:50:27,809 --> 00:50:32,319
unlocking is in the things fall and it's
really nicely done like you know if this

857
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,880
was an appropriate way to carry this out

858
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,390
this is a beautifully filmed I am and
then you look so fighting Sammy

859
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:43,140
I I am

860
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:47,779
that's hot for you all right thank you
all so much

861
00:50:47,779 --> 00:50:51,779
I'll be all around the conference hit me
up holler at me a scout and I come

862
00:50:51,779 --> 00:50:58,779
thank you

863
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:03,640
home
