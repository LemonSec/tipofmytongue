1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,410
on

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:11,330
apparently were nice clothes arrest
anyway I'm gonna

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,440
proper introduction I saying this is a a

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,550
by banning Starshine scam and alyna

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:24,019
via or can we talk about so I'm at Muzzy
other measures to research a massive

6
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:24,609
labs

7
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:29,710
our our parent company is Tamara have
about 10 years

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,690
background experience and development
and security have a passion for pen

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,040
testing development training

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,920
its toughness is Cavan Kevin

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,629
I you ever matt says nice im consultant
at Towers well

12
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,010
hmmm been doing and missing for two
years now specialize in where

13
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,339
applications and

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:54,649
web services as a quick overview

15
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:59,079
for some either having read the synopsis
%uh this is an incident happened last

16
00:00:59,079 --> 00:00:59,559
year

17
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:04,069
last summer we had fortune 500 cut
financial institution

18
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:07,710
call us they basically had a II

19
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,369
Ethical Hacker contact them and tried to
extort them

20
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,680
for two hundred fifty thousand dollars
after a bike that they had found

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,689
and so bizzare stand when I really
covering anything new

22
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,880
nothing groundbreaking organises kinda
back cautionary tale

23
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,110
what happened and how we came to the
conclusion and how we solve the

24
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,350
the issues and our manager technical
breakdown

25
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:36,350
and then cannibal the lessons learned
after the incidents

26
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,820
so again I acquire sees a call right

27
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,158
again Ethical Hacker basically

28
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:47,340
told him that he found a flaw that
allowed him to take over any account

29
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,710
in their system and with that was able
to transfer money to

30
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,809
from that account any account anyone
into on

31
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,979
at the time we they didn't really know
how he was doing it

32
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:01,310
but they basically said we had forty
hours to find out

33
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,350
otherwise he was gonna release the
information on Twitter and YouTube

34
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,799
themselves a threat made by hand I'm I
said yes team because we

35
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:12,380
mean later found on news from India and
all that good stuff but to

36
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,430
USO Kevin actually take the call and
about an hour and a half

37
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,630
into it you know first

38
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:24,739
first mission have science and responses
gathered a lot right so give me all the

39
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:26,170
evidence and logs that you have

40
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,950
here i rushing as a Myers Ron Swanson
better

41
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,560
and I so they had nine it was %ah really

42
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,120
awesome I to try and deal with the
situation where you had

43
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,340
really no path to go or should be

44
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,480
no no way to really figure out how they
got in so we're flying blind

45
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,768
so about an hour and a half into it

46
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:52,060
I was recovering from a party

47
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,600
at Def Con and have definitely was not
in the mood to

48
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,358
to think logically let alone contest and
her

49
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:05,410
sorry let Kevin run with it for a little
while how many have you been to Def Con

50
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,450
but that Hall that is at journey

51
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:14,149
specially when you're drunk should you
have to like pack a lunch just go from

52
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,319
one end to the other

53
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:18,388
so you know the schedule like the
skating rink

54
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:23,350
you know don't really know how to to
stay but they're like alongside the law

55
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,460
stuff happens like crawling along the
law

56
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:31,540
I get a call from my boss telling me I
can give me a break down what's going on

57
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,100
and I'm just not happening I

58
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,380
I'm September I we get on a quick call

59
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,930
start a review kinda what data we do
have

60
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,130
right we knew that there attacker knew
the

61
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,590
the email address the 1i the attack
victim

62
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,350
and I basically start trying to figure
out like if

63
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,650
we were the attacker how are we gonna
break the system

64
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,100
how are we getting nervous system so we
came up with a couple attack vectors

65
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,769
you know was an employee or station
potentially compromised

66
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,500
we quickly ruled that out and actually
challenge the a

67
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,800
attacker to do it again and he did it on
a brand new account test account I'm so

68
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,959
can I rolled out that there was anything
previously installed

69
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,440
we did a quick vulnerability scan the
web sir

70
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,580
just to see if there's any known
vulnerabilities and then

71
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,580
basic I narrowed it down to was there
potentially

72
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,490
some sort of law on the WebLogic which
is our national pot

73
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,620
so about 12 hours into it finally on

74
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,720
back in the hotel room I've sobered up a
little bit

75
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,450
and i got to work kevin was already
working on the web application site in

76
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,590
sign new Kevin pretty much had a
lockdown I'm so I decided to look at the

77
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,440
mobile version

78
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,630
on their website and it was actually
really weird it was thus

79
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,180
it was the same site but different logic

80
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,750
different business logic in the back end
SoCon really

81
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,370
I on issues like glowing for I'm

82
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,950
basically and had a request if you add

83
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:09,090
tried to reset the password and you
remove the security question

84
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:13,190
and the answer you were just a fault in
let you reset the password for any

85
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:13,969
account the gym

86
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:18,660
sorry like yeah you get nothing

87
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,700
crack for like we did dropped Mikey

88
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,870
you know you lose you and now inform the
client

89
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,510
and you know I want a bad with a
headache

90
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,169
and the next day clients team remediated
right away

91
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:37,200
IOC Kevin quickly wrote the instructions
and got over to them

92
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,380
the attacker was then able to do it
again

93
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,000
so whatever fly we found was not even
the one he was using

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,690
says so thankfully we found that fly and

95
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:52,020
you know I got patched but we're just
like how the heck is this guy doing

96
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,349
you know it's an hour were 24 hours n be
and a

97
00:05:56,349 --> 00:05:59,560
yeah link should you

98
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,810
should star surrounds grounds are right
we're going back to the drawing board

99
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,120
I am so basically a

100
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,729
Kevin cannon decided to throw out
everything we know about it and start

101
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:15,090
from scratch again right something on
hand over Kevin talk about a little bit

102
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,659
how he came to his conclusion

103
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,400
shipping second account I'm here to use
our

104
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,780
work on race against the clock for this
guys can release the exploits

105
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,349
downey's you know times types are still
flying by

106
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:31,490
blind idea of the Flies don't you know
Travis but

107
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,590
WebLogic following more but that's what
I'm pursuing that's what I've been

108
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,429
at on or slowing basically all parts
location I can handle pass for changes

109
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,930
at this point uncovered online you know
exactly what they're hitting

110
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,260
know a starting point but we decided to
go and look at things

111
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,020
in cationic exchange passer hopefully
exploit one of those forms

112
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,469
to make that happen it's been a return
to the score forgot password workflow

113
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,229
for resetting the password when you
forgot it

114
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:59,510
the pass reset Account page you can just
got your profile image that the password

115
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:03,760
and yeah decrease in your account page
in case in some situations might be able

116
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,760
to create new account alright pass
revealed

117
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:11,349
so those are the three factors we're up
pursuing at this point so that the main

118
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,780
thing that I was really trying to look
at what session management

119
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,260
home the reason is a lot of times

120
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,659
their slot opportunity for mistake here
which will make

121
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:24,560
cations and the form that they had to
reset passwords in the form that they

122
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,490
had to create new accounts very
complicated there's multiple pages and

123
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,380
they're all I am

124
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,400
state information from the session
cookie I'm

125
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,010
the problem with session management is
its pretty slow to test it was a lot of

126
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,070
a manual process for us

127
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,380
testing every little combination I'm
trying to figure out how they might be

128
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,360
doing on the back end

129
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,990
and on you know what are the
possibilities we're limited on time here

130
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,540
so about

131
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,600
you know ten hours left for certain
realize that you know we might go to

132
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,310
find this but it died of a bill to find
it in time

133
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:54,800
and that's when we we started noticing
that there's actually a

134
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,320
two other calls going every once in a
while back to the application

135
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,990
that work party application lodged
itself I'm no sweat Alex

136
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,680
so they're using cynical i dnt leaf 11
1x and

137
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,979
party this dead not been able to get a
Sydney logs in so we reach out to the

138
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:09,949
analyst Department

139
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:14,770
actually gotta a saddam serve their
their analytic slicing using this

140
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,409
I was finally on the right track so
getting long the warmer out here

141
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:22,400
have some direction we've received at
day actually

142
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,138
there's actually is coming from India at
Unitec a senior in a time frame that

143
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,199
which county tax change the password

144
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,039
hitting the Forgot Password work for
page so the slightest kinda cut-out

145
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:36,000
some the craft on casting the other page
isn't really focused on this page

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,549
and on still coming online but at least
we had you know

147
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:47,430
much more limited scope on our hands I'm
so we re folks Trafford on the stage

148
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:51,839
and finally thank God we had three guys
left at this point

149
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,490
our boss the office just yelling at me
to pull the trigger on the exploit

150
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,600
whatever that means so the thing he did
but

151
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,170
finally did they were able to reset a
password and we managed to you

152
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,339
fine with the flowers and this is

153
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:10,480
I can walk to the technical breakdown
about what's going on here dislike

154
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,730
mental issues nothing groundbreaking

155
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,860
perhaps but me to back into session
management

156
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,810
we've run into the slot on contests
special occasion contest with a session

157
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,329
management hair cell

158
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:24,849
forgive me if this is something as all
seen before but may be useful might

159
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:29,110
might find it on your own tests

160
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:33,260
so some background I just wanna give a
an idea how the page worked

161
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,579
that we were targeting Bedoya

162
00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:40,569
brought in the works works out shorter
to reset forgot password you may send a

163
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:41,120
troop

164
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,160
three pages on each page the state would
change so on first page

165
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,819
you enter username now Basij redirected
to the next page

166
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:52,920
you be in the context that use name
gassed 10 view 3 security questions

167
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,939
army to answer that so obvious you know
the name my dogs deserve my password

168
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,250
apparently according to its website but
if you answer the one security question

169
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,680
you now have that ability to reset the
password

170
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,339
and an hour redirected to change
password page where you can change

171
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,360
passeri

172
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,390
and I wanted reason for such missions on
that on

173
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,170
just turn out that the only verification
you hear security questions

174
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:18,219
you know even if this this form is
pretty secure in there is no flaw

175
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,500
they're still can be an issue with that
you busy

176
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,610
mystery question that offer things I was
your high school was

177
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,790
for stockings that things like you know
from being a fan with you on facebook

178
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,980
sorry callers have any technical issues
the the business logic

179
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,190
help application worked arm was not
sufficient to protect

180
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:38,910
page but unfortunately no that was
nothing as a tax it was much focus on

181
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,079
that and that actually still hasn't been
fixed

182
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,579
met me thank you mind when you're
designing web pages or an estimated

183
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:49,010
web pages that no unit SciTech flying
heading

184
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,510
maybe it's something that is week from
informations

185
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:57,319
requiring muted

186
00:10:57,319 --> 00:11:00,670
cell on we're looking at the sessions

187
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,750
we news they're using the basically
built like Java library

188
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,270
for a handling sessions because they're
using the G session ID

189
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,680
and against me this coming off this one

190
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,709
covering in 10 104

191
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:20,119
basically what happens is we use this
your such the session ID is that is

192
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,949
picky

193
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:24,469
that's unique ID adviser session stay

194
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,209
was in tears risk server coaching
reference modified

195
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:33,650
as needed circuit at a reaction stay

196
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,949
ants each page react differently based

197
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:38,189
patch

198
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,190
secure Jesus management but

199
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,060
thing is on so for this page right

200
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,689
what I was doing you can imagine
actually the session forgot password

201
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:53,740
it was getting session at Seaview from
scary question for user wise

202
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:58,010
and setting a this guy can go ahead and
choose password

203
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,210
UN Secretary questions on the reset
password page

204
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:05,500
it's just checking what whether you have
the permissions

205
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,250
passers so resetting your password at
least that's what should be happening

206
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:09,800
right

207
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,640
the logic changing state session he can
really be doing anything on any page

208
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,680
I'm and sometimes people make mistakes
managing state

209
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,989
that's a little foreshadowing here we
can see

210
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,130
we were talking this morning at server
to a state

211
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,570
that we can use change the password out
jumping through the hoops

212
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:30,680
actually entering security questions are
validated ourselves and so we're trying

213
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,489
to use the Outback incurs working see if
we can

214
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,630
get state into an area way relax that
will change password for us

215
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:42,270
cell if I can reinvest

216
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,829
this but they see what's going on here
on this page

217
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:49,520
this is Hannah what the session looks
like for each page we didn't have access

218
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,939
national cash some kinda marking up but
I think would look like

219
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,210
but essentially right checking it's
pouring out trading session or checking

220
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,120
existing session

221
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,040
adding the user test session redirecting
to the security question pages

222
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,480
checking to see if the if the answers
correct

223
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,910
it is correct it seems that this such as
you can teach

224
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,420
aspirin and now the Czech session page
its gonna go and check whether

225
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,790
they can change password cell take the
primary in the past standard

226
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:22,240
James himself notes reading these are
just the latest

227
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,000
painted dancers writing the pastor to
the navy's

228
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,500
against nets which should be happening
we found really

229
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,860
work like which is very strange is that
when you hit the

230
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,860
the Change Password page in your
password if it is your session is

231
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,190
is correct you guys heading teams
password but her sessions incorrect

232
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,340
I'm not only his redirect you to the
login page insist failure

233
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:48,330
ashey makes it so you have heard session

234
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:53,650
and sell I don't why did that and it was
really unexpected but we catch

235
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:57,069
bumped into that and we we're Cup its
prized

236
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:02,660
habitat that's you able to find it to
base the Nordics point that's right you

237
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,010
would

238
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,230
you can create your own account but
you're a normal password change capture

239
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:09,240
the POST request for the password change
itself on its third page

240
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,890
on go ahead and start to be surpassed
reset password

241
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:17,280
different user your target user on
joining poll that the session ID out now

242
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,079
that you're so she

243
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,070
the user with it before answer any
security questions go back to the post

244
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,470
request you captured pay synergy session
ID read it again

245
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,870
on successfully you know page fill you
in

246
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,530
back but then it a second time and
indicating

247
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:36,069
change password educated

248
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,190
just that sawyer's like expect the
unexpected right

249
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,480
why would if you failed to authenticate
make your syndicated

250
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,730
the server to do that there's no reason
to write any that my nap

251
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,680
something you're looking for and whether
fishing contest webster's and that's

252
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,099
because

253
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,710
why would anyone do that but code is
weird people make mistakes

254
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:56,110
things to be complicated meet in Iraq's
national character was symbols

255
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:59,580
you know if fail then make authenticated

256
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:04,070
there's pride small-company logic that
where there is a flaw and so ricky is

257
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,730
expected expected we're going out

258
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,900
after some like the things you might
expect to be happening

259
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,890
but if you kinda just mess around I
think the

260
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:15,990
you might just logically think would
fail you may be surprised to see that

261
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,270
actually be successful

262
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:21,579
on those things be expected right
win-win testing sessions in

263
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,380
applications in general lot of times all
the testing and stand by the developers

264
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,780
against hey what can you do in the
browser user experience tracked we have

265
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,890
tools right members

266
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:33,540
he said our project across the web
servers to reorder making check whatever

267
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,209
information

268
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:38,800
one on so take against the stools and do
things that

269
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,620
that the user will be able to do they
would be able to easily do in the

270
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,140
browser

271
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:47,350
to try and get into situations that
developers to speak cell

272
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:53,450
bells fun we we found the flaw ending
was kinda them are also a friend that

273
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,520
the buyback party

274
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,800
shares well I'm just close when the
times over so

275
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,010
we actually suggested

276
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,080
you know they should pay the staff
because he found any was releasing

277
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,130
user something you know twenty grand I'm

278
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,450
but unfortunately he kinda any

279
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,820
I guess calling them out on Twitter &
much their

280
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,030
networks was about it so we ended up not
getting any money

281
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:19,050
unfortunately actually find out later
that he had a

282
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:23,060
purchase the exploit as synthetic
acquiring mediated

283
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:30,060
next week YouTube from someone else self

284
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,170
around and dad

285
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,579
savior and

286
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,970
territory at

287
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:02,720
lessons learned alright so first off as
the attacker

288
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,189
if you are gonna find flaws and start to
requesting money

289
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:10,689
price should check to see if the company
has a bug bounty program back just roll

290
00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:11,079
one

291
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:15,448
but so this case they did not have about
ninety program

292
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:18,809
and so we're really trying to tell you
that

293
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:23,389
if you can and if your institution has
money or your organization has money

294
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,490
to definitely institute some sort of bug
bounty program

295
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,740
because basically they were left pant
and scrambling

296
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,450
right and they were a financial
institution I've had this debate a few

297
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,809
times especially in the office

298
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:39,280
the nation do about banning program
because my pen a target on their back

299
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,760
but I think we've already can illustrate
they were already a target

300
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,530
right fish this guy came at where decide
to spend

301
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:51,990
hours upon hours trying to find this law
and obviously found in was holding him

302
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,750
you know france-based person for two
hundred thousand dollars

303
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:00,540
she's insane but anyway I thing but
banning programs are pretty easy

304
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,720
establish a special

305
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,040
you know for anyway he security teams
out there there's online resources

306
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,000
google has done a very good job setting
can have a template

307
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,160
for for putting but bands out there

308
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,100
about crowd is another great website you
can actually signed up and put your bug

309
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,270
bounty program on

310
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:24,600
and a crack jury well will actually work
with you to set up a am but many program

311
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,629
but some things you should probably
consider when

312
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,840
when setting up a bug bounty program is
a ballot box right what do you consider

313
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,790
to be

314
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:36,330
a legitimate fly on your system I'm some
sort of crossing request forgery that

315
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,559
logs out a user

316
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,820
probably not that big of a deal
reconciled

317
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,439
his liking and user see you want to try
make that when you're in ballot box

318
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,490
your valid but might be something where
hijack secession or sensors

319
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,400
injection right

320
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,590
anything that's not gonna be a big deal

321
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:59,159
some sort SSL air something that we see
all the time on

322
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,490
you know your weather and Esther culture
spencer's are in the know what I'm

323
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,050
talking about

324
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:07,190
those priming you know not be a big
importance

325
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,340
for company to pay money for and then
you wanted to find your award right

326
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,689
so ya who I used to send out t-shirts
that's cool

327
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:20,190
I mean some people bitching complain but
really just a recognition that you did

328
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,130
something and got a shirt for tackle

329
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:27,070
I'm trophy I know Facebook does a a
white hat hacker debit card

330
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,889
you can keep the money as one tackle
debit card so

331
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,660
but yeah even recognition on the website
I like the whole fam a lot about

332
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,180
Manning's do that where they actually
just put your name out there

333
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:41,060
and that's really good for up-and-coming
security researchers

334
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,050
to try and establish themselves
especially in this market where

335
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,780
everyone's trying to look for jobs in

336
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,450
securities kinda hard to get into if you
can throw your

337
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,630
you know a couple links up there and say
you know have found these bugs and these

338
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,210
are the CDs that I found

339
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:58,990
you definitely know you have a lot
better chance getting a job and then NHA

340
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,710
another good thing is it opens a
challenge communication rank you set up

341
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,160
rules that say you're not gonna
prosecute them if they

342
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,470
disclose about you I think a lot more
people would be more willing to come up

343
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:09,940
and

344
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,140
actually disclose how they did it what
they did you know

345
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,400
so I know there is a kid not too long
ago in England

346
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,790
disclosed a bug at his school and he's
actually being persecuted now

347
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:23,230
so it's kinda te scary kinda things are
out there

348
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:26,770
but as long as you can open up that
channel and set up some sort of

349
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:30,240
form for them to submit their bugs it's
definitely a good thing

350
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,050
good step in the right direction another
thing

351
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:37,149
that you think a five Fortune 500
company would have a chance

352
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:41,100
response team I was probably the biggest
wake-up call

353
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,760
swears give us your locks and they had
not right

354
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,650
we found the web analytics lives and we
actually use them in a way that they

355
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,620
want is to be used

356
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,800
just because we had nothing else to use
I'm so

357
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,840
if you haven't already set up an instant
response team or even policies in your

358
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,600
organization knew that something you
start with even

359
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,240
know how to detector analyze a breach
and editor that was the first thing we

360
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:04,900
have to do is

361
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,700
she got off a bridge actually did occur
and so we lost valuable time doing that

362
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,150
so anyway you wanna work on containing
the breach

363
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:17,920
and possibly recovery and try medication
I'm gonna fix the problem

364
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,250
that's kinda what we did we came in we
found the problem nixon

365
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:27,390
post in San went ahead and checked so
again nothing new

366
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,940
but I feel like we have to reiterate the
stuff all the time streak

367
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,400
and and then if you are researcher

368
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,490
and they don't have a butt down here in
a tank that these are some proper ways

369
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,560
to disclose bugs

370
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,700
this is the ethical way to do it this is
where you get your title white hack

371
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,280
not you not gone out there breaking
stuff without permission c1 and form a

372
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:48,840
company

373
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,889
or the developer privately you don't
disclose it publicly known to put it out

374
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,660
on their own

375
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,710
predator for Chandler WordPress Blogger
whatever

376
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,170
and then when you do provider detailed
report just like you would provide a pen

377
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:01,890
tester for

378
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:06,280
go through findings detail the data that
you're able to do in

379
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,980
and can to give them a perfect concept
so that they can take back to their Q

380
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,340
eighteen to their security team

381
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,919
and they can run it through their system
so it's not just a one-time and

382
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,150
and they basically give the company time
to fix it so this is where I can a

383
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:22,270
different little bit on Google I think
Google gives people forty-eight hours to

384
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,030
fix bugs

385
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,530
I don't know that's to me just
unrealistic

386
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:30,730
I know a lot to you prior work for large
enterprises should does not get done in

387
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:31,600
forty-eight hours

388
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,689
right it takes weeks months

389
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:38,830
so I don't just give them plenty a time
work with them try and help

390
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:42,350
offer assistance to to fix it and then
you know I'm

391
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:45,689
see taking if you can use them as a
reference on a resume or whatever

392
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:50,270
you want to get that recognition and
then lastly this is kinda like Kevin

393
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,370
talked about a little bit

394
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,750
was having your pop proper Password
Reset

395
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,950
on there is a standard out there but the
OAS

396
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:02,210
the open web applications project is
done a pretty good job basically you

397
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,650
want to gather identification

398
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:07,290
so you want an end but they're using
other e-mail on one form

399
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:08,730
summit

400
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,509
verify with good security questions this
is this is not

401
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:16,710
what's your favorite color right there
sixty four nine colors other whatever

402
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:19,779
but how many how many can you name of
the top

403
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:23,559
10 so if I go through and you those ten
questions that's not a good

404
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:27,240
question I do those 10 answers so good
question would be

405
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,409
was the street drop on I guarantee you
not post in on Facebook

406
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:35,080
myspace whatever you use Twitter
something

407
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,949
do that once you verify that the user is
actually who they say they're

408
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,419
Senate ok and oversight channel right
this for the email comes in

409
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:45,600
send you an email with the email that's
registered to their town

410
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,039
with a link times out after a certain
number of hours

411
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,120
and then you have them click on it to
verify their and then once that happens

412
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,209
a lot and it changed

413
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:57,230
change the password something

414
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:00,600
thank you very much again mammals and
Kevin Dec

415
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,809
that's our contact information want to
reach out to us

416
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:10,678
any questions yes we did

417
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:17,679
not or not I

418
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:22,740
last chance

419
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,010
I'll be at the bar so if you ask
questions yes

420
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:30,610
bono's yes requesting

421
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:34,679
individual the believe

422
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,310
for for the wizard

423
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,320
answers like yet they their team didn't

424
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,040
I'm unfortunately we didn't have their
capabilities to step in and do that

425
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,690
we're getting everything share party we
actually found out later on that they're

426
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,540
actually holding information back from
us

427
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,629
there's four other teams working on this
at the same time for the consulting

428
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,110
turns

429
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,669
and they didn't add tell us any of that
information Anna why they were so

430
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:01,270
hesitant to give us that information
they could've maybe you know I honestly

431
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,450
don't know if they didn't do that

432
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:06,230
but that would definitely be the route
to go right especially if

433
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,890
you're trying to determine how the
bridge happened so but efficient they

434
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,520
tend to

435
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,310
ability you're interacting with these
organizations would you

436
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:19,040
did iight to have that access

437
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,210
oh yeah definitely definitely out there
if they're willing to give you that

438
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:22,740
access

439
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,000
I definitely take right you wanna you
wanna see what a

440
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,470
any entry point that they're giving so
we are flying blind

441
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:33,240
I'm so luckily we and the reason we
found it is because the other three

442
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,360
teams want focusing on the web
application

443
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,600
forget way we actually focused on the
web

444
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,820
something to do I think it has something
to do with the transferring the money

445
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,830
and we figure there's only really a
couple ways they could do it right

446
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,939
the mobile app the web app or or brick
and mortar store

447
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:54,240
and so we cannot determine that it might
be the application right to the three so

448
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,630
that's how we can it came to that

449
00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:00,940
be at the three other teams and
arranging for chasing I think their

450
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,960
internal team I'd

451
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,880
but to be I and II dnt leave large he
referenced

452
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,650
on that was actually really cool I never
even seen that technology is anybody

453
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,740
worked with that technology

454
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:17,070
it's called i dnt leaf it actually
records all the sessions on the website

455
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:21,790
so that you can watch a mouse movements
and everything for users see relies like

456
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,180
what they're clicking on stuff

457
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,800
and down

458
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,149
that was when we asked him for logs and
we started seeing the

459
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:32,540
Tea Leaf requests in the headers we
asked what that was in

460
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,820
once they gave that overdue as we get
action replay what the guy was doing

461
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,760
we can see the had a request you know
where he was said switching the session

462
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,500

463
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,020

465
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:54,430
your questions rights again

466
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,850
not really carry anything new but
cautionary tale for you can take back

467
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,100
your organization

468
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,860
you know maybe you find a battery reset
fly on your staffers and sorta business
