1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,029
there are three things that really just
turn me on

2
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:07,669
and important to get that out of the way
first is obviously security

3
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:10,670
I wouldn't be here if I I don't like
solving heart problems

4
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,730
and working with awesome people just a
fantastic domain

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,949
second is data visualization I'm a huge

6
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,199
huge visual learner I know there are a
lot of people who just learned from

7
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:24,980
reading a couple things I learned from
diagrams charts graphs visualizations

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,670
and so I'm gonna do my best to try and
interject love those things in the talk

9
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,119
today

10
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,649
as well see funny photos and images so
good morning

11
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:36,610
against and then not the final thing is
pedagogical learning models which

12
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,469
basically means

13
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,930
I love learning three stories I love
learning through anecdotes

14
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,960
I had to impart some that basically from
everything I've learned to my career

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,480
so at more on the topic a story so I'll
start without the first one

16
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,419
so the first story basically my career
and where I came from and

17
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,180
why I'm here and my you guys are awesome
first I I start my career office after

18
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:01,260
engineer at nasa to break down the road
at the jet propulsion laboratory

19
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,250
suffer engineer on computer-aided
engineering projects so

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,880
that includes business applications as
well as space like projects like the

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,030
Mars Science Laboratory

22
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,430
Center I did a massive detour in my life
and I went from

23
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,790
putting rovers on Mars to social
networks

24
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,759
basically myspace big social network at
the time in the mid 2000's growing up in

25
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:22,680
Los Angeles

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,430
and by the time I joined myspace they
were probably around 50 million users

27
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:31,140
and security was just a massive massive
issue for the company

28
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,020
they were getting attacked by just about
everybody I joined about

29
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,390
I think about a month or two after the
semi attack

30
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,159
happened and I think everybody's shares
pretty well familiar with the same %um

31
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,280
what that was and myspace I was focused
on managing security

32
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,130
answer really just leading security team
we good practice to about

33
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,500
2230 security engineers testers

34
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,579
cetera eventually I found myself at the
BBC

35
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,929
and a hymns at the same thing

36
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,530
the same here yet so I'll go back to
that are the semi warm

37
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,459
as affectively a a a cross-site
scripting attack where

38
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:13,190
Saini who is a user myspace and at the
time

39
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,620
a Ajax he sings for Ajax started
happening

40
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,940
he figured out an interesting attack
vector where we at Crossett request

41
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,440
forgery

42
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,560
on the myspace website and he was able
to inject JavaScript into his profile

43
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,190
M-one another user who is logged into
myspace went to his profile

44
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,290
it made a request to myspace web site on
the user's behalf

45
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,739
and it rearranged their top-eight their
top it trends

46
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:39,580
and a potem at CME in the top eight and
then it adjusters

47
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,200
and then exactly and then said he's my
hero actually was the

48
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,730
thing the profile and it was awesome
hack n out before I got there I I just

49
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,119
heard about

50
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,560
what was called remediation read the
radiation cleanup was massive myspace

51
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
had to pull the cord

52
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,819
and went back and did a massive massive
cleanup now

53
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,920
Tom Thomas the a my sister so

54
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,140
officially i feel myself managing
technology and security at the BBC

55
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,220
and so the BBC this big British
Broadcasting Corporation

56
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,130
and I was on the worldwide side not to
be confused public service which is the

57
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:13,590
news

58
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,450
worldwide is effectively the the
entertainment arm so the guy if you

59
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,890
watch things like doctor who were Top
Gear

60
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,760
thats BBC Worldwide to managing
technology is was security initiatives

61
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,359
for digital entertainment and gaming

62
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,640
and finally I became a cofounder and I
ctor Freddie

63
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,000
and so you see our lovely sign a cheer
t-shirts if you guys are interested

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,019
feel free to get in clouds Bacup
labeling boxes outside

65
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,109
I'm basically up ready what we're
focused on doing is

66
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:46,180
check try to change the landscape
security for developers developers have

67
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,150
a really tough time

68
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,280
and the scary life cycle and we'll talk
a little bit more about that but

69
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,410
to set in context this is not a vendor
talk at all so

70
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,329
I'm not trying to sell anything and I
try to talk about our company or

71
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:57,190
anything like that

72
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,910
your time is more precious my time is
more valuable it's better to just talk

73
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,250
about

74
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,670
security and talk about challenges and
everything that we're seeing

75
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,768
rowing together Sep

76
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:11,409
let's start with the past so work where
we come from

77
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:15,099
where we did a cell number one
applications were

78
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:18,349
a lot simpler than they are today and
things word

79
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,600
obviously it siloed of I saw this a GPO

80
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,710
I saw that there are a lot of
information systems built-in

81
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:29,008
all sorts of languages and frameworks
and there are just a lot more contained

82
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:29,669
than they are today

83
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:34,150
second is that there's this big
conception and again i saw this

84
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:39,698
at JPL I've were security was assumed to
be related to just network firewalls

85
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:43,020
and there are things like best practices
and there are things like secure

86
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,789
resources

87
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:46,960
but for the most part it was just really
focused on the firewall

88
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,000
end a lot of people thought in truly
believes that things like pattern

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,850
matching by regular expressions

90
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,889
could scale and scale from two different
approaches

91
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:59,580
one approach being that hey we can catch
absolutely everything with a regular

92
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,310
expression

93
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,419
Norwegian catch lots of things multiple
regular expressions or

94
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:07,289
they just generally thought that as
compute I'm in complete process he's got

95
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:08,150
faster that

96
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,049
regular expressions would just be easier
and could just stacked on top of each

97
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:12,449
other

98
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:15,699
so a two quotes I kept hearing

99
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:19,630
and this is you know my time the late
90s was

100
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,930
if it compiles ship it and that's just
generally the ethos

101
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,830
up what the late 90s were about when it
came to suffer development and I think

102
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,490
that there's

103
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,250
people here who've lived through that
moment I think this'll definitely

104
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,250
resonate with you

105
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,970
and the other thing that is somewhat
controversial is

106
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,190
this thing and I I got to work initially
in my career

107
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,460
as an Operations Engineer I sort of a
systems engineer

108
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,750
and I can't tell you how many times and
to all the different companies I

109
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,210
interned at are worked out

110
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,659
where this notion just kept coming up
were you talk to other operations

111
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:50,469
engineers in

112
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,979
you just ask each other hey what are we
doing from a security perspective

113
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:59,419
and there it's a %uh it's totally fine
we have a firewall and yes they are

114
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:01,200
end

115
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,340
yet you're right and upstream going to a
bunch different security conferences

116
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,739
it's definitely a message that's that's
certainly true so

117
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,700
this happened what vendors

118
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,070
went ahead and they decided that they're
not only gonna take

119
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,430
when use network firewalls are going to
create what's now called web application

120
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,110
firewalls

121
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,860
you heard Im they exist in all sorts of
shapes sizes in places

122
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,030
summer physical piece hardware some are
virtualized containers that live in your

123
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,090
data center or your

124
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:34,000
clout quotes so what is web application
firewall

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,470
it's effectively a proxy thats
potentially being daisy chained of

126
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,870
all load balancer or some other network
device

127
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,050
and it's trying to intercept and catch
things before malicious things going

128
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,020
hitter application

129
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,200
makes a lotta sense anything about the
network but when you think about the

130
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,979
application

131
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:55,000
lot emissions so three key issues that

132
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,660
I definitely observed from Wasson I'm
sure you guys in crowded probably

133
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,280
have your own pinpointed by the
application firewalls but anecdotally

134
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,809
here the three things i have observed

135
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,020
one is what's called learning modes and

136
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,380
someone somewhere who came up with the
idea of learning modes

137
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,880
has dozens of swimming pools and it
isn't me and

138
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,830
I'll get to what that means in a second
regular expression pattern matching so

139
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,349
again

140
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,350
we really thought that patterns and we
could we could catch things with

141
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,669
regular expressions but it doesn't
really work and you'll see why

142
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:29,530
and the third thing is latency speed
bumps so again

143
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,630
lots with application firewalls lotsa
firewalls proxies

144
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,490
they're basically sitting between your
end user and the application itself so

145
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,140
it's just another point in the network

146
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,380
that's going to sleep application down
so I

147
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,850
while I have a beef with learning modes
first

148
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:48,710
training a class fires incredibly
tedious I don't know if there's a lot

149
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,609
people here with

150
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,980
machine learning or did it houses in the
background but I'm

151
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,480
s

152
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,570
as a fellow quant I can tell you that
whether you're training and I've

153
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,770
crossfire or busy in classifier

154
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:03,130
there's lots and lots of issues with
primarily concerned second point which

155
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,040
is the training is

156
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,570
significantly AirPrint and the reason
for that is your only as good as the

157
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,230
dataset that you're gonna be training
your web application firewall

158
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,300
or classifier with and it was the third
point which is

159
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,240
what is statistically significant data
where you getting up from

160
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,380
is that staging data is the production
data

161
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,500
is a clean has been normalized do we
know if they're bad pillows about events

162
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:25,930
in their

163
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,080
how are we actually making sure that
we're training class fire that its

164
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,750
real data and the other thing that
someone like a typically think about is

165
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,909
a lot of vendors come up to us saying
well certainly at the BBC a lot of

166
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:38,919
vendors have come up in

167
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,880
sell their technologies other solution
as hey we built something really cool

168
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,850
that contains

169
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:46,930
artificial intelligence or machine
learning

170
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:50,870
what does that mean do you have do you
honestly have in your own network

171
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,010
running inside your appliance you have
in your home network running inside

172
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,270
your virtual machine today end when I
think I've what a lot of people want

173
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,890
they won an interface looks like this
right when you think about like

174
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,260
security thing about machine learning
you think about class fires

175
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,020
you want something is cool is this right
reality

176
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:13,530
you rely for this pretty significant
mismatch from what we want and what our

177
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,760
expectations are too what's actually out
there in the world

178
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,939
red sell to just rip into the slow to
more

179
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,370
I I think when you talk to a lot of
Engineers when they think about what

180
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,490
learning modes are

181
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,910
I don't know how many programmers there
there are in the crowd but up

182
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,660
if you're familiar with you know data
structures a lot of people think that

183
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,319
is that just a map or a dictionary with
and IP addresses the key

184
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,880
or Hashem the user agent with the route

185
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,980
and with counters on the other side
that's just being incremented

186
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,810
and if it crosses a waterfall or
threshold and I just

187
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,810
I was on a message board several years
ago where they're talking about the

188
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:50,849
complexity and

189
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,900
whether or not the web application
firewalls are the sort of approach

190
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,180
what they're doing statistically and not
the funniest

191
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,650
comment on there was summer patrol the
thing but

192
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,579
is going to chess had better
decision-making capabilities than your

193
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,760
web application firewall

194
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,660
when it comes to understanding patterns
in Paramus cell

195
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,750
let's talk a little bit about pattern
matching cuts we talked a lot about

196
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,230
regular expressions and patterns

197
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,580
let's dive into what that means in and
accurately

198
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,860
talk about you know the key issues here
Sep

199
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,370
many people here think that you can't do
things

200
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,750
bike input validation or Corey
validations solely on

201
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,580
regular expressions today exactly

202
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,450
and up it doesn't work her present at
the time and I think

203
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,170
if you're playing things like DLP so
basically for trying to scan for things

204
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,530
like social security numbers

205
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:44,610
if you try to scan for things like email
addresses or do input validation for

206
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,590
Hill dresses tera and he makes a lot of
sense to apply something like a regular

207
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,330
expression

208
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,230
border training course content or when
you're trying to look at free from

209
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,310
content like in the case

210
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:58,670
myspace I'll lot of HTML wetherbee a
subset additional even custom mark-up

211
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:03,360
you can't show use regular expressions
we'll get to that why but why do you

212
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,740
want to use regular expressions

213
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,150
well one they are intuitive and their
intuitive in their expressive

214
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,959
which means that again if you see a
pattern like a red like a social

215
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,770
security number

216
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,040
digit digit digit dash digit digit dash

217
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,319
digit digit digit digit think that's
right ahead and up

218
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,760
the two problems with it one you can
exploit them

219
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,500
in a rather trivial way sizing and I'll
show you an example a second

220
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,680
they also don't skill to infinity out
when I got a myspace

221
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,160
we had probably three to four hundred

222
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,170
regular expressions that we're running
with every single post request that was

223
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:41,250
coming to the website so basically

224
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,750
if you are posting a comment if you are
updating your profile

225
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:48,780
we would run through a battery hundreds
a regular expressions

226
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,290
they're all compiled regular expression
so I know there's a lot of people claim

227
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,069
that well if you compile the regular
expressions

228
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,340
still gonna be fine what you're
compiling them that's fine they're sad

229
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,350
memory but you're so gonna entrance if
you hit

230
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,680
running all those regular expressions
and we had expressions that were looking

231
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,160
for

232
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,719
weird Unicode characters cuz we've all
seen the fun nasty things you couldcan

233
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,370
do

234
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,600
in browsers like Internet Explorer
especially since a lot of the older

235
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,240
browsers

236
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,250
didn't enforce really strict rendering
in there

237
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,460
really weird things you can do with
syntax tax still

238
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,060
take a look at something like this alert
hella JavaScript is obvious

239
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,579
we know it's gonna do there's less
obvious ways that you can get this thing

240
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,140
through

241
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,970
and we see it stuff that goes past my
application web application firewall or

242
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,330
definition based approaches

243
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:36,029
do this same exact thing as alert hello
JavaScript

244
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:40,380
my character in string thats you know
letter anything like that

245
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,760
PC stuff like this to go past definition
based approaches

246
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,300
all the time suppose you got a regular
expression other handles this

247
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,510
about that right is just a palindrome

248
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,490
above the previous attacks to you build
a regular expression handle the first

249
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:55,800
one

250
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,979
this is still gonna go through this is
still gonna executing the application

251
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,670
what now so world attraction

252
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,870
cell not make going to join us for a
little bit for a little story time

253
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,529
so when I was on MySpace and

254
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:14,020
in the BBC a lot of people would come by
any talk to us

255
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,740
about selling web application firewalls
so

256
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,000
oftentimes these vendors did you see
anything in the world it's pretty

257
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,589
obvious

258
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:25,720
have you ever work at a company let's
say

259
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,490
you've gotten hacked or exploited and
the house more much security vendors

260
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,930
attack you send your email addresses
this try to get your phone number

261
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:39,279
the triangle when your colleagues and
they try to simply like find a way to

262
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,000
stock you and get to know you

263
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,320
that's basically what it was all

264
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,620
at all these times all these junctions
every single time there was

265
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,790
weird hacker exploits someone would come
along

266
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:55,730
and try to sell it something try and
claim that their technology

267
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,810
or their approach was gonna be far
better than anything else

268
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:02,410
and it's really annoying because there's
not one

269
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,810
there's no one solution that

270
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,180
jurors and solves absolutely everything
cell

271
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,189
I think it's really important to
delineate between what we call

272
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:12,950
compliance

273
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,610
national security and as someone who's
been on the other side

274
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,900
oftentimes you have to check box

275
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,260
right you work at the company let's say
you have legal reasons

276
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:28,410
but your company's public you have a
financial and you have a responsibility

277
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,689
to be good your shareholders center and
you have to check that box

278
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,760
that says whether or not you are PCI
compliant well

279
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,990
in that audit forms were in those firms
for audit

280
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,210
there's a checkbox that says whether or
not you have a lot of occasions

281
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,680
firewall and if you don't check that box
yet to prove how you have what's called

282
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,870
a corresponding control

283
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:50,580
as for PCI 6.6 and if you say that you
have corresponding controls

284
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,060
yet to prove it hinted at it and there's
a significant amount of work

285
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,849
so a lot of times a lot of people
accompanies just want the easy way out

286
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,550
just wanna check box and I don't
necessarily blame them trying to check

287
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,000
the box but at the same time

288
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,300
do they actually have real controls so
that when I checked the box they

289
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,849
actually have real security on the other
side

290
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:13,490
so are we today and what is all the
stuff in the past actually created

291
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:18,700
so the first is that applications are a
lot more complex today

292
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,070
I'll show you a nice pretty diagram the
second the second is that application

293
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,760
security means a lot more than running a
web application firewall

294
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,880
means running more than definitions and
signatures

295
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,590
means more than running regular
expressions were seen all sorts is what

296
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,270
we call targeted attacks things like

297
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:37,800
up cross-site scripting sequence action
CSRF

298
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,660
and happening in the context of the
application not outside the application

299
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,689
and certainly for something like sick or
injection it's happening between the

300
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,470
application

301
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,950
and the database itself not just
happening in the application

302
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,090
higher national size limitations I
talked a little bit about deal P

303
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,730
if you've got a form field in need to
validate a phone number

304
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:00,360
social security number email address
fine he's a regular expression

305
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,860
but if you have to do free-form content
if you're looking at Davis crease

306
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,590
if you're looking at mark-up that's
going back out to the front browser

307
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,970
don't use regular church cell we talk
about the environment today

308
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,020
generally what we're seeing so there's

309
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:19,620
lot more players today than it was in
the past before you add a binary that

310
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,170
was just

311
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,689
been compiled the played a single in
point missed it was environment you to

312
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:24,700
load balancer

313
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,370
life is pretty simple tits lot more
complex probably because an

314
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,260
information-sharing

315
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,100
the ideas that you got lotsa data coming
from a district drive sources

316
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,270
itself we typically see is the
distributor a model

317
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:41,680
I'll break down what that means but you
got content coming from the internet

318
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,709
from a regular users

319
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,640
Internet from your own CMS extract from
your partner and his forces and feeds

320
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,180
any one of those different sources can
be compromised in also two different

321
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:50,599
ways

322
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,610
how do you trust your partner is
actually send you crack data

323
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,190
suppose you build an XML rest or even
self-service depending on

324
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:01,630
on how older legacy applications how you
actually know that the data that you're

325
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,870
getting is well-formed

326
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,300
are you reading this year on parsers are
validators very simply enforcing that

327
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,520
based on contract

328
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,900
or business business prospects Center
legacy applications are also huge risks

329
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,890
I can tell you how many times we've got
to talk to companies that say that

330
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:16,970
they've got twenty

331
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,839
to thirty thousand applications 20,000
applications

332
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,159
20,000 applications it's mind-blowing
these organizations that have been in

333
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,589
business for more than 20 years

334
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,720
and they've written all the applications

335
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,710
seein they progressed all the way back
up in another building applications and

336
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,400
scripting languages like Ruby et cetera

337
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,790
and they've got a lot of risk because
they haven't gone back and they haven't

338
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,780
made sure that those previous
applications

339
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,340
have actually been secure tester
battle-hardened oftentimes you get

340
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,370
security professionals

341
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:47,320
to build something and they'll even a
year year and a half depending on how

342
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,159
shop either

343
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,780
the market is and how this anybody know
exactly what that he suffer what's

344
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,790
up was a threat modeling was a risk
assessments done

345
00:17:55,790 --> 00:18:00,110
also precompiled an open source software
and I think this speaks to a lot of

346
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,459
people who run things like static
analysis tools

347
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,080
you're running solutions like their
country perry et cetera today

348
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,129
but how are you sure that the stuff
that's already been precompiled from the

349
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,840
past that you're now linking in with
your existing projects

350
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,370
is safe what about the open-source offer
that you're pulling and how do you know

351
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:19,570
that that's doing exactly what it should
be doing I think with open source it's a

352
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,629
lot easier because you have

353
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:24,290
the ability to going on at the source
but whose actually auditing sources

354
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,220
anyone on your team

355
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,960
actually going ahead and and withdraw
those things there's a mathematical

356
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,570
equation here

357
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,790
and it's an it's really hard to put into

358
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:37,850
and actual equation so absurdly to cover
it it's the fact that you have

359
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,760
adversaries today

360
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,510
and they have employment and craft
attack its promise your application is

361
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,900
split second defend itself

362
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,150
and there's a huge mismatch ur and

363
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,790
I think the other thing that's changed
in the last few years is that

364
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:55,930
the economics are such that hackers
awarded

365
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:59,080
their attackers word today because to
such a low barrier to entry

366
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,530
to grab any tool I can grab

367
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,879
for Nessus Metasploit

368
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,060
and I can't turn it loose as a script
kiddie against your web application

369
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:14,190
I can do all sorts of things and if I
find anything that goes through

370
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:18,250
Austin right and it didn't cost much to
perform in

371
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,920
understand all those things you guys
remember this

372
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,820
this is why I think a whole time
especially when you're high target

373
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,770
company your high target application

374
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:33,580
BBC you have no idea what's gonna hit
you

375
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,870
and you have no idea what it's gonna
hitch and oftentimes feels that

376
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:42,219
you're up against a wall I mean you have
no idea

377
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,000
what could possibly happen if you're
gonna get a phone call at 3am

378
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,910
to get called in to do cleanup we're
gonna have to do something

379
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:53,290
to to fix a problem in someone else's
code that was written

380
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,810
ten to twenty years ago such for some
numbers this

381
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:00,810
confines stuff it's is actually really
dizzying

382
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:04,720
I spent the last few days traveling on a
plane looking over a bunch different

383
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,520
statistics

384
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,060
and I picked out what I thought were
some the most impressive in

385
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,580
an interesting ones so according to
Gartner

386
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:16,879
haircuts here Gartner claims that
seventy percent of the attacks they're

387
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,740
happening against the application itself

388
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,290
so that means that while people are
trying to definitely go out your network

389
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,899
means a lot of people actually going
ahead and trying to hammer the

390
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,160
application over and over again

391
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,790
1 percent spending again was also
associated back to Gartner

392
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:34,280
is focused on ap sec only one percent a
knapsack

393
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:39,000
where's the 99 percent going is going to
traditional security is a growing

394
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,910
network security is going to training

395
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:44,640
where's that actually going to a dozen
plus attacks

396
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,940
this is derived from other pokémon
Institute the claim that

397
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,770
more than a thousand plus critical
attacks are tempted against big

398
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:57,240
average rotates or electricity every day
and I think this problem numbers poly a

399
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,970
lot higher considering that you can

400
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,410
again take any the existing tools and
you can run

401
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:05,300
across entire website sometime in
December over and over

402
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,680
and then won it once it is a community
service company in

403
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,370
ice for and I promise is the last time I
mention property is that

404
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,449
fifty percent of all UGC that we've
observed his company

405
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,720
especially from protecting the sense
that we have is actually all spam

406
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,750
and this is free from content that users
are posting comments: profiles messages

407
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:29,140
things like that so why is this number
moving up into the right lies is

408
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:29,750
increasing

409
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,770
it seems like you know we solved we
generally no

410
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:37,190
how to solve staffing we figure lower
basics

411
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:42,500
mid 2000's but Wise's number still going
up think a lot about her system with

412
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,210
developers

413
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:47,260
development teams and I think this just
in this huge culture clash

414
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,770
between security and development for the
long time I think

415
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:54,090
if you've worked in development you hate
security teams ish

416
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:57,790
you working security you hate developers
every side calls each other

417
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:02,020
dumb every side calls each other in
every side is your develop a recent

418
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,639
security teams making me do something
that you don't need to do

419
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,130
enter the security team you think that
every developer

420
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:12,040
has no idea what a buffer overflow or
across its cooking is ur

421
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,409
originally cut something up existing
tools aren't

422
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:18,590
good enough and Papa's here and

423
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:22,480
re-read that again the to say that we
have are not good enough

424
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,770
as a developer its seen the confusing

425
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:29,560
when I shut my space I didn't have a day
security training

426
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,190
or security background at all and I got
in there and

427
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:37,720
I didn't know across its cryptic lies I
learned about HTML including

428
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,100
and then I found out that there other
ways that you could include things

429
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,189
and I found out about other encodings
and

430
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,190
so forth and so on and it's confusing

431
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:51,889
and oftentimes as a developer you feel
in the wish that

432
00:22:51,889 --> 00:22:55,289
a lot of these practices refused into
the framework

433
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:59,090
says a developer did not necessarily
think about it but that'll such a

434
00:22:59,090 --> 00:22:59,678
magical

435
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,360
when you go to that extent you he
sometimes

436
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,519
don't understand what's happening in the
execution

437
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:10,460
seem like a web request we seen
frameworks like rails

438
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,110
I think rails as a lot of great things
every was a lot of complexity for

439
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,139
building an application in getting the
idea

440
00:23:16,139 --> 00:23:19,870
from what's in your head to market
pretty easily I think the key problem

441
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:20,768
though is this a lot

442
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:23,960
match going on unless you know exactly
what's what's happening

443
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,769
how's the router doing what it's doing
how does the controller no to talk to

444
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:28,309
the view

445
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:31,928
has an overpass did view its can be a
little weird

446
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:35,139
so wanna make sure that we're not
creating

447
00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:38,350
black magic for the developers either
because the they're gonna find

448
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,090
themselves in situations where content
is doubling code

449
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:44,439
content is DD coated and whether doing
things like

450
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,880
escaping content in places where the
solution be as I think we still relies

451
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,510
cultured

452
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,950
too much on pattern matching I say
culture because as developers and

453
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:53,899
security teams

454
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,908
we still rely too much on a something
went through

455
00:23:56,909 --> 00:24:00,299
okay let's run share placement what a
regular expression sprinter stuff from

456
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:00,700
Max

457
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,159
actually executing so let's go into a
case study

458
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,370
I'm paper together why developers it
actually think

459
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:12,469
but they can validate employed wish
regular expressions and especially

460
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:12,980
something like

461
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,039
HTML so I don't if you guys seen

462
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:19,580
the the Stack Overflow post I i wish i
had a copy of it here but

463
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,519
there's this insane Stack Overflow
thread I see some head nodding

464
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:27,100
social there's an insane Stack Overflow
thread where they talk about

465
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,439
how to parse HTML if the regular
expression and what starts off as

466
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,200
you know the first comment being on one
line regular expression

467
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,510
eventually evolves into you you have to
scroll for days in your web browser

468
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:43,370
you see this incredibly gnarly regular
expression and even then the first

469
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:45,719
comment to someone creating an exploit
to get around that

470
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,340
regular expression good look at it right
so

471
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,949
one we took a step back and realize
what's actually happening why we figure

472
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,070
out what the problem is

473
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:57,020
so protect cross-site scripting for
instance which is why we would be

474
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,610
parsing aged in on the first place

475
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:02,129
it's something that executes in your web
browser

476
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:06,640
process scripting is the ability for an
attacker to to basically execute robbers

477
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,740
JavaScript inside your web browser to
perform all sorts of activities

478
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,400
you guys already know that this could be
the computer X amount to about let's say

479
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,080
you could drop reader reporting website
still credentials horrible horrible

480
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,570
things

481
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:21,230
sir so what we trying to domain-specific

482
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:25,780
if we know the stuff is going to excuse
your browser what if we thought about

483
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:29,129
what the browser with you what if we
apply to those techniques on me

484
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,740
came to analyzing content cell for free
in a building

485
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,500
well I call a close eye compiler and
said you think about what's happening in

486
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,590
your web browser today

487
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,659
there watch lot a lot steps so

488
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,490
there's the network step which is gonna
go to fetch content server side it's

489
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,080
gonna grab

490
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,570
all those payloads kinda run-through the
browser's runtime: brazzers runtime:

491
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,429
will be things like

492
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:52,750
let's run tokenizer is it's decent
action houses

493
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,740
let's build the parser and eventually
goes to paint pixels into the DOM

494
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:01,100
and paint pixels is is interesting but
dats

495
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,490
post executioner that's really during
the execution case if we're talking

496
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:07,010
about regular expressions already
talking pre execution

497
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:10,879
one we bring the same techniques in the
same technologies that web browsers

498
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,780
already out today

499
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:16,060
but do all of that server-side and so

500
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:19,909
a brazzers sorta kinda does this and if
you were to do whatever side you not to

501
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,410
go ahead and alter geysers

502
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:25,120
syntax analyzers and parsers for things
like

503
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,500
HTML CSS JavaScript

504
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,310
there a lot of people who think that you
can use parser generators today

505
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:35,870
to to accomplish this task you can't and

506
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:41,020
you can't primarily because every single
web browser is very very different and

507
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,670
for instance browsers like Internet
Explorer allied to do some really fun

508
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,440
things like

509
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,770
you can break things on

510
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,010
new lines and you still see execution
you can insert

511
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:53,170
anthology the code utf8 Ruto 16
characters

512
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:56,760
insider attributes name sir insider
actually values

513
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,980
still create execution what happens when
there's a best-fit

514
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,930
with sequel server so we talk about
things like single injection

515
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:08,120
what happens when you're making request
a single server but detect the databases

516
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,330
Latin or ASCII and Unicode character
comes in

517
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,240
I learned this the hard way is that
there's what's to make our best fit

518
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,750
four tries to normalize things and
higher her character sets to

519
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:22,680
where you are right now rather than
simply tossing characters so

520
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,870
you can also use things like virtual
machines to try and do things like

521
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:30,360
under saying the execution don't involve
things like chasing or hooks

522
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,840
lot of things you can do but building
compilers and new

523
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,889
there's not this touching a rocket
science either

524
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:43,080
there's lotsa Toolz lotta techniques

525
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:50,080
smash sees

526
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:54,220
sry yes

527
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,070
C

528
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:00,310
sauce I'm

529
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,450
us

530
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:06,190
okay call thanks Julia

531
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:09,309
shotacon

532
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:13,840
building compilers new just awesome now
dole

533
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,629
building a compilers new la titles
techniques that you can look up

534
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:21,009
preacher realtor try and old one its

535
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:24,580
not too difficult i won

536
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,309
I really don't like shaming people but
in this case

537
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:31,479
let's actually run to resemble so you
guys

538
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:34,979
all know that he days news this week
what's horrible

539
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:38,599
sad things happening to nice company

540
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:42,330
day as a security team

541
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:47,149
are are exceptionally smart I know a lot
of the security engineers over there

542
00:28:47,149 --> 00:28:50,719
I think they run into you what we're
running into today which is

543
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,080
model all loss a legacy applications
awesome development teams

544
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,109
and it's hard as big security team stay
on topic you know

545
00:28:58,109 --> 00:29:01,428
all the things are going on inside the
company but

546
00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:05,450
starting with Italy's payloads are going
through so

547
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:08,950
this is a payload that was recently
discovered in the last two or three days

548
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:13,519
and this particular payload works on lap
start EV dot com

549
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:18,090
specifically in the content or the
contact form section so we see over here

550
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,349
mix content right and this is just

551
00:29:21,349 --> 00:29:25,220
what's being sent in the POST request
over so we are we see things like

552
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:30,509
form data name but we also see the
closing HTML tags

553
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:34,109
disclosing style tag closing script tag
its

554
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:38,228
opening script act is payload alert 1337
obviously

555
00:29:38,229 --> 00:29:42,940
that's going to do closing script eg
newline newline well

556
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,789
if we had a compiler rather than regular
expression what would we see

557
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:51,119
and I'm gonna be naive and assume we're
looking at the full payload including

558
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:51,549
the other

559
00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:53,918
directives the poster question that
includes things like

560
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,509
content-disposition: form data

561
00:29:55,509 --> 00:29:59,349
even though we don't have to but let's
assume even then we wanted to you

562
00:29:59,349 --> 00:30:03,789
compressed everything the post your
question analyzed

563
00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:06,789
spot we would see on the other side
power

564
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:10,470
or to the publishing process for
scrutiny rate all the different

565
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,169
allocates

566
00:30:11,169 --> 00:30:15,350
so things like text nodes closing
comment nodes

567
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:19,449
closing tag nodes tera the other values
associated with them

568
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,489
so in the case a plain text we know that
would be case attacks

569
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:26,840
wheels no doubt the benefit of having a
compiler those

570
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,609
we can start doing things like
touchdowns we know what's open

571
00:30:30,609 --> 00:30:33,869
we know it's closed we also have the
ability to also

572
00:30:33,869 --> 00:30:36,959
reconcile that with integration so mushy
something like

573
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,470
plain text we can run things like each
non-coding if you want

574
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:43,820
if we see something like a bad tagged
weekend Haas

575
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,999
if we see tags that are open that are
closed

576
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:51,259
weekend shift to closing time also see
closing tag that is an open

577
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:54,590
we can get rid of it we can make on
10-12 1

578
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:59,129
and we can do all of this on the server
side before content goes back to the

579
00:30:59,129 --> 00:31:00,779
browser or gets persisted again

580
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:05,629
and silky run it through this process
and you run these decisions steps

581
00:31:05,629 --> 00:31:08,998
on the right hand side you get said ties
up

582
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:12,220
on the other side and again crew
demonstration I even included

583
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,599
all the other POS printers in this case
the content disposition the point up

584
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:19,989
my favorite on where in the world loss I
distractions

585
00:31:19,989 --> 00:31:24,060
programmer Ryan Gosling telecom and this
one

586
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:27,990
absolute loss because I think it makes a
lotta sense especially when you start

587
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:33,020
going to validate things like HTML 11
May content well formed

588
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:36,520
you gonna try and understand analyze at
the same exact way

589
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,470
your browser's and again the sloppy
execution and when you want to get into

590
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:41,240
execution

591
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,800
they're gonna take it a step further put
into a virtual machine understand it

592
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,620
dissected

593
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,850
Hockett chases lots of things you can do

594
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:53,760
but again you have the intelligence to
use on servers so

595
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,320
hug me improve I think there's lots lots
waz

596
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,490
and for sale Sunday more controversial

597
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:05,440
thing I think a lot of people

598
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,860
believe this to feature I see this all
the time even as a security I see this

599
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,389
all the time

600
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,490
how does someone with a good idea

601
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:19,060
for someone in a security startup
compete was a big company like HP

602
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:23,379
how do you go out there and gain
traction in discharging

603
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:27,030
see where beans flooded by other
companies

604
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:30,230
that are constantly pushing what they
consider to be

605
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:34,400
the right solution for everything a
one-size-fits-all approach

606
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,800
it's tough it's tough being

607
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,320
the the small guy in the room especially
competing with hundreds of millions of

608
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,629
dollars marking budget we all hope

609
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,920
that the best ideas will emerge the top
but it's not necessarily true

610
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,020
under lock n

611
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,350
does create a false sense of security I
think

612
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:58,730
i've seen this again to these companies
were you buy from one vendor

613
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:02,560
and you're likely to buy from another
vendor again and so forth and so on

614
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,690
you bought our firewall now buyer Sam

615
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:09,880
are you bother Sen now by this log
analysis tool

616
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,280
okay and so forth

617
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:16,250
so on and eventually you realize that
poster sheet or chattels

618
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:22,100
meant and Tony Soprano standing over you
so I put the box here

619
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,320
from office space because I I think if
there's one thing that's clear its

620
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,439
everybody needs to be asking what we
actually do you

621
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,660
for these controls on the security side
actually do

622
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,850
actually solving a real problem yes or
no

623
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:40,100
and oftentimes just getting your average
developer

624
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,219
and asking them if he's building the
right things

625
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:46,480
more often than not will lead you to a
really interesting solution

626
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,890
me stupid conversation at least talking
to developers

627
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:53,920
even security engineers in US them hey
is a small application firewall is the

628
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,170
solution or employing

629
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:58,610
actually protecting us from something
and forcing them to answer an address

630
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:59,260
the issues

631
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:04,760
actually goes hands was a really good
thing data aggregation data collection

632
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,030
some I know you guys probably heard
everybody talk about big data

633
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:12,760
not an amount of on big data but i cant
the one thing that's

634
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,980
that's absolutely true least from aliens
if you could save

635
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:20,130
every memory you ever had when you

636
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:24,010
every experience that you've ever
encountered but what if we could do to

637
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:28,510
today I mean according to guys like Joe
Hamacher from

638
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:31,980
clutter recent talk reason as earlier
this year

639
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,820
obviously we see the cost step down
tremendously that the associated costs

640
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,740
with not only

641
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:40,639
disk storage but also for personnel for
equipment

642
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,560
failover redundancy et cetera restoring
a petabyte of information is roughly two

643
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,690
hundred thousand dollars today

644
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:49,060
a machine that cost dropped considerably
I remember

645
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,120
nearly two thousand times millions

646
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,130
data to store a petabyte information

647
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:57,400
an even-strength provided information
was gnarly because how are you handling

648
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,200
replication are you Taylor

649
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,319
weapons to corruption I can you guys
remember the

650
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,370
call cyclic redundancy check from this
year so

651
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:10,819
why MTV a argument you can totally make
again why me because

652
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,430
you know I get slapped around but this
totally works well

653
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:18,750
which is the if you wanna prove that you
know the value and

654
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:22,120
storing up elevated information or
storing a lot of this data you can try

655
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,480
make the claim that your exact

656
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,390
in the sea level sleep are you in your
VP with the corner cushy office

657
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:31,319
costs more and one year than a petabyte
does from multiple years

658
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,650
and again mileage may vary from that
argument sees it

659
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:38,360
appropriately logging is also incredibly
useless

660
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:42,070
everything I just said with sorry about
about information is useless

661
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:45,590
unless you've got the tools to mine its

662
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:50,550
if you can't understand are you can't go
back and perform forensics or look at

663
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,200
friend's ex

664
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,710
when you out yeah but I do know that
nobody's looking at nobody cares about

665
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,930
we actually won no what's going on

666
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:02,129
every single step of the way so we can
do what we call the people did announce

667
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,670
learn from our mistakes rip your
successes over and over again

668
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:09,630
understanding what's going wrong

669
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,630
or what went wrong takes way too long

670
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:17,300
I'm been able to parachute into all
sorts of interesting companies whether

671
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,230
it's a consulting

672
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:22,240
lawrence Yun company and we typically
found was that

673
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,479
a lot people not only options that are
DGL process easier to converse um

674
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,010
they've got steps were but it did it
comes from the website

675
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:34,040
to syslog syslog then goes into ATL

676
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:38,170
ETL store stuff into it she knew data
from the queue gets

677
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:42,090
aggregated eventually gets into size and
the Jason blobs

678
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:45,350
which eventually gets pledged into
something like a Splunk

679
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:49,700
whereby a certain process for not to
execute on an hourly or

680
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:54,169
interval to find needles in the haystack
self put the

681
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:58,740
are Sheila here how many you're familiar
with some repost else

682
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:03,399
awesome so up significantly important

683
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,440
when you work at the company's when
something goes wrong when there's a big

684
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,190
data breach when PI leaks

685
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:12,480
need to be able to go back in you got
your CEO you gots each year standing

686
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,790
over you pointing a finger

687
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:18,520
and basically in your years saying K I
need to know exactly where we dropped

688
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,009
the ball

689
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:23,370
and if you can produce a long line that
actually says or here's the actual

690
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,080
problem

691
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,299
while your tenure at the company's
policy not to be that long

692
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,490
unfortunately sergeant

693
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:34,350
seems to be horribly horribly slow ETL
can be

694
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:39,089
girl the time for some and as security
talks uneven as developers

695
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:43,040
we want the intelligence to know that a
tree is gonna hold down

696
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,660
be when the tree is falling down in as
it's falling down and see

697
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:51,940
tree actually did fall down one did Paul
finally if

698
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:56,350
on on the point of alerting I'll stop on
this point sure let system

699
00:37:56,350 --> 00:38:00,190
is predicated on log rotation to
identify significant options

700
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:03,490
you failed like if you're waiting

701
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:06,959
like on hourly window to report a breach

702
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,340
or significant event because that's just
what you do you because you're

703
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:14,440
piggybacking on your developers syslog
mechanism or anything like that you

704
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,000
failed

705
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,090
and

706
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:19,230
dot doesn't work so I

707
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,900
talked a lot I'll close off with a few
points there

708
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:27,560
first when we think about things like
that assist you'll see

709
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,620
which spoil her to the idea taking
security and suffered on the life cycle

710
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,799
in shinning security

711
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,720
into it around it you got the first up
which is things like risk assessment

712
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,419
threat modeling

713
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:41,210
doesn't stop at us urged talking about
things

714
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:44,990
and you talk about scanners contest
rules

715
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:48,509
anything like that that is sticks
anything you just on the problem

716
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:52,910
ultimately dole relies back on the
developer mean a lot of things I'd

717
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,370
change that the developers have

718
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:57,710
my child to hear have way more power

719
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:01,730
then you can possibly imagine they're
the ones are writing the code

720
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:05,240
they're the ones that know and have to
think about security

721
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,399
and unfortunately when there's a problem
that happens

722
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,960
they're the ones that you go to when it
comes to hit me up to fix the problem

723
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,120
so they're really capital and a lot
different steps

724
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:20,109
says to Nolan release games tried

725
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:23,580
ish you're getting hammered today here
in the company s

726
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:27,150
he's fine companies swell as obviously
play more

727
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:31,390
honey include even down here but going
back to the first point that we talked

728
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:31,680
about

729
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,149
is definitely hard comes face and

730
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:38,870
there's not one cure all even if you go
down the path to building one say

731
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:39,980
something like compiler

732
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:43,770
not assault every single issue just
gonna solve one part

733
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:47,650
one problem you have to think about all
the different pieces

734
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:51,550
to think about what's the right way to
build a good security program and just

735
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:52,580
know that it's difficult

736
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:56,480
but lotta really good morning things are
difficult

737
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,150
I think all this year love challenges
otherwise we wouldn't be talking with

738
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:03,920
board tinkering with the board's around
her neck when be here talking about

739
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,740
things like

740
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:08,180
Crossett scripting have fun stings how
to break things

741
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:14,790
some thank you guys or its

742
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:18,619
so holla

743
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:21,750
last few points up Freddie you can dies

744
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:25,070
email me if you wanna party or anything
like that and you can't really sweet

745
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:25,560
things

746
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:31,180
acted and as a shameless plug we are as
a security company in LA and work on

747
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,339
stay on the lookout for a great story
many people

748
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:36,730
all right here and now Los Angeles proud
to be yourself

749
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:39,800
you guys are interested stop on by and

750
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,830
anybody ask questions or anything of the
sort you have a

751
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:50,830
have you have a conversation

752
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:59,110
national accounts committee shirts
outside the highest

753
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,710
got Argus I'll be around its
