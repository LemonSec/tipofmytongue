1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:03,919
so

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,600
welcome to my talk on anti-picking

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,960
features of high security locks

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,480
uh who am i well uh i'm the uh

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,000
secretary of the open organization of

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,440
block pickers in the uk and i'm a locked

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,960
scion fanatic who has been grappling

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,800
with the problem of how to design an

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,560
unpickable mechanical lock

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,720
for about the last half a decade

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,760
uh why am i giving this talk then uh

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,119
well i'm giving the talk

13
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,559
uh with the hope that maybe if i run

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,239
through a lot of ingenious attempts to

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,280
solve the problem

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,079
uh other people will be inspired to

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,000
grapple with the problem themselves

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,399
and uh maybe you know they'll see

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,600
something they think they can improve

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,399
upon

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,520
or if nothing else just to show you some

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,399
very cool lock designs

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,039
uh in order to do this uh effectively in

24
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:55,840
this talk

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,960
uh the problem is that uh

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,000
i'm gonna have to talk about lock

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
picking in a very abstract way and the

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,440
main reason for that is i'm covering

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,000
such a

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,040
bro uh such a broad uh

31
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,200
variety of uh locking mechanisms

32
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,360
that i it's simply not going to be

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,880
possible to talk about this

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,920
in the same way that you would talk

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,439
about picking conventional pin tumbler

36
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,240
locks

37
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,600
um so i'm going to abstract this out

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,520
uh it's kind of the very fundamental

39
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,439
concepts in lock picking and then we

40
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,000
will attempt

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,600
to apply those uh to

42
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,158
the locks

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,400
hopefully in in an effective way

44
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
so first of all we have manipulation uh

45
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,920
manipulation is basically just the idea

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,320
that

47
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,520
we need to be able to move the

48
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,200
components inside the lock if we can't

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,479
move the components inside the lock

50
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,520
well then we're not going to be able to

51
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,000
get it open without the key

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,320
secondly uh we have tension so this

53
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,840
hinges on the fact that we can't produce

54
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,560
um we can't produce elements in a lock

55
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,719
perfectly they won't all be identical so

56
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,759
if we can apply

57
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,680
some kind of driving force in the open

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,119
direction

59
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,119
then we will get contact against those

60
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,159
blocking elements

61
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,840
inside the lock whether they be levers

62
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,440
or wafers or

63
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,959
sliders or discs or pins or whatever it

64
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:13,920
may be

65
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,360
um then

66
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,879
when we've got that kind of that that

67
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,040
force which is what i'm referring to its

68
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,879
tension then we will be able to get some

69
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,920
kind of information out of the lock

70
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,920
uh i have to be able to do both those

71
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,520
things at the same time we will see some

72
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,800
locks that have uh

73
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,440
ingenious mechanisms to try to prevent

74
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,959
you from doing them both at the same

75
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,640
time although you could do either one

76
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,400
relatively trivially

77
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,760
on its own and of course we're doing all

78
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,160
of that

79
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,760
in order to get information out of the

80
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,840
lock so

81
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,519
when we're able to apply tension and

82
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,879
manipulate mechanism

83
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,560
typically we will be able to get

84
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,000
feedback from the mechanism

85
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,720
although some locks attempt to make that

86
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,280
impossible

87
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,800
even if you can do both simultaneous

88
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,239
manipulation and tension

89
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,159
we are not considering drilling snapping

90
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,680
cylinder or dial pulling angle grinders

91
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,120
excessive torque melting thermal last

92
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,800
explosive liquid nitrogen or chemical

93
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,440
attacks

94
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,040
or any other destructive attack

95
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,480
that is a different problem uh for for

96
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,480
some high security locks um they will

97
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,280
use a re-locker so this is a sacrificial

98
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,360
portion in front of the lock

99
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,879
and if you were to destroy the

100
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,799
sacrificial portion say using

101
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,959
any of the aforementioned methods on

102
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,000
this slide

103
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,879
uh you will trip the relocker mechanism

104
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,280
and

105
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,959
the whole thing will brick itself

106
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,319
whether that be a vault door

107
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,760
or a safe or whatever it may be

108
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,280
so these are a not a quick way

109
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,480
to get through all locks uh particularly

110
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,760
high security implementations but

111
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,560
secondly although these are things you

112
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,920
may wish to consider when designing a

113
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,280
high security lock

114
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,239
just keep in mind that is not always uh

115
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:00,799
something

116
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,599
that is a priority for the locks that

117
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,879
we'll be looking at today

118
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,920
simply because that whole this whole

119
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,599
problem can be shifted elsewhere and

120
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,798
doesn't have to lie on the lock

121
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,560
we're also not considering direct cam

122
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,160
actuation over lifting bumping snap guns

123
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,440
triac keys rapping jiggly keys

124
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,639
impressioning self-impressioning

125
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,399
decoding with a visual audio or any

126
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,040
other method

127
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,040
x-ray attacks or ultrasonic attacks

128
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,479
these are all attacks that you will want

129
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,080
to consider if you are designing a high

130
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,720
security

131
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,759
mechanical lock but realistically this

132
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,560
talk will be

133
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,720
too long if i try to cover all of these

134
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,120
things so instead i will focus on lock

135
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,120
picking because it is

136
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,800
in a very narrow sense because it is

137
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,160
probably the best known

138
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,440
uh and probably the best understood uh

139
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,400
of the attacks you can ask me about any

140
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,960
of these

141
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,360
other attacks in uh questions after the

142
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,440
talk

143
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,320
so first off the most common attempt to

144
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,919
make unpickable locks has hinged around

145
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,520
the idea of making the mechanism

146
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,840
impossible to manipulate

147
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,759
so the the kind of earliest examples

148
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,479
that we had were heavily warded locks

149
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,680
and this was an incredibly effective

150
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,160
technique uh back when there were only a

151
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,320
handful a tiny handful of people who had

152
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,759
the required skills

153
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,800
knowledge equipment

154
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,759
and so on and so forth to manufacture

155
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,160
these

156
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,960
locks and the corresponding keys so here

157
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,039
we can see quite an intricate example

158
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,680
of a boarded lock um and you can see

159
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,919
that essentially the way it works is

160
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,759
if you have a key cut with a matching

161
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,520
pattern then it can pass through

162
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,320
these wards hence the term word boarded

163
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,199
lock

164
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,400
and the rest of the mechanism is

165
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,320
essentially just a single lever that

166
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,960
once lifted allows the bolt to move

167
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,280
so essentially if you can get uh if you

168
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,360
can get something sufficiently long

169
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,600
through this uh through the obstacles

170
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,120
and the wards and this lock

171
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,320
then you will be able to retract the

172
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,800
bolt and open the lock

173
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,160
today that doesn't work so well just

174
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,840
because manufacturing has kind of moved

175
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,000
on a bit

176
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,759
here's a modern implementation of

177
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,120
basically the same principle it still

178
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,479
survives today

179
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,880
this is a heavily warded lock designed

180
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,199
by urban hawk but in a pin tumbler

181
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,479
design and it features a very

182
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,280
paracentric

183
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,280
keyway so this is a keyway where there

184
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,800
is basically no straight line that you

185
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,479
can cut down the middle

186
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,919
and there is no pick thin enough that

187
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,000
will have free travel up and down

188
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,280
inside that keyway um

189
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,560
but this is a a relatively

190
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,400
basic attempt to prevent lock-picking

191
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,759
attacks uh

192
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,000
as much as i respect all the work urban

193
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,600
hawk has done on his design

194
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,360
um so we shall move onwards

195
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,400
to um a more complex design

196
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,479
uh the previous design is very effective

197
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,759
at warding things uh

198
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,360
in terms of your pick movement left and

199
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,120
right and up and down uh

200
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,639
but of course the lock would be more

201
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,880
secure if we could also create some kind

202
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,000
of warding

203
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,400
uh as we travel into the lock in that

204
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,360
third dimension

205
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,039
and that's exactly what the layers chain

206
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,680
key lock attempts to do

207
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,440
the uh this works as a conventional pin

208
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,800
double lock except

209
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,880
the key is made of lots of little

210
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,199
segments that are hinged together

211
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,319
and the key is injected into the lock uh

212
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,000
which allows you to then travel around

213
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,400
these three dimensions of warding as you

214
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,000
go into the lock

215
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,440
a much earlier example is the

216
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,440
schneckenschloss which translates as

217
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,720
snail lock from germany i believe

218
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,080
um and uh

219
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,960
here we have a thin key that winds in

220
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,520
through

221
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,680
an obstruction at the front of the lock

222
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,880
which we can

223
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,319
kind of see that on the left hand side

224
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,800
here that obstruction and so again

225
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,400
there's no straight pick that you could

226
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,000
push into this lock in order to

227
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,639
set the elements correctly

228
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,800
is uh another example of kind of this

229
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,680
idea of

230
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,440
creating heavy warding although this

231
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,360
time not in three dimensions uh what we

232
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,440
what we have here is uh the tan reliance

233
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,080
which was an

234
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,280
1800s bank lock and

235
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,440
the key feature here is that uh so this

236
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,560
was the lever lock with

237
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,280
lots of levers kind of shaped like this

238
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
uh but the special feature here is this

239
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,400
is a lever lock

240
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,800
that has this half moon shaped piece of

241
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,400
boarding that's actually attached to one

242
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,280
of the levers

243
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,199
and we can see that that would fit then

244
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,800
this l-shaped cut in this key

245
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,720
and the problem that you've got here is

246
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,919
that traditionally if you were going to

247
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:20,720
attempt to

248
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,039
pick a lever lock well you have a wire

249
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,720
that simulates the

250
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,960
the typically the end of the key and

251
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,800
that gets inserted into the lock and is

252
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,879
used to try to retract the bolt

253
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,200
and when the bolt stump then presses

254
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,640
against the levers

255
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,958
um we would use a another pick wire in

256
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:39,519
order to

257
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,559
manipulate those levers into the correct

258
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,679
positions

259
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,160
but that is an l-shaped wire and that

260
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,839
would simply not be able to get around

261
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:48,240
this

262
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,800
l-shaped board so we'd have to come up

263
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,480
with some more complex design

264
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,120
possibly involving multiple pick wires

265
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,760
with

266
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,640
intricate bends in them in order to get

267
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,920
around that l-shaped

268
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,519
piece of wood inside the lock

269
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,680
here's a a modern implementation of the

270
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,640
tan reliance

271
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,240
albeit done much less well uh

272
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,920
using a pin tumbler mechanism

273
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,600
uh and then again in a slightly

274
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,880
different direction but still on the

275
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,600
same theme

276
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,320
we have the warm held meter lock so this

277
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,279
was used on gas meters in the uk

278
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,160
and essentially the the principle behind

279
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,720
this is

280
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,279
the same rough idea is what makes the uh

281
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,880
the sofa problem in mathematics

282
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,600
challenging

283
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,839
the sofa problem is essentially this uh

284
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,200
this problem of

285
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,959
designing a shape that's quite good at

286
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,120
getting around a right angled bend in a

287
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,600
corridor

288
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,680
and so we have this large cylindrical

289
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,160
obstruction right at the front of this

290
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,959
lock

291
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,600
and the wall mould meter lock key has a

292
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,720
moving

293
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,959
tooth in the end of it basically and so

294
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,720
that retracts as it travels down the

295
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,440
channel

296
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,079
and then it extends once it's inside the

297
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,240
lock and is able to set the single lever

298
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,680
inside this lock

299
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,560
and open it however from a picking

300
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,760
perspective

301
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,920
if you don't have a tool with a moving

302
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,959
end

303
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,880
then you run into quite a conundrum you

304
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
can either have a pick wire

305
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,720
that is long enough to lift that lever

306
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,320
into the correct height

307
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,160
but then it won't fit down that

308
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,399
cylindrical channel

309
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,399
or you can have a pick that does fit

310
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,839
down that cylindrical channel

311
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,920
but then it won't be long enough to set

312
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,839
the lever at the bottom

313
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,079
then we have the rosengrens 32a81 this

314
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:38,959
is a

315
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,480
swedish lock designed by the swedish

316
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,360
safe

317
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,480
company rosengrens and it uses a

318
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,760
curtain um to protect the discs

319
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,360
inside so the way this mechanism works

320
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,600
is it has a large number of discs inside

321
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,519
that need to be rotated to the correct

322
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,720
degree uh and if that is done correctly

323
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,760
then the

324
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,519
gates cut into them all aligned to make

325
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,680
one nice long slot and there is a bar

326
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,959
that can drop in

327
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,720
in what is called a side bar mechanism

328
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,839
in order to allow the lock to open

329
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,160
but most distant hand locks do not

330
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,519
feature a curtain

331
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,320
a curtain is this this piece of movable

332
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,880
warding

333
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
in the center of this lock this turns

334
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,560
one to one with the key

335
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,800
but it makes it impossible to insert any

336
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,079
kind of conventional

337
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,839
uh disc detainer picking tool

338
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,000
then we come to the abloy classic this

339
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,760
is also a dis detainer

340
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,120
um this one has a very iconic

341
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,360
half moon shape this is a finished

342
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,320
design

343
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,920
and um uh

344
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,920
this was considered uh very very

345
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,560
difficult to pick for a very long time

346
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,760
um but the the

347
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,600
the key here the reason why it's so

348
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,440
difficult to pick is we have a half moon

349
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,000
shaped

350
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,519
opening in the front of the lock but the

351
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,639
but in terms of the possible

352
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,639
configurations of discs a minimum

353
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,519
movement disc

354
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,200
does not move at all and the maximum

355
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,560
movement disc has to move

356
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,880
90 degrees and it turns out it's

357
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,800
incredibly difficult to design a pick

358
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,160
that is both capable of turning

359
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,200
one of these discs 90 degrees and yet is

360
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,560
small enough to fit through the

361
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,519
remaining gap

362
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,360
if you find yourself unfortunate enough

363
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,560
to be faced with a

364
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,120
maximum and a minimum cut disk right

365
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,480
next to each other inside the lock

366
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,399
mechanism

367
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,639
huxley pig has written a paper on this

368
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,480
where he goes into much more detail on

369
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,760
exactly how this

370
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,079
works i highly recommend reading it if

371
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,200
you can find a copy

372
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,720
and then finally we get onto the

373
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,120
conforty safety deposit box lock

374
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,040
so this is used for safety deposit boxes

375
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,480
that's why we have two

376
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,279
uh kind of two openings for keys here we

377
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,639
think we have a

378
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,639
one on the left and we have this much

379
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,839
more complicated

380
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,839
uh mechanism on the right and we will be

381
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,880
focusing on the mechanism on the right

382
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,639
uh what's curious about this is we we

383
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,160
have these two levers that are connected

384
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,720
together

385
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,480
uh like a jigsaw um and while it is

386
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,639
relatively trivial to set this uh the

387
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,839
upper lever

388
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,240
uh that's not too difficult at all the

389
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,480
problem is that um

390
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,720
the bolt stump that wants to enter the

391
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,320
gate in the uh

392
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,720
in the top lever is attached to the same

393
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,680
piece of metal

394
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,480
uh as the bolt stump uh for the bottom

395
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,279
lever

396
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,480
for each of these lever pairs and so

397
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,720
once we once we set that top lever and

398
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,079
the bolt stump for the top

399
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,480
enters that uh gate a little bit and

400
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,399
holds helps hold that up in place

401
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,560
uh we then attempt to set the lower

402
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,519
lever

403
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,240
but the uh this curve on the uh on the

404
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,760
edge of this lever is very cunningly

405
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,639
designed

406
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,320
so that as we get closer and closer to

407
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,160
the gate on the lower lever

408
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,760
what we find is we find that we are

409
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,680
pushing backwards against that bolt

410
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,639
stamp

411
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,680
and if we if we want to set it correctly

412
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,000
well

413
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,360
we're going to have to allow that bolt

414
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,120
stump to move backwards a little bit and

415
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,639
the problem there is if we allow that

416
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,480
backwards a little bit while we release

417
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,079
the lever above

418
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,839
and then they both drop and then we have

419
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,760
gotten nowhere and so with any

420
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,199
conventional picking tool

421
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,639
you will be caught in an infinite loop

422
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,800
of set top lever

423
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,560
attempt to set bottom lever and as you

424
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,480
attempt to set bottom libra release top

425
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,040
lever

426
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,480
resetting the whole thing and having to

427
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,040
start over

428
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,000
so now we come onto onto designs uh

429
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,680
that attempt to make it very difficult

430
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,440
to apply tension to the mechanism

431
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,720
even though it might be quite easy to

432
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,040
reach the various components and move

433
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,800
them around

434
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
so the first example we have is the van

435
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,760
lock this is a tubular lock

436
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,560
and we can see the seven pins there and

437
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,240
what's curious about this is the seven

438
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,160
pins come flush with the face of the

439
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,959
lock

440
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,880
and so this means there is basically no

441
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,279
surface to grasp or gain purchase on to

442
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,199
apply tension to the lock

443
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,360
the way the key does it is it has prongs

444
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,880
that stick into the

445
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,399
pin channels which sets them to the

446
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,079
correct depths

447
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,079
but then is also used to tension off

448
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,839
and since some of the possible pins

449
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,560
that can exist in a van lock include a

450
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,040
zero

451
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,560
movement pins so pins that must not be

452
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,880
moved at all it can be actually quite

453
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,440
challenging

454
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,560
to pick this lock using any conventional

455
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,959
method

456
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,959
we then have the gold atoms this is a

457
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,240
very cheap chinese

458
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,399
made padlock but it has a very curious

459
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,440
mechanism

460
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,480
uh it uses a reverse sidebar mechanism

461
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,079
and the way a reverse sidebar mechanism

462
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,320
works is it has its own springs that

463
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,959
bias it

464
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,800
constantly in the opening direction so

465
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,079
we don't have to apply attention to this

466
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:40,800
lock

467
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,639
um because it is constantly trying to

468
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,920
open itself

469
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,560
the problem arises that uh the pins that

470
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,040
have the

471
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,120
the gates in it for the uh for the for

472
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,880
this sidebar to drop into

473
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,560
uh they also have their own springs and

474
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,079
those springs are stronger

475
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,199
than the sidebar springs so

476
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,160
we are unable to tension the lock uh in

477
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,480
any conventional way and because of that

478
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,120
uh when we set any pin to a correct

479
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,519
height

480
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,880
it's not very difficult to reach the

481
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,040
pins uh the problem is they won't stay

482
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,519
there

483
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,440
because as soon as you set one you have

484
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,519
no control over the amount of tension

485
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,199
that the lock tensions itself entirely

486
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,880
on its own terms

487
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,079
and so as soon as you move on to

488
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,920
manipulate another pin well that first

489
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,279
pin drops back down again

490
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,800
and this applies to any one of the pins

491
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,160
and it doesn't matter whether or not it

492
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,800
would be

493
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,519
correct in the binding order or not

494
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,079
there is

495
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,320
simply no way to progress unless you can

496
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,079
find another way to apply tension

497
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,880
to the mechanism

498
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,600
um unfortunately that image hasn't

499
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,959
loaded which is a little bit awkward

500
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,440
but i've got this image so the uema 750

501
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,399
is uh

502
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,160
is an interesting mechanism so this is a

503
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,880
chinese-made um

504
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,160
euro eurocylinder as well uh this one is

505
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,320
a little bit more fancy

506
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,560
it is again a reverse sidebar mechanism

507
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,720
uh but this one actually uses a reverse

508
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,519
sidebar in

509
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,440
two parts uh and the benefit of that is

510
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,079
in this particular

511
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,000
configuration if you attempt to tension

512
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,599
the lock it will just spin

513
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,199
round and round and round and round and

514
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,959
round and round

515
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,959
and the way it achieves that is it has a

516
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,400
front portion to the plug

517
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,039
and has a back portion to the plug and

518
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,880
only when this reverse sidebar mechanism

519
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,240
when both parts of the reverse sidebar

520
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,839
mechanisms were allowed to drop inwards

521
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,119
by having these sliders correctly

522
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,439
aligned can the front part be locked to

523
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:26,880
the back part and therefore open the

524
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,079
lock

525
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,919
so here we can see the lock with an

526
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,679
incorrect key inserted

527
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,400
and we can see that we have we have

528
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:34,799
these

529
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,960
silver sliders which have this v shaped

530
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,000
cut in them here

531
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,799
not correctly aligned we have this lower

532
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,240
portion of the reverse sidebar

533
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,600
and we have this little upper portion of

534
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,880
the reverse sidebar that is sitting

535
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,400
above the shear line

536
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,120
outside the outer circumference of that

537
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,960
plug

538
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,400
and so when we turn the key

539
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,559
i'll turn the plug with the wrong key

540
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,000
inserted

541
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,160
well nothing happens essentially

542
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,200
uh however if we insert the correct key

543
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,360
as we can see here we see both parts of

544
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,799
the reverse sidebar mechanism

545
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,840
do drop in and then what happens is the

546
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,280
the cam moves and we might be able to

547
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,000
see that

548
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,559
up on the top left hand side of this

549
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,280
here

550
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,840
that uh that that actually turns

551
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,600
so that brings us on to the crankshaft

552
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
lock and this is a lock that i had

553
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,360
quite a bit of trouble categorizing um

554
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,440
but i i think i've settled on on leaving

555
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,160
it here and this is a concept i don't uh

556
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,280
to the best of my knowledge it's never

557
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,720
been produced or at least hasn't been

558
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,120
produced yet um

559
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,520
uh but it's a ten slider lock uh these

560
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,480
sliders are these

561
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,720
little reddish pink portions we can see

562
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,559
over here and they have gates in them

563
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,000
and when all those gates are correctly

564
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,080
aligned this sidebar can drop it the

565
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,960
thing that's uh

566
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,840
difficult about this lock though is um

567
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,360
it's not very hard to see how to tension

568
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:01,679
it

569
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,640
uh we just need the correct tip on the

570
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,840
end of our tool

571
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,000
in and and just turn that in order to

572
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,200
apply uh

573
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,440
tension to the mechanism but the problem

574
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,240
is if you

575
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,760
design a tool with a straight shaft um

576
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,600
well it's very likely that that's just

577
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,960
not going to fit into the lock as we can

578
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,880
see on the right hand side here

579
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,240
with this convenient diagram there is no

580
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,440
straight line down the center of this

581
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,160
lock

582
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,640
to get there and the problem with just

583
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,679
creating a curve

584
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,919
as we can see with this illustrated uh

585
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,200
potential tool

586
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,720
um well we don't know what the curve has

587
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,760
to be the curve is

588
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,919
entirely dictated by the slider

589
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,440
positions and we can't know what the

590
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,120
correct positions on the sliders are and

591
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,120
so we can apply attention to the lock

592
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,520
so that's another very clever design

593
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,480
that brings me on to the chroma

594
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,240
protector the penultimate lock

595
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,039
in this portion uh this is a lock i have

596
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,480
given a talk on

597
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,720
at the defcon lock picking village last

598
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,320
year there's also a talk that

599
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,000
uh iago fargoland has given a talk on uh

600
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,159
a much better talk entitled uh the

601
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:09,919
unpickable chroma protector

602
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,640
uh for all set con and i highly

603
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,159
recommend watching his talk if you're

604
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,200
interested in this lock mechanism

605
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,039
the interesting thing about this lock is

606
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,880
that it is a wafer lock

607
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,039
i have often seen it categorized as a

608
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:23,919
lever lock

609
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,960
uh that is certainly not correct

610
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,000
um but i guess the reason is because

611
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,280
most people don't believe that one of

612
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,400
the most secure locks

613
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,360
ever designed uh is actually a wafer

614
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,080
lock

615
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,240
uh the thing that is particularly uh

616
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,559
secure about this wafer lock compared to

617
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,000
conventional wafer locks

618
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,320
that you will see on low security

619
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,120
cabinets

620
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,400
and that sort of thing uh is that the uh

621
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,200
the wafers

622
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,720
look like this and uh

623
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,679
the the key only can apply tension to

624
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,480
the core

625
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,520
uh via the wafers

626
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,960
and so what's unique about wafers is

627
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,919
if you are if you have a wafer lock that

628
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,799
is designed in this

629
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,200
sorted configuration then you can make

630
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,559
it impossible to tension the lock

631
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,320
without first having aligned at least

632
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,159
one wafer so in this case what

633
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,600
what we would see is um that the uh

634
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,760
the key is going to be longer at any

635
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,520
given portion on one side

636
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,919
than the other and as we turn that

637
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,120
inside the lock

638
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,120
uh the longer side will make contact

639
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,159
with the inside of the wafer first

640
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,000
and that will result in a lateral motion

641
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,840
a side to side motion

642
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,600
um pardon me

643
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,039
in a lateral motion first until the

644
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,720
other side of the key makes contact with

645
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,480
the other side of the wafer

646
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,400
so that's what we see when the lock

647
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,840
starts to turn because at that point the

648
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,679
wafer can no longer move side to side it

649
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,440
is jammed in place by the key

650
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,120
and so that rotational force in the key

651
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,640
is then transferred to the wafer and

652
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,000
that is then transferred to the core

653
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,720
which is that

654
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,840
blue portion of your scene

655
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,120
of course if that weren't intimidating

656
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,240
enough this is the border panzer design

657
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,039
that is the exact same sort of mechanism

658
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,799
uh but this time it features

659
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,679
uh wafers that slide uh left and right

660
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,880
and up and down

661
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,840
and uh the key features four beards so

662
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,679
uh this is a

663
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,840
phenomenally complex to pick

664
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,679
and unfortunately very rare

665
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,159
a much simplified and much smaller

666
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,120
format design

667
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,039
on the same principle is the chub ava

668
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,559
uh this is a a very small uh wafer lock

669
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,200
that is occasionally found in the uk and

670
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,799
uh it works on the exact same design

671
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,919
principles just with

672
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,640
fewer options

673
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,559
and that leaves me finally

674
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,000
finally to uh to the drive cam mechanism

675
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,200
that you can find in many safe locks not

676
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:03,520
just

677
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,919
or many combination dial safe locks not

678
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,200
just uh this

679
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,440
model 6741 made by sargent in greenleaf

680
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,440
but this is the one i happen to have so

681
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,960
this is the one

682
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,440
i will be using as an example what we

683
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,240
have here is

684
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,799
we have a number of different wheels

685
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,320
which are these silver portions that

686
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,799
have a gate cut into them

687
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,960
and this strange lever shaped thing

688
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,159
actually hides a bar

689
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,039
that rests along those levers and when

690
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:31,919
the gates in

691
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,080
the wheels are sorry wheels when the

692
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,520
gates and those wheels are correctly

693
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,159
aligned

694
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,520
underneath this uh this nose portion

695
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,559
uh then it can drop in and open the lock

696
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,880
and uh you might have noticed that

697
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,279
there's a little corner of a spring here

698
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,840
on this on this lever and uh that

699
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,640
constantly

700
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,120
biases the the lever against the wheels

701
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,799
so the mechanism is constantly under

702
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,080
tension

703
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,120
but the problem that we do have is this

704
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,080
black portion

705
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,080
and forgives the fact that this the

706
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,080
camera angle changes slightly here

707
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,919
um the the this black portion moves one

708
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,039
to one with the dial

709
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,720
and it's necessary to move that before

710
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,480
you can move any of the wheels

711
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,279
and so the problem is in this position

712
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:17,679
uh

713
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,799
that the the nose drops in slightly

714
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,200
uh because it has space it matches the

715
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,039
gate in the drive cam

716
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,200
uh and so at this point we have tension

717
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,480
against the wheels

718
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,039
but anywhere else that we move this this

719
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,159
drive cam

720
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,440
uh the the drive cam causes the the nose

721
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,360
to lift up

722
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,480
or the lever to lift up um and at this

723
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,840
point there is no contact against the

724
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,039
wheels and so

725
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,880
there is no way of tensioning the

726
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,720
mechanism uh unless

727
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,279
we are inside that little gate in the

728
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,279
drive cam

729
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,600
but unfortunately that also means that

730
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,400
we only have

731
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,360
any tension against the mechanism for uh

732
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,760
a tiny portion of the dial

733
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,240
that brings me on to mechanisms uh that

734
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,000
attempt to prevent simultaneous tension

735
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
and manipulation so we are typically

736
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,440
looking at blocking mechanisms here

737
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,960
uh the first and for those that are

738
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,400
aware of blocking mechanisms perhaps one

739
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,919
of the most famous examples

740
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,000
is the western electric 30c this is an

741
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,640
american pay phone lock

742
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,400
or was an american pay phone lock and

743
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,000
what's curious about this is it's it's a

744
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,559
lever lock um

745
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,600
and the the way that it works is we

746
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,679
we have a bolt stump that needs to come

747
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,840
across and test the levers

748
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,400
uh and we can move the levers as freely

749
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,360
as we like

750
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,360
uh but when we apply tension before the

751
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,559
bolt stop can come across

752
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,960
this serrated lever grabber interacts

753
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,679
with the

754
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,279
points on the tips of the levers and

755
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,279
immobilizes them

756
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,720
so here we can see the gate on

757
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,600
on the levers and we can see the uh the

758
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,320
stump

759
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,400
uh trying to enter that uh but we can

760
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,159
also see the lever grabber has already

761
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,799
grabbed all of those levers so we can

762
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,720
move the levers or we can apply tension

763
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,880
but when we apply tension

764
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,240
the levers are immobilized and we can no

765
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,159
longer move them so uh that makes

766
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:12,960
picking this lock

767
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,000
phenomenally difficult

768
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,039
we also have the fisheye 787 this uses a

769
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,880
very complicated mechanism

770
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,320
um i've i've colored in the patent

771
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,520
diagram

772
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,520
uh that i've found on on lock wiki um

773
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,320
and essentially uh this red portion is

774
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,919
the key

775
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,200
the key directly interacts with some

776
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,000
levers the lever then turns to gear

777
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,080
the gear has a gate and here on the left

778
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,679
hand side we can see all those gates

779
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:42,640
aligned

780
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,559
and then before the gates and the wheels

781
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,559
are tested there is a blocking mechanism

782
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:47,440
which is this

783
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,080
kind of blob to the to underneath the

784
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,440
orange gear

785
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,559
that has to engage with the wheels

786
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,640
or the gears before they're tested again

787
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,600
preventing them from being rotated

788
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,440
uh which again makes it very difficult

789
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,760
to pick the lock

790
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,400
the abloy protec and protect2 are also

791
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,320
locks that include a blocking mechanism

792
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:08,799
although

793
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,240
this time in a distant format

794
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,240
the nato mersey lock on the other hand

795
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,720
uses a slightly different mechanism

796
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,200
to achieve its blocking which i will

797
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,679
attempt to explain

798
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,360
uh the the curious thing about this is

799
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,840
uh so this is a 14 lever lever lock that

800
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,279
normally features two sets of levers but

801
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,240
what we see here

802
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,000
is we see only a single lever

803
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,279
uh and this has been set up so that it's

804
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,520
much easier uh to kind of illustrate the

805
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,640
way the mechanism works

806
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,640
so thank you to automaton for that um

807
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,760
we have this kind of uh strange uh

808
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,440
element here with a nose and um

809
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,559
add a pivot which is this portion here

810
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,000
we can see the corresponding one up here

811
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,600
as well that's the pivot for it

812
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,600
and there's the nose on the end of it

813
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,039
and uh here we can see

814
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,360
there is a pivot for the levers and the

815
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,399
pivot for the levers

816
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,679
is inside this pivoting portion itself

817
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,320
so when we apply tension to the lock uh

818
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,200
conventionally

819
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,480
what happens is um the these two

820
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,200
uh stumps which are attached to the bolt

821
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,080
they just move

822
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,520
nicely into the gate when we use the

823
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,080
correct key and the lock opens totally

824
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,520
normally

825
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,840
however if we apply tension and

826
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,279
everything is not already in the correct

827
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,159
position

828
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,760
then what happens is the bolt stumps

829
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,360
press against the levers

830
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,440
and the levers press against their own

831
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,960
pivots

832
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,559
and the pivots then cause these elements

833
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,159
to move and when they rotate around

834
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:40,880
their pivots

835
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,039
they drop this kind of nose in into a

836
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,240
corresponding slot

837
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,600
inside the bolt work and immobilize the

838
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,320
bolt

839
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,480
and so when you when you attempt to

840
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,919
tension the lock in the open direction

841
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:52,960
then

842
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,640
what you find very quickly is none of

843
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,480
the levers are binding up and instead

844
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,360
you are basically

845
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,399
just uh blocking the bolt um

846
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,320
with these these two noses um

847
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,919
which makes this lock phenomenally

848
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,640
difficult to pick

849
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,600
more recently we've had uh shane's stuff

850
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,360
lock

851
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,799
which i believe is uh about

852
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,080
sometime late last year uh where shane

853
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,720
who has a youtube channel where he

854
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,399
he does all sorts of interesting

855
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,080
engineering projects he thought he'd

856
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,120
turn his hand

857
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,640
to the problem of creating an unpickable

858
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,120
mechanical lock and by his own admission

859
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,720
it was much harder than he thought it

860
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,360
would be which i find validating

861
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,840
but essentially the way his lock worked

862
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,320
is it would uh set the pins

863
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,520
to um a given set of heights

864
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,840
and then it would immobilize those pins

865
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,520
and then as you turn the key

866
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,360
you would lose access to those pins you

867
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,960
could not reach them and then the pins

868
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,159
would be tested

869
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,440
against a complex kind of series of

870
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,480
warding

871
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,039
um i highly recommend i highly recommend

872
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,320
watching his video

873
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,039
uh because he he does give you and i

874
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,720
have much better idea than i can

875
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,480
of how his lock works uh

876
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,360
and it's quite fun

877
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,039
uh that leaves us uh with locks

878
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,080
that attempt to deaden feedback

879
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,399
um despite perhaps being able to tension

880
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,000
them or manipulate them

881
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,480
so coming back to the uh sergeant green

882
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,360
leaf

883
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,480
6741 this is a combination dial safe

884
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,200
lock

885
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,960
and although it's it's quite tricky

886
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,399
because you can't really tension the

887
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:39,919
mechanism very easily

888
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,520
um turns out that is not a completely

889
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,320
impossible

890
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,640
lock to manipulate and so there are

891
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,279
various combination dial safe locks

892
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,279
which while having the benefit that um

893
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,799
that they largely dictate how you can

894
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,720
interact with it uh so you know you

895
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,919
don't have a key way you can't insert

896
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:59,039
your own tools

897
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,399
you basically only have the option to

898
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,840
turn left or right on the dial

899
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,720
um they have then on top of that attempt

900
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,480
to incorporate mechanisms to make it

901
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,440
very difficult

902
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,399
to get any feedback out of them so one

903
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,600
of these is another lock made by

904
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,080
sergeant

905
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,279
greenleaf this is the 8550

906
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,399
and the way this works is um where

907
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,760
you're going to have to look past this

908
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,640
large silver sprung element but we we

909
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,640
again have a drive cam this time

910
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,039
in a brass color we have our wheels

911
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,120
which we can see behind here

912
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,640
largely alive we have this curious

913
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,240
little

914
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,240
silver portion attached to the drive cam

915
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,679
and we have this rather odd

916
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,519
silver thing attached here as well you

917
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,360
can see behind that there is also

918
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,559
what looks to be and is a

919
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,880
and otherwise largely normal uh lever

920
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,120
nose

921
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,480
and the thing that's that's curious

922
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,720
about this is uh in this particular

923
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,679
position

924
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,960
uh the the lever is held up by this

925
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,320
spring and is not touching the wheels

926
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,039
but as we turn the drive cam uh this

927
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,720
silver portion will make contact against

928
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,159
the slope

929
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,279
and it will push the uh this

930
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:12,159
silver portion up over this little ledge

931
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,679
and it kind of clicks in

932
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,240
above this ledge and it's held there and

933
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,919
what that does is it basically

934
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:19,919
stores a lot of uh stores a lot of

935
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,320
kinetic energy

936
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,000
in this kind of spring and the drive cam

937
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,440
itself can actually move

938
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,000
front to back so kind of depth wise as

939
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,320
we look into the picture

940
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,120
and that means that the mechanism can be

941
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,399
uh released

942
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,919
and if it's in the wrong position well

943
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,760
then it will it will bring the lever

944
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,440
nose down the lever nose will test for a

945
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,679
moment of a second

946
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,360
uh but then it will effectively bounce

947
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,720
off the wheel pack

948
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,120
uh and so you only have that momentary

949
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,159
fraction of a second

950
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,000
to get any information out of the lock

951
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,080
before the uh before the lever is once

952
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,559
again

953
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,000
raised off the wheels

954
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,919
if you've aligned everything correctly

955
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,679
then as it fires it fires

956
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,720
fully all the way uh into the the slots

957
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:04,960
and

958
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,240
in the wheels and you can then retract

959
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,679
and open the lock

960
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,360
similar mechanism also by sergeant and

961
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,960
greenleaf

962
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,120
is the clock it has a few other names as

963
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,360
well

964
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,440
which i have and hopefully not included

965
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,799
but again this is a similar sort of

966
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,440
mechanism we have a uh we have a

967
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,960
silver uh lever of some kind now we

968
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,360
we have some brass wheels hidden behind

969
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,120
this plate

970
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,960
and we have a very curious looking drive

971
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,399
cam the drive cam

972
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,399
includes a spring and essentially

973
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:45,039
what happens is in its default position

974
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:45,840
uh

975
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,880
it kind of looks like this and so there

976
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,000
is no gate

977
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,840
to be found

978
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,640
as it turns what we find is it will wind

979
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,360
this

980
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,399
mechanism and we uh

981
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,120
we actually get the gate revealed uh for

982
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,960
a moment

983
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,239
and uh again if we're very lucky

984
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,399
and everything is perfectly aligned well

985
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,320
then the lever nose will be able to drop

986
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,440
into that gate and

987
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,800
it will prevent the uh the this

988
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,520
uh a clever cam mechanism from then

989
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,159
immediately

990
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,320
concealing the gate again and if we did

991
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,599
not get everything correct

992
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,879
well then what happens is that the lever

993
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,239
touches down against the wheels for a

994
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,000
moment of a second and then the sprung

995
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,520
element that is released

996
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,960
immediately pushes it back out of the

997
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,520
way and we get back into this position

998
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,159
here

999
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,480
where there is no gate and we have no

1000
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,879
information

1001
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,399
and then we have the manifoil mark iv so

1002
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,679
this was a british

1003
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,599
ministry of defense lock and it uses a

1004
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,399
cunning

1005
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,918
uh two-part drive cam so this drive cam

1006
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,918
actually has two levels to it that needs

1007
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,680
to be aligned in order to create the

1008
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,880
gate

1009
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,000
as we can see here but it also has

1010
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,119
these uh two rather devious rollers

1011
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,040
that uh make it very very difficult to

1012
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,560
tell the difference uh

1013
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,760
as to whether or not you're trying to

1014
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,079
get information from uh the nose on this

1015
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,920
lever which is actually useful

1016
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,599
or if you're just working with one of

1017
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,680
the two specially designed

1018
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,800
rollers that can be very very tricky to

1019
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,920
work out indeed

1020
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,119
and then finally uh i'm going to bring

1021
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,200
you on to some special considerations

1022
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,480
it turns out my categorization method my

1023
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,200
categorization method is not perfect and

1024
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,040
i was unable to categorize every high

1025
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,560
security lock that i wanted to

1026
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,400
so i thought i would take a look at some

1027
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,920
special considerations

1028
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,320
that don't fit my schema but

1029
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,119
nevertheless

1030
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,680
have some interesting value that we

1031
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,839
might want to take a look at

1032
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,599
so first of all we have the chub

1033
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,240
detector this was the unpickable lock of

1034
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,000
the

1035
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,680
1850s roundabouts until it was picked in

1036
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,119
the 1850s

1037
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,640
um and the way this works is uh

1038
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,839
there are so there are lots of

1039
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,680
implementations of the child detector it

1040
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,440
has a very long history

1041
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,119
um but essentially this is a lever lock

1042
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,720
but what's curious about it is we have

1043
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,119
this little pin that sticks out of

1044
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,079
this lever and this pin rests across all

1045
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,440
the other levers that would be laying in

1046
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,640
front of it

1047
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,960
and what happens is essentially if any

1048
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,960
of the levers ahead of it is lifted too

1049
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,680
far

1050
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,560
during a manipulation process then it

1051
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,359
will trip the detector mechanism

1052
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,480
so here we can see the detector

1053
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,320
mechanism is tripped so what's happened

1054
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,480
is this lever has been lifted too high

1055
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,280
and this small sprung portion has then

1056
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,480
slipped over this little

1057
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,200
lip and it then jams in place and

1058
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:43,839
prevents

1059
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:47,440
any movement of the bolt in the opening

1060
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,320
direction if on the other hand we press

1061
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,480
in the closing direction

1062
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,800
then we are able to once again reset the

1063
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,320
lock into this position so

1064
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,599
the lock is not uh bricked as it were

1065
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,200
uh if someone attempts to manipulate the

1066
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,200
lock and anyone with the correct key can

1067
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,680
uh

1068
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,800
can once again reset the mechanism

1069
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,720
and then turn the key in the opening

1070
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,160
direction in order to open the lock

1071
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,800
but this kind of trap mechanism does

1072
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,680
make picking

1073
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,280
very tricky um

1074
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,280
for those who have not yet seen it seth

1075
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,040
gould's coffer

1076
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,839
as filmed in forged and filed which is a

1077
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,359
video you can find on vimeo

1078
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,160
this is an absolutely stunning video uh

1079
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,599
seth gold spent

1080
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,079
two years uh constructing this kind of

1081
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,000
medieval style

1082
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,119
coffer and although i can't show you it

1083
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,079
very easily

1084
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,760
essentially i believe there's something

1085
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,520
like 11 steps

1086
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,680
to opening this coffer even if you have

1087
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,960
the correct key

1088
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,520
so having the correct key on its own is

1089
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,040
not sufficient there are a whole series

1090
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,040
of hidden buttons and switches

1091
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,960
and and steps where the key has to be

1092
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,880
turned only 90 degrees and then it will

1093
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,119
allow something else to open

1094
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,599
and so on uh that are required in order

1095
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,240
to open the coffer

1096
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,400
and again you know you you could be able

1097
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,599
to pick the mechanism

1098
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,280
uh but that wouldn't necessarily result

1099
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,079
in the lock opening

1100
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,160
uh then we have the uh the rks the robo

1101
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,760
key systems design

1102
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,960
this is a tiny tiny combination lock

1103
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,000
and uh in its kind of final form at

1104
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,480
least

1105
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,839
as far as it has today um the

1106
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:31,440
uh it only has five wheels um but the

1107
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,880
the whole idea behind the

1108
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,960
railroad key systems design was to have

1109
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,800
a large number of

1110
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,480
combination wheels so you essentially

1111
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,000
have a

1112
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,680
a very um a very complex well

1113
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,920
not a very complex it's quite a simple

1114
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,599
uh combination lock

1115
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,040
uh but it is one that will take an

1116
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,119
incredibly long time to dial

1117
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,920
and the robo key systems uh lock is then

1118
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,720
paired with

1119
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,520
an electromechanical uh key that

1120
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,560
basically

1121
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,960
has a motor in it and you engage that

1122
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,320
motor and you you

1123
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,920
press the buttons to put in your

1124
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,000
combination and it will very very

1125
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,640
rapidly

1126
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,119
dial in your combination into this tiny

1127
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:09,680
little

1128
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,000
uh combination lock and it's not so much

1129
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,240
the uh manipulation mechanism or

1130
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,760
manipulation method for this is not

1131
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,599
known it's just that it would take a

1132
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:20,000
very very long time with a lot of wheels

1133
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,760
uh to the point where it's kind of

1134
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,320
infeasible

1135
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,359
we've also got things such as these uh

1136
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:28,079
registered

1137
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,280
male counter padlocks from the us

1138
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,520
uh they have these counters that

1139
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,400
increment by one

1140
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,119
every time the plug is turned um so they

1141
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,280
might not be the hardest thing to pick

1142
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,359
once or twice but you're going to have

1143
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,960
to pick them

1144
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,880
9999 more times if you want to conceal

1145
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,599
the fact

1146
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,760
that you picked the lock

1147
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,040
so again

1148
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,599
another interesting consideration that

1149
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:58,240
uh

1150
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,000
can make a lot quite high security and

1151
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,839
tamper evidence um

1152
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,680
obviously these were for avoiding

1153
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,560
tampering with post

1154
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,160
and then we have unfortunately a rather

1155
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,760
blurry picture of uh

1156
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,000
my favorite lock as it happens to be uh

1157
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,560
the retina change key safe lock

1158
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,480
so the so this is a lever lock where we

1159
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,800
have a lever with these

1160
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,480
teeth on the end of it and that engages

1161
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,160
with this

1162
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,240
this sort of gear that has the gate in

1163
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,280
it and

1164
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,359
uh so lifting the lever causes the gear

1165
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,640
to turn and the correct key

1166
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,000
causes the levers to lift the correct

1167
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,280
heights turning the gears to the crate

1168
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,839
the correct amount however what's

1169
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:38,960
interesting is that

1170
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,280
when the bolt moves inwards it also

1171
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,800
disconnects the levers

1172
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,160
uh from the wheels and so the the result

1173
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:46,720
of that is

1174
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,119
that every time you unlock the lock uh

1175
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,400
it zeros itself

1176
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,119
and it will then key itself to whichever

1177
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,920
key you use to lock it back up again

1178
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,319
so the idea here is clearly for uh you

1179
00:40:58,319 --> 00:40:59,520
know banks

1180
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,119
if the bank manager realizes that one of

1181
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,040
the keys is missing well it's

1182
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,880
pretty much trivial for him to change

1183
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,040
the key uh he can do it in

1184
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,520
just a minute by simply unlocking the

1185
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,079
bolt

1186
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,280
and then locking it again uh with a new

1187
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,720
key that he knows

1188
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,280
um you know isn't uh missing and hasn't

1189
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,319
been copied or tampered with or whatever

1190
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,400
but from a picking consideration that

1191
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,520
means that you could pick

1192
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,560
a lock like this open

1193
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,440
but you would have a very very hard time

1194
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,599
to then correctly lift all of the levers

1195
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,880
simultaneously

1196
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,359
to the correct matching heights when you

1197
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:37,920
lock

1198
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,040
the lock again and while that might not

1199
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,640
seem like such an issue most of the

1200
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,640
benefit of using lock picking as an

1201
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,000
entry method over

1202
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,720
any other manipulation method or method

1203
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,839
of getting in

1204
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,880
um is that it's covert it's that people

1205
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,359
won't uh won't notice that you have

1206
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,240
picked the lock

1207
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,400
it's for extraction normally of

1208
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,000
information for example

1209
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,520
otherwise you might as well use a

1210
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,599
destructive attack

1211
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,760
uh so i find it very cool that this is

1212
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,359
basically a lock with a

1213
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:10,880
very high amount of tamper evidence

1214
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,520
finally i'd like to give my special

1215
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,880
thanks to all the people on this list

1216
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,599
for their either their direct help by

1217
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,040
providing photos

1218
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,680
uh or their encouragement or the

1219
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,599
conversations i've had with them

1220
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,240
uh to help me work out how to categorize

1221
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,359
the locks in this talk

1222
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,359
so thank you very much to all of those

1223
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,560
people in particular

1224
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,359
and that's the end of my presentation so

1225
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,040
if you've got any questions

1226
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,880
i believe we will now be moving to a

1227
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,960
question and answer section
