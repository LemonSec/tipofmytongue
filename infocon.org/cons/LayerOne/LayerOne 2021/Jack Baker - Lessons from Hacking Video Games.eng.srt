1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,280
all right uh hi everyone my name is jack

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:03,919
baker

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,080
and i am going to be talking about uh

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,839
video game hacking

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,559
so my sort of introduction to computers

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,840
and programming and

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,559
hacking uh was through video games i

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:15,200
started

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,119
programming little video games as a

10
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,800
teenager and that turned into

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,880
trying to hack video games and that sort

12
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,039
of turned into my career a little bit

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,160
later in life

14
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,080
uh and so when i got into sort of the

15
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,680
corporate world of doing

16
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,720
cyber security you know pen testing

17
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,399
reverse engineering sort of stuff

18
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,160
i noticed that there were a lot of tools

19
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,680
and techniques that i had learned

20
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,480
as a game hacker uh that really weren't

21
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,360
all that common

22
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,600
in the more more corporate reverse

23
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,520
engineering and bug hunting world

24
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,360
so this is sort of my attempt to take

25
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,879
those techniques take those things that

26
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,559
i already knew how to do

27
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,160
and adapt them to uh to this different

28
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,800
world

29
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,719
with its own techniques its own tools

30
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,079
and stuff like that

31
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,640
um so with that being said let's get

32
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,440
into

33
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,920
the first sort of lesson that uh i

34
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,520
learned as a game hacker and this is

35
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,159
sort of

36
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,200
how to find a needle in a haystack

37
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,880
so um if if you have done any video game

38
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,680
development

39
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,080
or any video game reverse engineering or

40
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,159
really just downloaded a video game

41
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,759
you've probably noticed that video games

42
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,320
are really big pieces of software

43
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,840
and of course part of this is just that

44
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,520
they come with all this extra stuff

45
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,840
there's 3d models there's textures

46
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,280
there's art there's music

47
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,360
all this stuff but it's also because

48
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,960
video games have

49
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,360
a lot in them and a video game engine

50
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,200
has a lot of different parts going on

51
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,600
they're very complicated systems

52
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,880
so if we were to think of a video game

53
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,280
engine

54
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,840
as this really crappy block art i'm

55
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,360
sorry i'm not an artist

56
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,079
um the part that's probably relevant to

57
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:48,479
us

58
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,960
as a game hacker is really just the the

59
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,240
component of

60
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,960
the game engine that is relevant to

61
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,880
gameplay but there's all this other

62
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,640
stuff in there there's the rendering

63
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,040
uh engine that is responsible for the

64
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,320
actual video

65
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,799
visuals there's audio there's input

66
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,240
there's all sorts of different things

67
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,719
that are

68
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,318
important and need to be there but

69
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,919
aren't really relevant when you're

70
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,479
trying to

71
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,080
pack a game they're not what you're

72
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,920
looking for and even

73
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,840
if we were to take the gameplay section

74
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,160
of code and look at just that

75
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,360
even that is a big world in and of

76
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,000
itself

77
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,520
with things like you know the physics

78
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,520
engine the artificial intelligence all

79
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,760
these things that again are pretty big

80
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,440
components of software and are very

81
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,360
important but aren't really what we're

82
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,800
looking at for the most part

83
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,480
and if we were to drill down to maybe

84
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,840
just like the the parts of code that uh

85
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,080
are related to our player to the the

86
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,120
actions that we

87
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,560
are performing even that uh is you know

88
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,319
a reasonable amount of code and the

89
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,319
actual stuff that might be relevant to

90
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,360
our purpose

91
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,760
is just this tiny little dot and this

92
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,800
big big

93
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,440
system that is uh the game engine and

94
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,680
the actual game software

95
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,360
so um uh this is a really relatable

96
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,000
problem

97
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,760
if you've been doing you know reverse

98
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,599
engineering because a lot of times you

99
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,440
run into these big code bases where you

100
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,959
don't really care about everything

101
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,159
you're not trying to do

102
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,840
a full you know 100 reverse engineering

103
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,400
something

104
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,720
back to source you're just looking for

105
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,159
maybe you're looking for bugs or you're

106
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:18,800
looking for

107
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,400
specific capabilities and how they work

108
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,959
so in game hacking there is this

109
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:25,599
technique

110
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,640
that is very common uh for basically

111
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,400
isolating just the code that we're

112
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,000
looking for for a particular

113
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,159
purpose and this this technique is sort

114
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,120
of uh

115
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,560
what you'll see in like a lot of game

116
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,640
hacking 101 tutorials

117
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,239
uh and so there are a lot of names for

118
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,599
this technique but i like to call it

119
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,519
differential searching

120
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:44,959
and so this technique was basically

121
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,440
pioneered by a tool called cheat engine

122
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,120
cheat engine's been around for a long

123
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,280
time it's still very frequently used and

124
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,840
it's

125
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,640
arguably the most like influential game

126
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,640
hacking tool it's very useful

127
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,080
does a lot of cool things and we're

128
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,920
going to talk about probably the the

129
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,840
most common one that you use cheat

130
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,599
engine for

131
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,920
uh so differential searching is

132
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,439
basically consists of

133
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,360
snapshotting a process's memory

134
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,680
repeatedly and repeatedly searching that

135
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,480
memory

136
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,720
uh for some sort of differential uh so

137
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,560
basically looking for values that have

138
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,720
increased since our last search or have

139
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,839
decreased or

140
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,079
have changed in some way or haven't

141
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,360
changed at all

142
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,600
um and so i'm gonna give an example of

143
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,120
how this works and how we can use

144
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,800
differential searching to go from

145
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,560
basically a black box we don't know

146
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,160
anything about the software we're not

147
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,080
opening it up in a disassembler

148
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,800
decompiler or anything and we're gonna

149
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,479
with some relatively simple

150
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,199
techniques uh find the code that is

151
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,960
specifically relevant to

152
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,600
a value of our of our choosing so in

153
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,120
this case we're playing our game

154
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,160
and our our goal is uh basically to

155
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,560
manipulate our health so this is real

156
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,479
sort of game hacking 101 stuff we're

157
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,080
gonna try to do like an infinite

158
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,120
health hack and so we're here we know

159
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,639
that our character's health is five

160
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,080
we've got the five hearts

161
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,440
so the first thing we're gonna do is

162
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,680
we're gonna uh search the game's memory

163
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,080
for the value of five it's gonna come

164
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,720
back with

165
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,039
all the memory addresses that have the

166
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,880
value five in them currently

167
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,160
and this is gonna be a lot we're gonna

168
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,919
have to narrow this down a lot but we

169
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,759
can be reasonably confident

170
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,199
that one of these values has the uh

171
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,240
has the value of our health in it

172
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,600
and so the next thing we're going to do

173
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,120
to narrow this down is we're going to

174
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,880
cause our value to change we're going to

175
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,800
take damage and now we know our health

176
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,840
value is four

177
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,120
and we're going to search again and

178
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,960
we're basically going to say okay

179
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,520
of all those uh those values from the

180
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,600
last search of all those that used to be

181
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,320
five

182
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
which one of those are now four and

183
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,840
that's going to narrow it down to more

184
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,960
and we're gonna basically

185
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,680
continue this iterative process until we

186
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,240
found

187
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,680
our health value in memory and uh we're

188
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,240
gonna

189
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,759
we're gonna get rid of the the

190
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,360
irrelevant stuff we're gonna be

191
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,039
reasonably confident that this one

192
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,240
particular value

193
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,319
has our health value in it and so as a

194
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,000
game hacker this might be sort of where

195
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,720
you stop

196
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,560
you have what you want because you can

197
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,479
manipulate this value we can now set it

198
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,560
to 100 or something and give ourselves a

199
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,919
whole bunch of health

200
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,560
um but what we want to do in this case

201
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,840
is we want to

202
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,880
uh turn this you know relevant memory

203
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,840
value

204
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,039
into code we want to know what code

205
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,000
actually is responsible for acting on

206
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,080
this memory value because what we want

207
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,560
is basically to be able to start our

208
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,080
reverse engineering somewhere

209
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,240
and we know the value we know the memory

210
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,919
address that's relevant now we want to

211
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,000
know the code that is responsible for

212
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,720
acting on this memory address and so to

213
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,360
do this

214
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,280
we're going to use watch points if

215
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,400
you're not familiar with the term

216
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,560
watchpoint it's basically a breakpoint

217
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,199
that is set uh that is triggered when a

218
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,639
memory address is either

219
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,800
read from or written to in this case

220
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,160
we're going to do written too

221
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,960
so we're going to uh set our watch point

222
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,560
on our memory address that we know

223
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,319
contains our health

224
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,919
we're going to trigger this watch point

225
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,840
by taking damage again we're gonna cause

226
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,280
that value to change

227
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,440
and we're gonna uh the watchpoint is

228
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
basically gonna show us the exact

229
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,160
instructions that were responsible for

230
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,479
causing that value to change

231
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,400
so just like that without too much work

232
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,639
without too much thought uh we were able

233
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,560
to go from sort of a black box

234
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,400
don't know anything about the internals

235
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,160
of the game and find the specific

236
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,400
instructions that were responsible

237
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,800
for updating our health value and that

238
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,720
becomes the start of our reverse

239
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,639
engineering process

240
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,800
so this technique is really useful but

241
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,680
what you

242
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,160
might have noticed is that uh we had a

243
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,960
little bit of help

244
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,039
because we knew exactly the starting

245
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,880
value we were looking for we knew that

246
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,240
our health was five

247
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,000
but this isn't always the case it could

248
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,400
be that it's a value we don't know the

249
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,039
the the specific value of it could also

250
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,160
be that we just don't know the

251
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,599
representation of it

252
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,520
uh it could be integer five it could be

253
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,280
floating point five it could be some

254
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,120
other representation we're not thinking

255
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,680
of

256
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,560
so um the question is how does

257
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,000
differential searching work

258
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,840
if we're not lucky enough to know the

259
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,319
exact value that we're looking for

260
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,400
and so i'm going to use another example

261
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,000
here and in this case we're doing

262
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,599
basically the same thing

263
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,080
but instead of uh looking for our health

264
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,599
value which we know

265
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,080
um we're gonna look for our coordinates

266
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,800
the the

267
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,639
x and y coordinates of our players so

268
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,240
since this is a 2d game

269
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,080
we can be reasonably confident that our

270
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,919
coordinates are going to be represented

271
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,280
as an x and a y

272
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,599
but we don't know exactly how they're

273
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,280
represented they could be a float they

274
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,479
could be an integer

275
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,760
they could be something else we don't

276
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,240
really know but we do know that we can

277
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,640
affect this value so we can be

278
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,000
reasonably confident that

279
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,839
if we move to the right our x

280
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,599
coordinates probably going to go up

281
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,200
if we move to the left it's probably

282
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,360
going to go down um

283
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,519
and so we can do differential searching

284
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,640
without a known start value

285
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,080
it takes a little bit longer but the

286
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,839
process is essentially to just take a

287
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:56,959
snapshot of memory

288
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,279
and compare which values have changed or

289
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,240
not changed

290
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,959
so we can say move to the right and ask

291
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,480
which values have increased

292
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,000
move to the left which values have

293
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,760
decreased we can stay in one place and

294
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,000
say

295
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,480
well which values didn't change and in

296
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,399
doing that we can sort of eliminate sort

297
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,320
of the irrelevant stuff that is changing

298
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,760
you know independent of

299
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,279
our actions uh and so in doing this

300
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,720
it takes a little bit longer than our

301
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
first example but we can basically

302
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,920
narrow down uh uh you know the entirety

303
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,200
of process memory

304
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,839
to so to those relevant values without

305
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:30,959
too much work

306
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,560
and once we have those we can do the

307
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
exact same process we can find the code

308
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,279
that is

309
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,680
responsible for acting on those values

310
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,519
and that becomes the starting point of

311
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,680
our reverse engineering

312
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,440
so when you're doing differential

313
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,680
searching it only really requires one of

314
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,120
two things

315
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,040
the first could be the ability to

316
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,920
trigger a value change so when we move

317
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,399
uh we we know that we are changing the

318
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,760
value in some way

319
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,800
or it could be a value that just changes

320
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,680
often

321
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,839
and we can observe that change so i

322
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,600
don't know if the game has a timer and

323
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,240
you want to

324
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,320
give yourself more time that's not

325
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,920
something you can really trigger the

326
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,680
change on it's already changing on its

327
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,079
own

328
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,839
but you do know that it's changing and

329
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,000
you're able to observe that change

330
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,160
and that could be all that you need in

331
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,160
order to do this differential search

332
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,640
because you can then say this value has

333
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,399
changed it's decreased or

334
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,800
whatever or at this point in time this

335
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,160
value hasn't changed

336
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,360
because you're able to uh observe when a

337
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,720
change occurs

338
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,800
and so differential searching is really

339
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,160
useful um

340
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,399
and uh it can be applied to basically

341
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,440
anywhere that you have

342
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,760
one of these requirements and this has

343
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,600
been very useful for me for dealing with

344
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,040
large code bases

345
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,880
where it's j it just doesn't seem

346
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,399
reasonable to

347
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,480
start reverse engineering sort of blind

348
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,839
and just look through

349
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,959
all the the irrelevant code until i find

350
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,720
the relevant stuff this is a

351
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,560
really simple and kind of uh

352
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,880
maybe a little tedious but much quicker

353
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,680
way

354
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,160
of narrowing down a big code base to

355
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,279
just the relevant parts

356
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,839
okay so uh the next lesson i want to

357
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:10,399
talk about

358
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,320
is sort of uh cheating while being

359
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,000
watched so let's talk

360
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,480
about anti-cheat systems so as the name

361
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,800
obviously suggests anti-cheat

362
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,959
is software that's set up to catch and

363
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,079
prevent cheaters

364
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,519
but specifically what we're talking

365
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,920
about here uh is the software that runs

366
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,959
client-side

367
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,360
on your computer basically watching you

368
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,880
play the game to make sure that you're

369
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,200
not

370
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,360
cheating and so typically this is

371
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,320
shipped as like a

372
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,839
separate piece of software that's

373
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,000
bundled with a game so rather than being

374
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,079
actually built into the game itself

375
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,839
it's a separate executable or separate

376
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,440
kernel module or something that is

377
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,720
bundled with the game

378
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,959
and is sort of watching the game as it

379
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,720
goes

380
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,040
uh so uh when i'm talking about

381
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,480
anti-cheats i really want to talk about

382
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:52,959
like

383
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,880
modern anti-cheat systems because there

384
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,720
have been a lot of anti-cheat systems

385
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,760
over the years

386
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,240
but um i really want to talk about the

387
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,360
the complicated

388
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,320
you know really uh really modern one so

389
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,760
these are things like battle eye

390
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,320
vanguard easy anti-things that are used

391
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,000
in you know the bigger games

392
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,160
and have a lot of work put into making

393
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,240
them you know resilient

394
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,600
um so uh modern anti-cheats typically

395
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,040
have a few things in common

396
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,880
at this point they typically run

397
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,079
partially or

398
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,959
fully within the kernel uh they do

399
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,720
signature detection where they look for

400
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,480
you know known

401
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,639
executables or uh known

402
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,360
patterns of cheats that have been seen

403
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,079
before

404
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,920
and they do heuristic detection where

405
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,240
they basically just look at the behavior

406
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,959
of processes and flag if they see

407
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,720
something suspicious

408
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,959
and anti-cheats typically will detect

409
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,160
and stop

410
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,399
most of the common process modification

411
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,399
and process injection techniques so if

412
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:50,959
you've got an

413
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,720
anti-cheat running on a game you

414
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
probably can't attach a debugger to it

415
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,399
you probably can't just write process

416
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,639
memory or inject a thread into that

417
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,360
process because

418
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,959
that's sort of what anti-cheat is there

419
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,399
to stop those are the things that it's

420
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,279
really

421
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,920
good at stopping and if you want some

422
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,519
extra reading about sort of the

423
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,720
technical details

424
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,040
of of anti-cheats this is a great

425
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,800
write-up on battle eye this is not mine

426
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,720
but it's a really good write-up

427
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,480
um and so if you looked at that list of

428
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,839
things that antigens

429
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,360
uh uh are doing you probably may have

430
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
seen some parallels with like antivirus

431
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,200
and yeah the parallels there are are

432
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,399
fairly obvious

433
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,959
but um there is one big difference

434
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,440
between like anti cheats and antiviruses

435
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,000
that i think is almost like uh

436
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,839
philosophical in a way and that

437
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,519
antiviruses ostensibly are

438
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,480
there to help you you're not the enemy

439
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,600
an antivirus

440
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,160
antivirus is there to protect you from a

441
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,680
malicious third party

442
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,320
but when you talk about anti-cheats the

443
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,120
the user

444
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,360
you who owns the computer it's running

445
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,600
on are sort of are the enemy

446
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,560
anti-cheat is there to prevent you who

447
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,040
has

448
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,839
physical access to the computer uh from

449
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:04,959
doing something that you

450
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,560
may fully intend to do uh so it's

451
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,360
a much more adversarial relationship

452
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,639
with the user

453
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,480
and so uh because of this sort of

454
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,240
adversarial relationship

455
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,720
anti-cheats tend to be a little bit more

456
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,959
aggressive than antiviruses are and

457
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,040
they'll do stuff that you may

458
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,160
uh associate more with malware than with

459
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,360
like antivirus

460
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,760
so anti-cheats are typically obfuscated

461
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,199
they're not you know something you can

462
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,519
easily open up in a decompiler

463
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,320
um they may even do a little bit of like

464
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,959
cloaking to keep themselves uh from

465
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,360
uh being seen by the operating system or

466
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,320
by the user

467
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,639
and anti-cheats often will even include

468
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,560
something like virtualization detection

469
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,480
so they'll check if they're in a vm

470
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,320
and if so they just won't run they won't

471
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,040
let the game run stuff that you might

472
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,279
you don't really see outside of like

473
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,079
malware

474
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,320
and that's because uh antigens sort of

475
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,399
have this adversarial relationship with

476
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,480
the users that in a way they are sort of

477
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,839
acting like malware and that they are uh

478
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,040
sort of uh at odds with what the the

479
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,600
user wants to do with their computer

480
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,600
um and so because anti-cheats are

481
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,760
uh it's sort of adversarial they're

482
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,360
running in the kernel they're doing all

483
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,120
sorts of complicated stuff

484
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,120
uh there there's a lot that can go wrong

485
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,600
and so uh antigens have earned some bad

486
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,360
headlines over the years

487
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,000
um so this could be a much longer list i

488
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,680
picked out some of my favorite headlines

489
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,240
here

490
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,279
but um one that i love is

491
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,120
uh you might remember this story a few

492
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,720
years ago of

493
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,440
a driver that was built into street

494
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,079
fighter 5 or came with street fighter 5

495
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:47,759
that uh basically opened up a a a

496
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,720
an i o control that anybody on the

497
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,160
operating system could call

498
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,320
and basically just ask it hey run this

499
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,920
code in the kernel for me

500
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,800
and this driver was set up to just uh

501
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,399
put that code in memory

502
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,279
turn off the the uh protections that

503
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,959
would prevent exactly this

504
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,720
run that code and then turn everything

505
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,000
back on

506
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,839
and so this was discovered uh by a

507
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,040
reverse engineer

508
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,880
uh who goes by slipstream i've got his

509
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,160
twitter account here

510
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,440
and this was a really fun example of uh

511
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,079
an anti-cheat basically opening up the

512
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:20,639
system

513
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,040
to all sorts of security issues just so

514
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,399
that hypothetically

515
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,560
someone might not cheat at street

516
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,480
fighter

517
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,079
um another example i really like uh is

518
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,040
the case of de nuvo anti cheat which was

519
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,079
doing things

520
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,600
that were uh uh uh suspicious enough

521
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,240
looking

522
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,519
that some antiviruses were uh doing

523
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,360
heuristic detection and thinking wow

524
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,959
this doesn't look right this looks like

525
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,079
malware to me

526
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:50,800
basically flagging the anti-cheat and uh

527
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,959
making the game unplayable for users

528
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:53,839
because they couldn't

529
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,360
run the game because they couldn't start

530
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,199
the anti-cheat um

531
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,680
and of course there were there are

532
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,519
always dozens of examples

533
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,440
of anti-teach screwing up and doing

534
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,799
something like crashing somebody's

535
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,599
computer

536
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,480
or banning a bunch of people who weren't

537
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,599
actually cheating

538
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,000
all good stuff all all hallmarks of

539
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,679
software that you want running on your

540
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,520
computer obviously

541
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,480
um and so before we talk about sort of

542
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,319
bypassing anti-cheat i think it's

543
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,160
important to understand what is it that

544
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,439
anti-cheat is

545
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,599
preventing us from doing that we want to

546
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,720
actually do

547
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,120
so this could be a longer list but the

548
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,400
the common stuff

549
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,960
that your cheat might be doing that

550
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,559
anti-cheat is trying to stop could be

551
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,200
stuff like

552
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,799
reading from process memory to uh

553
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,960
uh see information that isn't directly

554
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,000
exposed to you

555
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,240
writing to process memory in order to

556
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,679
you know do something you wouldn't be

557
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,720
able to do

558
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,360
uh injecting new code or threads into a

559
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,320
game

560
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,559
or just like hooking library functions

561
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,880
or syscalls of the operating system

562
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,799
in order to sort of manipulate how the

563
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,840
game runs without actually touching the

564
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,080
process

565
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,679
and so these are all things that

566
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,000
anti-cheat is probably looking for

567
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,320
and uh that it might be preventing you

568
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,280
from doing

569
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,919
uh and that is why we need to bypass it

570
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,120
so that we can do

571
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,559
these things so when we talk about

572
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,080
bypassing anti-cheats

573
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,160
one of the things that has become uh

574
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,440
more common is basically

575
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,600
moving cheats into the kernel so if

576
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,440
anti-cheat is moved into the kernel it

577
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,280
only makes sense the cheats need to do

578
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,320
the same thing

579
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,760
and uh uh do the cheating from

580
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,400
from kernel level and what this allows

581
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,520
those chiefs to do

582
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,080
is basically poke and prod at the game

583
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,799
process

584
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,799
without having to do sort of the the

585
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,400
user mode level like

586
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,360
uh uh process injection sort of stuff uh

587
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,520
because user mode process injection is a

588
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,320
little bit

589
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,200
easier to catch um particularly if it's

590
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,320
a known method

591
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,559
uh it's something that a a kernel level

592
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,440
anti-cheat is

593
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,440
gonna be pretty good at catching so

594
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,280
moving into the kernel gives

595
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,240
cheats the opportunity to sort of uh

596
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,480
bypass that whole difficult part

597
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,240
um the problem with this is that

598
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,080
anti-cheats get really suspicious if

599
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,720
you're running

600
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,120
unsigned kernel drivers in fact a lot of

601
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,120
anti-cheats basically they won't start

602
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,799
and they won't let the game start

603
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,960
if they notice that your colonel is

604
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,360
running a module that's unsigned

605
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,559
and uh since your your cheat is probably

606
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,160
not signed by you know a legitimate uh

607
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,960
certificate authority uh this this can

608
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,400
be a little bit of a challenge

609
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,080
so dealing with this problem there's a

610
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,760
few solutions that you see pretty

611
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,559
commonly

612
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,880
uh the first is like leveraging bugs and

613
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,760
legitimate

614
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,160
signed drivers so if we were to go back

615
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,320
to that capcom driver the street fighter

616
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,200
5 one that

617
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
opens up your kernel to anyone on the

618
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,960
system uh

619
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,559
this was a driver that was of course

620
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,400
created as

621
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,600
part of an anti-chief but it it actually

622
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,760
gave birth to a whole bunch of cheating

623
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,840
tools that used this legitimate driver

624
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,360
that was signed by a legitimate

625
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,320
authority

626
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,159
and uh was uh excuse me trusted by the

627
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,200
operating system

628
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,120
and they used it to write the game

629
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,919
hacking code into memory and basically

630
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,960
let you bypass the these uh anti-cheap

631
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,600
protections using a legitimate driver

632
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,559
um so this particular driver doesn't

633
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,400
really work for this anymore

634
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,559
because uh the capcom does this has

635
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,559
basically been blacklisted across the

636
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,120
board

637
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,960
for good reasons but you'll see this

638
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,480
technique very common with

639
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,720
other legitimate drivers that have some

640
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,000
sort of you know

641
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,159
vulnerability or bug or unintended

642
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,200
functionality

643
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,000
where you can write code into kernel

644
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,360
memory and use that

645
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,840
as as basically the loader for your

646
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,039
cheat

647
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,440
now if you want to throw money at the

648
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,440
problem you can also just sign your own

649
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,559
driver you can

650
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,240
fill out the paperwork get a code

651
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,320
signing certificate sign your driver and

652
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,440
have it sort of be

653
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,880
a little bit more hidden from

654
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,880
anti-cheats now this doesn't really

655
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,840
scale well

656
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,000
like uh if you're trying to do this with

657
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,360
a tool that you think a lot of people

658
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,559
are gonna use

659
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,640
your your signature your your signing

660
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,400
key is going to get blacklisted pretty

661
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,120
quickly

662
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
but if you're just building your own

663
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,799
tool this is a

664
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,280
a pretty simple way to sort of solve the

665
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,640
problem with money

666
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,120
um i think this is a little bit boring

667
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,000
because i think

668
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,159
uh actually going through the process of

669
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,840
you know bypassing anti-cheat that's

670
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,360
that's part of the fun that's part of

671
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,480
the difficulty there

672
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,039
but if you don't care about that getting

673
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,880
your own signing certificate using it on

674
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,640
your own kernel driver is

675
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,760
a reasonable way to deal with anti-cheat

676
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,360
sort of through the the official

677
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,600
channels and then of course there's

678
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,480
always a world

679
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,120
of just sort of anti-cheat specific

680
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,320
bypasses

681
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,240
so this could be something like putting

682
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,000
your code somewhere that anti-cheat

683
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,039
isn't looking for it

684
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,960
or having some method of process

685
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,799
injection that it doesn't know about

686
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,480
or it could just be like finding some

687
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,880
way to stop the anti-cheat from doing

688
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,400
what it's intended to do

689
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,720
this is sort of the cat and mouse game

690
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,400
of you know method is found

691
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,480
method gets fixed you know stuff like

692
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,640
that but there is this whole world

693
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,679
of of bypassing anti-cheats by looking

694
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:06,880
for specific

695
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,799
you know uh uh flaws or deficiencies in

696
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,799
its ability to detect what you're doing

697
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,480
uh so something that i really like uh

698
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,799
is cheats that are physically or

699
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:21,520
logically

700
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,120
separated from the system that's

701
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,720
actually running the game

702
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,320
so since your anti-cheat is running

703
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
client-side it's on the computer that is

704
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,440
running the game

705
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,360
if you can sort of separate your cheat

706
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,559
from that computer

707
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,559
this is a really effective way to not

708
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,559
get caught

709
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,159
and so uh for an example uh many cheats

710
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,919
uh there are cheats that you can pull

711
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,360
off basically just by

712
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,600
listening to the network so uh if

713
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,440
let's say you're playing a battle royale

714
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,280
let's say uh in fact this was

715
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,679
common in pubg there's a lot of

716
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:54,720
information that is

717
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,360
given to your client that isn't exposed

718
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:57,919
to you

719
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,440
the player so uh your game client

720
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,520
knows about player locations that it's

721
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,880
not actually showing you

722
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,640
because you can't see that far you're

723
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,240
not looking in the right direction

724
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,400
or whatever but the client needs to know

725
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,000
it's there because

726
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,280
it needs to be able to load resources

727
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,919
uh before that character gets into range

728
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,120
it needs to be able to make

729
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,360
sounds if they're they're doing gunshots

730
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,039
you know a mile away or something like

731
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:23,520
that

732
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,760
so your your your client has more

733
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,520
information than it's giving you

734
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,440
and that information is provided from

735
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,440
the server you know obviously over the

736
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,080
network

737
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,919
so if you're able to just listen to the

738
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,080
network and pick out those that

739
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,000
important information you know off the

740
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,120
wire

741
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,200
you can build basically an undetectable

742
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,720
cheat uh

743
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,480
by basically man in the middling

744
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,320
yourself listening to traffic

745
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,919
and just picking out the stuff you want

746
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,520
you're not interacting with traffic

747
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,400
there's no

748
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,480
you know noticeable change to the server

749
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,919
or even the client

750
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,400
um and you're not doing you're not

751
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,480
cheating on your local system

752
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,159
so this is a a pretty hard to catch

753
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,400
way of of cheating without interaction

754
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,240
now this method does get a little bit

755
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,760
more difficult once

756
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,320
you uh uh apply some sort of like

757
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,760
encryption layer

758
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,960
to to that game traffic so this kind of

759
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,120
attack this uh what we call radar hacks

760
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,440
was

761
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,240
really really common in pubg for a while

762
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,360
before they added

763
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,559
an encryption layer to the traffic and

764
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,039
so

765
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,200
uh this this gets more difficult because

766
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,080
while your client

767
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,240
obviously has the ability to decrypt

768
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,919
that traffic otherwise it wouldn't be

769
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:34,960
able to read it

770
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,520
um that decryption key is somewhere in

771
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,279
the process it's probably

772
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,200
created in a way that you can't just

773
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,880
guess it or something like that

774
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,720
and so you get back to the same point of

775
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,799
well i need to read process memory or i

776
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,960
need to manipulate in some way

777
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,520
so that i can get that key out and hand

778
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,760
it off to my radar hacking tool

779
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,440
so this is sort of a cat and mouse game

780
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,520
too but these kind of hacks are

781
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,320
still pretty common and they're really

782
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:00,880
useful

783
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,880
and in my mind really clever when they

784
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,559
work

785
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,320
um another example of sort of a

786
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,320
logically separated cheat

787
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,120
uh are uh cheats that basically separate

788
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,559
themselves by

789
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,880
excuse me appearing as a peripheral

790
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,840
device

791
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,640
so when i was a teenager i played an

792
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,760
mmorpg

793
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,440
and i really did not have the patience

794
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,360
for it so i bought this little like

795
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,240
botting tool

796
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,000
and it came to me shipped as this tiny

797
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,720
little like it looked like a usb stick

798
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,320
but it blew my mind because i would plug

799
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
it in thinking you know it would

800
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,159
open up like a flash drive and instead

801
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,919
it would just start playing the game for

802
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:36,640
you

803
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,440
um and so uh i i wasn't much of a

804
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,480
reverse engineer

805
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,640
wasn't much of a program at the time but

806
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,720
i was so curious about how does this

807
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,400
thing work it's so interesting

808
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,000
that i did a little research and um

809
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,520
i i figured out that when you plug this

810
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,520
thing in the computer doesn't see it as

811
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,919
a flash drive it sees it as a usb hub

812
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:56,960
that's connected to

813
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,520
a keyboard and a display device and so

814
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,640
assumably what the

815
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,559
the thing does is it just sort of reads

816
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,919
the screen and

817
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,480
types on a fake keyboard kind of like

818
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,360
you do

819
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,559
just just looking at what is

820
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,760
on the display and typing and so uh

821
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,400
this was really really difficult to

822
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,679
catch because there's not really

823
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:18,159
anything

824
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,039
there for an anti-cheat or for any

825
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,320
protection to see

826
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,840
it just looks like a keyboard it just

827
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,840
looks like a display it just looks like

828
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,400
someone playing the game uh and so this

829
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:28,960
was

830
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,760
uh kind of mind-blowing to me and i wish

831
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,520
that i still had this device because i

832
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,960
would love to have done like a full

833
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,640
teardown now that i have a little bit

834
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,559
better of an idea of what i'm doing

835
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,600
but uh this always stuck with me of uh

836
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,120
such a clever way to to bypass

837
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,400
those client level protections just by

838
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,360
behaving in a way that looked as as

839
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,520
realistically as possible like a real

840
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,520
user

841
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,679
uh so when we talk about bypassing

842
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:58,799
anti-cheats this has

843
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,120
been you know a really really short list

844
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,640
there's a lot of ways you can do that

845
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,640
there's a lot of clever methods

846
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,080
but um i i i just want to give

847
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,240
sort of an overview and say that like a

848
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,240
lot of these techniques that are

849
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,799
uh used to bypass anti-cheeks

850
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:15,679
anti-cheats

851
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,960
can be used to bypass antivirus

852
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,799
or other security controls things that

853
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,720
you might deal with in like the regular

854
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,559
corporate sort of day-to-day cyber

855
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,480
security um

856
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,919
and in fact i would say that a lot of

857
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,000
these techniques tend to be overkill for

858
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,520
that kind of thing because

859
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,919
antivirus isn't as aggressive as

860
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,000
anti-cheats you just don't need to go to

861
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,880
this extent

862
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,120
but it's always nice to know that there

863
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,320
are these really

864
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,000
you know intense methods and there are

865
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,360
there are game hackers out there

866
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,159
building these

867
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,720
really you know sort of revolutionary

868
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,960
bypass methods to deal with anti-cheats

869
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,720
and that they can be adapted whenever

870
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,440
you need

871
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,559
to bypassing you know kaspersky

872
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,799
antivirus or something like that

873
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,279
and conversely if you are a reverse

874
00:27:59,279 --> 00:27:59,840
engineer

875
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,600
there's a lot you can learn about sort

876
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,360
of malware analysis

877
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,840
by looking at anticheats because they do

878
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,279
a lot of the same stuff

879
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,600
they are very you know adversarial

880
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,039
software to the user

881
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,120
and they have um you know a lot of

882
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,240
funding and a lot of

883
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,760
a lot of support behind them so there's

884
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,919
a lot that can be learned that you can

885
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,039
uh apply to you know

886
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,799
regular reverse engineering that comes

887
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,799
from looking at anti-cheats and looking

888
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,960
at software that is built to stop

889
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,080
hackers

890
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,520
game hackers that is okay

891
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,600
so the last lesson i want to talk about

892
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,279
uh is about emulation

893
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,840
and so game hackers obviously did not

894
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,399
invent

895
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,480
emulation emulation has been a thing for

896
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,960
a long time but

897
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,200
it is it is definitely true that when we

898
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,640
hear the word emulation

899
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,720
we tend to associate it with something

900
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,760
like playing

901
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,480
n64 games on your laptop because

902
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
emulation is so

903
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,760
uh so common in the in the the context

904
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,880
of video games and

905
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,360
so much work goes into emulating video

906
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,159
games

907
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,600
and so as someone who has done a lot of

908
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,240
um embedded reverse engineering

909
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,360
professionally

910
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,760
video game emulation has actually been a

911
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,679
kind of a gold mine for me

912
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,600
so i'm gonna tell a bit of a story here

913
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,120
but um at work

914
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,559
i i at one point was uh dealing with

915
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,840
software that was written for a

916
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,640
particular digital signal processor

917
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,880
excuse me and this digital signal

918
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,360
processor was built in the early 90s

919
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,399
uh it wasn't really a long running model

920
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,120
uh um it's not totally obscure but it's

921
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,200
not something really common either

922
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,200
and i just didn't feel like i was gonna

923
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,360
find an emulator for it so i did you

924
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:41,840
know

925
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,080
typical looking i looked on github

926
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,039
looked on google

927
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,640
didn't really find anything and sort of

928
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,399
gave up on the possibility that i was

929
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,120
gonna find an

930
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,399
emulator for this processor and then

931
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,279
i don't know a few days later i i just

932
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,120
by pure coincidence i was

933
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,919
uh working at home on building one of

934
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:00,480
those like

935
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,840
arcade machine emulator tables um

936
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,880
and i had this little raspberry pi i was

937
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,520
building

938
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,480
mame the multi-arcade machine emulator

939
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,200
on this

940
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,320
raspberry pi so that i could uh you know

941
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,840
emulate games on it and i see a really

942
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,360
familiar term scroll by

943
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,720
in the you know the the gcc logs and i

944
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,559
realized that's the name of the digital

945
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,840
signal processor

946
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,880
that i was working on at work and so uh

947
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,799
immediately i go into the main source i

948
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,320
look at it and i realize there's

949
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,360
a full featured emulator for this

950
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,320
uh kind of rare digital signal processor

951
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,000
built into main

952
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,200
just so that i can someone can you know

953
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,919
emulate the the the sound card of an

954
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,559
arcade game from the early 90s

955
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,600
and so uh this sort of blew my mind

956
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,840
because i was like oh my gosh i never

957
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,799
thought to look at

958
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:58,080
name as uh uh as

959
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,640
something to be using for you know

960
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,600
embedded

961
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,559
uh uh emulation and embedded research

962
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,320
outside of video games normally if i

963
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,399
wanted to emulating emulate something

964
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,360
i'd look at a

965
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,399
qmu and if it didn't work which

966
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:15,039
it pretty often didn't i'd be like oh

967
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,960
gosh i guess i'm out of luck

968
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,600
but uh i so i decided to do a little bit

969
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,039
of like a comparison

970
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,200
and so if you look at like the qmu wiki

971
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,720
it'll say that you know it supports

972
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,880
something like 22 architectures i don't

973
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,320
know if that's completely up to date but

974
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,760
it's somewhere in that range

975
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,240
and that's a lot like that there's a lot

976
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,679
of work that goes into that

977
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:35,679
that amount you know it's supporting

978
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:36,960
that many architectures

979
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,640
and there's you know a a few dozen

980
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,279
cpu supported per architecture there's a

981
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,720
lot of code coverage there

982
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,559
but conversely maine uh supports over a

983
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,320
hundred architectures and in fact

984
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,440
depending on how you

985
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
choose to count in it could potentially

986
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,519
even be closer to 200 if you want to be

987
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,720
liberal about it

988
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,039
uh and like a countless amount of diff

989
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,159
specific boards

990
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,360
uh and cpus and stuff like that and so

991
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,919
um specifically if you're looking at

992
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,679
like digital signal processors

993
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,320
you'll see a lot of that in name because

994
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,440
you have to do

995
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,279
you know if you're emulating an arcade

996
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,120
game you have to emulate its sound card

997
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,480
you have to emulate its graphics

998
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,159
processor you have to do all of that

999
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:18,720
stuff

1000
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,000
and that tends to have some more

1001
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,960
obscure uh systems more obscure

1002
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,399
architectures on there

1003
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,320
so maine has sort of become like my

1004
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,919
go-to when i

1005
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,720
i've been trying to emulate some sort of

1006
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,360
more

1007
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,960
more obscure uh uh software that isn't

1008
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,039
x86 it's not arm it's this

1009
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,200
it's not the stuff that's really common

1010
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,440
i have had really good luck with name

1011
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,919
and in fact in the places where i didn't

1012
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,480
just have like a a plug and play tool

1013
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,279
with name

1014
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,919
maybe i had partial support or oh this

1015
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,440
family is supported but not this

1016
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,399
particular

1017
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,640
uh processor or something like that i've

1018
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,320
had really good luck

1019
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,279
mocking up hardware within main the apis

1020
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,960
are really easy to use the code is

1021
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,480
pretty self-explanatory

1022
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,480
and everything just sort of works pretty

1023
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,600
well uh

1024
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,320
so i have had really good experiences

1025
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,519
with mame and it has been

1026
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,559
a a huge help as someone who does a lot

1027
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,559
of embedded reverse engineering

1028
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,960
and would love to have an emulator when

1029
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,840
possible

1030
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,760
so if that if that sounds like something

1031
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,880
you do

1032
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,120
if you're doing emulation i would highly

1033
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,919
recommend

1034
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,279
you take a look at maim and put it in

1035
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,320
your arsenal of

1036
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,240
potential places you should look for uh

1037
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,399
for existing code for code you can

1038
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,000
leverage because it

1039
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,399
it is really remarkable how much code is

1040
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,200
there and how much how useful it can be

1041
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,279
uh so uh those are sort of the three

1042
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,000
big things that i i i feel like i've

1043
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,519
gotten out of game hacking

1044
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,720
but if you are you know uh if you're

1045
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,760
doing this kind of work

1046
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,360
you're doing the corporate level reverse

1047
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,360
engineering i highly recommend

1048
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,919
you go ahead and you give game hacking a

1049
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:03,840
try because there's a lot you can learn

1050
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,399
from it

1051
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:06,640
the first i mean the fact is game

1052
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,159
hacking combines so many of the

1053
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,639
like complicated problems in infosec

1054
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,000
there's you know

1055
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
dealing with big code bases and big

1056
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,839
reverse engineering projects and dealing

1057
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:16,399
with

1058
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:19,440
code that doesn't have symbols or it may

1059
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,320
even be

1060
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,520
like obfuscated or you know adversarial

1061
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,359
in some way there's a lot of practice

1062
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:26,960
that goes into this if you're a

1063
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,199
malware analyst you're a bug hunter or

1064
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,280
whatever there's a lot you can learn

1065
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,199
just from game hacking and and um

1066
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,280
uh uh you know going up against these

1067
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,440
systems whether it's anti-cheat or just

1068
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,639
a big

1069
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,839
uh game binary or anything like that

1070
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,760
um and uh i i would also say that uh

1071
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,918
game hacking is fun in that it is very

1072
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:52,480
it's flashy it's satisfying you know if

1073
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:52,960
you're

1074
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,040
you know a pen tester it's a good

1075
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,040
feeling when you get domain admin but

1076
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,440
you talk to someone who doesn't you know

1077
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,040
who isn't a pen tester they're not

1078
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,640
really impressed they don't really know

1079
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,119
what

1080
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,839
getting domain admin means but you know

1081
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:06,240
you

1082
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,079
you hack some video game and it's it's

1083
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,680
flashy it looks cool

1084
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,400
people are impressed it's it's it's you

1085
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,359
know

1086
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,640
it's fun for the senses and i mean if

1087
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,280
you're

1088
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,880
you're like me you're getting a little

1089
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,480
bit older you're feeling your

1090
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,400
your reflexes get a little bit worse

1091
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,079
you're not as good at video games as you

1092
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,200
were anymore

1093
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,960
video game hacking is a good way to you

1094
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,640
know cling to that that

1095
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,079
that uh lie that you're not getting old

1096
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,839
i'm still good at video games who cares

1097
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,200
if i have to cheat at them

1098
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,160
and you know uh it's it's fun you can

1099
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,160
make some 14 year olds cry and really

1100
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,000
that's that's what we're here for right

1101
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,480
that's

1102
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,800
that's the reason we all became hackers

1103
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,760
is we want to

1104
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,640
ruin someone else's time for for a

1105
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,119
little bit of dopamine hit for ourselves

1106
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,960
so i hope that it it if you get anything

1107
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,640
out of this maybe you get something you

1108
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,359
can use

1109
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,200
for um your own using your day job using

1110
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,520
your

1111
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,280
you know real life work that you're

1112
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,720
actually getting paid for

1113
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,040
but maybe you'll you'll pick this up and

1114
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,880
realize hey game hacking sounds kind of

1115
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,440
fun

1116
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,880
i'm going to take this and i'm going to

1117
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,440
make some some fortnite kids cry

1118
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,599
because uh that sounds like a good time

1119
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,800
to me uh

1120
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,760
so hopefully hopefully we'll uh we'll

1121
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,800
see you online

1122
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,040
i'll uh we'll get banned from something

1123
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,920
together

1124
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,400
uh but other than that i uh i hope you

1125
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,920
all have a great rest of your day

1126
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,920
i hope you enjoy layer one and thank you

1127
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,800
very much
