00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,519

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:11,920

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,880

many of you as well

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,240
let's begin i first want to say that

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,320
this talk is completely dedicated to all

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,760
the hackers who've been scared to

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,160
disclose to all the hackers who've been

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,920
prosecuted for trying to do something

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,920
good or actually just doing their job

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,439
let's be real

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,960
and to all the people who are in the

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,520
fight to bring rights for hackers

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,360
there are so many people behind scenes

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,559
that are trying to change

20
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,120
legislation change the media and how

21
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,480
they portray us

22
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,879
and also organizations there are people

23
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,719
inside that are trying to push for

24
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,239
vulnerability disclosure

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,239
or even ceases that are trying to tell

26
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,160
their executive team

27
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,000
that we need to actually have a

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,199
vulnerability disclosure policies

29
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,680
and also last but not least to you for

30
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,600
being here being part of this community

31
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,960
or even if you're brand new to the

32
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,560
community hello welcome

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,240
for those that don't know who i am my

34
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,760
name is chloe miss doggie and the

35
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,439
co-founder of hacking is not a crime we

36
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,280
also go by high neck

37
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,520
which you probably see right below but

38
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,200
i'm also the co-founder of wosek and the

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,360
founder we are hackers

40
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,200
besides all that stuff my side job these

41
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,600
days

42
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,640
is basically a strategy consultant

43
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,320
so i basically am trying to bring

44
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,240
changes to the tech world

45
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,720
um and that's through strategies and

46
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,240
growth

47
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,119
solutions to help empower organizations

48
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,880
but also to push other products that

49
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,400
actually work very well

50
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,560
but the thing i love the most is being

51
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,920
in my hacker community

52
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,159
and also being part of the infosec

53
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,159
community by large

54
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,880
that is my url feel free if you want to

55
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,720
learn anything about me i'm right on

56
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,720
there and also my twitter and instagram

57
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,719
my dms are always open

58
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,040
and feel free to follow me alright let's

59
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,880
get into the good stuff now the reason

60
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,240
why you are here today

61
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,719
and before i begin of course i just want

62
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:07,600
to tell you

63
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,360
if you don't know what hacking is not a

64
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,920
crime is this is the time to learn

65
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,640
so hacking is not a crime or we also go

66
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,040
by

67
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,720
high knack internally is basically it's

68
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,160
a non-profit

69
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,000
of a bunch of hackers in the community

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,080
that are trying to change

71
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,920
how the public perceives the hacker

72
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,280
community

73
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,879
and that's what i'll be diving into

74
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,400
about this conversation

75
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,560
and this talk i would say it's more like

76
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,640
a conversation between you and i

77
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,319
um and that's about what we need to do

78
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,319
about the public perception and how

79
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,440
that's impacting us in a very bad way

80
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,599
why we have legislation that are so out

81
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,200
of date from the 80s

82
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,000
that still impact us today from

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,160
organizations refusing to work with the

84
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,440
hacker community

85
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,160
or unaware of the hacker community or

86
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,000
the media when they report

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,720
about the hacker community it's always

88
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,800
there's always a hesitation and then

89
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,480
there's also the whole thing that they

90
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,760
don't know the difference between a

91
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,640
hacker and an attacker

92
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,959
and that's what our organization is

93
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,720
doing it's changing the

94
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,959
narrative that the public sees of us so

95
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,080
they reduce the

96
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,959
fear towards our group so then we can

97
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,800
have real change so we can have

98
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,040
legislation that's up to date where none

99
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,840
of us

100
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,159
have to ever be afraid for who we are

101
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,680
and what we love doing

102
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,400
and that's to protect and serve people

103
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,879
and organizations

104
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,799
so for those that are not aware between

105
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,319
what is a hacker versus an

106
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,480
attacker i always say the intent is the

107
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,599
key is

108
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,519
they use the exact same skills and

109
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,239
mindset the only difference is why are

110
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,760
they doing it

111
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,280
so the thing that makes it different

112
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,120
between a hacker and attacker and

113
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,159
sometimes you may hear

114
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,159
other terms so like hacker we say

115
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,000
security researcher

116
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,040
or an attacker we can also use the term

117
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,280
criminal cyber criminal malicious actor

118
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,319
just note that

119
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,920
an attacker is not the same as a hacker

120
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,799
an attacker what their job is is to

121
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:09,599
basically

122
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,480
have some sort of gain from it and they

123
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,480
gain itself as something of a criminal

124
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,439
intent

125
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,600
meaning they exploit without permission

126
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,279
they're using their skills to hurt and

127
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,279
extort

128
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,040
a hacker uses their skills to keep

129
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,520
things secure they don't extort

130
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,400
they always stay within scope and they

131
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,840
exploit with permission

132
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,720
only so that's the two differences and

133
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,320
yes we have people in the community that

134
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,759
are somewhere between

135
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,639
and that's okay but the thing is is

136
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,560
trying to get us as a community to

137
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,120
become

138
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,000
a hacker community i think that's the

139
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,440
thing where we need to go more

140
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,280
but if you're wondering where are we

141
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,440
standing today in the hacker community

142
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,880
when it comes to how the public

143
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,560
perceives us

144
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,199
the spoiler alert it's already have a

145
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,039
nice little emoji on the screen

146
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,320
it's not a great picture

147
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,360
one of the ones i love to always go into

148
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,560
is the story about kevin so

149
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,919
kevin came across a brand new bug bounty

150
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,039
program that was run

151
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,199
in-house with dji and what i mean

152
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,360
in-house that means is a bug

153
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,479
bounty program that is not

154
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,039
basically supported by a third party

155
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,080
like hacker one

156
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,919
bug crowd cynic it's more of

157
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,120
someone inside the company managing and

158
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,080
executing this program so one hacker

159
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,160
reports a vulnerability

160
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,199
that that company will use their

161
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,479
program manager to be able to pass it

162
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,280
forward

163
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,840
and ticket it to the correct people and

164
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,560
to have

165
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,280
communication with the hacker that is

166
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,160
simming the vulnerability

167
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,919
the difference here in this situation is

168
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,520
that when dji created it

169
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,319
they didn't do too much research and you

170
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,759
do find this quite a bit

171
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,520
when a company is like i'm going to just

172
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,240
do my own bug bounty program or my own

173
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,759
vulnerability disclosure program

174
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,560
they don't really know how much work it

175
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,240
is

176
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,919
first of all you have to be up to date

177
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,440
on everything second

178
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,600
communication is vital it's very

179
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,639
important

180
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,240
and what happened with kevin was that

181
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,759
there was a red flag

182
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,560
in a sense that when he asked for he

183
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,199
wanted to

184
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,000
well rewind he wanted to ensure that

185
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,520
everything that

186
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,840
he would do when looking at what's in

187
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,680
scope is within scope

188
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,800
he sent an email dji's bug bounty crew

189
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,280
and asked hey i just want to confirm

190
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,160
that this is

191
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,360
all within scope and it took them

192
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,560
two weeks to respond to confirm

193
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,319
this already existing list that's

194
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,280
published on their site

195
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,599
so that could have been a red flag there

196
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,000
but it was not

197
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,599
because it does happen when we

198
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,240
communicate and share hey i found a bug

199
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,680
sometimes we don't hear from them for a

200
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,759
while or maybe it's ignored

201
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,360
and so that could have been the case

202
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,599
with him

203
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,919
but they did come back they said yes

204
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,000
that is true that's what's in scope

205
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,400
he's like great so what he did was that

206
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,160
he submitted a vulnerability

207
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,599
this vulnerability was basically worth

208
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,880
30k to dji dji said thank you so much

209
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,919
here's 30k however before receiving it

210
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,479
we need you to sign this contract

211
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,240
and when you look at this contract it

212
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,319
offered no protection for

213
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,440
him which is the problem

214
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,120
you don't want to sign away your life

215
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,240
you don't know what's going to end up

216
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,919
happening sometimes the money is not

217
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,520
worth it

218
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,800
and i know for some of us we're like

219
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,400
yeah but 30k but to be real with you

220
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,879
what's more important being protected

221
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:53,599
knowing that

222
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,199
you will not face a jail time or legis

223
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,360
like basically someone coming after you

224
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,720
time

225
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,280
no and so that's what he did he walked

226
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,000
away

227
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,440
from 30k and it was like okay moving on

228
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,479
with my life

229
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,000
how are dji internally freaked out they

230
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,800
panicked and they said you know what

231
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,319
this guy's a troublemaker

232
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,120
we need to go after him and i'm not

233
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,919
making that

234
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,000
up at all because what happened was that

235
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,520
when they sent him an

236
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,479
email to threaten him with a lawsuit he

237
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,960
was attached to an internal chain

238
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,599
within it and he saw that they literally

239
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,279
saw him as a pr

240
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,679
threat

241
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,320
so kevin of course doesn't know what to

242
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,080
do in this situation except

243
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,440
for i'm about to get sued

244
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,680
and yes they handed this that you see on

245
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,640
the screen

246
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,279
to him throwing him with a lawsuit

247
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,440
connected to the cfa

248
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,480
and if you don't know what that

249
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,200
legislation is i will explain it to you

250
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,320
later in this talk but basically they

251
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,680
wanted to prosecute him

252
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,200
even though he stayed within scope

253
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,959
didn't exploit followed all the rules

254
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,360
communicated well they saw him as a

255
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,600
troublemaker

256
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,680
kevin then decided that he would post

257
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,360
all communications

258
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,320
in a blog post and you can see the blog

259
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,240
post right there

260
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,800
and uh let's just say dji backed up

261
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,360
and they realized well i hope they

262
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,200
realized that

263
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
what they feared that was something that

264
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,720
they created if they just left them

265
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,279
alone this would have not been a problem

266
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,959
but this is what i'm talking about is

267
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,880
that the current landscape today

268
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,399
is terrible for hackers in many ways

269
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,399
we don't have any protection and when i

270
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,760
say hacker writes

271
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,200
i hate to break it to you if you don't

272
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,959
know this already by now

273
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,120
we don't have rights we have no

274
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,560
protection whatsoever

275
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,360
we do everything out of good faith and

276
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,959
we're hoping that that

277
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,519
party that receives the vulnerabilities

278
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,600
or when we report something

279
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,920
that they have good faith with us and

280
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,000
within themselves and their organization

281
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,360
so how do we fix this situation

282
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,440
well like i said one of the things we

283
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,519
need to do is influence the public

284
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,680
cycle in other words change the public

285
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,440
perception of who we are

286
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,120
and be able to change the public

287
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,120
perception we have to go after these

288
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,320
three categories

289
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,000
the media organizations and legislation

290
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,120
the media plays a role because of what

291
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,000
they do

292
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,440
and how they share of what a population

293
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,640
is organizations are important because

294
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,320
they can push for change

295
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,200
just like the media can get people riled

296
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,160
up but also excited for something

297
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,399
media and organizations do impact

298
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,240
legislation

299
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,720
and legislation impacts organizations

300
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,920
and media

301
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,480
all three of them are interconnected so

302
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,360
unable to

303
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,279
influence the public cycle you can't

304
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,640
just focus on one

305
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,480
you have to focus at all three

306
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,040
directions

307
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,440
so step one how human behavior works

308
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,880
and this is the reason why i want to

309
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,800
bring this up first is because of human

310
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,000
behavior

311
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,279
human behavior is the reason why we have

312
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,480
perception and how we see each other

313
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,720
so i want to dive into a little bit

314
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,240
there for us to dive into

315
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,959
cognitive science on how your brain

316
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,519
operates but also

317
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,399
how it's wired in a way where we're

318
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,120
always going to have

319
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,519
biases by what we're being told

320
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,959
so first thing you should note is

321
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,959
socially constructed beliefs

322
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,040
these are basically beliefs that you

323
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,160
grew up with

324
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,760
in a sense that is part of your

325
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,519
essential being

326
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,519
so say for example that when you

327
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,120
are little you're told that like

328
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,040
people with pink hair are dangerous or

329
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,440
you see you turn on the tv who's always

330
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,360
a dangerous character in the show

331
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,120
or the movie the person with the pink

332
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,120
hair you have a teacher

333
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,160
who may say a side comment saying oh

334
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,120
pink hair people they're dangerous

335
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,720
they're criminals

336
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,000
or see for example you have an uncle

337
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,480
or an aunt or even a brother and sister

338
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,240
that turned around saying well pink hair

339
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,000
people are dangerous you have to be

340
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,160
careful of people with pink hair

341
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,600
and you're probably wondering where did

342
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,440
this stem from and all this can

343
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,399
stem from many different places but most

344
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,680
of the time it stems from like

345
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,120
books movies and opinions of others

346
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,440
around you when you're growing up

347
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,880
and that's what socially constructed

348
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,480
beliefs is the idea

349
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,160
that has been created and accepted by

350
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,920
people in society

351
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,079
in other words they're also stereotypes

352
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,760
and they're not always true

353
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,839
if anything most of the time they're not

354
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,160
true they're false assumptions of what

355
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,920
is going on around us and we put things

356
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,519
into pretty little boxes to make it

357
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,360
simple for us to digest and understand

358
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,560
everything around us

359
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,279
when in reality life is not so black and

360
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,320
white

361
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,839
it's all shades of gray

362
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,320
and that's why we're going to talk about

363
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,240
how this happens so how do you get

364
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,839
socially constructed beliefs and

365
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,440
how important are these socially

366
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,760
constructed beliefs to your being

367
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,959
well first things first

368
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,600
your brain now what you're looking at in

369
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,399
this photo

370
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,519
is inside the temporal lobe there's a

371
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,880
part of the tissue

372
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,440
called the amygdala the myconulife you

373
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,279
may have heard of is called the fight

374
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,560
versus flight

375
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,920
but the other thing you should know it's

376
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,320
not just a fight versus flight

377
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,959
it's also to stand still in other words

378
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,240
your freeze

379
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,000
so there's another thing in there that

380
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,760
no one talks about but you also may

381
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,440
freeze at the moment

382
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,560
but it's completely subconscious what

383
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,839
this mechanism does

384
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,000
is basically using your your memories

385
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,160
and it's telling your brain

386
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,760
of hey warning warning danger

387
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,920
basically any time that you may feel

388
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,440
afraid or scared

389
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,120
is probably because the amygdala alerted

390
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,800
the prefrontal and by probably

391
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,720
it did so remember my example about like

392
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
as a kid saying that you heard people

393
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,680
with pink hair are dangerous people

394
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,160
and so people with pink hair are

395
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,440
dangerous

396
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,199
so say for example you're walking down

397
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,880
the street and someone with pink hair

398
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,079
is behind you

399
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,720
your amygdala is sending a warning sign

400
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,120
saying

401
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,000
warning warning danger to the prefrontal

402
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,320
cortex to let it know

403
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,680
it needs to act now remember this is

404
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,440
completely subconscious so you have no

405
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,079
idea of that this is happening however

406
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,639
you have to verify the signal so the

407
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,480
warning goes to your prefrontal cortex

408
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,680
of your brain

409
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,040
and from there it says whether or not to

410
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,959
relax or to

411
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,839
take action and then it will send the

412
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,440
message back to the mcdonald and mcdo

413
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:03,760
lets

414
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,000
other parts of the brain know so

415
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,600
going back to the thing for someone with

416
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,120
pink hair behind you

417
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,480
your amygdala sense of warranty

418
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,240
prefrontal cortex saying

419
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,720
warning person with pink hairs behind

420
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,480
you do something

421
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,399
the prefrontal cortex comes up with

422
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,480
different things that it can do

423
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,560
all the various different actions it

424
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,600
uses

425
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,680
theory and logic to be able to figure

426
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,519
out what's the best

427
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,759
way forward what is the best decision

428
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:32,959
here

429
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,160
or what's the best action to take

430
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,480
so in your prefrontal cortex you're like

431
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,240
okay so the person with pink hair

432
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,480
is behind me i have a couple options

433
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,399
here since they're dangerous as i know

434
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,600
and i've been told

435
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,160
in the media and also from friends and

436
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,519
family

437
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,000
all right this person is dangerous

438
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,360
there's a high chance this person is

439
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,600
dangerous

440
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,839
so what you do is you're thinking okay i

441
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,040
can cross the street

442
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,519
that's one way i can go into a store

443
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,959
that's another one

444
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,839
or i can just hold my bag a little bit

445
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,240
closer

446
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,839
so those are the three that come to your

447
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,120
mind now your prefrontal cortex then

448
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,639
breaks it down okay if i were to cross

449
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:15,839
the street at this

450
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,920
what would that look like if i were to

451
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,600
go into the store what would that look

452
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,399
like

453
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,320
if i were to clutch my bag what would

454
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
that look like which one is the safest

455
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,920
way for me to get away from this person

456
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,479
with pink hair

457
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,600
but i want to stop right there because

458
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,480
one thing

459
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,519
is that you'll probably do that

460
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,959
and you'll probably select one of those

461
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,639
three and you'll take that action

462
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,279
so you may collect your bag you may

463
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,079
actually

464
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,600
cross the street you may go into a store

465
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,360
because this person with pink hair is

466
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,759
just walking behind you

467
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,160
i want to reiterate here it's just

468
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,040
someone with

469
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,639
pink hair walking behind you

470
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,279
sometimes it's that simple if you look

471
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:01,839
at it

472
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,799
take a step outside and just realize the

473
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,240
only difference between you

474
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,599
and that person is the color of your

475
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,839
hair

476
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,400
you have been led to believe that people

477
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,480
with pink hair are dangerous individuals

478
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,679
but in reality

479
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,160
they're just like you just have pink

480
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,280
hair

481
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,119
but you wouldn't know that because

482
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,599
everything around you is telling you

483
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,760
about that anytime you question that

484
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,600
it's always telling you that

485
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,679
so you're always consumed by messaging

486
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,919
and imagery around you that pink hair

487
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:34,320
people

488
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,640
are dangerous now to think in your mind

489
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,679
there

490
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,240
is that now you have a moment this

491
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,720
moment

492
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,080
of what happens if i don't

493
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,280
do those things and to get there is

494
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,360
really hard however science has shown us

495
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,039
the only way that you can challenge a

496
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,559
socially constructed belief

497
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,600
is hearing personal stories seeing their

498
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,160
face

499
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,559
talking about how it is to be them

500
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,799
so say for example that you did come

501
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,960
across a youtube video

502
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,360
and in that youtube video it's about a

503
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,280
person with pink hair talking about how

504
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,280
hard it is to be selling pink hair

505
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,919
because every time someone is be like

506
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:18,880
ahead of them

507
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,080
they're looking behind over their

508
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,440
shoulder they're clutching their back or

509
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,720
they cross the street they go in the

510
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,360
store

511
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,880
because they're always assuming that

512
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,400
they're criminals

513
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,160
because every time they turn the news

514
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,080
someone that looks like them

515
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,799
is somehow considered a criminal

516
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,160
everything that they do

517
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,160
it's always going to be seen first as a

518
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,080
criminal and then when they're not being

519
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,720
a criminal

520
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,280
then they must be something special or

521
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,679
something unique and not from

522
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,640
an outlier from the crowd and that's

523
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,360
what that pink

524
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,760
hair person tells you in a video of how

525
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,320
much it's impacted their life

526
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,160
where it's hard for them to walk down

527
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,000
the street because everyone sees them as

528
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,559
a threat when in reality they just want

529
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,880
to be seen for who they are

530
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,480
just themselves so going back to that

531
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,559
thing where you have those choices

532
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,720
of clutching your bag crossing the

533
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,880
street or going to the store

534
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,919
after watching that youtube video that

535
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,360
moment that memory pops up

536
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,600
and in that moment the prefrontal cortex

537
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,160
then thinks

538
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,360
why not do something that is

539
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,080
nothing instead take the chance

540
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,679
remember that video where the person

541
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,760
with the pink hair

542
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,960
remember how painful it was

543
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,919
for that person and when they explained

544
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:40,400
it

545
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,559
how hard it was to exist in a world

546
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,639
where everyone sees you as a criminal

547
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,960
now the thing to note about that is that

548
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,080
when it comes to any stereotype

549
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,440
we are always have the choice once that

550
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,200
message from our amygdala is like

551
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,720
warning morning's danger

552
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,200
like stranger danger goes to the

553
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,640
prefrontal cortex

554
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,000
you are now using logic and reason

555
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,039
to take an action

556
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,280
but that is the moment where we look at

557
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,240
ourselves

558
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,320
and to be like what should i do

559
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,200
and what is the best path forward and

560
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,960
the thing i have to admit is that the

561
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,240
best way how we can

562
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,720
always question our socially constructed

563
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,320
beliefs is getting outside of our

564
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,600
comfort zone

565
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,840
getting outside our bubble understanding

566
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,799
different people

567
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,960
and different backgrounds getting

568
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,320
outside of where we grew

569
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,360
up getting outside of our

570
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,880
environment getting outside our industry

571
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,760
that's how we learn how we learn about

572
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,360
the world that we live in

573
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,080
is by understanding we don't know

574
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,360
everything

575
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,280
and a lot of things that we learned or

576
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,840
we were taught or we've seen in movies

577
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,400
and

578
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,600
also in tv shows or read in a book or

579
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,520
seen on the news

580
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,720
that isn't always true and it's up to us

581
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,640
in our lifetime to

582
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,919
make that decision of

583
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,559
being okay with looking at that we may

584
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:15,679
be wrong

585
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,679
and yeah we're gonna feel insecure but

586
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,600
it's okay not to know everything

587
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,200
but the most important thing is to keep

588
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,679
trying

589
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,760
now what does this have to do

590
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,960
with hacker rights now the thing to

591
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,600
think about

592
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,600
is that the world sees us as criminals

593
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,080
hackers are seen as criminals i know you

594
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,919
probably have had this moment where

595
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,559
you basically you're at an event or

596
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,600
you're with family

597
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,600
or with a group of circle of friends

598
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,720
that you've

599
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,919
just made and they're like so what do

600
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:50,640
you do

601
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,320
and you're like oh i'm a i'm a hacker

602
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,559
sometimes their mouth drops their eyes

603
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,240
get bigger and then they take a step

604
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,000
back further and then they're like i

605
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,640
gotta get out of this situation

606
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,640
because they're afraid of us because

607
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,159
they don't know what we look like

608
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,760
they're always seeing

609
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,919
us as this dark-hooded figure in our

610
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,280
basement

611
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,200
or always that criminal whenever they

612
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,039
hear the term hacker they think

613
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,559
a cyber criminal and we need to change

614
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,000
that narrative

615
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,240
because unfortunately the public

616
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,039
believes that hackers are bad people

617
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,039
so yeah we have used term security

618
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,200
researcher

619
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,360
but that's not how we always want to be

620
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,200
called the reason we got in here in the

621
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,480
first place is because

622
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,880
of the term hacker because we were

623
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,679
intrigued

624
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,960
because we knew that we think

625
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,799
differently from our peers we

626
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,760
felt an outcast at some point we think

627
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,840
of things differently than

628
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,799
normally other people may see we like to

629
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,640
take things apart we like to understand

630
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,120
how it works put it back together or

631
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,960
maybe find new solutions

632
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,520
that's what being a hacker is is having

633
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,760
that mindset

634
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,400
of how can this be improved on and how

635
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,039
does this

636
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,559
work and that's what makes us

637
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,120
an amazing community is that we're

638
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,880
constantly trying to think outside the

639
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,320
box

640
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,600
but now we have to figure out how to use

641
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,240
what is outside the box to change the

642
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,640
public perception of who we are

643
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,080
and that's what the rest of this talk is

644
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,240
going to be about is the

645
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,640
the way that the public perceives us and

646
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,080
what we can do

647
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,799
to change that narrative by the media

648
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,400
and legislation

649
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,679
and also organizations

650
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,520
now remember i said that youtube video

651
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,679
of like in the example of a person with

652
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:42,640
pink hair sharing

653
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,640
how hard it is for them you could do

654
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,919
something like that

655
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,039
with us so hacking is not a crime we put

656
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,799
out this thing called

657
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,080
hacker stories and you can go to

658
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,039
hackinsnitecrime.org to learn more about

659
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:55,760
it

660
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,200
but basically it's just a video of you

661
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,240
talking to your camera for anywhere from

662
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,200
two minutes to

663
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,640
however long you want to sharing about

664
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,120
what made you become a hacker what are

665
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,320
things that you love about being a

666
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,080
hacker and what are the

667
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,159
the issues that you have faced by being

668
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,840
a hacker

669
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,760
because the public doesn't see as of who

670
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,679
we are

671
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,000
because we come from all walks of the

672
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,919
world which is amazing

673
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,520
i mean i've met like a 70 year old

674
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,679
woman who's a hacker like this is

675
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,320
amazing i wish that was out more than

676
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,440
like that

677
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,159
that creepy guy with the ski mask with

678
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:37,039
the

679
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,440
with the eye cutouts and like i don't

680
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,080
know

681
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,840
anyway the thing is is that we gotta

682
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,880
change this like now

683
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,919
and that's what we're going to talk

684
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,159
about is how to influence the public

685
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:49,039
perception of

686
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,880
hackers because as you've learned

687
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,799
from previously is that socially

688
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,400
constructive beliefs

689
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,240
stem from the media that means your

690
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,720
movies your tv what's on social media

691
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,640
what you read in books what you read in

692
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,400
the news

693
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,480
that is the media because it's through

694
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,039
imagery that we see when we do a google

695
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,159
search or

696
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,760
when we go to articles or when we see

697
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,799
a special cnn like special

698
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,000
on like hackers and the community

699
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,039
or hackers on the election security and

700
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,720
it's like dark-hooded

701
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,120
like figure and like a bunch of like

702
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,440
random digits all over the place and

703
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,400
like this like

704
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,159
this really like deep dark sounds

705
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,679
in the background you know what i mean

706
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,919
anyway it's hysterical

707
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,159
but it's also sad because people see us

708
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,559
as this

709
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,440
but also it's the terminology that's

710
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,320
being used

711
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,080
because they don't know the difference

712
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,000
between a hacker and attacker they keep

713
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,039
using the term

714
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,279
hacker and even when they do know

715
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,600
they're supposed to use the difference

716
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,240
of the two they choose not to because

717
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,080
they're worried about the readership

718
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,559
so this is another problem on top of it

719
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:05,200
so

720
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,840
the imagery and terminology keeps being

721
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,600
cycled with the same stuff even though

722
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,440
they know that's not supposed to be like

723
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,480
that

724
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,559
because of the viewership

725
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,039
but the reality is that we have to

726
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,559
reinforce that

727
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:23,279
it does hurt us and we have to let them

728
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,880
know we need to let the public

729
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,840
know outside of the media and within the

730
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,480
media

731
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,640
that there is a huge difference between

732
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,320
us because

733
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,039
we get stuff like this on the news

734
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,000
it's not a hacker that threatened the

735
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,760
link patience therapy knows

736
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,240
hackers don't do that you know who

737
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,880
doesn't attackers

738
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,880
that's what attackers do and hackers

739
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,080
definitely don't turn your home

740
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,440
computers into a bomb

741
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,440
come on now so we need to correct them

742
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,600
nicely because majority of the time they

743
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,840
really don't know

744
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,000
so how do you change that situation if

745
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,440
you are a reader

746
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,240
of a post on social media or if you read

747
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,200
an article

748
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,679
first remember to be kind they do not

749
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:10,880
know better

750
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,720
because they've believed into those

751
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,159
socially constructed beliefs that

752
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,080
hackers are criminals

753
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,240
so the best way how to do it is to dm

754
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,120
them

755
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,279
or to comment publicly remember once

756
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,320
again to be

757
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,279
nice you will never get anything out of

758
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:25,919
someone

759
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,840
through anger you will only get

760
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,520
something else on if you're

761
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,399
genuinely nice and kind and trying to

762
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:33,760
understand

763
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,799
in other words having empathy

764
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,559
and then right when you do comment

765
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,279
publicly make sure to tag hack not crime

766
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,720
so our advocates

767
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,919
can also support you at any time or

768
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,360
if the journalist or editor wants to ask

769
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,880
further questions about it

770
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,799
then they can loop us in so we can help

771
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,480
you out don't go at it alone the one

772
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,159
thing i can tell you from my experience

773
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,760
through all this hacker right stuff is

774
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,760
don't do it by yourself

775
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,120
ever it's really hard so these are some

776
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,799
examples of how you can call it out on

777
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:05,760
the news

778
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,720
for example you know letting them know

779
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,200
hey

780
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,520
you know in your article when you said

781
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,559
that

782
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,919
a hacker did these that's not a

783
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,960
a hacker that's an attacker hackers are

784
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,600
like this

785
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,360
the other way you can do it it's also

786
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,200
marketing so one thing you should note

787
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,080
is that media also means marketing so a

788
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,640
lot of times unfortunately in infosec

789
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,080
marketing teams don't know

790
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,600
that they should not be using that

791
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,840
terminology they also use

792
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,880
you know that hooded figure

793
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,799
kind of imagery and they shouldn't be

794
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,399
doing that anymore so

795
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,039
one of the things is calling that out

796
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,720
publicly

797
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,159
remember to be kind um the other way is

798
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,240
once conferences are back in person is

799
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,279
to actually approach

800
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,760
their their tables i have done this in

801
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,720
the past

802
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,960
and asked to speak with someone on their

803
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,240
marketing team because there's always

804
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,600
someone on the marketing team

805
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,880
at a booth and then tell them that

806
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,960
hey you know the image that's on the

807
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,000
outside of this

808
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,120
or your document says hackers

809
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,360
did you know that i'm a hacker and this

810
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,159
is what a hacker also can look like

811
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,760
and they don't know that that's the

812
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,840
craziest part of this all they don't

813
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,480
know that

814
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,559
and so it's so important that we call it

815
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,159
out so then they're aware of it but

816
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,919
remember to be kind about it because you

817
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,679
don't want to embarrass them either

818
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,520
you just want to have a healthy dialogue

819
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,520
and then when they get it right in the

820
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,600
news or when marketing does it

821
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,799
well give them kudos be like hey thank

822
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,640
you so much

823
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,480
i love it when i see someone does that

824
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,600
now the other thing you can do is if

825
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,840
for example we did this one for new york

826
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,440
times

827
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,960
a bunch of us came together and we

828
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,480
decided to send a

829
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,120
letter to the copy desk at new york

830
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,480
times letting them know that their

831
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,440
articles keep

832
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,279
stating um hacker instead of attacker

833
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,120
and it really is hurting us and this is

834
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,960
what we sent them

835
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,919
and we keep on doing this too and we're

836
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,760
going to keep on doing this until

837
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,399
they finally agree to it so that is

838
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,840
another way how to do it to send a

839
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,520
letter to the copy desk and if you need

840
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,279
help on that feel free to reach out to

841
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,000
me

842
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,200
more than happy to help out

843
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
now the other thing to do is that if you

844
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,600
are someone who talks to the press

845
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,200
ever or someone who is you know

846
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,320
publishes blogs or anything like that

847
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,080
it's really important is that when you

848
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,919
are talking to a reporter

849
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,360
or an editor or even in a message

850
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,559
to a journalist or an editor make sure

851
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,200
to always let them know and remind them

852
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,200
hey by the way when you report this

853
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,200
story it's really important that you use

854
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,720
the right terminology

855
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,679
that that this is about attackers not

856
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,080
hackers there's a huge difference

857
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,480
because hackers are not criminals

858
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,840
hacking is not a crime

859
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,799
and yet it keeps being seen so so we

860
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:09,760
really appreciate it

861
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,440
if i'm participating in this is to

862
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,440
please do that and then also

863
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,440
when they're ready to record your

864
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,080
conversation or record your comment make

865
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,880
sure to

866
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,399
use the right terminology

867
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,760
and please if you're ever on camera with

868
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,480
anything that's

869
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,440
outside of infosec please don't wear a

870
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:29,919
hoodie

871
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,200
especially you're talking in the press

872
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,039
you know what you should do

873
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,320
wear a suit and tie or wear a dress

874
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,559
or you know what wear something that

875
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:40,480
they would never think a hacker would

876
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,279
wear

877
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,120
please don't wear a costume though don't

878
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,960
just don't do that please don't do that

879
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,320
because they already see that quite a

880
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,320
bit so the thing is is like

881
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,000
dress up totally different than what

882
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,360
they think you would wear

883
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,519
just look like you are a suit and tie or

884
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,880
an executive at some

885
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,960
tech company yeah you could wear a

886
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,080
t-shirt i guess

887
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,320
but that's the thing is like we need to

888
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,480
change the way that people are seeing us

889
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,039
too

890
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,440
so we can start doing that by wearing a

891
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,640
text if you want

892
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,720
or like wearing a suit and tie or

893
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,760
wearing a dress

894
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,440
or wearing a nice dress shirt

895
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,480
people get a kick out of it because the

896
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,159
results of the media to be honest with

897
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:18,640
you

898
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,360
is that it has impacted our community in

899
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,640
so many ways

900
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,360
the first thing first is that 94 of the

901
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,960
forbes global 2000

902
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,720
still don't have any vulnerability

903
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,880
disclosure policies

904
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,640
that in itself is just disturbing

905
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,159
the other thing is that one out of four

906
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,240
hackers don't report any vulnerabilities

907
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,200
and when they do

908
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,679
usually they're either ignored or then

909
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,279
they're told like

910
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,000
to back away they're gonna send a

911
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,720
lawsuit at them it's terrible

912
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,679
also laws that prevent good hacking

913
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,600
that's something that

914
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,080
we need good hacking to exist to protect

915
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,480
people to protect organizations without

916
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,519
us

917
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,039
we would have chaos also

918
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,760
we need to change things because hackers

919
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,519
are still being prosecuted and the one

920
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,120
thing to note though is that most of the

921
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,320
prosecution's happening

922
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,240
is not on a federal level as much

923
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,360
anymore

924
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,559
is more on local side and by companies

925
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,840
so just keep that in mind also the thing

926
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,159
is

927
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,080
is that because of how the media has set

928
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,919
things up and where we are

929
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,320
today on the public perception is that

930
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,159
it's also increasing the number of bad

931
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,840
actors in our space

932
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,679
because they came in with good

933
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,039
intentions

934
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,679
but then recognized real fast that like

935
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,600
no one sees them with good intentions

936
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,720
and they're like well

937
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,799
forget this i can just make money off

938
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:41,840
this because no one

939
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,279
really cares about me and they're all

940
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,960
gonna throw me with a lawsuit so i'm

941
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,519
just gonna do it my way

942
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,200
but i have to admit there's also this

943
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,120
thing called guilt that comes in

944
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,720
so there are some that when they get

945
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,320
guilty they come back

946
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,918
so that's one thing is to think about

947
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,399
next step how to influence legislation

948
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,840
so we went into the media

949
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,919
we talked about public perception but

950
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,519
public perception of media does

951
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,320
influence legislation

952
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,320
because the laws right now they prevent

953
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,000
good hacking in the same way that they

954
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,960
prevent

955
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,599
attackers and we need good hacking here

956
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,040
because there's this thing called the

957
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,520
computer fraud

958
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,359
abuse act the cfaa and this was

959
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,879
found in the 80s and basically how this

960
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,800
came about was that ronald reagan he

961
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,960
went to a special screening

962
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,239
of war games which i absolutely loved

963
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,440
that movie but i

964
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,079
have to admit i'm also a little upset at

965
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,918
that movie because that was the movie

966
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,839
that he watched he went full panic mode

967
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:46,639
and was like

968
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,119
we need to shut those hackers down there

969
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,199
is no good hacker out there

970
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,359
we need to have something created and

971
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,199
that is how the cfa

972
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,680
was created welcome to my history 101 on

973
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,160
hacking

974
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,079
and so this has been an issue because

975
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,560
it's been misused by prosecution

976
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,200
especially by corporations and local

977
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,480
governments

978
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,680
it's also extremely vague so this could

979
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,760
be used in many ways to prosecute a

980
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,280
hacker

981
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,079
even to the full extent also

982
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:18,960
redundancies

983
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,720
you can basically be charged over and

984
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,960
over and over for the same crime

985
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,520
and that's another problem so the cfa

986
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,720
has been around

987
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,040
before y2k and it's exactly the same

988
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,200
since then like there has been no

989
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,640
changes or updates on it

990
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,760
and we are now in what year 2021

991
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,599
so yeah things need to change clearly

992
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,640
because the reality is is that people

993
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,680
are getting hurt all the time by it the

994
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,040
cfa is the thing

995
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,320
that hurts our community so much in many

996
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:52,880
ways

997
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,440
yes granted we do not need legislation

998
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,960
that protects

999
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,880
the good guys from the bad guys don't

1000
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,119
get me wrong but the reality is is that

1001
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,200
it's hurting the good guys

1002
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,320
and this is a problem for example aaron

1003
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,359
swartz

1004
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,599
aaron swartz was he basically he went

1005
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,880
into jstor

1006
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,200
and download a bunch of different

1007
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,920
articles

1008
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,960
that was ba basically backed

1009
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,880
by taxpayer research funds

1010
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,079
he wanted to make it publicly available

1011
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,839
and he got slammed for it

1012
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,440
he got attacked by it and what ended up

1013
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,400
happening was that

1014
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,280
he was looking at a 17-month legal

1015
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,800
battle

1016
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,640
with charges of 35 years in prison

1017
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,040
i want to just stop like just pause

1018
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,040
there did you know that for like

1019
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,560
for murder case it's 25-year minimum

1020
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,680
but yet he was facing a 35-year minimum

1021
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,920
it's not like he hurt someone physically

1022
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,560
it's not like he damaged someone at all

1023
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,560
but yet 35 years for articles

1024
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,400
that were funded by american taxpayers

1025
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,079
yeah granted he should have not

1026
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,400
you know granted access without

1027
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
permission i get that

1028
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,040
but 35 years does that seem even to

1029
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,400
anyone

1030
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,560
or the fact that he also had to pay like

1031
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,440
1 million in

1032
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,200
fines this is what he was looking at

1033
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,680
he was 17 months into a legal battle

1034
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,040
that didn't seem like there was going to

1035
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,280
be an ending anytime soon

1036
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,720
with 35 years of prison and 1 million

1037
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,160
dollars in fines

1038
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,400
attached to that i cannot imagine

1039
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,599
what he must felt like to feel

1040
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:38,960
completely trapped

1041
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,040
because they were using him as an

1042
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,960
example to set an example

1043
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,880
why people shouldn't be hackers in the

1044
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,440
community

1045
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:51,359
it is so sad because the way had the cfa

1046
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,680
was written is that it does allow

1047
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,680
to stack on years and payments

1048
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,359
for a single crime

1049
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,680
and that's the thing is that aaron

1050
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,720
swords was looking

1051
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,760
at a 17-month legal battle with all

1052
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,560
these other things

1053
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,280
unknowing of how long it would be to

1054
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,000
serve

1055
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
in jail also the fact that like one

1056
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,040
million in fines

1057
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,720
and then also because he thought

1058
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,000
what he did is something that people

1059
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,280
should have access to

1060
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,400
he wasn't hurting anyone he didn't plan

1061
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,480
to hurt anyone

1062
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,079
it was something completely peaceful

1063
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,240
and unfortunately he ended his life

1064
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,280
very early

1065
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,760
it's really sad because the case is

1066
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,720
aaron's force

1067
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,920
shows us that we need change

1068
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,480
and it's been quite some time since this

1069
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,680
and yet there's been

1070
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,200
no changes there was something that came

1071
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,920
about called aaron's law

1072
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,079
and it was going to fix these problems

1073
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:02,160
that the cfaa does

1074
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,280
so people that have

1075
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,839
been basically dealing with legal

1076
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,040
situations

1077
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,560
in the u.s similar to aaron swartz case

1078
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,560
would never have to deal with that again

1079
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,839
they'd still have to

1080
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:18,560
have prosecution don't get me wrong but

1081
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,119
the redundancies would be taken out

1082
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:22,800
and that the verbiage would be a lot

1083
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,240
more clear

1084
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,440
so it wouldn't be so vague

1085
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,359
and the thing to think about the sad

1086
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,280
part of it is that it didn't pass

1087
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,160
because there are major lobbyist groups

1088
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,720
and majority of them were tech companies

1089
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,280
that don't want that to happen because

1090
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,280
the cfa is what they use against their

1091
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,160
own employees if they step out of line

1092
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,960
but also for them to protect against

1093
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,000
hackers

1094
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,880
remember that whole like forbes global

1095
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,160
2000 list

1096
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,839
94 don't have a vulnerability disclosure

1097
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:57,599
policies

1098
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,320
it's it's because there is no bridge

1099
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,359
between these two

1100
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,440
parties the hacker community and them

1101
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,359
and this is why legislation has to

1102
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,319
change because if legislation changes

1103
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:14,079
then imagine all the forbes global 2000

1104
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,240
having vulnerability disclosure policies

1105
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,400
so we all know what's in scope what's

1106
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,240
out of scope how to report who to

1107
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,200
contact

1108
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,920
i mean remember like when you find

1109
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,000
something and you try to find the person

1110
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,480
to

1111
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,960
contact sometimes it takes hours days

1112
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,000
weeks and they just kind of give up

1113
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,079
or when we contact them and dm them on

1114
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,119
social media

1115
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,560
hoping that they will respond but in

1116
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,480
reality who owns that it's the marketing

1117
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,760
team does the marketing team have

1118
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,359
connection with security teams no

1119
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,040
usually don't they don't know who to

1120
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,160
give that to you if anything they're

1121
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,599
like okay let's give this a pr

1122
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,280
pr sends the two legal team legal team

1123
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,640
sends it a lawsuit

1124
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,760
i mean that's how it is we have to find

1125
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,359
a way where we can communicate with

1126
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:54,160
parties

1127
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,119
because customers need to be protected

1128
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,960
and we want the companies to know

1129
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,880
hey we found something that is important

1130
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,280
to you and your business

1131
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,880
and also for your customers

1132
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,400
the other thing is that imagine if all

1133
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,079
of us could report our vulnerabilities

1134
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,440
that we find

1135
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,319
safely it wouldn't be just about good

1136
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,079
faith anymore it's just because there's

1137
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,560
something set up a process

1138
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,800
where we feel protected and the company

1139
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,800
feels protected so it goes

1140
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,240
it's a really good regulated way

1141
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,160
also laws that encourage good hacking

1142
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,560
because it's i'm tired of all these

1143
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,040
people that like end up becoming

1144
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,119
you know changing their shade of their

1145
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,560
the hat that they wear

1146
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,560
when they're a hacker because that

1147
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,680
they're just fed up it shouldn't be that

1148
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,359
way

1149
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,920
because imagine if they were all on the

1150
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,640
good side

1151
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,400
the other thing is the prosecution of

1152
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,319
hackers has to stop

1153
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,319
it's gone too far and we're always

1154
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,839
afraid

1155
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,079
and that's why we need rights we need

1156
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:03,119
protection

1157
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,640
because we have none so what can you do

1158
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,079
in this moment

1159
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,119
well be bold and kind remember one of

1160
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,880
the things i will always tell people is

1161
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,240
to have empathy

1162
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,240
majority of time the public perception

1163
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,440
of the hacker community

1164
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,359
is that we're criminals there were

1165
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:20,880
dangerous individuals

1166
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,400
or in the tech world they think that

1167
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,240
word the nerds of them all

1168
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,839
who knows but the one thing i can tell

1169
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,599
you is vote

1170
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,079
vote like your life depends on it when

1171
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,119
you vote you're

1172
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,800
taking a stance when you purchase

1173
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,720
something you're voting

1174
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,839
everything you do whenever you're

1175
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,720
basically trading something for money or

1176
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,440
purchasing

1177
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,560
something or you know signing

1178
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,400
up for something you're voting for

1179
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,040
something so be aware of that

1180
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,119
but also register to vote there are some

1181
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,560
people that aren't registered that

1182
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,599
should register

1183
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,119
if you can legally vote

1184
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,280
you have no excuse get to know your

1185
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,839
local representatives in other words

1186
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:09,359
here you go find your representative

1187
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:10,560
that's the other thing so register to

1188
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,200
vote know your representatives

1189
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,800
because that's important anytime you

1190
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,319
need something done contact your

1191
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,079
representatives

1192
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,319
i cannot push that enough like in

1193
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:21,920
california a lot of people were dealing

1194
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,800
with like

1195
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,079
cases of edd so unemployment pay

1196
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,560
or payment system in california

1197
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,119
people can get through so what did they

1198
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:34,640
do they contacted their local

1199
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,440
representative

1200
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,720
you know what their local representative

1201
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,640
did connected to edd

1202
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,920
you know what they got they got their

1203
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,400
money this is why representatives are

1204
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,000
really important because they help

1205
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,119
us out because we voted them in

1206
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,680
they also represent the people of their

1207
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,800
district

1208
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,400
so it's so important is to know who your

1209
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,079
representatives are because they're also

1210
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:55,359
the ones that can push for

1211
00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:58,960
change because when you do that

1212
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,839
for example set up a meeting with them

1213
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,520
set up a meeting and talk about

1214
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,319
what it's like to be a hacker and why

1215
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:07,839
this needs to change that this should

1216
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,000
not be existing anymore that

1217
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,920
hacker shouldn't be getting prosecuted

1218
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,359
right now hackers should have

1219
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,480
protections

1220
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,920
they're doing this out of good faith to

1221
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,680
protect and serve that's all what we're

1222
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:18,880
doing here

1223
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,560
we need protection like i said

1224
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,680
don't go at it alone contact hack is not

1225
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,079
crime

1226
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,520
we'll be there we will be there for you

1227
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,920
because we have to work together that's

1228
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,040
the only way we're going to have change

1229
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,520
the other thing is besides legislation

1230
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,079
media remember organizations

1231
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,920
vulnerability disclosure or loan

1232
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,680
disclosure depending on which way you

1233
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,119
want to go about this

1234
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,319
but the reality is every single company

1235
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,240
should have one

1236
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,240
as and just make sure that if every

1237
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,160
company has one go with a platform if

1238
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,079
you don't have the management

1239
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,960
or ticketing system in existence or the

1240
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,599
right

1241
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,240
way of organizing your company to be

1242
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,079
able to handle bug bounty

1243
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,400
or vulnerability disclosure so always

1244
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,680
have someone in charge

1245
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,760
but there's a lot of programs out there

1246
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,079
that can help you out

1247
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,079
so why vulnerability disclosure well one

1248
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,599
it does reduce breaches

1249
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:18,560
and also think of hundreds of eyes

1250
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,400
thousands of eyes around the world being

1251
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,960
able to look for vulnerabilities for you

1252
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,520
and to catch it and because the thing is

1253
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,440
your security team is going to miss one

1254
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,280
that's just a reality the more eyes you

1255
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,800
have on something the more people will

1256
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,960
catch some faults of it

1257
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,680
so why not just make it out there and

1258
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,200
have something written up where people

1259
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,960
can understand it

1260
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,200
also because it allows a bilateral trust

1261
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,280
between organization hackers so they can

1262
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,000
keep security

1263
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,400
and check with each other and also

1264
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,240
anytime i hear someone say

1265
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,480
no just rely your security with scanners

1266
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,680
i just a part of me curls up a little

1267
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,800
bit inside

1268
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,400
so if you have a vulnerability

1269
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,599
disclosure policies at your work

1270
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,280
here's how you can prove it one state

1271
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,200
what's in scope what's out of scope

1272
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,359
also don't write it for attorneys come

1273
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:12,319
on

1274
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:14,720
none of us read whatever terms and

1275
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,480
conditions are okay if you do

1276
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,160
kudos to you i'm not gonna do that

1277
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,319
i'm talking about like the apple

1278
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:23,520
products

1279
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,640
sometimes like 50 pages long i mean i've

1280
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,560
i've tried reading it and then i'm like

1281
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,079
you know what they already own my life

1282
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,200
at this point

1283
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,240
why even bother anyway the thing is we

1284
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,839
have to write it so

1285
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,000
people can understand it we have hackers

1286
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,200
all around the world so

1287
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,119
think of it as more of like writing it

1288
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,040
for english learners so everyone can

1289
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,000
understand it

1290
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,240
not too verbose something very simple

1291
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,079
and straightforward

1292
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:50,000
contact information we need to know who

1293
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,839
to contact that's the email address

1294
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,040
we're doing that

1295
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,040
and then communication so once i submit

1296
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,720
a vulnerability i would love for a

1297
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,000
response

1298
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,560
when you come into the office that's

1299
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,160
really important i want to know how

1300
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,000
things are going so doing check-ins

1301
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,599
would be great

1302
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:08,960
and having a dedicated person who knows

1303
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,880
how to manage prioritize and task

1304
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,839
remember the dji case with kevin

1305
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,079
and how like basically there this person

1306
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,560
took two weeks to respond to him

1307
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,160
that's letting you know they did not

1308
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,400
have a dedicated person for it most

1309
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,119
likely

1310
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:24,559
so that's why it's really important is

1311
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,400
to have something like that if you're

1312
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,880
planning to do it on your own how are

1313
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,079
there are

1314
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,559
platforms out there that do support vdps

1315
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,960
the other thing to do is that once you

1316
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,079
do have vulnerability

1317
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:39,760
disclosure policies at your company

1318
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,599
check out disclose.io

1319
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,920
or if you're even thinking about getting

1320
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,200
you know vulnerability disclosure

1321
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,559
policies at your company

1322
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:49,599
check out disclose.io disclose.io is

1323
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,119
trying to

1324
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,000
provide a safe haven not a safe haven

1325
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:54,720
but

1326
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,920
basically a safe harbor way of reporting

1327
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,280
vulnerabilities

1328
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,839
that hackers in good faith are coming to

1329
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,440
you

1330
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,000
and as an organization you have to have

1331
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:06,880
good faith

1332
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,559
by asking for them

1333
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,359
besides disclosure the other things that

1334
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:14,400
you can do

1335
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,359
about organizations is to volunteer and

1336
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:18,160
give give

1337
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,280
time or give funds if you can or even

1338
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:21,760
call and

1339
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,200
ask hey how can i help you they love

1340
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,400
that

1341
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,280
so eff is another one i'm the calvary

1342
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,240
cert cc

1343
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,480
cti league dissolves that io and hack is

1344
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,000
not crime these are all great

1345

working to help the community because we

1357
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,280
need to come together

1358
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,880
record a video and participate in

1359
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,960
hashtag hacker stories project because

1360
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,559
that is how we challenge public

1361
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,520
perception

1362
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,200
is by letting them know what we look

1363
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,880
like in our story

1364
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,880
our personal stories challenges their

1365
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,440
socially constructed beliefs

1366
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,559
and it reduces the hate that we get

1367
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:19,920
work with the press and keep them

1368
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,359
informed in other words the press is

1369
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,200
your friend don't forget that they are

1370
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,960
your friend and it's important to let

1371
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:25,680
them know

1372
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,359
that if they're reporting something

1373
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:30,800
wrong good journalists care about that

1374
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,119
and remember to always have empathy and

1375
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,480
be kind

1376
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,240
a lot of people don't know who we are

1377
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,760
what our community is like they don't

1378
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,040
know what we look like

1379
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,200
and because of that they're kind of

1380
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,680
believing whatever they're being told

1381
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,520
or what they read about or what they see

1382
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,760
in movies and that's not the reality

1383
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,040
so remember to be kind because the

1384
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:51,839
reality is

1385
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,240
at the end of this talk i want one thing

1386
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,640
for you to take away

1387
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,000
is that change starts with you and me

1388
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,920
and that's something that we tend to

1389
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,440
forget about quite a bit

1390
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,640
once in a while is that you

1391
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,880
have an opportunity to make a difference

1392
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,880
in your life

1393
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,880
you can live a life of just living a

1394
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,160
life

1395
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,640
but wouldn't it mean a lot more if you

1396
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,839
did something with it

1397
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:20,640
in a sense where you're helping others

1398
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,000
because you have two hands

1399
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,839
