1
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,228
and the past known attacks and like how

2
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,769
those attacks with like material

3
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:24,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">recanting and obviously about the puzzle</font>

4
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:29,199
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've worked on and finally the demo</font>

5
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:31,698
of like one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the crashes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

6
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,530
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't be like discussing the</font>

7
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:35,870
details about the crash that has taken

8
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:39,340
place because I were a tipping point I

9
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money out of it</font>

10
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:49,490
and yeah i'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you the demo to sit</font>

11
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:52,310
so scared up so how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you are like</font>

12
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:54,350
familiar with skate around here well

13
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:57,620
beautiful like you lot more people<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

14
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:59,030
I expected so scanner<font color="#E5E5E5"> dick is defined as</font>

15
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,940
a supervisory control data acquisition

16
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:03,260
and that is the acronym for it and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

17
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">defined as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the common process of</font>

18
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,699
application and collects data from

19
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:09,500
sensors and<font color="#E5E5E5"> shafts off or in the remote</font>

20
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:11,930
locations and sends it to the central

21
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,770
computer for like what you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

22
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:17,180
processing of that particular data so a

23
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,830
typical<font color="#CCCCCC"> example would be like in a</font>

24
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,510
manufacturing plant or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something where</font>

25
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,370
like you're like doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of</font>

26
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,990
manufacturing and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

27
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,389
say like you're producing a thousand

28
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,250
computers a day and say some point of

29
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:30,199
the parts is like you just ran out and

30
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,849
so like you have like the first 800

31
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,979
which has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> manufactured completely</font>

32
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:35,419
and like the next 200 which just doesn't

33
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:37,639
have that particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> part in it that</font>

34
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:39,139
kind of thing so you want those sensors

35
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:41,449
to send out information through your

36
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:43,820
central server and there you basically

37
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:47,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">say okay fine like stop production right</font>

38
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:49,699
now that kind of thing so and it is like

39
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,780
the most widely component of your cradle

40
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:52,310
infrastructure by critical

41
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,948
infrastructure I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> like all your</font>

42
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,979
nuclear power plants your electricity

43
00:05:54,949 --> 00:06:00,110
utilities the gas war all those<font color="#E5E5E5"> places</font>

44
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:01,460
everywhere I mean the manufacturing

45
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,229
plants are just like the smaller scale

46
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:07,909
of where the scalar networks is being

47
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:09,320
used right now so the basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> components</font>

48
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:11,930
of the scanner networks are like you

49
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,729
have like the operator the guy who looks

50
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,250
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer and things like he's</font>

51
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:18,710
cool and then you have the human machine

52
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,090
interface which basically pulls out like

53
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,799
the software basically which puts out a

54
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,859
nice GUI of the

55
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,300
how the interpretation is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

56
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it collected from the</font>

57
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,009
empty use what an mpu is basically it's

58
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:32,930
a master terminal unit which basically

59
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:34,819
aggregates all the data<font color="#CCCCCC"> from all the</font>

60
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,919
remote sensors and then pulls<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up</font>

61
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:39,650
together makes an analysis of it and

62
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:41,150
gives the this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one like it if the MTU</font>

63
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,799
basically does<font color="#CCCCCC"> or if there's an any</font>

64
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,020
query coming and likes it from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the any</font>

65
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,639
of the RT use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just says like okay</font>

66
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,198
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the response for it but there</font>

67
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,479
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> like some cases where the odd cases</font>

68
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:52,280
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> empty use is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

69
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,860
a decision for it that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> when like it</font>

70
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,318
comes to the operator to make the call

71
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,610
so one such cases like when lick your

72
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:01,550
manufacturing something and like you

73
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,930
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> parts available</font>

74
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,300
anymore so then that's when like you

75
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:07,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to like check up with this one the</font>

76
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,229
empty empty makes a flag for that

77
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">canceling then there's the communication</font>

78
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,479
channel they can write another scalar

79
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:12,800
network goes through<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sorts of</font>

80
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,229
possible channels like right from

81
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet to your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless cell phone</font>

82
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:21,289
towers everything so and finally the RT

83
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:25,490
use which basically does the oldest

84
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:27,919
dirty work of collecting the data here's

85
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:30,050
a cool little thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do well as</font>

86
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,789
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over here like the the</font>

87
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,590
robotics is something some kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

88
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:35,990
manufacturing plants those are the RT

89
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,000
years and then we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the routers</font>

90
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,699
and the plz plz sub messing with program

91
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,460
logic controllers and those are used to

92
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:46,880
again like they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be working as an</font>

93
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:48,440
intermediate<font color="#CCCCCC"> three empty use so again</font>

94
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">like this entire scatter architecture</font>

95
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,099
you don't have to like make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it less like</font>

96
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:54,050
one master and<font color="#E5E5E5"> slave it came like master</font>

97
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:56,599
master and slave<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm like the</font>

98
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:59,180
intermediate guy acts as a slave to the

99
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:03,520
above the hierarchy that<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

100
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:05,629
tree hierarchy I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think and like</font>

101
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,549
initially one like the scalar networks

102
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:09,080
were all developed they were all mainly

103
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">going through like the serial ports and</font>

104
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,590
those kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and they were like</font>

105
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:14,659
short distance that<font color="#E5E5E5"> cannot think and so</font>

106
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,299
it all started that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way like using like</font>

107
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:19,400
rs-232 and those kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and now</font>

108
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,680
nowadays nowadays it's all going through

109
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,940
ethernet and then like the expected ones

110
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,120
is going to be like also like the

111
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:28,219
wireless in the caster so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like</font>

112
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,849
the basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> diagram like how it could</font>

113
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:34,969
possibly look and oh yeah obviously like

114
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:35,718
you can attack on like the into the HMI

115
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:37,699
itself we're like

116
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:39,169
the anti processing takes place you can

117
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:41,419
attack the empty you wear like you can

118
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:44,208
force that want to go down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and you</font>

119
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:45,680
can attack the PLC's or the rtu it's

120
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:47,239
like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensors</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's of you can take</font>

121
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:52,069
control<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the sensors it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> order</font>

122
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">to buck they take an attack of thing why</font>

123
00:08:52,069 --> 00:08:56,300
do we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> security in the scalar</font>

124
00:08:53,420 --> 00:09:00,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">networks firstly Emily simple question</font>

125
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:02,209
when this<font color="#E5E5E5"> product and when if i'm not</font>

126
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:05,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">wrong like your Modbus was like created</font>

127
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:07,399
in like 1970s so obviously they didn't

128
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,599
have security in mind in 1970s when they

129
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:11,540
created these stuffs for like

130
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,550
communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> purposes and when they did</font>

131
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,740
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then like now it's still being</font>

132
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,660
used by some of the not some like many

133
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,970
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies they still use Modbus</font>

134
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:22,310
protocol and there was an extension to

135
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:24,259
it called Modbus plus and the marbles or

136
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet in those kind of things but the</font>

137
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:29,000
the basics<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the protocol it still</font>

138
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,740
remains the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same but didn't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

139
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,620
adding any of the security features to

140
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,269
it it's still one<font color="#E5E5E5"> double select some of</font>

141
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,699
your critical infrastructure is like we

142
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:40,699
use dnp3<font color="#E5E5E5"> in like all most of the gas in</font>

143
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:44,479
the water industries and it's still not

144
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:47,449
so secure the UCR see but yeah right

145
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,490
that kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing so it's pretty easy</font>

146
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:51,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm like the next thing is like the</font>

147
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:55,129
pretty one good example was like the

148
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:58,689
blackout emlak which took place in 2003

149
00:09:55,129 --> 00:10:01,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">January yeah yeah 2003 January and it</font>

150
00:09:58,689 --> 00:10:03,620
was basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> an overload and that kind</font>

151
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:05,508
of thing but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can also likes it and</font>

152
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,610
there was like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other case where like</font>

153
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:10,339
you had like the nuclear power plant go

154
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:12,769
down for like five hours and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll get</font>

155
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:15,920
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> those examples coming Nick next</font>

156
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:17,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">slides so that was just one example like</font>

157
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,309
the blackout happened because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

158
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,319
overload but there could be like

159
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:22,819
possibly like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> government is like</font>

160
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:24,559
probably hiding it from us or something

161
00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:27,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">and in there we're like somebody</font>

162
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:30,279
attacked into it it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy I'm</font>

163
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:34,459
like it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like so very difficult yes</font>

164
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:38,449
Jeff so I know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought he had a</font>

165
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:40,399
question sir until like the blackout

166
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:41,050
silica that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one for you think</font>

167
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,839
the

168
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,670
hey think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where like your</font>

169
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,230
company in Company B and like what if

170
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,060
you're producing the same stuff unlike

171
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,339
one easy way one like take on the

172
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,839
company<font color="#CCCCCC"> b will be like yeah they produce</font>

173
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:54,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">so many stuffs during the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Christmas time</font>

174
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:56,800
that's when their sales is really high

175
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:58,689
let's take them down on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Christmas that</font>

176
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,790
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing so simple ways you don't</font>

177
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,620
even have to go and hack into like the

178
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,120
main servers or anything just take<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

179
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cooling system of the company and</font>

180
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,230
they let all the service blend down that

181
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:09,760
kind of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's like one easy way</font>

182
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,380
to like take control<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the company and</font>

183
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,120
make them<font color="#E5E5E5"> into loss or something like</font>

184
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,100
that thing now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm recommending you</font>

185
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,930
guys should do it add button like I'm

186
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,180
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like saying that's simple way to do</font>

187
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:21,479
it then like try to find real hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunt</font>

188
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:24,279
overseas and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into those computers</font>

189
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,350
and then like obviously there's other

190
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:28,120
possibility to like where like if the

191
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:32,380
sensors are supposedly giving you like

192
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,610
some feeds the values so say something

193
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,779
to determine like the temperature of

194
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,399
this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> room and with this</font>

195
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:37,660
server room if the temperature is

196
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,209
supposed to be maintained at 65 degrees

197
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:42,160
Fahrenheit unlike and sensor sends out

198
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:43,839
saying it's 65 degrees Fahrenheit even

199
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,360
though like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have taken</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> control</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

200
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,550
the sensor and that is sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> out false</font>

201
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,020
information to you where it's like the

202
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:52,300
real thing is like probably 85 or

203
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:54,189
something that kind of thing and the

204
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,170
other cool thing about these protocols

205
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,420
is that like not the cool thing I'm like

206
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,279
it's a sad thing actually so you don't

207
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:03,310
need authentication to like talk to the

208
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:04,600
servers I'm like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can just like go in</font>

209
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,219
like send and like this is the

210
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,230
instruction that I want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to execute</font>

211
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,029
as a server I like the solar just

212
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">executors and send it back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you so</font>

213
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:14,709
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how weak it is I'm like there's</font>

214
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,970
like no check as to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this is the IP</font>

215
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:18,189
address it's coming from this is the

216
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,020
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that not even those kind of basic</font>

217
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:22,149
tests so that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go in like</font>

218
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,920
sending like a data saying oh this is my

219
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:25,120
instruction why don't you do it and the

220
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,490
saw was just going to respond back to

221
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,440
you saying yeah this is the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

222
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,329
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> query and like this is the thing I</font>

223
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,680
hourly<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm going to go like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

224
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:34,510
asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to shut down so i'll go shut</font>

225
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:39,790
down that kind of thing so that's how

226
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:40,810
simple it is to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so yeah the attack</font>

227
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,180
scenarios will be like basically

228
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,849
providing false data like the way I

229
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:48,399
totally like<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the case like of a</font>

230
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:50,320
temperature sensor or like sensing like

231
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,770
the water pollutants so here's an

232
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">example like we're like you take out the</font>

233
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,740
water from the lake or some

234
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,110
and process it and then sending it out

235
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,400
to all the houses all over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> your part</font>

236
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the county or lick your state that</font>

237
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,620
kind of thing so what happens is like if

238
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:07,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">there is a pollutant in the water it's</font>

239
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">supposed to go out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has been</font>

240
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">determined by the sensors inside the</font>

241
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:14,440
water they can't say so if you can like

242
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:17,140
control over those sensors and say like

243
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,220
well the water is fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can just send</font>

244
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,860
it that kind of thing I'm like it's

245
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,000
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through and everybody who is</font>

246
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,590
going to drink the water is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

247
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,970
eventually die of false like that kind

248
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:29,250
of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's one simpler case and</font>

249
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:31,570
denial of service attack basically like

250
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,400
like I totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> like sending out like a</font>

251
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,680
reboot instruction to the service it's

252
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,720
like you need an authentication to do

253
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,689
that so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I keep on sending reboots</font>

254
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,460
command to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server continuously it's</font>

255
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,870
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep on rebooting every time</font>

256
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,610
and like it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be processing</font>

257
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,190
any data so you're like totally taking

258
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,360
down the entire network there and

259
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:50,680
obviously they're the extremity protocol

260
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,570
anomalies and like most of the software

261
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">is when I looked into them I'm like it</font>

262
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a pretty sad I'm like the first</font>

263
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,270
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you see is like feel like</font>

264
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">make the software like to just sell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

265
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,079
out as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as possible if they don't</font>

266
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,699
even care about like that the looks and

267
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,110
the feel of the software not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

268
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,400
examine like this just one<font color="#E5E5E5"> like have</font>

269
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,810
something which says okay this is the

270
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,040
instruction this is the output go for it

271
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,569
that kind of thing alchemia done<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

272
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,160
they don't even comply with any of the

273
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:14,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">rfcs or any of the standards basically</font>

274
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,670
how these<font color="#E5E5E5"> software's make how they're</font>

275
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,960
supposed to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interacting for this</font>

276
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:20,680
particular protocol that kind of thing

277
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:22,690
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really Emily every time I look</font>

278
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,500
into once out try like<font color="#E5E5E5"> ugh this is like</font>

279
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:27,700
too simple to do it they can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think and</font>

280
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,440
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous attacks there was one</font>

281
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,290
particular thing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> California's of the</font>

282
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,120
first one where apparently al-qaeda had

283
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:37,060
some connections over here and this was

284
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:40,570
portion i just googled up and i founded

285
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:42,250
in Washington Post in June 27 2002 where

286
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,200
they apparently had all the schematics

287
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:47,380
and everything of taking down<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

288
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:50,350
power utility over here and second one

289
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:52,870
is like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cut those this contractor</font>

290
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:56,470
was working for this Russian thing yes

291
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:58,090
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> an Australian thing yeah so yeah</font>

292
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,460
he was working over there he got laid

293
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:01,990
off and he knew how the scalar system

294
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:04,840
was over there like<font color="#E5E5E5"> how those things</font>

295
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:06,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">were managing the input and he just</font>

296
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,630
threatened the company that like if they

297
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,420
don't pay him something of the kind of

298
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,240
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like he was</font>

299
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:13,969
like basically introduced sewage water

300
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,910
into the drinking water and lake or make

301
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,589
everybody for second second thing and

302
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:21,620
because there was a slammer worm ever

303
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:24,920
lonely which they took<font color="#CCCCCC"> down one of the</font>

304
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:27,170
nuclear plants for like<font color="#E5E5E5"> fires and the</font>

305
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,120
other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> was like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the hacker in this</font>

306
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,760
one is in Russia where like he<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes</font>

307
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,649
control of the gas pipelines I know if

308
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:37,040
any we will just<font color="#E5E5E5"> look 24 over here</font>

309
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:38,510
anyway yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm like i watch all five</font>

310
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,250
seasons of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it like and lick the</font>

311
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">Christmas break so like I know which</font>

312
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:43,579
season it was but in one of them like

313
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:45,199
they do think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about like introducing the</font>

314
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:47,000
nerve gas into it without being fresh

315
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,459
that was basically taking control of the

316
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,649
scalar system indirectly that's it so

317
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:53,239
you basically could do that do they take

318
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:56,029
control over there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like take control</font>

319
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:59,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the sensors like not to like send out</font>

320
00:15:56,029 --> 00:16:00,800
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> values the readings to you and once</font>

321
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:02,239
you are done with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your thing and then</font>

322
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,920
like when the real thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

323
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,990
through like then release it back so

324
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,310
like the server<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to think mobile</font>

325
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,449
the sensor just went down<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> while or</font>

326
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:12,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like counting and it's going</font>

327
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:14,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">to like come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back but am I going really</font>

328
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:17,089
fast or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like I got a</font>

329
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,410
little bit carrier subject so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

330
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:20,149
the scale of protocols that you can see

331
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:24,079
out there like these are just a few of

332
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:25,940
them for the feel like Modbus dnp3<font color="#E5E5E5"> mod</font>

333
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,790
bacillus like<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably one of the most</font>

334
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,589
ancient one slick probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> little few of</font>

335
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:33,079
the first ones to be developed and it

336
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:36,050
still being used a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> all over the</font>

337
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:38,269
places and Modbus was like mainly

338
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:39,920
develop for like all the utilities again

339
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:42,320
all the utility companies basically use

340
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,660
that one dnp3<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like mainly for water</font>

341
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:50,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">and gas that's that's where like they</font>

342
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:53,269
use dnp3 a lot and so this and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> CCP is</font>

343
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:57,019
like used and like all the pretty go

344
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:58,970
although probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> like all the</font>

345
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:01,579
electricity place and everything and you

346
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,470
see a is again like you see a and you

347
00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:07,909
see a part of you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> 82 architecture</font>

348
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:10,939
which stick damn<font color="#E5E5E5"> I forgot the name ah I</font>

349
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:12,559
forgot an expansion for it so you see

350
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:14,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">again like it's an architecture</font>

351
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,010
basically for like the communication

352
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:17,569
models I'm like what it does is like

353
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:19,010
again for like<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the electricity and</font>

354
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:21,270
like all those people they usually

355
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">different standards like all the ice</font>

356
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:26,940
standard and like part of IEC standards

357
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:28,710
are used in even<font color="#CCCCCC"> iccp too so these are</font>

358
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:31,200
again like used for like the electricity

359
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,730
and like those generations places and of

360
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,850
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> like all there are also many</font>

361
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:37,500
other more protocols over there now

362
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:39,840
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get on to like the Modbus protocol</font>

363
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,700
so do the basic architecture<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the</font>

364
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,429
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> two bikes is always a transaction</font>

365
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:49,470
ID so each MTU is going to be like

366
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:51,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking to like lots of client IDs I'm</font>

367
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,930
like actually theoretically they can

368
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:56,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk to like to 55 of them but so and</font>

369
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:58,980
each one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have an transaction</font>

370
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:01,440
ID with it so that you can be talking to

371
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:04,050
like the ID one with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transaction ID</font>

372
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,870
2 or something and then like with the

373
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:09,300
client ID to with some hundred

374
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,770
transaction or that kind of thing so the

375
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,720
first two bites always determines the

376
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,550
transaction ID the next two<font color="#CCCCCC"> bytes is the</font>

377
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,160
protocol identifier which always has to

378
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:19,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">be zero is two nulls then the next two</font>

379
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">White's is the length light and the</font>

380
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,820
strange thing is like most of the

381
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:26,760
queries all have a length of six bytes

382
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">so if you want to like future in the</font>

383
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:36,060
future you want to go build up your own

384
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:38,040
stuff so yeah yeah why should just

385
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:40,139
support these two I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know yeah currently</font>

386
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,940
they do that's like I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like pretty</font>

387
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">shark like when I saw like oh wow this</font>

388
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,990
is like awesome and these guys are<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

389
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,820
crazy cool like I like I in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact like</font>

390
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:50,460
the first where they actually starting

391
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:54,050
to write my pleasure I know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys</font>

392
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:56,370
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard about Auto def a uto da fé</font>

393
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,080
that one is basically what it does is

394
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:00,929
like it takes out like the interpreters

395
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,909
from the Wireshark like those files and

396
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:04,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">then like it creates a test cases kind</font>

397
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:05,400
of things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a generic thing it</font>

398
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,740
doesn't like go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through like that</font>

399
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,940
details of it just like spills out like

400
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,770
what are all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

401
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">take in that kind of thing so that's how</font>

402
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,680
I look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into it first and then like I</font>

403
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,290
thought like I'll write it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out based on</font>

404
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,970
that particular order def way then like

405
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,080
I thought like you know what that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

406
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,120
going to give me like so much of

407
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,800
feasibility like so much of extensions

408
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,199
that I really want to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that won't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

409
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:28,560
possible in that kind of thing so I kind

410
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,850
of like ended up not to use that then

411
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,860
the next two bites of the length and

412
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:34,169
then that unit identify which is the

413
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,559
basically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client identifier so you</font>

414
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,779
basically

415
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,509
you can say like client ID with

416
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:42,600
so-and-so is requesting for so-and-so

417
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:43,799
information that kind of thing and the

418
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,480
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> byte is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most important one</font>

419
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:47,399
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the function bite we're like</font>

420
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,809
the it seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> perform</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

421
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:51,508
particular operation that kind of thing

422
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:53,070
and the last last one is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data</font>

423
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:54,919
or the sub function sum of the function

424
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:57,450
codes taken like some functions to like

425
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:59,399
like all the diagnostic ones they'll

426
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:01,889
take in like and sub function code<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

427
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:04,049
and the data basically is being like

428
00:20:01,889 --> 00:20:06,029
asking like supposing it's requesting

429
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:07,230
for particular register value so it's

430
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:09,960
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like mention the register</font>

431
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:13,710
number over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data portion just after</font>

432
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:17,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">the sub function thing so basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

433
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:21,090
particular picture is from<font color="#E5E5E5"> why sure yeah</font>

434
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:23,879
and if you see in there like the 0800

435
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:25,918
for that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the 08 is the</font>

436
00:20:23,879 --> 00:20:28,199
diagnostic bit which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is being set and</font>

437
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,240
then like the 04 is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the force listen</font>

438
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,119
mode so right now the instruction was

439
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">sent to force the client into listening</font>

440
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:38,100
mode so what happens is like when you

441
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:41,090
make someone go in two like<font color="#E5E5E5"> listening</font>

442
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,230
mode no matter what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the server says the</font>

443
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:45,119
flavors not going to respond back to you

444
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:49,590
so when such a case happens like you

445
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:51,029
basically forces the client to go into

446
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:53,279
listen mode and then you carry out<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

447
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:55,110
attack and then release this one to go

448
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,269
back and respond<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it and by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font>

449
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:58,590
all your attack is done and like the

450
00:20:57,269 --> 00:21:03,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">server just doesn't even know about it</font>

451
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:05,459
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing and here's some of</font>

452
00:21:03,149 --> 00:21:07,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">the function codes which I took some</font>

453
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:10,080
pain to like put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to everybody</font>

454
00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:13,139
kid here is it so all the function codes

455
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,259
and everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you see like like</font>

456
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:19,529
the first one<font color="#CCCCCC"> to six they all take the</font>

457
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:20,940
length x dash<font color="#CCCCCC"> six and they all have like</font>

458
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:22,049
sub function they don't have sub

459
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,149
function but then they have like the

460
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:28,470
four bytes of data<font color="#CCCCCC"> bytes the seventh one</font>

461
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:30,449
and hex value the lemon and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's one</font>

462
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:32,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">more which is like a single byte</font>

463
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,649
instruction so they don't take in like

464
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:36,149
any of the sub function codes and there

465
00:21:34,649 --> 00:21:37,889
are some of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the program for it</font>

466
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:40,498
<font color="#E5E5E5">for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> poll for it but those are all like</font>

467
00:21:37,889 --> 00:21:42,508
the proprietary ones so those you won't

468
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,740
find in like a normal implementation

469
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're kind of things like darling only</font>

470
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:48,020
appalling like certain implementations

471
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,760
and

472
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,650
yeah like the other things are again

473
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:55,550
basically explains what it is what each

474
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:57,770
function code does so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> again like</font>

475
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:59,360
the sub function I mean like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

476
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,190
diagnostic mode where what I was telling

477
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,350
you about like the previous the pcap

478
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,970
that I showed you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like all the</font>

479
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,139
oh it's and like we're all the sub

480
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:08,540
function codes for that particular

481
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,670
diagnostic mode this can like tell you

482
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:13,370
like all this report slave IDs or like

483
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:15,590
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want the sort but you declined</font>

484
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:18,169
to do client all the server to do and by

485
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:19,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way all the Modbus Modbus protocol</font>

486
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do either way transactions so like</font>

487
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:23,510
you can force the client to do something

488
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,280
as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the server can force the</font>

489
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:28,370
either either way you can enforce things

490
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,899
to happen because<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I told you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

491
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,330
it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the intermediate</font>

492
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,920
free level two is early which could be

493
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:36,770
acting as a server for some of the

494
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,750
protocols some of the artists might by

495
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:41,930
it self be acting us and our to you to

496
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:43,460
it another<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mt and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing so</font>

497
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:45,440
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the other sub function</font>

498
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,970
codes and these are all<font color="#E5E5E5"> two bytes</font>

499
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,340
basically the oldest of function because

500
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:52,760
it should be 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 the kind of

501
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:56,570
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on to the next protocol</font>

502
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:58,520
which is the dnp3 again like it always

503
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:00,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">starts up with like the first two bytes</font>

504
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:04,280
which is like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sync byte</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which has to</font>

505
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:07,010
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Oh 564 and then like the length</font>

506
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,420
right again the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like even</font>

507
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,160
though like<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the Modbus if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

508
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:12,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">have seen the length by just like two</font>

509
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:15,530
bites law it's technically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can take</font>

510
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:19,129
an only like 250 max character 255 minus

511
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:21,950
like the header length so but they do

512
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:25,580
have two<font color="#CCCCCC"> bytes over there the RFC states</font>

513
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:26,990
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to have like dancing so and in DN</font>

514
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:30,230
pity they made sure it just takes in

515
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:32,810
like one bite as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a length right so the</font>

516
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:35,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">david enforce a little bit much better</font>

517
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:37,460
architecture into the dnp3 protocol

518
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,350
we're like introducing CRC's and like

519
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,660
the CRC's are used in the Modbus the

520
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:43,399
later versions we're only in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

521
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,740
processing data<font color="#CCCCCC"> transcription only there</font>

522
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,140
the CRC's are yours and like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

523
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,790
querying processes it just nobody cares

524
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:53,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it apparently which is like the</font>

525
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:54,920
most critical ones again over here look

526
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:57,290
the first byte is the length white so

527
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:01,190
again over here the length can be like

528
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:03,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">maximum of 250 and all the</font>

529
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:06,680
minus the header stick anything and then

530
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:09,080
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the link control which basically</font>

531
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,370
says like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was like these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are all</font>

532
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,280
the instructions that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to follow</font>

533
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:14,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">that kind of thing and the next device</font>

534
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,629
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the destination and then the source</font>

535
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,850
address to two bytes each and the crc of

536
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:22,070
the entire header then comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data</font>

537
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:24,350
portion and the data portion is again

538
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,149
like split up into further things which

539
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:28,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll explain it from coming slight and</font>

540
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:31,490
this is the packet capture of the very

541
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:34,490
good dnp3 thing and if you see like the

542
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:36,200
command 15 which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like the command</font>

543
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:38,660
basically in this one comes as the third

544
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,890
bite in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data portion before that</font>

545
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,560
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like two more bites which i'll</font>

546
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:44,420
be explaining there so which says over

547
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,310
here is the disabled spontaneous

548
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,720
messages so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're if you're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

549
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:52,190
be like waiting for<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody that thinks</font>

550
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:54,890
it's going to like not respond<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you so</font>

551
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:58,280
yeah the control bite is basically the

552
00:24:54,890 --> 00:25:01,190
if you see the control bite over it'll

553
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,530
lose it<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the link control so that one</font>

554
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:05,360
is basically provides all the control

555
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:07,100
information of the function codes then

556
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,709
the next one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like the layer layer</font>

557
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,840
transport so transport layer bike over

558
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:13,550
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the first bit basically says</font>

559
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,260
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the start of the first packet</font>

560
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,610
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> n-type if you are having like</font>

561
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,230
obviously going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have like huge chunks</font>

562
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:20,000
of data so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to explain it into</font>

563
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:22,160
like smaller chunks and then extended

564
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,570
across and which<font color="#E5E5E5"> sinister kids of the</font>

565
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,490
first packet or like that if the second

566
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:27,169
better said then it's like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> final</font>

567
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,390
packet or both of them i said it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

568
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:31,520
one packet transaction and then followed

569
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:33,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">by the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next six bits like that sequence</font>

570
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,510
ID then the application layer control

571
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,730
which is again like does all the first

572
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:40,400
in the final confirmation and sequence

573
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:42,680
and all the skin and things then the

574
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,020
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing about the dnp3 is like</font>

575
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,540
it can chunk the data so all your data

576
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,580
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be like see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our seed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

577
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,379
and even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> your max data is going</font>

578
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to 50 bytes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it has to be like</font>

579
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,280
junk into like 16 bytes each and each 16

580
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:57,170
byte is going to be followed by two

581
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,000
bites of crc so this was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why</font>

582
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:01,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">i couldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use auto def and like the</font>

583
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,780
other the chucking purposes for like the

584
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,659
first in the final but setting in that

585
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,370
kind of thing so and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the crc</font>

586
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,690
of the dnp3 is like completely different

587
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:11,330
from like the regular series that we

588
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:14,750
have so they have their own stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if</font>

589
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:18,990
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can share that code too so</font>

590
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:20,789
so then<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we had like the CRC's being</font>

591
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:22,830
created every 16 bytes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so even though</font>

592
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:25,350
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the length bite will be like just</font>

593
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:28,590
one byte value and you'll say like if it

594
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:30,689
is like 2 15 or 2 55 that there it's the

595
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:33,689
actual packet is going to be like 292

596
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:35,549
probably 32 bytes of crc after every to

597
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:38,760
every 16 bytes of junk<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of</font>

598
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:40,440
thing these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again like the</font>

599
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,149
internal indication flags about like

600
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:47,159
those control bytes how it should be

601
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:48,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of thing and attending ICCP is the</font>

602
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:50,429
next protocol but like I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font>

603
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:52,649
go in much detail about this one and

604
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:56,639
because i thought i'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be running out of</font>

605
00:26:52,649 --> 00:26:59,100
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so again like in icc p we</font>

606
00:26:56,639 --> 00:27:01,500
established it's like a really layered

607
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,389
highly layered architecture in icc p and

608
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,059
you can just keep on adding up more and

609
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:07,979
more layers to this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's a</font>

610
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:10,500
really complicated one so first you

611
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,389
establish a connection the TP TP<font color="#E5E5E5"> katie</font>

612
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,649
establishes the connection then like the

613
00:27:12,389 --> 00:27:15,928
next one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like connection-oriented</font>

614
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:17,939
layer then you go on to like the next

615
00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:20,220
the session layers and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation</font>

616
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,659
layer and all this everything like they

617
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,730
have their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own like seven layer</font>

618
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:28,230
architecture over there after like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

619
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:29,549
regular architecture<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did see what kid</font>

620
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,980
over there probably at so the kid would

621
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:35,490
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested this buzzer is basically</font>

622
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:38,070
called Sully because the guy with<font color="#CCCCCC"> whom I</font>

623
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:39,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">worked bedroom and Cody so thirsteee you</font>

624
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:41,549
guys are the one who developed the

625
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,439
framework for this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they decided</font>

626
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:45,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">to name its alley because they thought</font>

627
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,519
this slowly from monster<font color="#CCCCCC"> Inc was like</font>

628
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:53,010
really fuzzy and like they wanted to be

629
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:55,440
like that so what a product the test

630
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:57,450
cases that I've made mainly made Earl

631
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,269
for like the protocol anomaly detection

632
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:02,460
then like all the unauthorized read and

633
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:04,260
write instructions and then determining

634
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,480
ups<font color="#E5E5E5"> like fear the possible then I of</font>

635
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:08,760
service<font color="#CCCCCC"> attack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and today i'll be just</font>

636
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:13,559
showing you like the two cases for the

637
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:15,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">Modbus entity and p3 protocols the main</font>

638
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:17,820
components of the puzzle are again like

639
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:19,980
the initialized one and then the blocks

640
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,200
which does the all the blocking of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

641
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,120
like putting it into<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the entire the</font>

642
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,850
Sally<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pfizer is like based on like</font>

643
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,439
blocks so that you create the test cases

644
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:29,969
of each block select

645
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,770
it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> together</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extend it across</font>

646
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:34,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">that kind of a thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's like much</font>

647
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">more better than like the regular files</font>

648
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,990
as well like you create the test cases

649
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:41,010
and then like send it out that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

650
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:42,480
thing so here it's like 1 probably a

651
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:45,150
hundred lines of codes like you'll have

652
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:51,360
like probably like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2,000 test cases for</font>

653
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:54,090
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular protocol i canít a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

654
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,159
sorry here I shall explain a pfizer is

655
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:58,230
basically what it does is like you are

656
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:03,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to find automated bugs and</font>

657
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:05,760
software so you have application so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

658
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,590
want to extend you normally like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used</font>

659
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">to sending like legitimate values to it</font>

660
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:11,220
all the time supposing like you're like

661
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,190
checking out the web or something you

662
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:17,430
say like w google com and what it does

663
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:20,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to put it and get / google</font>

664
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:22,320
com and / HTTP 11<font color="#E5E5E5"> or whatever that this</font>

665
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:24,930
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> set it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up that's</font>

666
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,560
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> legitimate request so what happens</font>

667
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:31,290
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put in like a case where like get /</font>

668
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:34,850
and probably like two<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand bytes of</font>

669
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:38,639
a random data over there and then like /

670
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:40,740
HTTP da one and if there's in a proper

671
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,090
test case over there for checking for

672
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,910
values which is like greater than

673
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:46,860
certain number of bytes and what happens

674
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:48,570
is that we end up like all flowing that

675
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:50,760
particular buffer and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> going into</font>

676
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:52,320
some other portions and<font color="#CCCCCC"> overwriting the</font>

677
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:56,790
code and like<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking control of the</font>

678
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:59,520
mission basically yes please so this

679
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:03,060
puzzle like create the values which is

680
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:05,280
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to be a legitimate value so</font>

681
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:07,260
you can create like really weird stuff

682
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">like there was just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one example of the</font>

683
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,470
guests

684
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:37,910
make sure it's valid enough to hire

685
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:39,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">later so sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not yeah so so here's the</font>

686
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:43,430
thing like if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are implemented like a</font>

687
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:44,600
Modbus protocol in your network so what

688
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:46,700
it's going to do is like it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

689
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,350
open up the port 502 because that's

690
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,180
where it is supposed to communicate and

691
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:52,520
you will be opening that particular port

692
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:54,410
up and like what my father is going to

693
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:56,240
do is like I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

694
00:30:54,410 --> 00:31:04,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">with like that fight or to port right</font>

695
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:07,580
now and try to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can do</font>

696
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:09,230
lunch to it commenced to you mean to

697
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:11,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">select sending a legitimate commands</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

698
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,950
that particular port

699
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:46,610
I will be getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that kind of an</font>

700
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:52,159
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically I'll the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last slide of my</font>

701
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:56,600
presentation will be probably well<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

702
00:31:52,159 --> 00:32:03,919
does it work well I just weren't right

703
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:05,779
against the desert yes we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

704
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">they will let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come out and present</font>

705
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:14,240
this stuff if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not covering it</font>

706
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:16,250
fresh in the person well yeah going on

707
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,500
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next one the bed RPC is like the</font>

708
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:20,390
one we're like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't our pc</font>

709
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,730
interface between like the fuzzing

710
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:24,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">furbearer lick the client target us and</font>

711
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:26,750
to the place from very generating all

712
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:28,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">the test cases and like for all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GU</font>

713
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:30,320
eyes and everything and the general

714
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,120
primitives are like what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

715
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,529
send like you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send in a static</font>

716
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,928
string or like you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send in like</font>

717
00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:38,390
some random data<font color="#CCCCCC"> as or like the bytes</font>

718
00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:39,919
that what were the things the looks way

719
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:42,590
too many of them to the list over there

720
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:44,480
and sessions is basically like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

721
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:46,309
it maintains the session of every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

722
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,990
attack that we set up and like gets a

723
00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:50,120
response but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can like Caesar which is</font>

724
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:52,429
like legit or none taken and the last

725
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:55,668
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next one is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like our own exception</font>

726
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:56,840
handler for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sally framework then the</font>

727
00:32:55,669 --> 00:32:58,850
agents are basically the network

728
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,709
monitoring agent which what it does is

729
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:02,330
like most of the cases like especially

730
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:05,059
people like us when we hadn't liked the

731
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:06,770
IPS sector we want packet capture we

732
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:09,110
want to see what is on the wire in order

733
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:11,899
to like make something sense out of it

734
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:13,490
so the cool thing about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's</font>

735
00:33:11,899 --> 00:33:15,080
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like transact every single</font>

736
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:17,720
packet and like put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up over there</font>

737
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,639
according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the test cases and save it</font>

738
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,470
up there and when something<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad happens</font>

739
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:23,240
when something crashes we just know

740
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,799
which put it up pick up to go check<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

741
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,380
out rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than going through like a</font>

742
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:31,639
huge dump of like probably thousand p

743
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:34,010
caption thank you so this will be

744
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:36,770
released out on june thirteenth I

745
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:39,710
suppose jun 13th or July thirteenth one

746
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:40,908
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these two days pedram is releasing</font>

747
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:43,129
his book on

748
00:33:40,909 --> 00:33:49,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">think so along with the book it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

749
00:33:43,129 --> 00:33:55,759
released and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pedram</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amini</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> param land</font>

750
00:33:49,249 --> 00:34:04,429
yeah the couple guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> said so pedram p ed</font>

751
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:17,059
I am I mean II am I n I so know that

752
00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:19,190
author I am Not sure you got that the

753
00:34:17,059 --> 00:34:25,730
framework was built by him so my test

754
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:36,649
cases will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> released with it so sure i</font>

755
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:38,510
can give me my<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry at dnp3 yeah and</font>

756
00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:40,038
probably like i'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

757
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:45,440
other protocols to in the meantime i

758
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:47,000
will be i'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> adding an icc p for sure</font>

759
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,629
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if i'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the</font>

760
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">uca I was try to do that one to like ask</font>

761
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:56,868
someone like you should probably

762
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:58,759
exchange check it out on<font color="#E5E5E5"> open rce org so</font>

763
00:34:56,869 --> 00:35:00,710
that's probably where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will find the</font>

764
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,020
search code for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pfizer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to most</font>

765
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:05,240
probably so that's yeah that's his

766
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:07,640
website to so like he'll certainly be

767
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,459
along and the other plan is to basically

768
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,660
to integrate it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jaime I don't know</font>

769
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,819
if you have used<font color="#E5E5E5"> by me for reverse</font>

770
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:19,359
engineering so<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be like integrating</font>

771
00:35:13,819 --> 00:35:22,069
this puzzle along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with pie made to yeah</font>

772
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:23,660
so yeah the network monitoring thing

773
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:26,569
will be basically taking out all the

774
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:27,799
peak at the process process monitor will

775
00:35:26,569 --> 00:35:29,480
be a basic checking out all the

776
00:35:27,799 --> 00:35:31,099
processes over there like if the process

777
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,380
got killed or like if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

778
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:35,089
something it costs an exception that

779
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,589
kind of thing and the beam control is

780
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:37,640
like the cool one that we really thought

781
00:35:36,589 --> 00:35:39,078
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it most of the time when you're</font>

782
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:42,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing like the test cases it's like</font>

783
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:43,640
gonna like do it in the vmware image and

784
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:44,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">then like do the crash and all these</font>

785
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,308
kind of things there's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

786
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:48,589
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened that we did with</font>

787
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:51,289
trend micro when you're like testing it

788
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:53,450
out and like it just blew it off bad and

789
00:35:51,289 --> 00:35:54,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">like it just crashed it so bad we</font>

790
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:57,960
couldn't

791
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:59,550
get the OS to reload again so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

792
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,200
wouldn't load up so we had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go back to</font>

793
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:03,060
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> previous lap shot in order to get it</font>

794
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,189
up and running and then go from the the

795
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,960
next test case almost not that one I can

796
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:09,090
think it was a major crush on that one

797
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,650
so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of that party the recent</font>

798
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:13,620
like he went on to like do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

799
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:15,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">moduli so badly can after every single</font>

800
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:17,490
test cases just take a snapshot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

801
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:20,670
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then goes and deletes it that</font>

802
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:22,290
kind of thing so if such a severe crash

803
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,880
happens we can just revert back to the

804
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:25,890
previous snapshot and then like load up

805
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:29,700
so all those<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are done by the vm</font>

806
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:32,430
control here's a small snippet of my

807
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,990
Modbus protocol this one test cases the

808
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:36,720
first one has to be always initialized

809
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:39,930
with a unique name the second one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

810
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,669
basically the 001 is like I'm just

811
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:43,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">keeping the transaction ideas static</font>

812
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:45,330
over here I'm not facing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that particular</font>

813
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,830
value because I thought like that itself

814
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:48,720
is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> running out to be like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

815
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,490
lot of test cases over there the next

816
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bytes has to be static with like I</font>

817
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:54,089
said it has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like to null bytes</font>

818
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,280
which determines its a Modbus protocol

819
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:58,260
then like the sizer bite which basically

820
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,940
takes the entire size of the data that

821
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:02,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">is going to be following after that and</font>

822
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:04,350
then like puts it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> over there so the</font>

823
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,640
size of block again like the cool thing

824
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:07,770
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is like you can do all the</font>

825
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,270
little Indian big Indian and like you

826
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:10,860
can do the fuzzing of that particular

827
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,720
thing itself and then like part of data

828
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:15,630
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a padding instruction to to</font>

829
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,310
like right up to the data to then the

830
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:19,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">next one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is like again like I kept it</font>

831
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:22,259
static which is like the unit identifier

832
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:24,180
which mostly it doesn't matter like

833
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:26,400
which unity all right and trying to hack

834
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:28,290
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of thing so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next one</font>

835
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,760
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the most important one where</font>

836
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:31,440
like we are like<font color="#CCCCCC"> fighting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for every</font>

837
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">single function bite over there like all</font>

838
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique cases and everything and the</font>

839
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:39,270
last one the<font color="#E5E5E5"> D word is basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

840
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:41,120
the four bytes of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the function sub</font>

841
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:43,710
function code and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data so that</font>

842
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:46,770
generates a huge and like if I were

843
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:50,970
alike by default it doesn't do like the

844
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:52,740
entire the four gigs of options because

845
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:54,270
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna like run into like years and</font>

846
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:59,410
years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> years to finish so it just</font>

847
00:37:54,270 --> 00:38:03,009
does all the boundary condition sorry

848
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:04,990
so I trigger them you'll see you see the

849
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:06,700
devil I said so yeah that's right like

850
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:10,029
we because like if you're like doing a

851
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:13,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">2-byte thing it's like 65535 test cases</font>

852
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:16,119
not like on an average say like we do

853
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,039
like 10 per second or something so it's

854
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:20,950
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take 13 years I suppose to</font>

855
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:24,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">finish up like the entire 65,000 kind of</font>

856
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:27,460
thing so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I will just do the</font>

857
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,869
boundary cases like really unless you

858
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:30,760
want that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the possible is</font>

859
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:32,500
set to false over here if you really

860
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do like the entire race then</font>

861
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:49,299
like you can set it<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to true and like</font>

862
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:50,829
do it this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also barrel so so the</font>

863
00:38:49,299 --> 00:38:52,210
other thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do instead of</font>

864
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:55,599
having the<font color="#CCCCCC"> D word over there for like</font>

865
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:57,250
the four bytes because I feel like I've

866
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,770
tried out this one as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the other</font>

867
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:01,660
case wherein like I said it as like two

868
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:03,490
words short words so like it's like two

869
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,720
bites like first before since it's all I

870
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:06,669
told you it's all going to be like

871
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,288
blocks English so it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be like</font>

872
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,900
the first two bites occur it's going to

873
00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:12,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">like get first first with like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

874
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">different possible sub function codes</font>

875
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,720
and then like the the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> two bites are</font>

876
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:18,308
going to be like set as a default 0s or

877
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,410
whatever default values and then like

878
00:39:18,309 --> 00:39:22,750
that one will be kept static and then I

879
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:24,549
think so I kept it as a deeper over here

880
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:27,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">cuz like it didn't matter to me much sir</font>

881
00:39:24,549 --> 00:39:29,559
and strangely but this is what i did i

882
00:39:27,609 --> 00:39:31,420
just went in after<font color="#E5E5E5"> i finished all this</font>

883
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:33,160
coding I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> went in google them for</font>

884
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,109
like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> scalar software that can</font>

885
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,180
see the first thing I click downloaded

886
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:39,848
the demo version than this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> Darwin</font>

887
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:45,368
crash I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> like yeah that's good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

888
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:48,190
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing here's the d mp3 protocol</font>

889
00:39:45,369 --> 00:39:49,990
again like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can I have the initial over</font>

890
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:52,059
here like this but in a test case I'm

891
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:54,399
like just doing it as a static 1 i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

892
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:56,289
doing like the the fuzzing of the data

893
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,000
if you won't do the passing of the data

894
00:39:56,289 --> 00:40:00,640
then just have to like include these two

895
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,920
ones in that small bubble over there so

896
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,170
again like the static ones are like the

897
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,990
first two bites of the sink<font color="#CCCCCC"> bytes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

898
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:09,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">is like which says that this is the dnp3</font>

899
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:13,000
protocol and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way dnp3 works on</font>

900
00:40:09,819 --> 00:40:15,279
20,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 20,000 so you will have</font>

901
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,340
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> up that FML report with all the</font>

902
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:21,250
firewalls<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everything so then like</font>

903
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:23,650
the bite folic control bites all those

904
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:27,750
things the if you see over here like the

905
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:30,670
after the S endoscope block start data

906
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:32,410
the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> byte over there which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

907
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:34,840
the transport layer chunk which

908
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:36,399
basically checks for like<font color="#E5E5E5"> set set up</font>

909
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,810
saying like this is the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> packet or</font>

910
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,800
the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet or the middle packet</font>

911
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,440
that kind of thing out the entire

912
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,630
transaction so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is implemented</font>

913
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,130
in here so that's you won't be able to

914
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:47,020
have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in like regular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Pfizer's or</font>

915
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:49,480
anything because the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people</font>

916
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:52,150
who have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> puzzle for dnp3 is like new</font>

917
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:54,310
security or someone and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem</font>

918
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:57,190
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be telling much a boiler times like</font>

919
00:40:54,310 --> 00:41:00,130
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they like charging like super crazy</font>

920
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:01,780
money for it too so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said like you know</font>

921
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:05,860
what I can just build one myself and

922
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:06,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">give it to you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for free and after that</font>

923
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:09,130
this one transport layer is the

924
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">application layer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chunks again like so</font>

925
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:12,730
since it's also a again like a layered

926
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:15,460
architecture you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to go through that</font>

927
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:18,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of thing and next testing out like</font>

928
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:20,170
the bites and all this and CRC checksum

929
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:22,540
for the dnp3 protocol has to be created

930
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:24,850
after every single 16 bytes and then

931
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:31,509
after the header value over there so

932
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:33,810
those things are being calculated<font color="#E5E5E5"> I miss</font>

933
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:33,810
something

934
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:40,450
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing somebody asked me</font>

935
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:42,250
right here I want the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fire world</font>

936
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:45,910
application firewall and everything so

937
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:47,740
here's a simple case like if a client is

938
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:49,960
sending out an instruction to the server

939
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:51,459
saying reboot the system right now that

940
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,170
kind of thing so that's basically a

941
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:55,150
reboot cold reboot command which is the

942
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:57,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">OD over there in the second line</font>

943
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:59,400
highlighted so which says it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the</font>

944
00:41:57,339 --> 00:42:01,720
reboot command for the dnp3 protocol and

945
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,280
it's just going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reboot just always</font>

946
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,899
going to reboot I you keep on sending

947
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,460
that one like so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> times it's just</font>

948
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,079
keep on I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reboot and reboot</font>

949
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:09,099
and reboot and you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

950
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,470
have any more data being processed

951
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:13,660
anywhere over there so sending it once

952
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:16,509
it's like kind of like acceptable like

953
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:17,859
you can like say yeah this is fine like

954
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:20,440
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was something wrong with</font>

955
00:42:17,859 --> 00:42:22,119
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server so let's reboot it but what</font>

956
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:25,180
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you're sitting in like a huge</font>

957
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:26,859
bunch of them like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Saturday I said</font>

958
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:28,180
that's what like I was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

959
00:42:26,859 --> 00:42:29,680
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> her like I just didn't know what</font>

960
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:32,078
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with this idea so I just thought</font>

961
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:34,868
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slight over there if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody is</font>

962
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:37,210
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there to build a new IPS</font>

963
00:42:34,869 --> 00:42:38,740
device or a new intrusion detection

964
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:42,730
thing you can just pull it up with this

965
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:44,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of an idea will be cool so now what</font>

966
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:47,079
I do is basically like say like you have

967
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:49,180
a reboot come and check out for that

968
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:50,970
particular set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bytes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then let's see</font>

969
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:53,799
if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is coming from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that particular</font>

970
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:55,959
these many counts within like this short

971
00:42:53,799 --> 00:42:57,700
span of time that kind of thing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

972
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,319
have like ten commands within like five

973
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:02,290
seconds or like something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of</font>

974
00:42:59,319 --> 00:43:04,359
thing and if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is coming from the same</font>

975
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:07,540
IP then it's like really fishy over

976
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:10,140
there for yourself like anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

977
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,140
show you the devil

978
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:56,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay the port fire 2 is not it opened I</font>

979
00:43:53,849 --> 00:43:59,380
just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure this is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp</font>

980
00:43:56,589 --> 00:44:01,869
version of sorry this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a tcp version</font>

981
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:04,030
of the Modbus protocol implemented by

982
00:44:01,869 --> 00:44:05,380
this burrito software company so I'm

983
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:07,150
just opening up that particular port

984
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:19,839
over here so the transaction can take

985
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:26,140
place this is the Modbus test case that

986
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:30,490
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> written so that's how fast it was</font>

987
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:32,799
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you basically have the the service</font>

988
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:39,819
of it like send out like the responses

989
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:42,819
to and the crash were in danger you can

990
00:44:39,819 --> 00:44:46,619
see the instructions right I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure it's</font>

991
00:44:42,819 --> 00:44:46,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">also clear it's fine that's good for me</font>

992
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:54,369
so like that basically shows you like

993
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:56,859
where exactly right<font color="#E5E5E5"> over there a switch</font>

994
00:44:54,369 --> 00:45:01,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">put in the command it got like screwed</font>

995
00:44:56,859 --> 00:45:02,950
over this<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can't answer it's in the</font>

996
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:06,310
vmware image where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application</font>

997
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:09,180
actually crashed so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sending out the</font>

998
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:09,180
attack from my machine

999
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:23,520
yeah other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than like that this one just</font>

1000
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:26,430
crashing over there like you won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1001
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:29,540
any more responses from the victim like

1002
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:29,540
I think so

1003
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:50,760
that's a bad answer no but like oh yeah

1004
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:52,050
I'm like this the entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1005
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be like open source so that you can</font>

1006
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:55,620
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go in and create your wolf icing</font>

1007
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:58,140
test cases over there and put it up over

1008
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,970
there for your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus so like the</font>

1009
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:01,529
framework has been built already like

1010
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:03,720
this is like just plugins that like

1011
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:05,640
mascara is what like I volunteer to do

1012
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,500
for bedroom and then like I'm like doing

1013
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:10,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the scalar steps for him and we put</font>

1014
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:12,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">it up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there and we have some for like</font>

1015
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:16,560
the RPC which has been developed already

1016
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:18,690
so our pc is done like HTTP has been

1017
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,670
done already and the basic stuffs like

1018
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:22,080
we like already putting it out and when

1019
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:24,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> puzzle is going to be released it's</font>

1020
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:26,730
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be all coming out but the other</font>

1021
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,379
than that like some proprietary

1022
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:29,490
protocols or anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

1023
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,110
do you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're welcome to do it</font>

1024
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:35,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and everything is going to be</font>

1025
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:35,060
open to yourself so yours

1026
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:46,960
finally some of my references that I've

1027
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:49,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">used in the paper all the stuff and</font>

1028
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,830
digital bond is one of the really cool

1029
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:52,750
websites where you can find a lot of

1030
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:54,250
information previously<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were giving</font>

1031
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:57,040
everything from free now they charge<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100</font>

1032
00:46:54,250 --> 00:47:00,220
bucks<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it it's a bummer but it's</font>

1033
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:04,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty good yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can push it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up to me</font>

1034
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:06,129
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I'll good or I can just give it as</font>

1035
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:11,050
a organizers or something and they can

1036
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:12,700
put it up somewhere yeah yeah special

1037
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:16,450
thanks to these two guys who have built

1038
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:24,089
up framework and any questions this

1039
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:24,089
point in time<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh gosh</font>

1040
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:36,350
for Jimmy look for these protocols or

1041
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:39,350
four so there's some protocols which do

1042
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:40,970
have authentication like the ICC p1 you

1043
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:43,069
have to make first establish a

1044
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:45,020
connection over there and lick over did

1045
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:50,000
the checks are all done but even<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1046
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:52,850
like this yeah so but here's the thing

1047
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,410
in those is one other I don't know if

1048
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:56,000
you guys know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> a guy called Matt</font>

1049
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:57,950
France he's pretty big in the scale I

1050
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,420
world I'm like he's done some stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1051
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:00,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're so like I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like talking to</font>

1052
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:02,150
him and like really<font color="#CCCCCC"> generally doing</font>

1053
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,820
stuff so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was in Austin</font>

1054
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:07,460
previously before he moved out like

1055
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:10,160
Chicago right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now so the thing was when</font>

1056
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:12,830
you say like<font color="#CCCCCC"> along the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TP Katie command</font>

1057
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,210
and like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> icc p that crashes that but</font>

1058
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:16,400
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> softer i'm like they're like</font>

1059
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:18,470
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> softwares they just built it up</font>

1060
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,790
like you know like asking is possible

1061
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:21,950
they can just leave the house that kind

1062
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:23,810
of a thing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so you'll find like</font>

1063
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:25,640
a lot of vulnerabilities out there so

1064
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:31,310
yeah if you find somewhere over this

1065
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:33,290
reporter tipping point<font color="#CCCCCC"> will pay you so</font>

1066
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:36,520
yeah that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it so any other</font>

1067
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:36,520
questions somebody else had a question

1068
00:48:41,590 --> 00:49:09,340
I to touch a fig probably you will have

1069
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:11,680
to set up your own thing only<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like</font>

1070
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:13,870
not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy but it's pretty expensive</font>

1071
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">too I'm like if you won like set up your</font>

1072
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:48,940
own<font color="#CCCCCC"> skill and network and everything to</font>

1073
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:51,070
ditch okay well the thing is this right

1074
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:52,720
away I'm talking over here was made my

1075
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:55,450
talk or heroes mainly about the protocol

1076
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,770
anomaly so if it's a protocol anomaly

1077
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:58,149
then like it's like that putting a

1078
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:00,700
software effort is being used by like

1079
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:01,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten other vendors then it's I me like 10</font>

1080
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,250
other people who are implemented scared

1081
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:06,189
then like they're all vulnerable to it

1082
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:07,930
and like most I'm like I was like pretty

1083
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:09,370
shocked I'm like first I<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't realize</font>

1084
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:11,470
this was the thing I generally talking

1085
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:14,170
to one of the my friends on the key

1086
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:15,580
works for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Talon manufacturing plant like</font>

1087
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:17,170
I was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to telling him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1088
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:18,910
I'm working on scalar that kind of thing

1089
00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:22,240
he said Oh skate out we have a scalar

1090
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:24,279
server nodes and thick<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wow ok but then</font>

1091
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:27,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">lock me in there by any chance I just</font>

1092
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,000
want to test<font color="#E5E5E5"> it down</font>

1093
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,990
had

1094
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:45,720
yeah they hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> it like tries in a year</font>

1095
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:49,879
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something through sands holds that</font>

1096
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:55,700
scare some it three times in a year yeah

1097
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:55,700
so does it thank you
