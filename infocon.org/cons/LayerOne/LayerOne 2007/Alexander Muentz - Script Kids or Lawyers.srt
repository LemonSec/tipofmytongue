2
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:33,820
also to a couple more speakers today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

3
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,059
highly recommend sticking around to see

00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:39,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">Zach Franken's talk on access control I</font>

5
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,629
got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see a demo of what he's about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys when he was in Seattle</font>

7
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:46,269
last weekend and it is freaking scary

8
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,459
very very scary what he's going to

9
00:00:46,269 --> 00:00:49,960
demonstrate with regards to access

10
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:56,140
control systems it's pretty frightening

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:59,559
and a cool-looking demo<font color="#E5E5E5"> too ok up now is</font>

12
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:01,870
Alexander months he is a lawyer don't

13
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:04,089
hold it against him and he'll be talking

14
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,280
about hackers script kiddies and lawyers

15
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:11,920
and with that I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> let them take</font>

16
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:14,020
it away so we can get rolling oh you

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:22,080
don't have to applaud for that I think

18
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:22,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're plotting for you can you hear me</font>

19
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:48,670
ok ok I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just a lawyer i'm also</font>

20
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,350
still a practicing sysadmin so at least

21
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,720
I've not completely gone to the dark

22
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:55,240
side unlike<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last talk I gave at</font>

23
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">least our old</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coworker mind gave me shit</font>

24
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,789
for about five minutes while introducing

25
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:02,590
me um standard disclaimer because

26
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:04,090
everything now needs a disclaimer now

27
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:10,929
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a member of the bar I am a</font>

28
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:13,470

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,850
no it's it's

31
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:45,160
I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> hoping I wouldn't have to do this</font>

32
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:55,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">but evidently everyone needs to</font>

33
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:59,760
configure X while they're here okay try

34
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,760
that again<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

35
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,990
hmm

36
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,799
ok

37
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:24,260
I apply buttons out hell it didn't seem

38
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:24,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">to it didn't seem to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tape</font>

39
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:14,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I take back that system in part i'm</font>

40
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:17,419
just a lawyer ok back to the disclaimers

41
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,330
I love disclaimers I am a lawyer I'm not

42
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:23,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">your lawyer so this is not advice this</font>

43
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:27,109
is for your amusement alone if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

44
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,489
get in trouble call a lawyer preferably

45
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:33,350
one in the state<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

46
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:37,340
arrested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the topic presented do not</font>

47
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:38,450
in any way implicate my employer and I

48
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:42,020
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even know what their personal</font>

49
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:44,090
views on this are this field of law is

50
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,280
in flux this is an important bit what is

51
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:49,580
true today or what I think is true today

52
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:53,869
may change next week 180 degrees which

53
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:55,729
should scare everyone and local laws may

54
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,760
vary so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give a basic</font>

55
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:00,860
overview of federal law<font color="#CCCCCC"> on individual</font>

56
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:06,530
state laws may main mirror them or may

57
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:09,320
be 180 degrees off that said I'm going

58
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give a quick overview I've described</font>

59
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:15,650
these in the preparation attack response

60
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,630
model I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give couple basic</font>

61
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,729
kinds of attacks and then what can I do

62
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:27,800
to protect my users myself and my

63
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:29,210
organization ok this is this spawns

64
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,590
actually from sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a drunken</font>

65
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:35,299
conversation / rant at pumpkin 2005

66
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,000
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was trying to defend what I do</font>

67
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,740
for a living as I'm not a script kiddie

68
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,060
you know I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not social engineering I</font>

69
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,130
have a subpoena it actually has power

70
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,960
and then I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to thinking what is the</font>

71
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,450
real difference because they have a lot

72
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,469
of the same effects um you know for

73
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:52,789
example I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you and you know</font>

74
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:56,090
think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this way you know I remember</font>

75
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:59,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">reading a line from a discussion given</font>

76
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,830
at hot BOTS about denial service attacks

77
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,080
or what every script kitty thinks is a

78
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,060
way to solve any social problem and we

79
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,979
clearly know that that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> true</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

80
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,590
litigation<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what solves every social</font>

81
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:12,770
problem because that's you know what

82
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:14,150
adults do as supposed to ever you know

83
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,889
God have been actually talking to one

84
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:20,179
another but that's another

85
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:21,979
entirely but an injunction can be a

86
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,099
shutdown you know I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you off</font>

87
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:27,139
the one I want you offline uh I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

88
00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:30,229
hurt you in<font color="#E5E5E5"> some way well I can do a</font>

89
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:32,419
massive denial denial of service attack

90
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:35,539
our I can just you know slap you with an

91
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:37,188
injunction and say you stop are the the

92
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:40,128
sheriff's will come<font color="#CCCCCC"> and stop you from</font>

93
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:41,900
doing that it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead I might</font>

94
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:44,569
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing attack to get information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

95
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:47,779
you it could be sort of a database

96
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:49,430
intrusion a traditional hack our<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font>

97
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:52,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">just serve you with a subpoena it's the</font>

98
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:54,860
same thing I want your information give

99
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:58,490
it to me and also similar precautions

100
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:01,189
come to mind good off-site backups I

101
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:03,020
mean as anyone who's ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> mendham you</font>

102
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:05,389
know amend a box that has you know users

103
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:08,180
that don't like you in random<font color="#E5E5E5"> deletions</font>

104
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:11,240
of data it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to have tapes</font>

105
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:13,460
off site preferably not in your living

106
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,110
room you know actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have like the</font>

107
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,430
nice people from arcus or Iron Mountain

108
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,199
come and put them in the little boxes

109
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,479
and take them to wherever they take them

110
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,740
probably their living rooms I've

111
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,210
actually never been<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an artist</font>

112
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:28,339
facility so for all I know it's like you

113
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:31,638
know oh no it's a Bob's house yeah u

114
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:33,649
haul<font color="#CCCCCC"> are and also you know the</font>

115
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:35,329
equivalent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a destructive</font>

116
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:37,549
search warrant you know a natural

117
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:41,000
disaster<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh there were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tornadoes we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lost</font>

118
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:43,669
the data center of where the backups and

119
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,850
I often<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about this because I talk</font>

120
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:48,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> companies as well about why you need</font>

121
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have a strong searching an archive</font>

122
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,119
solution which ironically is something

123
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,680
my company does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell so i don't know</font>

124
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,899
why i push it other than it makes life

125
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:01,189
so much easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok a couple different</font>

126
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:02,990
kinds of legal attacks are going to

127
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">start with the rarest and most</font>

128
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:07,370
destructive and the one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font>

129
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,860
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think most careful if you ever</font>

130
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:14,260
honest to god are on the target end of a

131
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:17,029
search warrant then subpoenas discovery

132
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:19,370
wiretaps and transitive trust attacks

133
00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:20,899
I'll go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's been kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

134
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:25,880
getting bigger and bigger in my mind

135
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:28,370
because well we'll see why first off

136
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,480
search warrants I like putting the

137
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,699
Fourth Amendment in print

138
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,920
much any presentation I can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font>

139
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:36,050
want people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remember it I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,880
they've got child poner unless they you

145

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that and maybe I'm you</font>

147
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,300
know some old-fashioned liberal or

148
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:54,860
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I think you</font>

149
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,899
know really the police should not be

150
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,370
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tear through your shit because</font>

151
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:59,930
they suspect you of a crime unless

152
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,420
they've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough you know they need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

153
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:04,729
have enough reason to do that and that's

154
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,510
what this amendments for and they

155
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,279
shouldn't be able to tear through

156
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:11,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">computer stuff as well unless they've</font>

157
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:13,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">got reasonable suspicion so looking</font>

158
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,779
through what you have to do if you're a

159
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:17,269
law enforcement officer to get a warrant

160
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:21,769
or what you can if they don't do this

161
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:25,579
you can get the warrant a kit warrant

162
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:27,980
requires a neutral judicial officer even

163
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:29,930
when some states allow the Attorney

164
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,899
General to issue subpoena to issue

165
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:34,189
search warrants unless they are if they

166
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:36,410
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it but they still have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

167
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:38,209
someone else convince them they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

168
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,610
act in their neutral role not as their

169
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:43,099
advocate role most the time it's a

170
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:44,300
magistrate are a magistrate judge who

171
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,860
sits there and just review search

172
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,019
warrants and arrest warrants and says

173
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,360
okay yes there's enough probable cause

174
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:53,690
it's not absolute proof but it's more

175
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">than just wild ass guess that a crime</font>

176
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:58,940
occurred and that the persons named and

177
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:01,819
are the evidence is within that place

178
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:04,069
that their name into search so they have

179
00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:06,439
to be fairly specific in that I can't

180
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:08,510
you know if I'm if I'm a DA and I want

181
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,180
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a search warrant I can't say I</font>

182
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:13,639
want evidence from everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> named John</font>

183
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,680
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> city</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of Los Angeles I have to say</font>

184
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,899
no I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one two three four</font>

185
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,630
anywhere street there exists evidence of

186
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:22,490
this crime I've to be very specific

187
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,920
about the crime as well are the types of

188
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,660
crimes so that way I can't just knock

189
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,800
down your door take everything and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

190
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure it out later it also requires and</font>

191
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,370
this is the important part a signed

192
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:37,160
written at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> David the written part is</font>

193
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:39,260
useful because it allows someone like me

194
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,810
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it when their defense attorney to</font>

195
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,819
gain figure out is was that warrant too

196
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:45,549
broad

197
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:47,529
there's a writing not of the judge but

198
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:51,029
of the one of the officer saying I've

199
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:53,619
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need to know this information and</font>

200
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:56,379
particularity that that limits the

201
00:11:53,619 --> 00:12:00,249
police's ability to go and and run

202
00:11:56,379 --> 00:12:01,839
roughshod over you now a warrant allows

203
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:03,489
and this is one of those obvious things

204
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,589
it allows the items named in the warrant

205
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:09,549
if they find we think you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have evidence</font>

206
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:12,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a manufactured child pornography well</font>

207
00:12:09,549 --> 00:12:13,569
we found 180 images of children doing

208
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:17,499
things that you really shouldn't be

209
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:19,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing okay I can seize that it can</font>

210
00:12:17,499 --> 00:12:22,959
seized contraband conceives evidence

211
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:25,869
fruits IE anything anything gained by

212
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,599
that usually that's used for example

213
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:30,249
such as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bank robbery well the money is</font>

214
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,069
a fruit of that crime they can see the

215
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:35,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">police can seize that as well and the</font>

216
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:39,069
instrumentalities the tools used to

217
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:42,459
create<font color="#E5E5E5"> the crime interesting about that</font>

218
00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:44,319
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also contraband can be seized even if</font>

219
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:45,518
it's not named in the warrant so if

220
00:12:44,319 --> 00:12:47,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at if they're tearing</font>

your house apart looking for say money

222
00:12:47,169 --> 00:12:52,239
laundering they find child porn they get

223
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take that as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well so the scope of the</font>

224
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:57,729
warrant can expand as it's being

225
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:59,079
executed now for computers those you

226
00:12:57,729 --> 00:13:03,119
know those of us who are sis admin's

227
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:05,709
there's this issue about what do you see

228
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:07,449
do you see is the whole computer do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

229
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:09,219
just show up in forensic<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lee image the</font>

230
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:11,559
drive and let the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have it</font>

231
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,479
back are you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> D rack the whole thing</font>

232
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:18,219
loaded in a truck and say I'll see in

233
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:19,839
two years which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I call the search</font>

234
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:23,589
warrant as an attack noisy and

235
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:28,089
destructive they it you have minimal

236
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:30,489
warning you know if at best<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I we'd</font>

237
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:33,100
like to go into your<font color="#CCCCCC"> knock we're</font>

238
00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:37,479
interested in that server rack and that

239
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:39,429
server rack and what makes it what<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes</font>

240
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:40,569
it difficult is that you can't do

241
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:45,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything about it you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just there</font>

242
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:47,019
watching and I've heard of this I've not

243
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:49,509
seen it because I've not actually been a

244
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:51,399
part of a search warrant I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seen</font>

245
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:54,220
a search warrant executed for for

246
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:55,529
computer-based evidence but I've talked

247
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,990
to a few police that do

248
00:13:55,529 --> 00:14:02,160
this they have mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they use</font>

249
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:03,720
techniques to unintentionally commit

250
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,519
collateral damage they get the biggest

251
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,040
ugliest guy with a pair of bolt cutters

252
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,550
who says yeah I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> here to remove the</font>

253
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,439
servers and of course you know if you're

254
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,300
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're thinking oh my god Mongo</font>

255
00:14:13,439 --> 00:14:16,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">is going to destroy everything is going</font>

256
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,719
to cut these just gonna start cutting

257
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,779
cables he's going to wreck everything oh

258
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,529
god I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him and what</font>

259

<font color="#E5E5E5">they're trying to do is they're trying</font>

00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get information if you it's like if</font>

261
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:26,819
you get stopped if you get pulled over

262
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,949
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start asking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

263
00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:30,809
they don't have the right to search but

264
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:32,790
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask and watch to see</font>

265
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:41,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe you'll give it up maybe you waive</font>

266
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:42,899
your rights<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay preparing for it</font>

267
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:44,970
obviously you're not you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

268
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:48,959
sort of defenses in place for when a

269
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:51,360
search warrant occurs<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a big fan of</font>

270
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,449
multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> site both data and systems back</font>

271
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,279
up if you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have hot swappable hot</font>

272
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:58,829
switchable systems in multiple

273
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:01,709
jurisdictions even if they come and tear

274
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:05,099
your systems out of location a you just

275
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:08,550
flick a switch go to be I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking of</font>

276
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,649
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it was alternate had a had an</font>

277
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,660
issue where they d rekt a bunch of

278
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:14,579
servers and they weren't able to cut

279
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:17,879
over as quickly so they lost they lost

280
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:19,109
they had some downtime automatic

281
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:21,319
failover you don't have to do anything

282
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:24,180
because while you know if you're the

283
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:25,769
manager of the knocker system in the NOC

284
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,599
during the search<font color="#E5E5E5"> warrant you're</font>

285
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:29,430
watching then you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not able to in fact</font>

286
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,920
they may not allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to touch any</font>

287
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,420
keyboards they may in fact move you into

288
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,490
a room and say you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> touching</font>

289
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,740
anything put down everything that has a

290
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,629
circuit in it because they don't want

291
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,220
you to potentially destroy evidence and

292
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:42,750
they don't you know even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font>

294
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,870
don't know what's in it on any of these

295
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,459
things they don't know and it's within

296
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:50,509
their rights just say you don't touch

297
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:50,508
anything you don't do anything

298
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,870
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give a quick aside to</font>

299
00:15:57,569 --> 00:16:02,579
warrantless searches I've not see I've

300
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:05,100
only seen one or two of these in the

301
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:07,079
case law there's a recent one called

302
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,420
hacking camp the US where they were able

303
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:12,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do a exigent circumstances or</font>

304
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:15,120
emergency search of of a defendant's

305
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:17,969
computer with no warning just we have

306
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,339
enough suspicion that he's got evidence

307
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:22,230
of committing a crime we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

308
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:23,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">to take the machine or actually we're</font>

309
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:28,769
going to image the machine give it back

<font color="#E5E5E5">to it others are search incident to</font>

311
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:33,660
lawful arrest if you're arrested for say

312
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:36,300
DUI you have a laptop<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your possession</font>

313
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:39,209
they can search it they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look through</font>

314
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,878
it kind of scary automobile searches

315
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:43,258
it's not as they can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

316
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:45,180
anything that's contained in the

commitment in the car if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's seized as</font>

318
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,559
either evidence or if you know going

319
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,269
back to the DUI example they can it's

320
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:52,980
what's known as an inventory search they

321
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:54,029
can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the contents to make</font>

322
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,620
sure that they didn't you know that

323
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:56,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing goes missing of course they can</font>

324
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,569
also look through to find out if you're

325
00:16:56,939 --> 00:17:02,639
doing anything regulatory searches

326
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:04,619
search if you're crossing<font color="#E5E5E5"> orders or</font>

327
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,429
you're going into<font color="#E5E5E5"> an area that is</font>

328
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:10,729
considered to be you have a diminished a

329
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:13,559
right of privacy they can search it so

330
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:15,599
airport is a potential issue here but

331
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:18,689
crossing borders there are several cases

332
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:22,589
of people who come in from Canada

333
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:26,309
they've got a laptop custom says we're

334
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:27,958
taking the drive and it's I'm sorry do

335
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:29,250
you need to prevail like nope we're

336
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,529
allowed to we're allowed to search you

337
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:33,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">were allowed to take whatever we like</font>

338
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:36,299
and we'll send you back the drive if it

339
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:37,919
proves to be innocent<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually these</font>

340
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:39,600
cases come up because there's something

341
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">not innocent on the drive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and they get</font>

342
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know they get convicted then they</font>

343
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,750
bring up that as a as a grounds for

344
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:49,350
appeal you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years later</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

345
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:50,490
they spend a little time in jail I'm not

346
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that joke</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore the</font>

347
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,669
first time they gave a talk about about

348
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:55,950
computer crime I was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah because</font>

349
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:58,350
federal prison sucks and Bernie s is in

350
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:01,880
the audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's like oops sorry</font>

351
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,879
man how's your draw

352
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:07,590
ironically his parole officer is one of

353
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:14,860
my wife scratches graduate students

354
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:18,250
small world their next wiretaps now this

355
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:21,580
is it's it's this area of law is really

356
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:24,070
in flux because we don't know what all

357
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:29,199
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> means yet because this kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of goes</font>

358
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:31,330
into the NSA spying scandal the 80 rip

359
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,950
at least 80 if not other providers who

360
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,480
have just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said oh yeah sure you can just</font>

361
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,669
you can set up like a little room in or

362
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,809
knock and sniff whatever you like I mean

363
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:41,200
you know it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's you know</font>

364
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:43,500
important or anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the big law</font>

365
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,250
that allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to do anything as colio</font>

366
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:50,019
communications assistance for law

367
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:52,899
enforcement act it's really neat in

368
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:55,000
order to prevent innocent communications

369
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:58,330
from being sniffed the police are able

370
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,880
to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want your information but not</font>

371
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:02,980
yours you both use the same router you

372
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,350
both maybe have have accounts in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

373
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,720
same system I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> limit all the</font>

374
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:10,840
capture all the captured packets to his

375
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,130
and it's wow that's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that's an</font>

376
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,870
issue with look Fourth Amendment stuff

377
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,250
because he's got a privacy right looks

378
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:17,350
like why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sniffing my packets</font>

379
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,899
when you want him so they put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the burden</font>

380
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:23,709
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP the ISP has to figure out</font>

381
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:27,489
some way<font color="#E5E5E5"> of carving the packets which I</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">see a I foresee a big a big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> boom in</font>

transmission it has to be done

386
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:40,418
simultaneously there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something about a</font>

00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:04,149
fashion recently the DOJ was claiming

that they didn't even<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to alert the</font>

we've decided to first you've got of

402
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,030
you know we didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know</font>

403
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,320
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know so you don't ever have a</font>

406
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:27,510
if it's an open door for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government</font>

407
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:29,650
it's an open door for other people and

408
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:31,720
that's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice thing to do just</font>

409
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:34,210
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give me all your packets thank</font>

410
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,860
you are a tell if you've got the code to

411
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,660
carve it out you could specify the

412
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,840
people you're attacking and just have a

413
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:43,150
coeliac compliant wiretap send you the

414
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:49,540
information so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a playground</font>

415
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:51,340
for attackers I'm calling<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wiretap</font>

416
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:53,500
attack profile stealthy and

417
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:57,970
incriminating because anyone who's

418
00:20:53,500 --> 00:21:03,640
involved doesn't know for your IP

419
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:05,710
defenses you've got a best one I can

420
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,590
think of is strong encryption that you

421
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:12,700
control if the ISP or the provider

422
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:15,580
controls the the concretion they can be

423
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:20,580
forced to divulge the encryption keys

424
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:23,050
under section 103 of Kalia so if you are

425
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:25,060
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone's sniffing your</font>

426
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,379
packets<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to control</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it you can't</font>

427
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:30,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">just turn it over to a vendor and say</font>

428
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:31,930
make sure our link is is secure so you

429
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,100
have to hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> the keys and you have to be</font>

430
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:38,230
the sole holder of the keys um they can

431
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,240
subpoena keys but then at that point

432
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,820
it's no longer stealthy it's açaí we'd

433
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:47,290
like your encryption keys for this this

434
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:49,750
link huh I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder why so at that point</font>

435
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:52,270
you can then say um guys I think we

436
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:54,220
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop using the internet or at</font>

437
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:56,470
least you know we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that Uncle</font>

438
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,960
Sam's listening in so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know stop you</font>

439
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:06,550
know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know buying coke or you</font>

440
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:14,710

441
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:17,980
um wow that's now that's a spam now a

442
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,660
legal defense to a wiretap is you attack

443
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,880
the warrant when revealed it has to be

444
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:24,430
revealed after the<font color="#E5E5E5"> indictment is handed</font>

445
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,960
down at that point a lawyer<font color="#E5E5E5"> can possibly</font>

446
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:31,420
pick through and see if there any flaws

447
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:33,580
in it and then go and fight it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have no</font>

448
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:39,700
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> why my slides are way out of order</font>

449
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:45,850
here I I blame<font color="#CCCCCC"> openoffice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm sorry</font>

450
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:47,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">because I'm doing this immediate I want</font>

451
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:54,040
to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to warrants I apologize about</font>

452
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:57,420
the out of order here one of the things

453
00:22:54,040 --> 00:23:00,040
okay thinking of Defense's IT the the

454
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:05,740
multiple site data and systems during

455
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:07,720
the attack it's the helpful versus

456
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,980
passive if you're the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

457
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,300
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> figure out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what they're looking</font>

458
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,800
for now you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the warrant and</font>

459
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,320
they can say we want all the information

460
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,419
that Bob Smith has well if you think

461
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,030
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do this if</font>

462
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:22,480
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that you're implicated with</font>

463
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:23,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">bob smith however it is you can the best</font>

464
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,290
thing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just shut up and</font>

465
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:28,720
let them dirac your servers if you know

466
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:31,030
that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it you</font>

467
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,060
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead turn around and say Bob</font>

468
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:35,530
Smith stuff is on that box so that way

469
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:38,470
you've limited the destruction from all

470
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:41,560
your boxing to one box you might even be

471
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:43,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to negotiate with them to say I'll</font>

472
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,870
give you that you know it's this path

473
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:51,399
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> help I have a backup you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can just</font>

474
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:54,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">take the tapes now two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things you cannot</font>

475
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,590
absolutely cannot cannot do do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

476
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:58,239
interfere do not lie to the police when

477
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:59,949
they're there because that's obstruction

478
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,760
of justice and now you're in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hot</font>

479
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:04,990
seat and a law enforcement officer while

480
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not going to accuse them of this war</font>

481
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:09,520
can use that leverage to expand the

482
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:12,490
scope of the search you lie they say

483
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,320
well I can get you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for obstruction I can</font>

484
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,850
now turn around and say I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look</font>

485
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">at some other boxes that are named in</font>

486
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:20,110
the search warrant do

487
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:23,050
you agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this and of course you're</font>

488
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:25,120
saying wow I I'm a skinny white boy

489
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:27,490
really don't want to go to jail because

490
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fact that I'm a really good linux</font>

491
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:34,690
hacker it doesn't seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work well in</font>

492
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:39,040
cell block<font color="#E5E5E5"> B and finally shut the fuck</font>

493
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:42,400
up there police are trained to get you

494
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:45,490
to talk through either being nice to you

495
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:48,760
being terrifying whatever I've seen in

496
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:51,150
fact cases I've worked on where if they

497
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,650
if the defendant had just been quiet

498
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:56,230
even when<font color="#E5E5E5"> their rest like we're going to</font>

499
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:57,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">rescue fine thank you a resume can I</font>

500
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:00,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">have my order i'm going to go give</font>

501
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:02,830
someone a call at that point it's often

502
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:06,790
better because what will happen is

503
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:08,620
you'll want to explain things and I've

504
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:09,909
read transcripts of those explaining

505
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:13,270
things where they're now admitting to

506
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:15,160
like multiple crimes ago yeah it's it's

507
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:18,160
it's really sex I read these like dude

508
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,600
if you shut<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and of course event you</font>

509
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,340
know of course this translates through

510
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,260
faster words like oh you know five days

511
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">later through the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> glasses like man why</font>

512
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,160
don't you get in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like because</font>

513
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:29,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">you walk went from us you went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from a</font>

514
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:32,770
misdemeanor to a multiple felony with

515
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:35,020
your own mouth I can't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you off you</font>

516
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:36,760
know if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple days I</font>

517
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:41,980
could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know just can't do and</font>

518
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:44,650
said shut up so be quiet<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially in</font>

519
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:46,270
the case where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are peripheral</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

520
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:47,800
search you're just the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> in you</font>

521
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,300
know you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing to do with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

522
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,409
you don't want to be too friendly

523
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,030
because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start asking</font>

524
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:53,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of look at other stuff all of a</font>

525
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:55,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">sudden you might implicate yourself</font>

526
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:58,600
because if you've got something that's

527
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:00,250
of questionable legality are might look

528
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,169
questionable because it might take

529
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,910
longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort out and even if you're</font>

530
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:05,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">eventually found not guilty it's you</font>

531
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:08,260
know good criminal defense is anywhere

532
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:10,540
from 5,000<font color="#CCCCCC"> to one hundred and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty</font>

533
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:14,340
thousand dollars and you know well I

534
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:16,629
would happily render such assistance I

535
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:18,250
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone wants to spend</font>

536
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:22,060
you know what I paid to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to law school</font>

537
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:25,450
to you know defend it cleaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

538
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:28,559
afterwards there's a legal approach

539
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:30,360
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attempt to quash the</font>

540
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,220
the search warrant exclude<font color="#CCCCCC"> the evidence</font>

541
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,199
because it was a bad search warrant and

542
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,570
then I PS be able to cut over to

543
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:54,409
alternate sites or restore from backup

544
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:58,470
on new boxes and go<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah mm-hmm oh</font>

545
00:26:54,409 --> 00:27:00,029
yeah okay well<font color="#CCCCCC"> um that's why you may</font>

546
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:01,740
want to you know based up in other

547
00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:04,230
countries as well if you're that big

548
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">where you're afraid that also those</font>

549
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:08,429
search warrants are generally specific

550
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:10,529
to an individual federal search warrants

551
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:13,049
generally specific to an individual US

552
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:16,049
Court District for example like the

553
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:19,619
Southern District of California so if

554
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:23,009
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had boxing in say San Diego and also</font>

555
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:25,110
had boxes in San Francisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> they need to</font>

556
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:27,269
have two warrants if they don't know

557
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:29,729
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> about your systems yet you might</font>

558
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:31,769
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to still do a cut over before</font>

559
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:34,110
they realize wait a minute they have an

560
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:36,720
extra set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of boxes they've got a Colo</font>

561
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:40,080
somewhere else and it just and it adds

562
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to their coordination problems not that</font>

563
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,350
I'm telling you how to run like an

564
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,059
illegal ring or anything but it helps to

565
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:48,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">have systems I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also just from a</font>

566
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:50,730
general disaster recovery chances are a

567
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:53,490
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> outage in one region won't be</font>

568
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:54,659
replicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> in another region so it helps</font>

569
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:56,730
just have you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh we've got</font>

570
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:58,860
Cola boxes in New York and California

571
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:00,330
we're relatively safe it's just an

572
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:06,990
additional this is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else that</font>

573
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:10,740
protects you against the next is

574
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:13,529
subpoenas this is a court backed order

575
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:16,289
for information it's not a court order

576
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:19,340
per se this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that grand</font>

577
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:22,980

587
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,429
there's this whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that I can't do</font>

593
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:58,850
adulterated substances in it by then but

594
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:01,850
it's not a court order quarters by a

595
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:04,010
judge so court order has more power you

596
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:06,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">can slap someone around with a court</font>

I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> court and get a</font>

anything from fines for every day too

for a little while you're going to be a

603
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:21,500
hangout in jail which is a really

604
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,260
effective<font color="#CCCCCC"> patty notes for people who are</font>

605

606
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,470
thing because you can't bail out you

607
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:32,150
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> then comply with whatever the</font>

608
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:34,880
judge asked but a subpoena you can turn

<font color="#E5E5E5">a subpoena into a court order if show up</font>

610
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,410
with a subpoena and the person

611
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,730
responding does not do anything they

612
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,620
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back to court and say I</font>

614
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:48,350
it then you can turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> the subpoena into a</font>

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:51,590
court order two basic kinds of subpoenas

616
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:53,870
subpoena duces take them bring us in for

617
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:56,179
maybe bring us information our stuff or

618
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:59,750
let us come somewhere and look at your

619
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:02,210
stuff that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be the mark common</font>

620
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:04,700
forms I've actually helped write a few

621
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:07,760
of these for the consulting practice

622
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:10,070
where it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi you know lawyer you don't</font>

623
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,480
understand how stuff the store you know

624
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:13,250
like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask your</font>

625
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:16,550
backup tapes and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like</font>

626
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:19,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">eight tracks and then you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ad</font>

627
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:21,889
testificandum which is the come to court

628
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:25,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">or come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some place and testify and</font>

629
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:28,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's if you lie or you know damage the</font>

630
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:35,000
truth in any way it's like it's like

631
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:37,310
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to court in lying its perjury okay</font>

632
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,200
what makes subpoenas kind of scary is

633
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:41,000
there's very little protection from it

634
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,110
you do have like generally between five

635
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,860
and ten days depending on the

636
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:47,449
jurisdiction to say either let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer</font>

637
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:49,530
our let me

638
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:51,630
but you have no right against

639
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:54,210
self-incrimination I can go and subpoena

640
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:57,330
somebody for stuff that damages them if

641
00:30:54,210 --> 00:31:00,630
there's some legal fight are the only

642
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:02,639
real protections are no privilege

643
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:08,970
material that's generally medical

644
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:10,290
records a attorney-client trade secrets

645
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:13,020
are also generally protected from

646
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:15,810
subpoenas you can if you're really an

647
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:19,200
asshole<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can actually get the judge</font>

648
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:21,179
to view your trade secrets usually for

649
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,920
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with serious IP cases</font>

650
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,540
those are things that people litigate

651
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:27,840
over for months because you don't want

652
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:30,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get your trade secrets out there are</font>

653
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:34,080
some limits on what you can subpoena

654
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:36,659
it's the you can claim oh it's unduly

655
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,550
burdensome something like we seek the

656
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:40,500
all the information that's on your

657
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:44,399
backup tapes going back to nineteen

658
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">eighty seven that's the the the I've</font>

659
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,390
actually dealt with that when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

660
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:50,190
sysadmin where it's you know it gives us

661
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:52,800
everything that's responsive to this and

662
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:56,390
then some guy shows up with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rena crate</font>

663
00:31:52,800 --> 00:32:03,180
full of<font color="#E5E5E5"> D lt's completely unlabeled oh</font>

664
00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:05,430
god damn<font color="#CCCCCC"> insecure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course at that</font>

665
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:07,380
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> my friend who you know made fun of</font>

666
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:08,760
me at the less at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last Lisa said hey</font>

667
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:11,280

here's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> first like hot man so I'm</font>

669
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,310
you know shunting them in for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font>

670
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:16,460
like three weeks going what's on this

671
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:19,620
thing I don't know it's 80 gigs of<font color="#E5E5E5"> crap</font>

672
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:21,360
that's not responsive and we because we

673
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't I had now have learned that you</font>

674
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,899
know could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just spend like a five minute</font>

675
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,400
phone call to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> judge saying it's not</font>

676
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:27,630
totally burdens a man like unless<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

677
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,600
want to come down<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and just rack</font>

678
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:31,890
tapes for the next couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weeks</font>

679
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:37,350
generally I don't think the judge would

680
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:40,590
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and oh yeah back to not for</font>

681
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:42,780
harassment improper purpose which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:45,000
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the parts of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the business</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I work for</font>

we get just on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> line because you can</font>

684
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">often even imagine the you're in a</font>

685
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:53,010
lawsuit with someone with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> company and</font>

686
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:55,139
its we want a hundred thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars</font>

00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:57,540
or going to make your IT your you know

688
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,880
our IT staff of 55 people work overtime

use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for harassment or the improper</font>

694
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:18,150
purpose but it's done all the time I'd

695
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,210
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as intrusive</font>

696
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:22,680
mysterious and dangerous because

697
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:25,530
especially for governmental subpoenas

698
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:27,390
you don't know if your peripheral ie we

699
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:28,920
think you hold some small little piece

700
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:32,130
of information we're actually going

701
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:36,090
after those guys are you could be the

702
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:41,610
target and yeah they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just looking for</font>

703
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:43,470
stuff the what's scary is you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

704
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:45,149
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to give the reason why</font>

705
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:46,260
with especially the administrative

706
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:48,570
subpoena they can just come and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say we</font>

707
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,490
want your<font color="#E5E5E5"> records on this you may want</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">business to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go away you may</font>

710
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:58,050
also just instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> say fine here you go</font>

711
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,970
you know please leave so you have to

712
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:01,290
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you don't know you just</font>

713
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:02,790
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of make some good guesses</font>

714
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,350
the lucky bit is that you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

715
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:07,590
reasonable time<font color="#E5E5E5"> response you can kind of</font>

put your heads together as a company IT

department and legal department go what

718
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:12,480
is it that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for because</font>

719
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:14,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're going to ask you what's on those</font>

720
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,350
tapes what's on those servers and you're

721
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:18,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to explain to them and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

722
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:24,449
huh is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the smoking gun er</font>

723
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:29,040
is that completely irrelevant defenses

724
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:30,600
you can mitigate them if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

725
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,610
capability of going across all the

726
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:35,339
information in your cyst on all your

727
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:38,700
systems and be able to pull stuff I'm

728
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:41,250
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've installed one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> altavista</font>

729
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:42,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">search engine that that kind of spidered</font>

730
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:45,030
against all of our internal

731
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:47,639
documentation and it would have made

732
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:49,620
this a trivial because oftentimes the

733
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:53,819
subpoenas maybe give<font color="#CCCCCC"> us every document</font>

734
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:56,639
that Bob Smith wrote our God that's an

735
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:58,350
interesting perl scripting<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think our</font>

736
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,390
it could be really if you can do it

737
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:02,190
really easily you're you're a golden boy

738
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:06,029
cuz you just go okay you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that on</font>

739
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:08,500
DVD or hard drive<font color="#E5E5E5"> here we go and wow you</font>

740
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:11,320
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> instead of instead of the oh my</font>

741
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:13,480
I have to physically go like grep on

742
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:15,640
each system including the ones that are

743
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,500
in the basement that if I bend like this

744
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,410
has been decommissioned why isn't been

745
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,640
you know yeah donated oh god I've got

746

752
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:38,830
stringy floppies like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like and</font>

753
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:40,210
I'm thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh yeah I remember</font>

754
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:42,279
what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are like this has got to be</font>

755
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:44,860
mistaken<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking do I have to go</font>

756
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:47,230
get like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a timex sinclair 1000 with the</font>

762
00:35:56,830 --> 00:36:00,850
settle because like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can find</font>

763
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:05,920
some of this stuff there's a guy in

765
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,330
method is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like to think of a</font>

766
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:13,180
stone long or compartmentalization where

767
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:14,890
and some IT departments are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

768
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:17,379

769
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:19,569
hell is going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who's got this</font>

781
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:50,850
centrist 650 like this is built like 94

782
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,900
and see you know I don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching</font>

my<font color="#CCCCCC"> phones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on who's gonna call who's good</font>

784
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:01,180
because i'm going to asking like yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

785
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:03,549
can't get an observer what server what's

786
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:09,279
on it cuz i just found out<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

787
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:12,070
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes it's like you know all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

788
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,350
special video else my special image

789
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:16,300
files are gone or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad I don't</font>

790
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:17,770
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is like I don't know anything</font>

791
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,780
else to do because it's not even labeled

792
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:21,380
like you know maybe get some group and

793
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:23,030
I'm looking at the files on it

794
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:25,310
you know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have no idea what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

795
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:27,890
stuff is it's actually key server so it

796
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:30,440
actually did result in you know dad yeah

797
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:33,290
3 million dollars of the scientific

798
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:35,930
software isn't working anymore<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh the</font>

799
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:38,990
licenses are on that box would have been

800
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:41,240
helpful to tell me that there was here

801
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:44,029
three million dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ID on them you</font>

802
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:48,859
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 year old system but that's how I</font>

803
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:51,530
thought out about it ah legal defenses

804
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:52,940
if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a subpoena against you ask</font>

805
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:55,340
me for stuff you can do what's called

806
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:58,280
our lawyer can do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> motion to quash you</font>

807
00:37:55,340 --> 00:38:01,760
can say it's overly burdensome it's too

808
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:03,320
broad it's got trade secrets and you can

809
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">limit it you can generally fight it out</font>

810
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:08,150
because you know it's the if it's done

811
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,790
to her ass we want everything on every

812
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:12,830
tape that you've ever done it's like

813
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:14,420
come on you know it's a sexual

814
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:17,600
harassment suit for it for someone who

815
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:22,480
was fired last week chances are files

816
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:22,480
from 1985 are irrelevant knock it out

817
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:49,580
yeah yes that's I'm going to get that in

818
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,259
the next section which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is called</font>

819
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:55,330
discovery there's something called a

820
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:58,220
litigation hold where once<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know and</font>

821
00:38:55,330 --> 00:39:00,470
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a term of art which I always</font>

822
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:02,390
I've learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use that as term of art</font>

823
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:06,020
means this does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean what you think</font>

824
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:08,210
it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime you know you're about</font>

825
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:10,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be sued are you have a you</font>

826
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:13,430
constructive<font color="#CCCCCC"> lino which means you should</font>

827
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:15,230
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you weren't an idiot you cannot</font>

828
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:19,180
delete evidence you have to hold all

829
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:22,510
evidence that might be used against you

830
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:22,509
then you're safe

831
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:32,120
I know it depends I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give that</font>

832
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:36,170
like sarbanes-oxley I've worked mostly

833
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:38,029
in the FDA regulated fields where you

834
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:40,040
know I you know we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep</font>

835
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:41,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">information about drug reactions for</font>

836
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:46,220
like you know pumpkin clutch billion

837
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:48,440
years and the regulations were vague so

838
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:50,390
but if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to hold it there's</font>

839
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,400
a big school of thought that says the

840
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:54,020
leading don't hold it no immediately

841
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,650
like stuff like logs are generally not

842
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:59,150
going to be then yeah unless you unless

843
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:01,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your theory</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

844
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:03,920
like you know Bob adulterated this file

845
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:06,740
and it turned out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be you know</font>

846
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,050
adulterated the design for the bumper on

847
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:10,910
the Pinto and therefore because Bob did

848
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:14,990
this you're now liable for this you

849
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:18,980
would have had to hold the data Sox

850
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:21,350
comes into mind HIPAA not so much

851
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:25,220
because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> hip is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more about not</font>

852
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:26,540
leaking it yes secure it's keeping it

853
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:32,149
keeping what's supposed to be secret

854
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:35,390
secret<font color="#CCCCCC"> socks FDA regs and the new</font>

855
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:36,620
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure sort of

856
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:52,609
require once you know there's a

857
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:53,569
controversy then you hold it which is I

858
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:55,760
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> especially if you're doing</font>

859
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:57,500
something well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this should be one</font>

860
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">of those obvious things if you know</font>

nothing proving stuff yeah it's it's

from disclosure there's no case law on

917
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,869

00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:20,279
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

919

much more likely that you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you're no sir your organization</font>

hopefully not you personally will get

922
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:30,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved in a civil lawsuit it works</font>

923
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:32,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a subpoena against the parties too</font>

924
00:44:30,089 --> 00:44:34,558
soon except there's this automatic

925
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:37,199
disclosure rule which is once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

926
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:39,299
soon you have to give over a bunch of

927
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:41,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's anything the initial rule</font>

928
00:44:39,299 --> 00:44:44,449
within I think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten days maybe 20</font>

929
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:46,979
depending on the jurisdiction the

930
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:50,910
locations and types of electronically

931
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:53,339
stored information that is so vague it

932
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:55,649
terrifies me I'm writing a paper now on

933
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:57,869
whether or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> voice mail is</font>

934
00:44:55,650 --> 00:45:01,799
electronically stored information under

935
00:44:57,869 --> 00:45:03,449
the federal rules which has law firms to

936
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:05,759
terrify because they run off of they

937
00:45:03,449 --> 00:45:07,319
they often because it's considered to be

938
00:45:05,759 --> 00:45:09,180
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a cardinal sin like</font>

939
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:13,019
bringing you know a plate of bacon to

940
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:14,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">mecca that you should ever miss a phone</font>

941
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:16,459
call so there

942
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:18,200
that have thee if you call<font color="#E5E5E5"> my house if</font>

943
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:20,660
you call like my office<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone it</font>

944
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:23,210
forwards and leave a voicemail for words

945
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:24,920
the file to my blackberry<font color="#E5E5E5"> well now it's</font>

946
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:28,940
electronically stored now it's

947
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:30,920
discoverable oh my god this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like now</font>

948
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:32,990
you're gonna have you know my my friends

949
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,520
and from law school we're now going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

950
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:36,620
like sitting to listening tapes going

951
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:44,930
hey Bob you know want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go out all</font>

952
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:46,400
thing not responsive<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and you wonder</font>

953
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:47,930
why lawyers are cranky because that's

954
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,870
what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> esri to get to do for 12 hours</font>

955
00:45:47,930 --> 00:45:52,640
a day at least until<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

956
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:53,990
you're like you're like 35 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then that</font>

957
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:58,569
point like like it get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

958
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:58,569
basement now you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a courtroom</font>

959
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:03,649
the what what I'm finding interesting is

960
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:08,410
that must disclose locations and types

961
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:11,960
so that's what servers what boxes what

962
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:15,080
tapes voicemails whatever that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

963
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:17,540
so it requires you within 10 days to

964
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:19,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">comp of a list you don't have to give it</font>

965
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:22,880
all the data over but you always have to

966
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:26,000
have a list now think of a company more

967
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,410
than 150 employees think of that IT

968
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,970
staff you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know think of think of a</font>

969
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:31,520
company like a thousand employees the IT

970
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:33,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">staff is frequently like I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the yellin</font>

971
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:36,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">need unix guy I'm the lead windows guy</font>

972
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:39,410
and there is stuff that they don't know

973
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:42,109
about yet the company can get sanctioned

974
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:44,509
for what we found this box of stuff like

975
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:45,980
okay that was in a crate oh it was here

976
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:49,220
before I started I don't know anything

977
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:51,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it you'll have to disclose that</font>

978
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:53,720
which is why there's a big incentive to

979
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:58,730
just get<font color="#CCCCCC"> rid of stuff if you don't need</font>

980
00:46:53,720 --> 00:47:01,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">it toss it however destruction of</font>

981
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:04,390
evidence once the suit is likely has

982
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:06,859
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nasty consequences</font>

983
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:08,690
sanctions the council which we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

984
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,550
like because it comes out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our pay we</font>

985
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:12,440
cannot charge a client for a sanction

986
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:14,200
that happens to us it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> considered you</font>

987
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:17,290
against public policy

988
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:19,089
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll look namak so so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

989
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:20,859
basically means that so i can say with a

990
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:23,920
straight face<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sorry i can't do that</font>

991
00:47:20,859 --> 00:47:27,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't risk my license for</font>

992
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:30,250
you adverse inference instructions these

993
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:33,220
are fun because these get to say you

994
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:35,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">deleted data you deleted evidence we get</font>

995
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:38,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">to argue in court that the absence of</font>

996
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:40,359
evidence is evidence of malice you get

997
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:42,970
to prove something you couldn't prove

998
00:47:40,359 --> 00:47:44,799
with the actual data so instead you go

999
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:49,390
well because you deleted it it was the

1000
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:51,130
smoking gun that's there's a opinion

1001
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:52,960

the hell you are I've deleted all the

1027
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:13,450
emails<font color="#E5E5E5"> that show any contract formation</font>

between us I don't know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

1029
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:18,069
yet you might be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prove it so I</font>

1030
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:20,380
say they've been deleted you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

1031
00:49:18,069 --> 00:49:22,270
beat the shit out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> me because not only</font>

1032
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:24,730
can you prove it happened you get the

1033
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:25,990
additional sting of sanctions against me

1034
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:28,900
for intentionally to

1035
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:31,779
leading it proving it and stuff like

1036
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:32,830
that in front of a jury oh my god you

1037
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:35,020
know all of a sudden you've got punitive

1038
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:38,290
you go from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you know you get to</font>

1039
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:41,350
multiply the the payoff by like eight so

1040
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:44,110
in that case<font color="#E5E5E5"> you realize your youth</font>

1041
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:47,770
you've doubled-down you've said<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

1042
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:50,710
to play for bigger stakes so the the

1043
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:53,619
knee-jerk reaction is no instead let the

1044
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:55,450
stuff because that's like I liken that

1045
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:58,480
to you know one of my favorite public

1046
00:49:55,450 --> 00:50:01,180
defender clients whose whose first line

1047

to the cops<font color="#E5E5E5"> when caught with i think was</font>

half a pound of weed said man you guys

1049
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:12,040

1050
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:14,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">but that is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even much hi this man</font>

1051

your<font color="#E5E5E5"> left like you admitted that not</font>

1052
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,560
only are you normally carrying two

1053
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:20,529
pounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weed that you're carrying weed</font>

1054
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:24,340
the guy was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cops mostly like</font>

1055
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:25,869
hey Bob how's it going like oh and of

1056
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:28,690
course then the guys like<font color="#E5E5E5"> man you're a</font>

1057
00:50:25,869 --> 00:50:35,640
public pretender you saw like dude you

1058
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:35,640
did it yourself but another ramp yeah

1059
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:53,230
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> depends the under under the grounds</font>

1060
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:57,009
of the subpoena if you are subpoenaed it

1061
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:59,800
by a grand jury and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they get self</font>

1062
00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:02,410
incriminating stuff it depends it may be

1063
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,910
excludable because the grounds ground

1064
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:06,000
for a subpoena and discovery are it

1065
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:08,710
doesn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be relevant it has to be</font>

1066
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,770
reasonably likely to get relevant

1067
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:13,330
information so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like with you know</font>

1068
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:14,860
if you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just make some connection</font>

1069
00:51:13,330 --> 00:51:17,740
between what we're seeking and what

1070
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:19,750
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to prove you're good for</font>

1071
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:21,790
generally which is why police do not

1072
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:23,410
like to use subpoenas because it's

1073
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:25,450
possible that you'll get evidence and

1074
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:27,339
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a sting when you think I can't</font>

1075
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:30,069
prove it because I screwed up early I

1076
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:32,080
can't prove it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> he you know you is</font>

1077
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:36,090
that as the guilty person are going to

1078
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:38,440
go free because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a technicality so and</font>

1079
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:40,690
courts are very very willing to smack

1080
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:49,480
people down for using a subpoena versus

1081
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:51,340
a warrant okay discovery defenses going

1082
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:53,830
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bility to quickly efficiently</font>

1083
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:56,410
and get completely completely is the big

1084
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:58,870
part to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to safely say i got</font>

1085
00:51:56,410 --> 00:52:04,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything there all the smoking guns</font>

1086
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:06,670
that we have you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> you and I do some</font>

1087
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:10,060
you know in the consulting side of the

1088
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:12,460
of the shop I go to IT shops and go can

1089
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:13,450
I see your basement<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're like why</font>

1090
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,890
do you want to see it because I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1091
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:16,390
see what box that you have just lying

1092
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:18,670
around for parts because that's

1093
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:23,350
discoverable and then oh that's nothing

1094
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:24,430
well it is it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun to do that</font>

1095
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:26,049
one like I've got a member of their

1096
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:27,040
legal team and a member<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their IT team</font>

1097
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:28,570
and they're like well<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not</font>

1098
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:33,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">qualified to say it like actually I am</font>

1099
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:35,110
no I'm a freak<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the ability to</font>

1100
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:38,380
locate response information quickly and

1101
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:40,690
cheaply will drive down costs it will

1102
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:42,580
also make<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the golden boy to the I to</font>

1103
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:45,610
the legal department if you can pull

1104
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:48,009
this stuff off because you now in their

1105
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:50,800
minds you've gone from being those

1106
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:52,690
assholes and most legal departments and

1107
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:57,280
IT departments do not get along

1108
00:52:52,690 --> 00:53:00,000
I have a horror story I've many artists

1109

1115
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:19,629
will cost X amount of dollars why<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount</font>

1116
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:21,970
of weeks they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> then go back and say</font>

1117
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:24,160
wow go to the judge and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we</font>

1118
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:26,560
don't discuss we wanted to get any done

1119
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,609
if you can explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to it of course</font>

1120
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:30,810
that requires there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual</font>

1121
00:53:27,609 --> 00:53:30,810
relationship between the two departments

1122

document retention and destruction

1123
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:39,460
policies this also goes to how you get

1124
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:44,829
rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of computers how you get rid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of old</font>

1125
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:47,200

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> box in two years dump it enforced</font>

1128
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:55,839
and rational if you can automatically

1129
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:57,819
enforce your document the structural

1130
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:00,009
policy do so because instead you're

1131
00:53:57,819 --> 00:54:02,890
going to get the one idiot who's going

1132
