1
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:06,979
last talk of the day before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> free</font>

2
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:09,200
booze<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dancing girls zach is going to</font>

3
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:10,909
talk about access control systems any

4
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,799
going to show you something very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

5
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:19,340
interesting about how they work and how

6
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:21,229
are all broken should<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like think</font>

7
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:25,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">of it like land man for access control</font>

8
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:27,408
yeah trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> me it's it's broken</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

9
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,460
what I'm going to do is I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

10
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:32,899
give you a quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> overview of access</font>

11
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,520
control systems in general just so

12
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:35,720
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a bit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a backgrounder and</font>

13
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,960
then I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take you through some</font>

14
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:42,470
credential technologies like<font color="#E5E5E5"> protz cards</font>

15
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:46,580
swipe cards some biometrics and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

16
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:48,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">are kind of basic workings so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

17
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:51,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go too deeply into how</font>

18
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:53,450
fingerprint recognition algorithm

19
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:56,000
actually works but just an overview and

20
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:59,289
then we're going to actually start to

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,619
look it's a worked example of biometrics

22
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:06,020
how actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes about doing it and</font>

23
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:15,709
we'll take you through their rare common

24
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:17,180
floor<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so and by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way I do tend</font>

25
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:20,120
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get ahead of it my mouth runs ahead</font>

26
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:23,629
of my slides so you will probably see

27
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,340
this happening quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

28
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:30,200
here's a basic access control system

29
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:33,530
like you'd expect to see this reader

30
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,299
could be a swipe it could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> prox it</font>

31
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:39,260
could be a biometric reader like

32
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:41,750
fingerprint I<font color="#E5E5E5"> traditionally in a basic</font>

33
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,870
system like this you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a single</font>

34
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">access controller electric lock and</font>

35
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:49,730
normally a push to exit button

36
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:52,129
occasionally you have other exit devices

37
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:54,379
such as passives mounted above the door

38
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:57,679
passive infrared sensor so that when you

39
00:02:54,379 --> 00:03:00,798
walk up to the door it unlocks and that

40
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,350
could be a whole world of<font color="#E5E5E5"> peeing in</font>

41
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:06,390
itself because they're waving a bit of

42
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,260
underneath<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will quite often just</font>

43
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:14,100
pop the door slightly more sophisticated

44
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:16,350
systems actually have a local<font color="#E5E5E5"> door</font>

45
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:18,120
controller which talks to the access

46
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:21,239
control system quite often the access

47
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:26,580
control system simply pushes the

48
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:28,470
credentials ie the user IDs the card

49
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,280
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the door controller which</font>

50
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:34,590
remembers it in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> situation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got</font>

51
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,910
what's mazzanti pass back so both<font color="#CCCCCC"> sides</font>

52
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:41,100
of the doors have readers so you acenta

53
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:43,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kate to get in and your scent Kate to</font>

54
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,150
get out basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can't slide</font>

55
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:48,420
your card back under the<font color="#E5E5E5"> door and let</font>

56
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:51,240
someone else in can be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem because</font>

57
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,070
occasionally it gets screwed up and you

58
00:03:51,240 --> 00:04:03,090
get users that either can't get out or

59
00:03:53,070 --> 00:04:06,690
can't get back in so not ideal ok so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far</font>

60
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:09,870
as physical tokens got we've got your

61
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:12,000
mag stripe card pretty common the white

62
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,130
gang card a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data these</font>

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,690
days but<font color="#E5E5E5"> still used and going to places</font>

64
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:21,899
like airports London Heath rooms ly gun

65
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:25,620
cart authenticated proc scarves which

66
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:27,150
we're all familiar with at bottom

67
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,120
ferrite card now this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the original</font>

68
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:34,770
card key they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really used that</font>

69
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:37,890
much these days i concealed barcode card

70
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:41,549
which we'll get to in a minute smart

71
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:45,900
cards and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> start with our concealed</font>

72
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:48,260
barcode card it is as crappy as it

73
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,260
sounds

74
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:55,289
basically yeah you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> barcode and</font>

75
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:57,330
then you have a ir translucent material

76
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:59,639
that just looks like a black stripe

77
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,620
along the bottom of the card<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold it up</font>

78
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,169
to any bright light and you will see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

79
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:08,069
barcode put a bright light above the

80
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:11,068
barcode on a scanner<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you'll just be</font>

81
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:19,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to image the barcode right off it</font>

82
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:22,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">is fucking embarrassing so basically if</font>

83
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:25,229
you find anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's ever implemented</font>

84
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:27,539
one of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I suggest that do</font>

85
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:32,699
you fire them and then shoot them so

86
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:36,150
they don't infect anyone else so Mike

87
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:41,789
stripes again we're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty familiar</font>

88
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:43,888
with normally three tracks I two types

89
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:47,248
of cards so you've got high coercivity

90
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:50,550
cards and low coercivity cards so

91
00:05:47,249 --> 00:05:54,300
basically how much magnetic energy it

92
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:57,139
takes to actually align the particles on

93
00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:01,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">the card so credit cards typically our</font>

94
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:03,089
local things like your cal state

95
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,969
driver's license is a high coercivity

96
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:10,439
card so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't just pop it through a</font>

97
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:13,889
regular reader writer and write<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

98
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:19,259
need a special high coercivity I card

99
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:22,589
writer I expose head in the reader which

100
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:25,919
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's yeah possible quite easily</font>

101
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:29,399
actually and there are certain high

102
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,770
security cards the hotel lot in this

103
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:35,939
hotel are considered by the manufacturer

104
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:37,438
to be high security now you'd be

105
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:40,169
surprised so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means that</font>

106
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:43,020
in general a regular card reader writer

107
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:48,359
won't be able to duplicate them but that

108
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:50,758
can simply be as easy as just adjusting

109
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,469
the track offset so the tracks don't

110
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:55,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">line up where they would normally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do on</font>

111
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:57,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">an iso standard card and they also use</font>

112
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:02,400
slightly different modulation techniques

113
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:04,169
so it by no means high

114
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">high</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security it's certainly</font>

115
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:13,169
duplicatable but just not by your

116
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:14,789
standard card reader writer the max max

117
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:18,780
rights basically use a protocol called

118
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:21,240
clock and data which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is pretty simple</font>

119
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,520
you've got your your clock pulses along

120
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,570
the top your data pulses along the

121
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:31,080
bottom the presence of a a one or a zero

122
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:34,979
with a clock pulse indicates your data

123
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:38,630
stream this is actually a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my Visa</font>

124
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:42,539
card actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're only a small bit</font>

125
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:44,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">here's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dad no significant digits there</font>

126
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:46,440
but but you can clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> see there's your</font>

127
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:51,090
your clock along the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> and your</font>

128
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:53,940
database along the bottom but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> faerie</font>

129
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:58,560
carbs not really used that<font color="#E5E5E5"> much anymore</font>

130
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:00,360
the where the original card key card so

131
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,849
it tends to be an insertion leader but

132
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:07,070
I've seen readers where you hold the

133
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:11,639
card up against a little metal<font color="#E5E5E5"> plate I</font>

134
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:14,550
and it has what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could only describe</font>

135
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,919
as a fridge magnet<font color="#CCCCCC"> inside which has</font>

136
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:19,409
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> discrete magnetic domains so</font>

137
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:22,620
basically if you have a bit paper and

138
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:25,740
you pour iron filings over that's that's

139
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,840
what you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see and the</font>

140
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">original car key as I mentioned why gun</font>

141
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:35,579
cards a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more interesting</font>

142
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:39,419
there is a special wire which is

143
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:44,180
actually coaxial on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> special forging</font>

144
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:46,410
and has this magical<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wiegand effect</font>

145
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:49,290
which everyone thought was really cool

146
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:50,400
at the time and non duplicatable of

147
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,020
course they never really<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought you</font>

148
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:57,029
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just take an existing wide young</font>

149
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:59,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">card when we order the bits but a so</font>

150
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:03,020
basically if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the card you'll</font>

151
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:08,459
see little bits of wire embedded in it

152
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:09,449
and so that's pattern just remember it

153
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,680
because we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be seeing a lot</font>

154
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,430
of it

155
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:16,469
and basically the top Brewers<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones the</font>

156
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:21,899
bottom row zeros or either way it

157
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:23,490
doesn't matter I that's what carb looks

158
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:25,649
like that's what it looks like when you

159
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:30,360
hold up to the light so you can clearly

160
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:32,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">see the wires embedded in the card and</font>

161
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,750
basically what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> why kind effect is is</font>

162
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:40,589
when you wave your special bit of wire

163
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:43,320
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> wire to past a magnet in it which is</font>

164
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:48,029
polarized in a particular direction it

165
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:51,839
charges<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with magnetic field</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and when</font>

166
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:54,839
you wave it next to our oppositely

167
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,520
polarized magnet it dumps its charge and

168
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:00,000
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen to have a convenient</font>

169
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:02,399
little coil nearby you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font>

170
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,950
that pulse and that's all that's

171
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,160
happening when you swipe<font color="#CCCCCC"> your card</font>

172
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:11,399
through the reader there's two magnets

173
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,920
for each rule one charges the wire<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

174
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:19,770
other discharges it next to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

175
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:22,319
coil so once you swipe your<font color="#E5E5E5"> card what</font>

176
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:25,560
you actually get is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the wide and</font>

177
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,920
electrical protocol there's basically

178
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:32,790
three wires a data one wire a data<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero</font>

179
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:35,760
wire and a ground wire and these tiny

180
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:38,540
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> pulses are effectively what you'd</font>

181
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:43,069
see as you swipe the card cool down

182
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:47,219
through the reader so you've got to your

183
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:50,550
binary one here it's 40 micro second dip

184
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:54,209
and there's a 2 milli second gap between

185
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:57,300
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next pulse then your 40 micro</font>

186
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:59,969
second dip<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then a 2 milli second gap</font>

187
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,189
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's it's really quite</font>

188
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:05,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">simple there is quite a lot of variance</font>

189
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:08,970
in that the particular reader but i<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

190
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,279
here happens to do this some<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've seen</font>

191
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,829
this be as high as a hundred

192
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:19,170
microseconds hear it it's a it's quite

193
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:21,449
flexible as a protocol so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

194
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:23,250
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it looks like when you if</font>

195
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,459
you hook it up to a logic analyzer and

196
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,069
you

197
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:29,248
run a card through it doesn't happen to

198
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:35,219
me this<font color="#E5E5E5"> card but as you can see you know</font>

199
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:36,920
it's identical pretty much this is

200
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,970
important so you need to remember

201
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,819
because this is what we're going to be

202
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:48,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking out later the next thing we've</font>

203
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:50,819
got is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Y and format so generally if</font>

204
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,689
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go out into a store and say oh I</font>

205
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:58,019
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> our a white guy and prox card it</font>

206
00:11:54,689 --> 00:12:01,189
will probably be 26 bits they'll ask you

207
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:05,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh what facility called would you like</font>

208
00:12:01,189 --> 00:12:07,139
and that's ranges from 0 to 255 and then

209
00:12:05,369 --> 00:12:12,420
they'll give you a range of carbs which

210
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:14,670
you can specify quite often so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

211
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,618
actually 24 bits because you've got a

212
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:20,998
parity bit at the beginning a parity bit

213
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:27,749
at the end and that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes up a</font>

214
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:29,490
wide and ID they will manufacturers of

215
00:12:27,749 --> 00:12:32,369
cards will quite often say right I'll

216
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:35,579
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we've got this super</font>

217
00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:39,119
secure version which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually 36 bits</font>

218
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:41,160
and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell the site codes to</font>

219
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:43,319
everyone what will give you your own

220
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,019
site<font color="#E5E5E5"> board and we won't sell it to</font>

221
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:49,199
anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> else so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just remember when you're</font>

222
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:50,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">buying your 26 bit card quite often</font>

223
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:51,929
there's a there's a chance your

224
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:53,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">next-door neighbor might have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

225
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:58,470
facility good and therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> might have</font>

226
00:12:53,790 --> 00:13:03,118
duplicate cards prox card which we're

227
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:09,199
all aware of their passive so it takes

228
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:12,809
its energy from the reader and basically

229
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:17,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">pairs carved up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the carb bars back a</font>

230
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:18,899
data stream and it does it this when you

231
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:21,619
hold our plots card up to the light it

232
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:25,499
looks exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you think</font>

233
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:28,139
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little strip of wire wire for</font>

234
00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:31,709
wire antenna in there and a chip

235
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:33,779
actually it's a coil of a bazillion

236
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:35,439
terms of the finest wire you will ever

237
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:38,990
see

238
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:42,230
so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it pairs up it's</font>

239
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:44,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">magnetically coupled and it bars back a</font>

240
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:47,960
data stream it takes five hundred and

241
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:51,710
six bits across the ear interface to

242
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:59,120
hand over a single 26 bit ID so there's

243
00:13:51,710 --> 00:14:03,020
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of redundancy in it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay don't get</font>

244
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">prox cards on rfid cards people use the</font>

245
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,850
term interchangeably they're not

246
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:10,450
proximity<font color="#E5E5E5"> cards are magnetically coupled</font>

247
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:15,770
they've got to be close to the reader

248
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:17,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">enabled from for them to work I and</font>

249
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:20,329
basically when it's transmitting the

250
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:22,579
data back what it actually does is it

251
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,530
shorts its own coil it's got a tiny

252
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:28,190
capacitor in there to<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

253
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:29,540
alive it shorts its own coil<font color="#CCCCCC"> load which</font>

254
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:32,750
is effectively killing its own power

255
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:36,319
source but it causes a tiny volts drop

256
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:38,930
in the coil that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually powering it</font>

257
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,390
in the reader and that's how it actually

258
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:45,199
singles signals back so basically

259
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:48,439
through this magnetic coupling<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFID</font>

260
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,990
cards basically our true little radio

261
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:55,220
transmitters they take a radio signal

262
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:57,950
and typically they transmit the response

263
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,500
on a different frequency tends to be

264
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:03,070
half the frequency that's used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

265
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,070
energize it

266
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:14,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay see what I said about my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mouse</font>

267
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">running ahead of us late okay contact</font>

268
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:23,310
with smart cards in my view the way to

269
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:26,790
go I there tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the tent of</font>

270
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:30,029
decent crypto screens<font color="#E5E5E5"> the authenticate</font>

271
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:32,310
the reader so if you have a standard

272
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:35,010
prox card reader it will read pretty

273
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:37,500
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone prox card of that frequency</font>

274
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:39,300
so you can you know stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind them in</font>

275
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,820
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> street and you can read the data off</font>

276
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,769
their car with contactless smart cards

277
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:50,220
is at least some authentication you

278
00:15:43,769 --> 00:15:51,750
can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i will get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into there's a</font>

279
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,870
bit of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with someone we'll get</font>

280
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:57,680
into that in a minute so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to</font>

281
00:15:54,870 --> 00:16:01,139
give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick rundown of biometrics I</font>

282
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:04,050
there's my favorite and this is by far

283
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:06,060
my favorite the retina scan hey iris

284
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:08,910
scans which are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> popular than news</font>

285
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:12,989
at the moment new one that's coming out

286
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:14,880
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a venial hand map I hand</font>

287
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:20,459
geometry another perennial favorite mine

288
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:26,370
and the old fingerprint so fingerprints

289
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:29,760
are simply a capture and compared to

290
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:33,230

your semiconductor capacitive sensors

I'm not too keen on there but I'm not

293
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,560
too keen on either of them simply

<font color="#CCCCCC">because the semiconductor one can be</font>

very easily damaged by static

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:50,970
electricity it is literally a single

297
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:55,019
semiconductor field and so you can zap

298
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:56,970
that one really easily easily defeated

they're not about hard the important

302
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:09,689
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're all images so</font>

303
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:13,520
generally this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what our fingerprint</font>

304
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:16,650
breakdown looks like and the technology

305
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,199
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on which algorithm is using</font>

306
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:21,659
will look for particular things so

307
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,519
it might map all the ridge endings in

308
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:27,959
your finger but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might look for</font>

309
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:32,190
bifurcations or islands and everyone has

310
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:34,289
their own scheme there is no kind of

311
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:37,860
standard way for recognizing

312
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:40,019
fingerprints which means some vendors

313
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:44,850
technologies might be far more secure

314
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:46,950
than others and geometry scanners I

315
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,149
actually have a few of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these simply</font>

316
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:53,850
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're they're quite easy to</font>

use the not foolproof again it's just an

image capture this is actually quite a

00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:04,100
nice image of thoughtless devices

actually capturing and the smart guys

added a 45 degree murder in its field of

hand geometry scanner because it it

324

takes a side profile I thought yeah well

I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a nice hacked but</font>

geometry scanners as well where it's

00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:47,850
doing both a hand geometry and a venal

334
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:52,230
hand map and apparently someone's come

335
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:54,689
out with a finger venial map which I'm

340
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:10,169
image capture and that's where all

it it recognizes your pupils and takes

trained how to use a retina scanner you

do it's easy to to screw up even if you

little line of green dots that went into

380
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:33,500
infinity and you can have lined them up

381
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:36,410
so you could only see one the newer ones

382
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,570
I'd like the one picture there has a

then you freeze because<font color="#E5E5E5"> a retina scanner</font>

that easy and they all<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a variance</font>

410

factor because everyone changes look a

00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:17,809
little bit you know I have the staff

this afternoon tomorrow there will be

414
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:28,879
slightly larger and that changes things

415
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:30,730
all of a sudden bits and<font color="#CCCCCC"> pieces that the</font>

slightly further apart I if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> load up</font>

418
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:40,759
on water again things change if your

419
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,830
head is slightly oh you weren't quite

420
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:47,750
standing quite straight you're a slight

421
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:50,928
slightly angled again different so they

422
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:53,409
all have a fudge factor you never match

423
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:55,370
your biometric one hundred percent and

424
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:57,680
quite often when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look</font>

these these readers if you've got

00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:03,200
slightly more sophisticated device I

427
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,960
when you scan yourself it will give you

428
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:10,910
a score as to how closely you match your

429
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:13,040
ideal biometric that it recorded and the

430
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:15,670
systems administrators can tweak that so

431
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:20,659
you can see right well if you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> within</font>

432

thirty percent it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but you know 35</font>

433
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:27,140
isn't sometimes there can be a lot of

436
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:35,870
setting these systems up<font color="#CCCCCC"> and again that</font>

437
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,580
the stricter you make it the more

438
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:44,590
rejects you're going to get with people

439
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:49,399
trying to ascend to<font color="#CCCCCC"> gate and feeling so</font>

440
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:53,330
here's a retina and imagine that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font>

441
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:59,630
looked into my retina scanner and I've

442
00:24:53,330 --> 00:25:02,659
aligned my little dots press the red

443
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:10,510
button<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what happens because it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scans</font>

444
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:13,280
up a circle round my retina which is

445
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:16,179
effectively<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I retina scan actually</font>

446
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:23,720
is what happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it takes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that image</font>

447
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:28,010
it flattens<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out and but as it parses</font>

448
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:30,620
it it notices that here oh it got a

449
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:33,820
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> darker here oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm here and</font>

450
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:36,020
here and here and here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here and here</font>

451
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:41,030
surprisingly enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the original</font>

452
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:48,010
retina scanners the credential was 360

453
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:53,330
bits long I did start hashing this on

454
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:55,429
later later<font color="#E5E5E5"> models but it just just</font>

455
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:57,439
shows you it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like how are we going to</font>

456
00:25:55,429 --> 00:26:00,950
do this these people<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think are</font>

457
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,679
really really smart aren't quite that

458
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:07,660
smart you think oh well if he's designed

459
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,660
a written identification system

460
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:18,930
got to be great but maybe not so my<font color="#E5E5E5"> fave</font>

461
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:23,850
I have to say if certain problems

462
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:30,240
alignment it's totally subjective so we

463
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:35,010
just skip back to that that spot that

464
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:37,770
sport may be optically just where I

465
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:40,500
dropped it on on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> image I've said oh</font>

466
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:43,230
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in the center but with</font>

467
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:45,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">you it might not be the center of your</font>

468
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:47,790
retina<font color="#CCCCCC"> Center your retina just might be</font>

469
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:54,870
here as far as you're concerned in your

470
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:57,510
in your view so when you see movies

471
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:59,540
where someone pops someone's eyeball out

472
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:03,260
and holds it up to the retina<font color="#E5E5E5"> scanner</font>

473
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:06,330
totally totally totally bogus because a

474
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:09,690
even if they could align it so that the

475
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:12,659
the target ends up<font color="#E5E5E5"> spot-on in the center</font>

476
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:14,880
of the retina it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be the center</font>

477
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:17,210
of the retina as that user perceives it

478
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:24,120
as they aligned it when they were

479
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:25,890
registering it with the system so almost

480
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">like having a brain print because</font>

481
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:32,610
basically it's how your brain how that

482
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:35,130
the neurons whining the retina to your

483
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:38,550
brain actually decided it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

484
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:41,580
that was going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the center again</font>

485
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:43,200
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> your fudge factor and ID's</font>

486
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:48,290
end up as a hash which is not always a

487
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:50,430
good thing so false acceptance rate I

488
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:53,040
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really care about this are</font>

489
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:56,010
of the military ie they really don't

490
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:58,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">want they'd rather we had the false</font>

491
00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:01,230
rejection rate was high<font color="#CCCCCC"> E</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone didn't</font>

492
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:03,870
match their valid scan than to have a

493
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:05,220
high false acceptance rate where someone

494
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:09,540
that shouldn't be allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> then suddenly</font>

495
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:13,680
is and again they're all coupled with

496
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:14,960
the user ID so bit of a problem with

497
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:21,950
biometrics

498
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:28,610
how do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> revolt your credentials which</font>

499
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:31,340
is not nearly as bad as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> red bit of a</font>

500
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:33,320
problem it's like Oh someone's

501
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:38,449
duplicated my retina what am I going to

502
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:42,590
do I well you're screwed basically so

503
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:44,419
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a bit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a catch and it's about</font>

504
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:50,178
backwards<font color="#E5E5E5"> compatibility really and also</font>

505
00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:55,820
market forces the great market force why

506
00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:57,770
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> why gang card the bollocks these are</font>

507
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,570
the most secure things ever when they

508
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:03,529
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> out you know back in the 60s 70s</font>

509
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:06,289
and all the access control manufacturer

510
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:07,730
said right we warn your white guy and

511
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:09,289
came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> they didn't make access control</font>

512
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:14,230
systems they made the cards and the

513
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:16,549
readers so basically everyone wanted to

514
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:20,779
interface with white gang breeders and

515
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:23,029
they still do so everything we saw

516
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:26,360
everything we've just talked about from

517
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:29,510
the retina scanner down to your standard

518
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:32,240
proc swipe the all used<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wiegand</font>

519
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:35,059
electrical<font color="#CCCCCC"> whine and electrical protocol</font>

520
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,159
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wiegand data protocol to signal back</font>

521
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:41,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the controller and that's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

522
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:44,659
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a problem it's plain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> face</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

523
00:29:41,419 --> 00:29:48,409
much it's easily intercepted is even

524
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:51,289
easily more easily replayed you've got

525
00:29:48,409 --> 00:29:53,779
your output from biometrics and includes

526
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:56,210
the output<font color="#E5E5E5"> from your strong crypto</font>

527
00:29:53,779 --> 00:30:00,820
readers a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> white guy at</font>

528
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:02,750
bit on the bag some smarter

529
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:08,240
manufacturers are starting to move away

530
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:10,940
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but it's a huge problem so the</font>

531
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,779
goal of my little<font color="#E5E5E5"> project was to record</font>

532
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:16,850
widened IDs and to replay them and to be

533
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:18,470
small because basically it needs to

534
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:22,340
intersect the physical wiring guy in the

535
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:24,660
reader I'd be easily installable and to

536
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:29,080
be cheap would be nice

537
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:33,220
problems well once it's in there how do

538
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:36,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">I actually control it how do I get get</font>

539
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:40,210
it to replay IDs how did I make sure

540
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:43,570
that the the idea i'm seeing is actually

541
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:46,510
good and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to get the data out</font>

542
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:50,250
of the device how do i actually do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

543
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:55,930
again don't want the wires hanging about

544
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:58,000
so basically this is what a reader

545
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:00,850
standard reader would look like you've

546
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,550
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your positive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and negative which</font>

547
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:06,639
is dead handy because it gives me / and

548
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:08,200
then you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the data one and data 0</font>

549
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,690
lines which are transmitting the actual

550
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">Wiegand data and quite often you've got</font>

551
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:14,860
an LED which is driven by the access

552
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:20,220
control system that just basically makes

553
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:27,399
the school green when your load access

554
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:35,470
so this is gecko it's really small and

555
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:37,930
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cheap and it uses command</font>

556
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:40,750
carbs so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it has its own little</font>

557
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:43,150
set that is its own tiny access control

558
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:48,330
systems on it's a little set of cards

559
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:51,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">that knows to look out for it uses the</font>

560
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:56,110
access allowed led this one doesn't but

561
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:59,080
the v2 one does<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually say oh I</font>

562
00:31:56,110 --> 00:32:03,639
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen a wide an ID go past</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or and</font>

563
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:08,620
the access allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> led went on so it's a</font>

564
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:11,950
good good card and actually again this

565
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:14,739
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in v2 it uses</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the access to load</font>

566
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:17,920
it led to get the data out of the reader

567
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:21,280
because i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> using a pic chip for this</font>

568
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:24,010
and they're quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> handy so i can say in</font>

569
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:28,060
five you're an output pin and you're

570
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:30,940
totally driving that led oh you're no

571
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:34,990
serial port 9600 bits per second it one

572
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:38,200
nor and here have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff to send so</font>

573
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:40,890
basically I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little optical</font>

574
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:45,010
reader that you hold over to the LED you

575
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:47,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">swipe your dump card and it will just</font>

576
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:53,080
read out its entire contents of memory

577
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:58,379
and it just places in like this it's

578
00:32:53,080 --> 00:33:04,199
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> small this has quick connects so</font>

579
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:06,850
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I video man if you're about</font>

580
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:09,310
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pass these are these are</font>

581
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:11,919
artists renditions but basically is it

582
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:13,870
physically they're identical to this so

583
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,340
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pass a few out and you just</font>

584
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:16,750
pass them around so that people can

585
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:22,810
actually kind of see what we're actually

586
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:26,950
dealing with here I so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

587
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:29,679
you a quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> demo standard disclaimer</font>

588
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:31,420
applies if locks is in the room please

589
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:35,710
leave no because he's been drinking my

590
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:37,570
demo all weekend so I'm seeing right now

591
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:39,190
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to work but just in case</font>

592
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:41,669
it does I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take all the credit</font>

593
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:41,670
for it

594
00:33:52,070 --> 00:34:03,208
so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is oh nice thing is is here's</font>

595
00:34:01,649 --> 00:34:07,768
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual device I'm talking about it</font>

596
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:10,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was my artist rendition before</font>

597
00:34:07,769 --> 00:34:19,649
I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's actually just a</font>

598
00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:22,500
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> smaller so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a tiny</font>

599
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:25,710
tiny tiny little access control system

600
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:29,730
you got your reader and as I said this

601
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:32,879
particular one doesn't monitor the LEDs

602
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:34,679
I so that's what this yellow line is

603
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:37,859
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simply to drive the LED on the</font>

604
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:45,809
reader and here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have our power and</font>

605
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:51,029
our data<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero and data ones so it</font>

606
00:34:45,809 --> 00:34:57,329
recognizes to users oops you see that's

607
00:34:51,029 --> 00:35:10,319
the lock effect so user<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adam and users</font>

608
00:34:57,329 --> 00:35:12,569
AG and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad user is denied so what</font>

609
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:17,579
we're going to do is we'll just pop our

610
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:20,490
device in as you can see from the units

611
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:24,980
being passed around<font color="#CCCCCC"> there quick connects</font>

612
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:28,558
are open so literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> is as easy as</font>

613
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:31,170
cutting the wires and just crimping them

614
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:34,549
in all these readers tend to have

615
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:38,339
pigtails or rather than connectors so

616
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:40,020
it'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to also the connectors are</font>

617
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:42,779
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> single largest thing here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

618
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:45,559
pic chip in here is an 18 pin<font color="#CCCCCC"> dil</font>

619
00:35:42,779 --> 00:35:48,000
picture in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> socket so it's huge</font>

620
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:49,559
compared to what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it could be if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I went</font>

621
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,750
surface meant it<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be a lot smaller</font>

622
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:55,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it would be completely completely</font>

623
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:55,849
dwarfed by the connectors

624
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:14,270
so users<font color="#E5E5E5"> ack user Adam bad user just to</font>

625
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:17,140
use a sack again here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> parking yes and</font>

626
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:20,839
now I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a card here which previously</font>

627
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:23,290
wouldn't work this isolation<font color="#CCCCCC"> i knew i</font>

628
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:27,078
was missing something keep telling you I

629
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:31,040
run ahead of myself so I have three

630
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:35,869
other cards here which I didn't show you

631
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:44,259
if I will know and we'll just leave them

632
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:53,260
here the moment so bad user user Adam

633
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:53,260
and user<font color="#E5E5E5"> Zach the cards on this side</font>

634
00:36:54,280 --> 00:37:05,980
nope so they're all not recognized for

635
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,980
this access control system

636
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:29,810
believe it or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a lot don't</font>

637
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:32,270
actually bother monitoring and it's as

638
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:35,270
simple as holding lines high when you're

639
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:37,280
connecting it so bed of nails you just

640
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:39,940
hold the lines hi there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing</font>

641
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,650
there's nothing smart happening here I

642
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:44,090
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my favorite access control</font>

643
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:46,510
systems is actually manufactured by

644
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:49,340
harsh it's a system I use and it uses

645
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:54,740
courts strong crypto to talk to it sir

646
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:57,890
it's its readers I it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely to sport</font>

647
00:37:54,740 --> 00:38:01,450
things like that I because it's

648
00:37:57,890 --> 00:38:05,690
constantly talking to the readers but

649
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:09,230
basically no<font color="#CCCCCC"> one else does that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

650
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:17,480
they're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting there lines are</font>

651
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:26,570
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so bring it back up so we have</font>

652
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:31,310
a bad user reviews or Adam we have user

653
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:35,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">Zach and then we have our previous card</font>

654
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:44,630
which didn't work which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this one here</font>

655
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:47,620
oh dear this card is the replay card now

656
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:55,820
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are none</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the two cards here</font>

657
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:59,630
this one here for example quite handy it

658
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:04,990
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a reason because here's</font>

659
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:04,990
user<font color="#E5E5E5"> Zach and user Adam</font>

660
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:21,490
but use a replay so we'll use<font color="#E5E5E5"> our magic</font>

661
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:27,670
enable card let them back in<font color="#CCCCCC"> so now use</font>

662
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:30,850
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Zack so basically there's a whole</font>

663
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:35,970
raft of of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Handy other things you can do</font>

664
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:38,710
this was a this was a pic so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have a</font>

665
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:43,930
dump<font color="#E5E5E5"> card which will dump stuff out to</font>

666
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:48,580
the LED<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have some program cards so i</font>

667
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:51,910
have a program<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have an end program and</font>

668
00:39:48,580 --> 00:40:02,410
i have a1 and a0 so you literally can go

669
00:39:51,910 --> 00:40:08,890
program 1 0 1<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 0 0 0 1 and and get your</font>

670
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:10,569
ID in there so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it did work this is what</font>

671
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:18,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">happens when you look at the protocol</font>

672
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:21,250
analyzer and you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the this</font>

673
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:24,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the ID of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the card that was actually</font>

674
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:27,430
swiped the last few bites are bits

675
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,830
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> I say and you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

676
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:34,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">card that's transmitted to the reader is</font>

677
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:35,920
completely different<font color="#E5E5E5"> I albeit not that</font>

678
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:38,770
different because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen to use all my</font>

679
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:44,380
cards in the same batch but they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

680
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:48,030
the scary thing is is it took 12 hours

681
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:51,130
to do it was literally that simple

682
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:55,780
included learning the IDE and how to

683
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:58,240
program<font color="#CCCCCC"> pegs which isn't hard at all not</font>

684
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:02,920
when you write it in six key a big basic

685
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:06,609
I it's got a very basic feature set and

686
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:10,030
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen their disabled vary from to</font>

687
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:11,360
which I'm working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the moment these</font>

688
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:13,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">pictures</font>

689
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:16,760
either have either there's a whole range

690
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:19,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">of them they've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got different features</font>

691
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:25,130
some have got built an<font color="#CCCCCC"> eeprom most of</font>

692
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:26,810
them have got built-in flash I they

693
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:29,000
check the validity of the card by

694
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:33,890
monitoring the the reader<font color="#CCCCCC"> LED so there's</font>

695
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,810
a slightly / one here which is our

696
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:42,080
another connector on the top which

697
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:45,799
intersects this led line I that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my fav</font>

698
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:48,890
is serial port line 5 clock the data out

699
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:52,940
and it will load the data via the

700
00:41:48,890 --> 00:42:01,370
command carbs version 3 i'm using a

701
00:41:52,940 --> 00:42:11,450
bluetooth interface<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just take the</font>

702
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:13,700
larger<font color="#E5E5E5"> positive i'm obviously have no</font>

703
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:17,859
way to control it that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good way</font>

704
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:28,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then they're from for</font>

705
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:36,130
that little guy is<font color="#E5E5E5"> stem fun so this is</font>

706
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:42,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">the GSM antenna I this is a gps antenna</font>

707
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:47,060
and it is fully programmable in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python I</font>

708
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:49,250
and the cost about<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty bucks so so</font>

709
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:52,160
yeah there's lots and lots and lots and

710
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:59,450
lots of fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be had now as for these</font>

711
00:42:52,160 --> 00:43:01,240
readers I basically were you screwed by

712
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:08,390
two screws for plastic cover because

713
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:12,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically that's literally all it takes</font>

714
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:17,440
two screws so that about wraps it up

715
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:17,440
hope you enjoyed it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rocking</font>

716
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:35,629
so does anyone have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions sorry</font>

717
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:41,160
the fuck well I'm quite decided if I'm

718
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:43,500
going to release it or not because it

719
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">was so easy to do I mean it is</font>

720
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:50,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">criminally you should learn how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

721
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:53,879
this pic chips are fabulous I it's I

722
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:57,330
mean is it's not hard in any way<font color="#CCCCCC"> shape</font>

723
00:43:53,880 --> 00:44:00,150
or form I this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this little circuit here</font>

724
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:03,210
has some supporting hardware like a

725
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:05,880
little crystal to give that the chip its

726
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:07,170
timing the only reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did it on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

727
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">one is because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I happen to have a pic</font>

728
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:10,710
lying around that didn't have an

729
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:13,500
internal clock I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> literally</font>

730
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:16,320
everything's<font color="#E5E5E5"> their Hardware serial ports</font>

731
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:18,900
built in there really really easy to use

732
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:24,060
shockingly so I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this in</font>

733
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:29,120
12 hours and I generally I'm not known

734
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:29,120
for my coding I anyone can

735
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:44,319
anything else well the problem is is

736
00:44:38,329 --> 00:44:44,319
it's not there isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a vendor that is</font>

737
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:59,150
that's the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing it's just couple</font>

738
00:44:55,130 --> 00:45:03,319
of pulses going down two wires so it's a

739
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:06,650
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone I mean most of</font>

740
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:10,490
these readers have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> frame if you buy</font>

741
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:11,839
an alarm device like a passive or I even

742
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:14,390
a little junction box it will have a

743
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:17,750
tamper switch built into it as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

744
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:21,020
as part of the device not one of these

745
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:23,450
readers I've ever looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at has any form</font>

746
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:25,970
of tamper switch at all some of the

747
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:31,700
biometric devices do but they're worth

748
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:33,770
stealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I spoke</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to some locksmith and</font>

749
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:37,220
they said oh well it's easy you just put

750
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:39,079
tamper-proof screws in so it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

751
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:41,990
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you destroy it</font>

752
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:44,359
taking off the wall and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm like okay so</font>

753
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:47,538
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> destroy taking off the wall they're</font>

754
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:51,558
like 20 bucks on<font color="#E5E5E5"> eBay I'll just put a</font>

755
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:55,700
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> one back in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing the only</font>

756
00:45:51,559 --> 00:46:02,180
thing it does raise is this particular

757
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:04,730
manufacturer who are born name I has has

758
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:06,788
its own command carbs so<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you pair</font>

759
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:10,309
one of these readers up<font color="#E5E5E5"> for five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes</font>

760
00:46:06,789 --> 00:46:12,890
it goes into<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can program me Maude</font>

761
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:16,400
and it has its own little set of command

762
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:18,379
cards surprisingly enough I so I've got

763
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,020
a card that will turn the beep on and

764
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:25,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">off I don't want my beep to beep boom we</font>

765
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:30,589
have a card doesn't beep anymore so how

766
00:46:25,819 --> 00:46:36,170
do you know that this feature isn't

767
00:46:30,589 --> 00:46:39,500
already in your readers because<font color="#CCCCCC"> hell if</font>

768
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:42,500
I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to to their microcode it</font>

769
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:44,880
certainly would be so you know how much

770
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:46,799
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually hire actually much the</font>

771
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,099
actually trust your access control

772
00:46:46,799 --> 00:46:52,769
vendors you know with their I shouldn't

773
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:57,240
really mention this to some people with

774
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:59,609
rampant paranoia but it's like yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

775
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:36,058
could very very easily be compromised

776
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:39,420
already I some keypad readers use<font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font>

777
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:41,730
games some are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really dumb and they just</font>

778
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:43,740
have a contact closure on the back so

779
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:46,799
some some keypad readers are actually

780
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:49,109
kind of smart they talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wiegand to</font>

781
00:47:46,799 --> 00:47:51,720
back-end access control system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

782
00:47:49,109 --> 00:47:55,170
are just literally locally programmed

783
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:57,899
and if you actually were able to get

784
00:47:55,170 --> 00:48:00,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">behind the keypad you could just short</font>

785
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:10,920
out there I the contacts<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would</font>

786
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:13,589
actually open the lock well if you had

787
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:15,630
to look at the ones I that are floating

788
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:18,660
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all you have to do is cut four</font>

789
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:20,880
wires poke them in the end there crimp

790
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:25,170
poke them in the ends and crimp and

791
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:27,029
that's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> pressive yeah plus I could</font>

792
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:28,769
take you know how long does it take you

793
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:34,200
to take a light switch out of its socket

794
00:48:28,769 --> 00:48:36,118
put it back<font color="#E5E5E5"> in well now you what you</font>

795
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,250
want to put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> back but I mean that all</font>

796
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:41,730
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have fits down dorje boxes</font>

797
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:43,740
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you walk around the place have</font>

798
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:48,299
a look and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see how many of these are</font>

799
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:50,609
sitting guarding doors with you know no

800
00:48:48,299 --> 00:48:53,800
camera back up there just you know

801
00:48:50,609 --> 00:48:59,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">sitting in the back of an alley</font>

802
00:48:53,800 --> 00:49:02,930
yeah yeah art do it in the day just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

803
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:05,089
oh I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I told one of my mates</font>

804
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:07,819
about you said<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope he just put a</font>

805
00:49:05,089 --> 00:49:32,839
manufacturers label on it just call it

806
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:34,820
Tara filter or yeah all depends when and

807
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:40,190
where the readers are I mean the classic

808
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:42,980
place is the is is smokers corner right

809
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:44,810
in the back every building has one

810
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:49,670
especially in California it's like and

811
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:51,859
in the UK<font color="#CCCCCC"> now as well so there's a yeah</font>

812
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:53,740
there's going to be a door it's good

813
00:49:51,859 --> 00:49:56,328
it's going to have a reader on it and

814
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:57,680
yeah it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in some little</font>

815
00:49:56,329 --> 00:50:00,980
place because they don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

816
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:03,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">people to see all the smokers I yeah I</font>

817
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:05,990
say it's a classic there's just have a

818
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:09,190
walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> around and have a look and see how</font>

819
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:09,189
many exposed readers there are

820
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:24,980
this is a pic and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 6 16 f</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 627 I</font>

821
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:28,100
and it is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pic and the</font>

822
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:30,980
connectors yeah it is that embarrassing

823
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:34,069
so some of the this reader and most

824
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:36,230
readers will do from<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 to 12 volts if it</font>

825
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:38,360
is a 12-volt system the signaling always

826
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:42,530
goes back certainly in my experience at

827
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:44,570
five so you may have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I add in a</font>

828
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:47,180
little voltage regulator so you don't

829
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:49,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">fry your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pic but they're the size you</font>

830
00:50:47,180 --> 00:51:05,060
know TOS package their size of a

831
00:50:49,160 --> 00:51:11,149
transistor so hard way well incidentally

832
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:14,090
this this is timed down to the

833
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:16,790
nanosecond and my timings are actually

834
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:20,030
better they're more accurate than the

835
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:21,950
reader itself just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit but</font>

836
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:24,920
they're more accurate and if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

837
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:26,930
made my device slightly larger that

838
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:29,570
included a little slot ceramic resonator

839
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:34,520
clocked it slightly faster I could make

840
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:38,960
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more deadly accurate still so I</font>

841
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:42,670
mean I the only kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hardware used to</font>

842
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,670
develop this was it was a programmer

843
00:51:46,570 --> 00:52:00,310
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey you just use a u.s. use bed of</font>

844
00:51:57,490 --> 00:52:03,359
nails a halt to hold the voltage up the

845
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:07,840
signals signals each bit is it dropping

846
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:10,360
it drops for a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it so its standard</font>

847
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:13,650
state is held high so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just hold it</font>

848
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:17,080
high while you're doing the install I

849
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:20,320
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Norma's going to be an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advisor I</font>

850
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:23,529
mean pic programmer 50 bucks looks like

851
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:25,720
that and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a little logic</font>

852
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:29,340
analyzer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get the timings perfect but</font>

853
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:32,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">sir that is the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one you used and</font>

854
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:35,020
this one was about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 300 bucks but</font>

855
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:37,960
basically you can get really really

856
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:40,930
really cheap only I mean this decides

857
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:43,000
like 34 ports you can get you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know one</font>

858
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:46,180
or two port logic analyzers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are little</font>

859
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:55,960
USB scopes really cheaply as well so if

860
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:58,750
no expensive at all yeah but the thing

861
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:04,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">is it's it's really really close to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

862
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:06,100
end and it's it's not it doesn't look

863
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:08,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a tat because it's actually</font>

864
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:13,360
intercepting the signal and terminating

865
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:15,220
it effectively so I mean no doubt if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

866
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:18,070
are actually actively looking for this

867
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:23,080
stuff then it may be possible to detect

868
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:24,540
it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom line is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i 90</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

869
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:27,730
heavily MC ninety i'd say probably

870
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:31,770
ninety eight percent of access control

871
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:31,770
systems don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even bother</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff</font>

872
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:38,950
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean obviously putting at</font>

00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:45,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">the G box I mean if you if you're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">outside a building then I accessing that</font>

875

door is kind of number one I once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

876
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:57,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">in then I mean you could read it read</font>

877
00:53:53,350 --> 00:54:00,640
out the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> I there are other devices</font>

878
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:02,710
for calling cards so rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than trying</font>

879
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:04,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">to find users it would be quite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to</font>

880
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:06,730
install one of these that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the XR one of</font>

881
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:08,680
the external readers just read a whole

882
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:12,420
bunch of carbide ease and then once

883
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:12,419
you've got them just emulate the carbs

884
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:26,710
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> quad-core quite called quite often</font>

885
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:29,560
sorry this this is generally mounted on

886
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:33,430
the outside so I'd be at the service

887
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:38,380
entrance<font color="#E5E5E5"> it how long does it take to pop</font>

888
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:42,580
the cover off two screws you cut crimp

889
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:46,930
primp so I i would say three minutes or

890
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:50,100
under yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> practice you</font>

891
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:50,100
could probably do it really quickly

892
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:06,330
one of one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the problems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with this is</font>

893
00:55:02,839 --> 00:55:09,529
people think that that the actual

894
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:11,670
security is in the card not in

895
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:14,609
what'swhat's going back and forth so

896
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:17,790
they made no attempt<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really secure I</font>

897
00:55:14,609 --> 00:55:19,830
mean if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be you know</font>

898
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:23,250
tamper switch to hell I would be talking

899
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:26,390
crypto from here or ideally from the

900
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:38,820
card back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the access control system</font>

901
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:48,680
sadly no sorry I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> normally use just</font>

902
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:52,020
shielded cat5 cat6 cable I yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

903
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:55,098
some some places will do if it's

904
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:57,660
particularly exposed but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again you know</font>

905
00:55:55,099 --> 00:55:59,010
two screws in a plastic color that's

906
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:08,220
that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> stopped you getting behind</font>

907
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:11,630
the reader any more questions then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

908
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:11,629
commend<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to the bar</font>
