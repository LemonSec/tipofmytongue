1
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:14,190
thanks everyone for sticking around for

2
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:15,900
this smells<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in and out here I'm</font>

3
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lisa Eduardo I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

4
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:25,860
online and some sort of offline banking

5
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:27,660
fraud fishing and stuff like that the

6
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,790
purpose of the talk the motivation of

7
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,100
the talk is to talk some about some of

8
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,470
the differences from the online online

9
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,619
banking and the whole banking system

10
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,980
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have here in the US and some</font>

11
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">other places so being born and raised in</font>

12
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,670
brazil and living here for quite a while

13
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,370
now and traveling back and forth

14
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes I kind of have the motivation</font>

15
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:54,090
to do a presentation talking about the

16
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,430
differences because in places where the

17
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,620
law really works or the system is

18
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,960
different it's simpler for the user to

19
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,060
make use of the bank or the ATM and

20
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,220
stuff like that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in other places</font>

21
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">where things sometimes don't work that</font>

22
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:11,670
well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to it has to be some</font>

23
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,980
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> steps have to be added to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

24
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:18,059
system to make it more complicated for

25
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:20,959
the user sometimes and safer for the

26
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,730
financial institutions so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really quick</font>

27
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,560
going to talk a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it not</font>

28
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:29,510
going to spend time time talking about

29
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:32,550
what fishing is and some other

30
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,649
techniques of doing fishing because most

31
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,860
of you know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and some of you</font>

32
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,870
might know way better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than I do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm gaya</font>

33
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,360
i'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to focus only on the</font>

34
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,500
differences and stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're</font>

35
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk about the evolution of</font>

36
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:50,910
fishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to jump from to ATM</font>

37
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:56,010
fraud which is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> big outside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

38
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:58,980
US and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some places in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

39
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:01,160
much but there are cases of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it have some</font>

40
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,390
videos<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i put from the internet and</font>

41
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:06,410
try to get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort of conclusion</font>

42
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,410
about this

43
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:14,420
so about the history of fishing what is

44
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:17,120
fishing it's on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next slide by the</font>

45
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:21,049
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's a means to a fraud so with</font>

46
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,090
everybody using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet it became</font>

47
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:26,050
clear to the two people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do</font>

48
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:31,330
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff to use that channel that</font>

49
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:34,730
vector that attack vector to get either

50
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:38,570
people's identity information so

51
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:41,720
identity theft or just simply money and

52
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:43,400
a part of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the whole marketing</font>

53
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying no use the internet the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

54
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,860
is easy buy stuff from the internet some

55
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:51,320
of us are even may be the cause of this

56
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,660
you go to your family some one way or

57
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,609
another you say well use the internet to

58
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,829
do this and then they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

59
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:03,770
much knowledge on how to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

60
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:05,950
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fishers people who do that who</font>

61
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,240
prepared the fishing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fishers they</font>

62
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,220
they thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> year to</font>

63
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:15,140
use this type of exploited let's call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

64
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:16,820
exploitation and the intro that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i put</font>

65
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:20,329
here or not the intro that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the title</font>

66
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:22,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">that i put online and offline by offline</font>

67
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:24,560
i mean that well it's not really online

68
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,719
banking it's not internet banking but it

69
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,910
sort of all all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it is of course tied</font>

70
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,980
up to the same system so<font color="#E5E5E5"> being on the</font>

71
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,530
same system somehow you're going to get

72
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:39,410
screwed one way or another right if you

73
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:42,409
fall for one of these so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is fishing</font>

74
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,970
it means to a fraud that's the part that

75
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not going to spend too much time I</font>

76
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:50,330
have a slide for each one of these

77
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:55,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">topics here and some of them I'm going</font>

78
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:57,919
to go really fast and they may so the

79
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">difference here why some places some</font>

80
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">third-world countries had to be a little</font>

81
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit more advanced not nowadays nowadays</font>

82
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,000
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the technology</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

83
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:11,810
protections are the same all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,990
place but why it was different<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

85
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:18,009
while I remember seeing a torque on two

86
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:21,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">years ago I think presentation from</font>

87
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:23,379
a fellow from websense and at that time

88
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:26,009
like screen captures of virtual

89
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:29,139
keyboards was something fairly new and

90
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:31,659
that's not new anymore but that started

91
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:34,839
actually back in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brazil because I</font>

92
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:37,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember almost a decade ago when I</font>

93
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:40,180
moved to the States I had in Brazil on

94
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:43,479
online<font color="#CCCCCC"> an internet banking access and</font>

95
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:45,639
when I moved here up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the boonies in</font>

96
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:48,818
the Northeast I went to the banks open

97
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:50,589
an account and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just asked and like so</font>

98
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:53,169
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the internet banking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're like</font>

99
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:54,849
looking at me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not banking like</font>

100
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:56,799
banking through the internet and like

101
00:05:54,849 --> 00:05:59,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">ender like we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have that of course</font>

102
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,749
like two<font color="#E5E5E5"> years later it showed up but at</font>

103
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:04,180
that point in 97 was totally new at

104
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:06,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">least for the bank that I used and that</font>

105
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:11,709
was something that I was using for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font>

106
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:14,020
years already the thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

107
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:15,759
third<font color="#E5E5E5"> world countries is that usually</font>

108
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:19,419
they're not that targets for the fishing

109
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,759
they because<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who who's got the</font>

110
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:25,229
money pretty much is here and some

111
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:30,039
places in Europe so the target is mostly

112
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:32,649
force most developed countries and the

113
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,269
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are trying to or creating</font>

114
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:38,159
fishing kits and stuff like that or

115
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:41,589
benefiting from this somehow or abroad

116
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:46,089
the anti-phishing work group divides

117
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:48,759
fishing and pretty much<font color="#CCCCCC"> for flavors</font>

118
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:52,240
let's call it like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this financial retail</font>

119
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:55,870
is peace and other I'm not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

120
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the others and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISPs neither</font>

121
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,969
the retail then a focus on online

122
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:04,438
banking and any sort of financial

123
00:07:00,969 --> 00:07:08,259
institution credit union kind of stuff

124
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:11,309
identity so the goal of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fishing on</font>

125
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:15,639
financial or the financial market is

126
00:07:11,309 --> 00:07:18,069
identity theft account withdraw like

127
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:21,909
take sometimes they call<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money out</font>

128
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:26,229
of an account buy stuff with somebody

129
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:28,899
else's money and due<font color="#CCCCCC"> to technology</font>

130
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:31,120
advanced to the evolution<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Technology</font>

131
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:33,940
some banks<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want to push the</font>

132
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,560
technology to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used and as probably</font>

133
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,040
you sign most of the talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happen</font>

134
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,110
today and yesterday here sometimes

135
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:44,880
security is left it's an afterthought

136
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:47,530
right it's left<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all let's push the</font>

137
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,650
this thing to work let's release this

138
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:52,780
new product and then we figure out what

139
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:58,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do with security or don't even think</font>

140
00:07:52,780 --> 00:08:02,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">about security why people create this</font>

141
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:04,300
type of mechanism for fraud pretty much

142
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:09,370
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a high return of</font>

143
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:13,680
investment it's fairly cheap to deploy

144
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:15,970
fake servers or fake websites and

145
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:21,400
release spam all over the place and

146
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:23,380
stuff and it's risk-free because

147
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,870
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is as I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

148
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:28,690
developed abroad and these people are

149
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:32,890
abroad and although of course there are

150
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:38,200
places not places they are the

151
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:40,000
three-letter agencies here that might

152
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,700
take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it or at least one of them</font>

153
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,500
should take<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it it's hard to go</font>

154
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">after these guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not going to</font>

155
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:51,730
leave the place where they are and most

156
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:56,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">likely there are no laws for that excuse</font>

157
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:59,470
me what<font color="#CCCCCC"> all another thing is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lack of</font>

158
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,859
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> of human interaction so when you're</font>

159
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:04,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing this kind of stuff you're not for</font>

160
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,980
the user and<font color="#E5E5E5"> four home average doing the</font>

161
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,290
attack right there's no human

162
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:11,500
interaction although you're doing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

163
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:14,050
bad thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for somebody you really don't</font>

164
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:19,770
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in a sort of way</font>

165
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:21,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the lack of user knowledge is a</font>

166
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:25,180
problem too and that's something that is

167
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:29,219
being worked on make somebody bring me a

168
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:33,540
glass of<font color="#CCCCCC"> water not one into as too much</font>

169
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,540
nigga<font color="#E5E5E5"> zine and out effect here</font>

170
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:46,380
going on and coughing so how do people

171
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:49,949
fall for these things span the most

172
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:53,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">famous one everybody knows this out of a</font>

173
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:58,110
million the spam message is sent at

174
00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:00,170
least 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> one percent is going to fall</font>

175
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:04,590
for it and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot still a lot and</font>

176
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:06,569
people they get educated they use

177
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:12,740
antivirus this anti-spam and stuff like

178
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:25,280
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the spams get also smarter and</font>

179
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:30,480
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that create that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks okay</font>

180
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:33,089
better so the other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some</font>

181
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,060
websites well here any website any bank

182
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:39,120
website that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go now there is a</font>

183
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:41,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">security thing there before he didn't</font>

184
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,320
use to be there but about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spam</font>

185
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,930
sometimes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> banks when there is a life</font>

186
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,810
like a spam on the wild let's put it

187
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,550
like this the bank say we did not send

188
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:52,589
this which is really cool it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

189
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:55,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">good for the user to know that that</font>

190
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:58,020
email<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he might he or she might have</font>

191
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:00,060
received is not from the bank but I've

192
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,829
seen cases where the bank says this is

193
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">not how we do it this is actually how we</font>

194
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:09,080
do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then of course they copy that</font>

195
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:09,080
the thing not really smart in my opinion

196
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:16,860
after they get that email they go to the

197
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:19,439
forge or fake websites these websites

198
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,740
usually they're not hosted here they're

199
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,490
not up for a few more than a few days

200
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:30,570
and that might be the reason why the

201
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:32,220
emails they go out like seasonally that

202
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,530
means they set up a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

203
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,350
servers or whatever and then they send

204
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:39,329
out all those spams that's why at least

205
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:42,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">I noticed that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes I get of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

206
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:44,100
I get spams every day but sometimes I

207
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:52,740
get way more than

208
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:55,709
that I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to how do people get through</font>

209
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,660
these webs to this fake website number

210
00:11:55,709 --> 00:12:00,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">one the email they spam they just go</font>

211
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:02,189
there and click I don't have screenshots

212
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:07,199
here I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I need for this type</font>

213
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:13,319
of crowd the email might be directing to

214
00:12:07,199 --> 00:12:17,339
a fake website well here people use a

215
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:22,589
lot of myspace abroad people use a lot

216
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:25,380
of orchid Google and I've seen that you

217
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:27,660
have links to malware and stuff like

218
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:31,079
that click here to see whomever's your

219
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:34,469
friends picture whatever you download

220
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:40,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a malware and</font>

221
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:44,130
the user is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to know or simply</font>

222
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:47,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instant messaging and of course after</font>

223
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:49,740
the download either it changes locally

224
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:54,449
on the only host on the hosts entry the

225
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:57,029
DNA saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> baenk.com</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be the</font>

226
00:12:54,449 --> 00:13:00,630
bad sites IP address so it's going to

227
00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:03,290
direct<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there or there was that case</font>

228
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:05,579
not too long ago where there was a

229
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:08,160
malware that was changing the dns

230
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:10,469
entries on the gateway so there was a

231
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,930
vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was dude that was think</font>

232
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,579
mostly affected by it and what the

233
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:16,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">trojan did it didn't change anything on</font>

234
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:19,079
the user machine but look for the

235
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">default gateway try to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> log in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

237
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:28,019
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't change especially in the</font>

238
00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:33,360
soho market and routine instead of using

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP dns entry would would</font>

240
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:40,139
stick their dns ain't a fake<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns now the</font>

241
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:42,839
IP address of a bad dns a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns that has</font>

242
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:45,329
poisoned entries so the guy says go to

243
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:48,329
my bank calm his machine is fine but his

244
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:53,010
gateway is directing the machine to the

245
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:54,719
wrong place so that wouldn't help too

246
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">much to have some sort of anti malware</font>

247
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,530
or

248
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:02,329
anti spyware on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine and of</font>

249
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:05,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they have key loggers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

250
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:16,070
screenshot loggers click loggers and

251
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:18,620
stuff like that sorry voice phishing not

252
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:20,810
really related to VoIP but it white

253
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:23,630
could really help doing this type of

254
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:26,390
attacks meaning you can put an asterisk

255
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:30,110
server somewhere doing men in the middle

256
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:32,540
or something like that that people would

257
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,190
call in and be either you're

258
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:37,910
eavesdropping on whatever it's been

259
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:40,550
going on on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> call or is just faking</font>

260
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:42,530
really faking and a call center of a

261
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:44,959
bank or something like that how do

262
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:47,089
people call this number though it all

263
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,040
depends could be an email that received

264
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:51,320
this is your bank there's a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

267
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:59,500
blah blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a problem</font>

with it right how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you here</font>

269
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,040
somehow smart you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to call your</font>

270
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,350
bank the number that i know that is in

271
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:10,339
the back of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your card and hopefully</font>

272
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:12,050
that's the bank sometimes the number

273
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:14,990
they give you is not that number behind

274
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:18,890
the card that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is written behind your</font>

278
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,830
fishing at that I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

279
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:34,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">extremely lame but since i had the stock</font>

280
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:36,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">i just put it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much your</font>

284
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:50,930
it to know specifics and so you can get

285

any mail where you can get a voicemail

315
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,670
done like in two minutes using the

316
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:46,010
internet and Google and that's it right

that that's fairly easy for somebody to

320
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:59,230
spoof this so it's out there and tell

321
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,230
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the truth I go ahead strong</font>

322
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:06,240
when I call my bank and I recorded their

323
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,070
ivr menu and I present wonderful things

324
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've read back numbers to me I took that</font>

325
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:13,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">into Adobe Audition splice it up and put</font>

326
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:15,780
on my asterisk box and had an exact

327
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,178
sounding replica of my bank oh my ass

328
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:20,220
response as the concepts<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't even</font>

329
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:28,590
need to generate different for you have

330
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:30,000
the action reports so I exactly that

331
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:32,189
would be the men in the middle so strums

332
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,710
point was that one time he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> called his</font>

333
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:37,140
bank and just recorded every single menu

334
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,820
they had and put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on his edit it and</font>

335
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,640
put on his Asterix box and he had

336
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:44,460
exactly the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same call menu and the other</font>

337
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,530
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the Asterix box intercepting</font>

338
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,990
everything right and then that's another

339
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:50,970
that would be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave's drown men in</font>

340
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,309
the middle so the guys really talking to

341
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:56,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">his bank and but somebody's recording</font>

342
00:18:53,309 --> 00:18:59,570
whatever's been talked so I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

343
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:59,570
know i think the solute right there

344
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:12,090
asterix ba asterixis somebody wants to

345
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:15,149
answer and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can have that</font>

346
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:17,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a live CD free distribution that</font>

347
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,140
you can download and has the Asterix

348
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:28,340
pre-configured right what's the name of

349
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:30,750
the Asterix now so going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on moving on</font>

350
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:34,470
SMS would be a new way I don't think

351
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:39,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is really being used yet but</font>

352
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:41,760
there's a lot of spam over SMS some

353
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:43,559
places abroad starting from the carrier

354
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,390
that you use you land somewhere you turn

355
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:47,070
on your phone it says welcome<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this if</font>

356
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:49,470
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do welcome to this carrier</font>

357
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:51,570
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to do this and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that</font>

358
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:56,220
don't do not look for another network

359
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:59,789
well if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> start sending SMSs all</font>

360
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:02,520
over the place now you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> there like</font>

361
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:06,360
free websites that you can send free SMS

362
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,610
s worldwide so that would be a way to

363
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,610
have a person<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to a web page or to</font>

364
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:13,709
call certain number like one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the fake</font>

365
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,428
numbers but like we weren't discussing

366
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,950
the last

367
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:18,840
or telling go here and you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

368
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:21,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">get free stuff if you fill out the</font>

369
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:27,678
survey going to get an iphone or

370
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:33,450
something like that Wi-Fi fishing well

371
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:36,059
put this here just because it's the the

372
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:39,029
result is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same as dns poisoning so</font>

373
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:43,200
it's on the Wi-Fi side would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the evil</font>

374
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:45,720
twin attack meaning you have an access

375
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,960
point that is using the same SSID as a

376
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,240
good access point<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fake-ass</font>

377
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,820
access point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that fake access point</font>

378
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:59,220
has bad dns entries<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sending you to</font>

379
00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:01,408
the bad servers so<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better be like</font>

380
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,679
mostly using<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot spots not corp</font>

381
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:08,429
corporations so in hearts will you go to

382
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:13,049
to your favorite five bucks too fast or

383
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:15,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first shot and you turn on your</font>

384
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:17,009
computer you see the SSID they're used

385
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:18,869
to connect and you connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it and</font>

386
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,610
you're on the internet or say oh ok let

387
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:22,830
me do my online banking and actually

388
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:26,428
you're going to a bad website you<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

389
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:27,928
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know about it or simply a</font>

390
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:30,720
man-in-the-middle attack even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font>

391
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:33,269
like most of the connections to banks

392
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:39,929
now use<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSL but we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk</font>

393
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:44,159
about ssl in a little bit in some cases

394
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:48,929
yet but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get to ssl well</font>

395
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:51,480
20 stuff not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only web tool but stuff</font>

396
00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:54,659
mostly related to ab 20 the javascript

397
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,580
ajax cross-site scripting and even man

398
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:59,669
in the middle with some of these

399
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:02,610
applications so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not going to talk</font>

400
00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:04,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this because Billy Hoffman who</font>

401
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:08,039
knows a lot about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this he did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a talk at</font>

404
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:18,690
google for it<font color="#CCCCCC"> bartle in there's a</font>

405
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,800
presentation from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Billy and part of it</font>

406
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:32,190
he mentions how this is possible

407
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:35,669
a point that I found here is what it

408
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:38,940
says there in Portuguese's lab that I

409
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:41,790
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make cds and dvds is found in in</font>

410
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,620
a city in Brazil that<font color="#CCCCCC"> means they found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

411
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:46,320
place that would like make cds and dvds

412
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,120
with personal information what would be

413
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,780
in the u.s. name address social security

414
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,850
numbers and stuff so why some places you

415
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:56,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have to try to do the technology</font>

416
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:57,990
stuff to buy a fishing kit or something

417
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:00,780
like that just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people's think you</font>

418
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:04,140
just go downtown somewhere and walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

419
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:07,010
the street and<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 50 US dollars you you</font>

420
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:10,320
can get a CD with all this information

421
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:13,140
last time I went to Brazil not trying to

422
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,780
get in trouble<font color="#CCCCCC"> I went to one of these</font>

423
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:19,320
places which is just a street that sells

424
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:20,820
all kinds of electronic stuff and on the

425
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,120
street<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have the little stands and</font>

426
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:27,179
the guy selling they sell dvds and movie

427
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:29,280
dvds and cds with applications and stuff

428
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:32,820
like that like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we heard in china is the</font>

429
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,670
same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and other places too and but</font>

430
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:38,580
they have the regular commercial stuff

431
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:40,530
but if you ask oh do you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Social</font>

432
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">Security listing whatever they're like</font>

433
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:44,760
yeah for what state do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want and they</font>

434
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:48,379
do it by state and it costs 50 US

435
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:51,080
dollars so<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes they get busted but</font>

436
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:54,060
the problem is bigger than that right

437
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:56,129
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another example that the director</font>

438
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:58,740
of intellectual property from Microsoft

439
00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:02,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">he was in San</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Paulo Brazil not too long</font>

440
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:03,600
ago and they took<font color="#CCCCCC"> him to this place so</font>

441
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,610
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> picture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is actually from the</font>

442
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,060
street that I told you so the stands are

443
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:12,360
exactly like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're like this</font>

444
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:14,850
booth here and you have all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

445
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:18,689
software so<font color="#CCCCCC"> 45 US dollars you get a copy</font>

446
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:20,459
of windows<font color="#CCCCCC"> list or whatever and then if</font>

447
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:23,100
you ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the good stuff they reach</font>

448
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,930
underneath or whatever bag they have and

449
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:28,889
again they say<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh what do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want and</font>

450
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:31,370
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad so</font>

451
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:33,420
comparing this to what we live here I

452
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:36,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully we're not going to see this</font>

453
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:39,330
around here but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing is</font>

454
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:42,510
I think it became a trend to have every

455
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:45,000
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> week or so for the past year you</font>

456
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:46,920
here Oh somebody some<font color="#E5E5E5"> company's computer</font>

457
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,890
with thousands of people's information

458
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:52,350
got stolen and what happens to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

459
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:59,280
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing sometimes I bet</font>

460
00:24:52,350 --> 00:25:01,740
you yes how to resolve the problem well

461
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:04,320
from in the past decade<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were like</font>

462
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:07,320
several solutions for the problem and of

463
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:11,879
course technology evolves and the

464
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:13,860
attacks also<font color="#CCCCCC"> evolved it comes down at</font>

465
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,770
the end to who's responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

466
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:18,659
damage right that's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting point</font>

467
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:23,250
and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into the ATM</font>

468
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:27,870
machines in a little bit but here with a

469
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:30,630
hidden fee or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> your your money's is</font>

470
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:32,760
secure so if you fall like if you get

471
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:35,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">your credit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> card statement or something</font>

472
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,950
and you call your bank and say I didn't

473
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:39,450
buy this of course I'm not going to get

474
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:42,150
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> money right away but eventually you</font>

475
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:45,240
will and it's not going to take it's not

476
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:47,340
too much of a hassle it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be easy</font>

477
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,940
but actually somehow you're paying for

478
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:53,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">it but it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in other places is not</font>

479
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:57,930
exactly how it works they put it like

480
00:25:53,790 --> 00:26:00,389
stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> laws sometimes to protect who the</font>

481
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:03,510
stronger side saying well internet

482
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:05,820
banking actually is just something that

483
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:08,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">we did to facilitate your life it's not</font>

484
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:11,760
our responsibility at all so there are

485
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:14,250
cases and cases and at the ATM part i'm

486
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,800
going to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so the</font>

487
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:22,020
solutions to wrap up the online banking

488
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:25,500
kind of thing solutions is use of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssl as</font>

489
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:28,740
it was nation ssl was going to create a

490
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:33,180
secure tunnel between the end user and

491
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:36,840
the server problem with that the

492
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:40,260
connection is secure there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> doubt</font>

493
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:42,720
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> put like this but when</font>

494
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:46,470
you have bad not bad dns entries but

495
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,870
when you have websites with name or fake

496
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,620
websites with<font color="#E5E5E5"> domain names really close</font>

497
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,750
to the we own

498
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,370
so if you do a title<font color="#CCCCCC"> you fat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fingers</font>

499
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:56,910
something that says instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my bank</font>

500
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:59,669
is my bank 1.com you're going to fall

501
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:03,120
into this server that actually has a

502
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:05,490
valid certificate eventually they're

503
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,409
going to bust this guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> but again the</font>

504
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:09,780
server is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be up for more</font>

505
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:11,700
than a few days so they're gonna your

506
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:15,059
client is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to complain that you</font>

507
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,620
have that it has a bad certificate

508
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:19,410
because it's using a real certificate

509
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,479
and for the guy who paid 200 bucks for

510
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:23,420
the valid certificate that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine this</font>

511
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,210
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get way more money than that</font>

512
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:30,000
the other problem with ssl would be if

513
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:33,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have some sort of malware or</font>

514
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,760
keylogger or some sort of screen capture

515
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:39,330
or click logger so the connection is is

516
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,280
good but at the end the connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

517
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:45,750
the connection but the transaction is

518
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:51,120
compromised somebody's captioning user

519
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:53,550
credentials somehow I've seen this<font color="#CCCCCC"> on in</font>

520
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:57,270
Brazil the second point there some banks

521
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:58,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">they push applications to the client so</font>

522
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:00,960
they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some sort of control</font>

523
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">over the client to make sure the guy is</font>

524
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,660
not doing a bad thing so it is not

525
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:08,730
sending an anti spyware or an

526
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:11,700
anti-malware client is something else

527
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:13,350
but in the same sense but<font color="#CCCCCC"> again I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

528
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,910
like the idea of pushing something two

529
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,649
or getting something<font color="#CCCCCC"> pushed to my</font>

530
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:18,480
machine to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use a service of</font>

531
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:21,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">course we're going to have in the terms</font>

532
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,580
of use and stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I don't</font>

533
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:26,850
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the same thing as</font>

534
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:28,530
pushing something that might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad they</font>

535
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:32,070
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to rant about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people that might</font>

536
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:36,030
be doing bad code for coding for these

537
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:40,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">things or not what else was use captchas</font>

538
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:43,590
which not only perfect saw something not

539
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:46,440
too long ago about this maybe somebody

540
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:48,510
saw we all know that there are 0 CRS

541
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,150
that can we read the CAPTCHA sometimes I

542
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:55,500
cannot read it for anything but the OCR

543
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:58,650
s do but I saw 101 website that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

544
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:00,240
said give me a string and said which one

545
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:04,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the ladders there are not</font>

546
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,059
I don't know a lot letter<font color="#CCCCCC"> a so you have</font>

547
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:08,940
to actually understand you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font>

548
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:11,070
an intelligent answer on that thing I've

549
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:15,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">sown in one website and I thought was</font>

550
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:17,340
really neat simple and neat other

551
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:20,700
solutions the usual ones anti-spam and

552
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:23,428
despite wearing that anti-malware both

553
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,990
for the enterprise and home on

554
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:27,809
enterprises you can have this sort of

555
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:32,070
stuff like in line on the network not

556
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:35,220
only or not or not on the desktops

557
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:37,860
themselves there are some smaller

558
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:40,320
appliances for home so you can see you

559
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:42,360
see that some antivirus vendors they

560
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,210
have known small boxes there are your

561
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:49,229
gateway your access point and also some

562
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:52,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">runs some sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of anti virus or malware</font>

563
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:57,210
and stuff like that didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> try one and I</font>

564
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:58,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know if I want to and I also as</font>

565
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:01,470
part of the solution but now on the

566
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:04,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">banks and of course the really large</font>

567
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:06,030
corporate bank financial institutions

568
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:08,280
they have their response incident

569
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:10,590
response team and stuff like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

570
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:13,620
doing my research I saw that some banks

571
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:15,870
actually outsource their fishing

572
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:17,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">incident response handling to some</font>

573
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:20,729
company that only does that or does that

574
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:23,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">and fantastic and stuff like that but</font>

575
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:26,429
their idea is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take down the offending</font>

576
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:28,110
site so I thought this was there are

577
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:35,720
people making<font color="#E5E5E5"> money with it which is</font>

578
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:35,719
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool on the defensive side yep</font>

579
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:42,379
name they're doing things like you

580
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:44,150
initially set up response questions

581
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:45,890
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will challenge you with the</font>

582
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:48,200
question that's supposedly only you'll

583
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:49,670
know then it will provide you with the

584
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,040
place today your password and they're

585
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:55,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing like random images that you choose</font>

586
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:59,720
which is you know a good idea except you

587
00:30:55,010 --> 00:31:02,990
can just remember this so the context

588
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,340
the comment was there some banks or at

589
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:06,620
least one bank that is doing something

590
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,149
that is like it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenge questions</font>

591
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:11,270
that you create the questions or you

592
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:15,620
upload images and stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

593
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:17,060
the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really good but in a few</font>

594
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:20,719
slides I'm going to get to the problem

595
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:22,669
of this or I'll send<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to a website</font>

596
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,400
that has a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good white paper on</font>

597
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:30,350
how this is not effective and how site

598
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:33,380
key doesn't really protect that so as a

599
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:35,870
cell<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked about that there's always</font>

600
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:37,100
the human factor too so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cell</font>

601
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:41,510
connection is good but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

602
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:44,600
what's behind that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the client computer</font>

603
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:46,460
or in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> clients computer virtual</font>

604
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:52,879
keyboards could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> key logger could be</font>

605
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:55,250
click screen shot loggers psyche was

606
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,140
what we just talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the thing</font>

607
00:31:55,250 --> 00:32:01,640
about upload here the picture of your

608
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:03,080
dog and<font color="#CCCCCC"> here it it works but here</font>

609
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:08,150
explains how to do a man in the middle

610
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:10,100
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so it is cool but another</font>

611
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:12,680
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about SSL and this site</font>

612
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:14,959
key thing I gonna have time to actually

613
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,180
get to the bottom of this that's why I

614
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,770
didn't put on any slide but apparently

615
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:23,570
they're like issues when you have some

616
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:26,389
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ssl proxy in the network so</font>

617
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:28,429
because somehow that has to fake to kind

618
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:30,410
of do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> man-in-the-middle to so you</font>

619
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:32,810
never know maybe the whole solution

620
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:34,460
works but the network admin or the

621
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:37,669
security person responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

622
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:39,290
that appliance didn't do a good job and

623
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:43,570
if that thing gets compromised somebody

624
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:43,570
else could be doing bad stuff with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

625
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:48,320
there's the security card I don't have

626
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good pictures about this but</font>

627
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:54,450
think about what is that is a challenge

628
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:57,870
response card or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a poor man's one-time</font>

629
00:32:54,450 --> 00:33:00,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">password token so my mom has one of</font>

630
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:04,290
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the bank that she uses in</font>

631
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">Brazil has that once a month or I think</font>

632
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:08,668
it depends of course on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the usage too</font>

633
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,490
it's a one-time card password but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has</font>

634
00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:14,640
like 40 passwords so she gets that on

635
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:16,620
the mail and when she does internet

636
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,530
banking well she does but when a user

637
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:21,659
does besides<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pin number that you</font>

638
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,850
know what once you want to do a

639
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,260
transaction is going to ask you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now</font>

640
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:28,770
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this Bank this</font>

641
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:32,010
transfer or dis payment whatever type

642
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:34,350
password number 29 in your card so you

643
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:37,260
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number 29 is this one one two</font>

644
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:39,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">three four then you type 1 2 3</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 this is</font>

645
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:41,850
we're going to revisit this this is also

646
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:48,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">used for ATM transactions which make a</font>

647
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:51,780
really pain in the butt some places use

648
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:55,860
real tokens they're expensive at least

649
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:58,590
in Brazil they're given for free for the

650
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:00,178
high-profile customers so is the guy

651
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:02,250
that actually doesn't even look at his

652
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:06,000
account somebody else the secretary or

653
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:10,580
something does and to be able to use

654
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:15,690
this account you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps use a real</font>

655
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:17,489
token and some other or if the client is

656
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:19,800
willing to pay for it so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

657
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:22,168
do banking and one of you don't want to

658
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,450
use the poor man's version you pay I

659
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:27,418
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember now how much it is some</font>

660
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:30,658
falling out of the financial institution

661
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:32,368
thing here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the US i think AOL started</font>

662
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:35,010
using that several years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

663
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:38,250
know if they still do offer this as a

664
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:41,429
service and they all announced<font color="#E5E5E5"> that not</font>

665
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:43,580
too long ago for five bucks<font color="#CCCCCC"> a month a</font>

666
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,580
thing

667
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:49,100
so that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much it for online</font>

668
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:52,500
banking I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of go back</font>

669
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:56,960
when it matters but talk a little bit

670
00:34:52,500 --> 00:35:00,120
about ATM fraud what is ATM fraud is

671
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:04,740
again take money from somebody else's

672
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:07,230
account or just from the bank so what

673
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:10,500
type of problems do you have let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

674
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:14,220
see if I have this no I don't so what

675
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:17,040
problems do we have card credit credit

676
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:19,740
card stealing and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pin oh the pain is</font>

677
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,210
something that person knows so it's

678
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,759
virtually impossible<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steal know</font>

679
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:25,650
somebody can put a sticker on the card

680
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,880
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it written down on the wallet</font>

681
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:35,580
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something not totally impossible card</font>

682
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:38,820
cloning<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's mag stripes and stuff like</font>

683
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:41,270
that easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> clone you still have to</font>

684
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:44,220
know the pin kind of the same problem

685
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:46,500
fake ATM machines I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a</font>

686
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:50,700
common thing at Def Con few years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font>

687
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:54,450
and it happened a few well it was

688
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:58,259
normally in some other places to fake

689
00:35:54,450 --> 00:36:01,129
ATM machine covers so I know lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

690
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:03,480
people who work like in the Security

691
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:06,060
department's of banks in Brazil not

692
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,470
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with ATMs themselves but they</font>

693
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:10,049
all tell me the same thing before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

694
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:13,169
use use any ATM and now I do to any ATM

695
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:14,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use anywhere you just shake the</font>

696
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,800
thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure the thing doesn't</font>

697
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:18,690
come out in your your hand before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

698
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,640
use it because we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

699
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:30,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff in a few slides that they put fake</font>

700
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:30,620
covers on the on the ATMs yeah

701
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:38,049
it wasn't a KTM the company that

702
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:53,020
providing the ATM decided to customize

703
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:55,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">them so Zacks comment was that was what</font>

704
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:59,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">DEFCON nine or definitely something like</font>

705
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:01,598
that actually wasn't a fake aqui em the

706
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:03,490
company who had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ATM there they</font>

707
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,589
decided to be nice to the conference so

708
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:07,959
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> went to the website to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the contest</font>

709
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:09,609
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> logo contest page and they</font>

710
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:14,160
downloaded all the images there and put

711
00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:14,160
on the ATM so that freaked everybody out

712
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:21,009
hacking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ATM itself there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> several</font>

713
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:25,029
ways to do it one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a video and</font>

714
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:27,220
happen here in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US of course there is</font>

715
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:30,089
like insider information involved with

716
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:32,470
this the other one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard in Brazil is</font>

717
00:37:30,089 --> 00:37:34,150
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is neat in the sense that it</font>

718
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:36,520
doesn't take money out of anybody's

719
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:38,859
account but from the bank<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself because</font>

720
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:41,079
you somebody walks to the ATM machine he

721
00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:44,230
knows exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> a location where there is</font>

722
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:46,420
a debugger port kind of thing on the

723
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:48,880
thing punches a hole there connects a

724
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:50,589
serial cable sends a whole bunch of

725
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,869
commands through some sort of cheap

726
00:37:50,589 --> 00:37:56,259
laptop just serial interface the thing

727
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:59,250
starts spilling money so it's one

728
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,250
another way to do it

729
00:38:08,949 --> 00:38:17,150
they had the default password<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go in a</font>

730
00:38:14,689 --> 00:38:28,459
chain he would change the setting on

731
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:30,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">bills or in the drawer yeah so the</font>

732
00:38:28,459 --> 00:38:33,049
comment was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that not on the big</font>

733
00:38:30,859 --> 00:38:35,170
financial ATM machines but those that

734
00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:38,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">you see on gas stations and stuff</font>

735
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:41,420
somebody had a master<font color="#E5E5E5"> code that just</font>

736
00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:43,729
walked into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the to the ATM punched</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

737
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:45,529
number and change the denomination of

738
00:38:43,729 --> 00:38:47,660
the of the bills that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside that</font>

739
00:38:45,529 --> 00:38:50,229
thing so instead of telling the machine

740
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:52,969
that instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having twenty bucks</font>

741
00:38:50,229 --> 00:38:56,089
twenty bucks bills had five bucks bill

742
00:38:52,969 --> 00:38:57,979
so when you withdraw ten bucks actually

743
00:38:56,089 --> 00:39:00,049
gave you 40 actually I have a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

744
00:38:57,979 --> 00:39:04,640
this that's one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

745
00:39:00,049 --> 00:39:07,430
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video here and what else money</font>

746
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,140
is stealing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spot well that's not</font>

747
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:11,839
so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a problem here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and hopefully</font>

748
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:13,069
stays that way but some places you and

749
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:15,199
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

750
00:39:13,069 --> 00:39:18,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk who pays for the who pays for the</font>

751
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:20,049
damage right white at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Brazil as</font>

752
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:22,848
far as I know why did i do all this

753
00:39:20,049 --> 00:39:24,619
crazy stuff on you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that</font>

754
00:39:22,849 --> 00:39:26,569
special car to take the money and no

755
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:30,049
like the one time password and stuff

756
00:39:26,569 --> 00:39:34,759
like that the law there says<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you</font>

757
00:39:30,049 --> 00:39:37,699
robbed or if a fraud is committed on the

758
00:39:34,759 --> 00:39:40,279
bank premises<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means they can the</font>

759
00:39:37,699 --> 00:39:44,420
bank<font color="#E5E5E5"> is responsible for it if it's</font>

760
00:39:40,279 --> 00:39:48,799
outside that that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> users problem so</font>

761
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:51,349
that's why they made all these really

762
00:39:48,799 --> 00:39:54,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard steps for a normal user to take</font>

763
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:57,079
money out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have the steps in a few</font>

764
00:39:54,499 --> 00:39:58,428
slides and people hijacking that's

765
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:00,199
something really sad that happens not

766
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:02,869
only in Brazil but in Mexico<font color="#CCCCCC"> and other</font>

767
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:04,459
places to you that it's called flash

768
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:05,929
hijacking you're walking on the street

769
00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:07,848
they're like oh come here and they put

770
00:40:05,929 --> 00:40:09,380
you in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a car and they make you take as</font>

771
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:12,799
much money as you can from all your

772
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:15,170
credit cards and ATM cards and stuff

773
00:40:12,799 --> 00:40:16,710
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you have restrictions for</font>

774
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:19,510
example from

775
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:22,390
ten<font color="#E5E5E5"> o'clock at night on you can only</font>

776
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:24,130
take 80 bucks out doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter what</font>

777
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:26,980
your limit is you cannot take more than

778
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:29,440
that which is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really say it's safe</font>

779
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:35,650
but not convenient but that was one of

780
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:43,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">the solutions they found so what's wrong</font>

781
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:47,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this ATM thanks lar right on so</font>

782
00:40:43,569 --> 00:40:49,270
there's fake slot there what else is

783
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:52,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong besides it looks like espresso</font>

784
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:52,950
machine that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not as cross the machine</font>

785
00:40:55,829 --> 00:41:02,500
right on here we go so there's the

786
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:05,098
camera there and the camera looks at the

787
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:07,990
password and whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the person typed</font>

788
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:17,250
the pin<font color="#CCCCCC"> number and whatever else the</font>

789
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:19,750
person typed what is it yeah yeah and

790
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:21,160
then of one so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is collecting</font>

791
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:23,559
all the information from them from the

792
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:26,980
cards and then they take it out later

793
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:28,839
and read offline so in that case was

794
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:34,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">just the this lot thing sometimes they</font>

795
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:40,569
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole cover on top of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so the</font>

796
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:44,740
solutions smart cards still need the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mag</font>

797
00:41:40,569 --> 00:41:48,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">stripe so why I don't know if it's</font>

798
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,990
cloneable or not where's Adam

799
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:02,890
so apparently you can you can clone it

800
00:42:00,249 --> 00:42:04,238
you can get information<font color="#CCCCCC"> from one and put</font>

801
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:07,808
on another one that doesn't have

802
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:10,650
anything compatibility issues I thought

803
00:42:07,809 --> 00:42:14,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">this wouldn't happen but within the same</font>

804
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:16,660
credit card authorization network I try

805
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:20,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use my credit card that had a smart</font>

806
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:22,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">chip on it outside the US and the guy</font>

807
00:42:20,709 --> 00:42:23,828
was freaked out because he put in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

808
00:42:22,029 --> 00:42:26,079
machine and he didn't work i'm like well

809
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:27,400
it's because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a card from the US is</font>

810
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,200
like yeah it should work i'm like yeah

811
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,329
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> crap it should work but it doesn't</font>

812
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,609
this is like no this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a fake card I'm</font>

813
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:36,849
like no it's not a fake heart give me my

814
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:38,680
card back and he swiped and it worked so

815
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:43,420
inside the same network apparently there

816
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:45,399
are compatibility issues but you never

817
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:48,670
know just I put it there because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

818
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:51,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">happened</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to me integration with cell</font>

819
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:53,799
phones some banks<font color="#CCCCCC"> are using not only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

820
00:42:51,759 --> 00:42:57,400
ATM but also for online banking it's

821
00:42:53,799 --> 00:43:00,339
using SMS as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-time password</font>

822
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,650
mechanism so once you register with your

00:43:00,339 --> 00:43:04,599
bank now they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have your cell phone they</font>

00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:06,430
ask you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put your to confirm your cell</font>

or do some online transaction it's going

827

<font color="#E5E5E5">to say we're going to send you this one</font>

829
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:20,609
me this opens a whole can of worms and

830
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:23,680
other big problems might happen right

831
00:43:20,609 --> 00:43:27,009
cell phone banking itself it's happening

832
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:29,589
some places already upon the internet I

833
00:43:27,009 --> 00:43:31,690
found some places in Europe South Africa

834
00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:33,549
New Zealand Brazil is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

835
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:35,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">with it just one bank is doing it in</font>

836
00:43:33,549 --> 00:43:37,869
Japan apparently is doing that for a

837
00:43:35,499 --> 00:43:40,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">while also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found on the internet that's</font>

838
00:43:37,869 --> 00:43:45,479
singular the new AT&T is going to offer

839
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:48,609
that in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. shortly and if you saw</font>

840
00:43:45,479 --> 00:43:51,368
Rodney's talk he mentioned something

841
00:43:48,609 --> 00:43:52,930
about this about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the phones having lots</font>

842
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:55,269
of stuff in the phone in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell phone</font>

843
00:43:52,930 --> 00:44:00,698
<font color="#E5E5E5">itself the whole convergence see thing</font>

844
00:43:55,269 --> 00:44:04,390
that you have phones doing lots of stuff

845
00:44:00,699 --> 00:44:07,810
from multimedia to anything which allows

846
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:12,150
the user to begin to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to install</font>

847
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:15,430
all kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> crap on the phone including</font>

848
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:20,320
maybe bad stuff and so there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to that's one of the things</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to show the steps to take</font>

by amount depending on the time of the

00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:50,770
day and zach is going to love this so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

858
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:52,660
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you so this has this is not</font>

859
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:55,270
too<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's last year's but it's</font>

860
00:44:52,660 --> 00:45:00,970
not implemented yet they're going to be

861
00:44:55,270 --> 00:45:03,730
using the biometric reading on the ATM

862
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:05,680
machines which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's going to</font>

863
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:07,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">be more beneficial for the people to</font>

864
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:11,759
steal the ATM machines for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the price of</font>

865
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:14,080
this but so biometrics to take out money

866
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,540
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds really cool apparently</font>

867
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:19,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's being used in japan already and it</font>

868
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:22,000
works the only thing reading this that i

869
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:25,990
thought was kind of funny and<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the</font>

870
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,700
thing once you get there is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> protect</font>

871
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:29,589
the privacy and personal information of

872
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:31,330
the user the register biometric

873
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:36,460
information itself can be stored in the

874
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:45,009
bank<font color="#CCCCCC"> heart why so you're defeating the</font>

875
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:48,550
whole purpose of it right one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

876
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:50,920
I've seen also<font color="#E5E5E5"> well this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm seeing all</font>

877
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:52,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the place websites now most of the</font>

878
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:55,120
websites have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security thing</font>

879
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:57,490
somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the front page of the bank</font>

880
00:45:55,120 --> 00:46:00,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the bank's website you see something</font>

881
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:03,250
about security some are more are bigger

882
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:06,220
than others some<font color="#E5E5E5"> have really sometimes</font>

883
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:10,410
videos of how to be secure and that's

884
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:12,640
cool but outside of the US I saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

885
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:14,980
which i think is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool stuff for</font>

886
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,200
their powers and awareness kind of thing

887
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:19,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">you see ads on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mag on mainstream</font>

888
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:22,100
magazines on TV even<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

889
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:25,400
boards saying don't fall for<font color="#CCCCCC"> fishing or</font>

890
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:27,890
this is how you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your internet</font>

891
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:30,890
banking and stuff like that so I think

892
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:33,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea but again you're</font>

893
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:37,730
doing this there because it depends who

894
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:39,170
pays for the damage right so taking

895
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:41,410
money in the u.s. everybody knows that

896
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:44,150
insert the card watch the pin number

897
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:49,210
select withdraw take the cash and go

898
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:51,680
home in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Brazil one of the ways is you</font>

899
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:53,750
insert<font color="#CCCCCC"> the card punch the fee number</font>

900
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,910
that you know select the operation

901
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:59,090
withdraw<font color="#CCCCCC"> then is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from your</font>

902
00:46:55,910 --> 00:47:02,270
other password card I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see please</font>

903
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:04,400
type the password number 39 so you go to

904
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:06,530
your car then you look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> one two</font>

905
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:10,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">three four then it asks you to insert</font>

906
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:13,370
the ATM card again which I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

907
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:14,990
why there must be a reason and then you

908
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:17,799
can take the cash and sometimes

909
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:21,350
depending where you are you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

910
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,670
another thing that I saw is insert the

911
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:23,900
card punch the pin number<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it's</font>

912
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:26,240
going to ask you something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else that you</font>

913
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:29,350
know either your month of birth your

914
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:33,140
data for or the year or something else

915
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:34,880
again it's a for us it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I like I</font>

916
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:38,900
feel bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> for my mom to have to take to</font>

917
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,480
go to the ATM sometimes this is a sad

918
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:44,630
story because sometimes i'm a dumbass<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

919
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:46,970
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one time for work for to Caracas</font>

920
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:48,830
and I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any cash on me but I</font>

921
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:51,709
said well any<font color="#CCCCCC"> Airport has an ATM machine</font>

922
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:53,990
right correct walk to the ATM machine

923
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:56,840
put the card bunch of the pin number and

924
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:59,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">then it says please type your ID you're</font>

925
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:03,500
the first three digits of your ID I'm

926
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:06,529
like what id my driver's license my

927
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:08,360
passport my what I know my bank did I

928
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:09,590
have this information I used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> live in</font>

929
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:14,240
another state when I opened my account

930
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:17,240
right end of story<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that i had to find</font>

931
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">another ATM there was nobody even the</font>

932
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:22,189
bank couldn't tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me what I had to do</font>

933
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:26,419
finally I found one that asked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

934
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:28,110
first three digits and I tried 000<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

935
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:31,110
it worked

936
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:34,380
so that means in our ATM cards here that

937
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:37,530
feud is probably blank but at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

938
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:39,270
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not I tried 000 on the ones that</font>

939

five dollar bill but in actuality

1066
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:05,730
getting to the point though

1067
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:20,960
this machine full of twenty dollar bills

1068
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:24,080
into thinking it was will apply dollars

1069
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:28,130
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ATM it was really multiplayer</font>

1070
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:30,740
about just<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter detectives their</font>

1071
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:34,640
suspect it was an untraceable prepaid

1072
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:36,830
debit card so well walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> into another</font>

1073
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:39,379
dark days after the crime was committed

machine to admit all these video videos

1076
00:58:54,920 --> 00:59:00,560
i took from youtube so feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1077
00:58:57,230 --> 00:59:03,290
browse<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so well before the</font>

1078
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:05,330
conclusion so what you can find also<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

1079
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:08,210
the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever the guy type there</font>

1080
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:10,430
is a combination of not only started

1081
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:12,260
code not only<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number there's a</font>

1082
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:13,730
combination of keys that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to press</font>

1083
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:15,740
that puts the machine in programming

1084
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:18,200
mode and one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can</font>

1085
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:20,529
do in programming mode is change the

1086
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:22,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">dumpee denomination of the bills I</font>

1087
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:24,920
wonder I'm pretty sure there is like

1088
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:28,480
some sort of test that spills all the

1089
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:32,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">money out they didn't do that so</font>

1090
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:35,330
conclusion is probably going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1091
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:38,170
worse what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worse is not that</font>

1092
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:41,890
well we're screwed we might but not

1093
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:44,270
necessarily but everything is there's

1094
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:47,810
evolution in everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> so online</font>

1095
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:49,850
banking of course in but here i<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1096
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:53,660
know i hope the talk was informative at

1097
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:55,160
least you showed that outside here some

1098
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:57,859
people they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to go like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a step ahead</font>

1099
00:59:55,160 --> 01:00:01,069
to simply take money out of an ATM just

1100
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:03,250
because of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole law and cultural</font>

1101
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:05,810
differences and stuff like that and

1102
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:09,320
hopefully some places will not change I

1103
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:11,960
mean this isn't a good way for us here

1104
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:14,030
for example it works here hopefully

1105
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:16,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll stay the same and on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

1106
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:17,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">math like I am and travel without cash</font>

1107
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,490
hoping that

1108
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:31,348
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> land</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere and take money out</font>

1109
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:34,140
questions directly in and it wouldn't

1110
01:00:31,349 --> 01:00:40,260
work what it would just copy the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cars</font>

1111
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:42,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I don't see how it off yeah I think</font>

1112
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:45,510
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is so the comment was that he saw</font>

1113
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:59,129
one of the cloning device is kind of

1114
01:00:45,510 --> 01:01:01,970
thing that slid in the slot right same

1115
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:01,970
thing we're different thing

1116
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:11,319
see those pretty

1117
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:14,540
like

1118
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:28,509
true so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the comment was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there yeah the</font>

1119
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:31,180
comment was there some people here<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

1120
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:33,670
saw some devices that would only cloned

1121
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:35,259
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> card like the card wouldn't work but</font>

1122
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:37,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">at that point used you put the card</font>

1123
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:39,460
already he's been the information has

1124
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:41,890
been collected<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it wouldn't work so</font>

1125
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:43,600
that the question was why people do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1126
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:45,069
if they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the pin number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1127
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:47,440
thing is there are places<font color="#CCCCCC"> there you go</font>

1128
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:49,840
like even starbucks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Walgreens and</font>

1129
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:52,000
stuff like that up to a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount</font>

1130
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:56,670
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a pin number so that's</font>

1131
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,670
for the small kind of stuff this is done

1132
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:19,619
so the thing another comment from zach

1133
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:21,390
