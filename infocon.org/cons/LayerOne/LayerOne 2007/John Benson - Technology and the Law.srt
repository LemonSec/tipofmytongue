00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,029
I

2
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,420
well good morning everybody everybody

00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:06,550
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the back excellent my name is</font>

00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,610
jon benson and today<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

5
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:11,710
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the gap between technology</font>

6
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:13,870
and the law and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a</font>

7
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:17,110
little bit about whether it's getting

8
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:18,370
bigger getting smaller first we're going

9
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the fundamental</font>

10
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:25,150
differences between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two worlds of</font>

11
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:26,800
technology and the law and why<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

12
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:31,180
differences lead to kind of where we are

13
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:33,190
today with uncertainty in how the law is

14
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,180
going to treat things then we're going

15
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:40,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">to take a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at some perceptions and</font>

16
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:43,540
adoption of Technology and security

17
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:45,520
within the legal community then we're

18
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,670
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Julia</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maro trial</font>

19
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,240
and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens when you</font>

20
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:54,070
have attorneys on both sides that don't

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,520
at least have a working knowledge of

22
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:59,589
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

23
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,170
and actually find the facts the way that

24
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:04,149
they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be and then if we have time</font>

25
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,740
at the end I will talk a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

26
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:09,000
about what happened last week with the

27
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:12,069
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the release of the HD DVD</font>

33
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:30,670
fact if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were here at the legal talk</font>

34
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,830
yesterday and heard about going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

35
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,329
stacks and stacks of documents saying

36
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,360
whether or not something is responsive

37
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:41,020
or not that's my job right now and it's

38
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,360

more<font color="#CCCCCC"> details on that I have resume as</font>

43

44
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:02,610
right now well first let's talk about

45
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:06,269
the differences between technology and

46
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:09,160
the legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> community as we all know here</font>

47
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:13,860
technology becomes more advanced

48
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:17,470
at every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what what may be</font>

49
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:21,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">state-of-the-art</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one day is certainly</font>

50
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:25,600
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next and growth and development</font>

51
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:28,590
are encouraged and what the how does

52
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:32,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> contrast with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the legal world well</font>

53
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:35,640
sweeping changes in the law are actually

54
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:39,700
extremely rare it's a common

55
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:43,540
misconception that courts can just

56
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:45,970
simply overturn previous decisions with

57
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:49,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">the exception of Brown versus Board of</font>

58
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:52,359
Education which ended segregation

59
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:55,809
usually you you will not see that and if

60
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:58,360
you do it is a very big<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal in in the</font>

61
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:03,160
legal community<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet the law is slow to</font>

62
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:05,290
react to<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes and I've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another it</font>

63
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,930
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pates things that are new and</font>

64
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:11,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">different the legal community is always</font>

65
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:15,190
very slow on the uptake of new issues

66
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:18,220
and we know that just now the Federal

67
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:20,370
Rules of Civil Procedure have officially

68
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,440
recognized electronic discovery and

69
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,700
codified it that's all I will say today

70
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,630
about the Federal Rules of Civil

71
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:30,159
Procedure to keep you all<font color="#E5E5E5"> week so why</font>

72
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,050
can't the lobby different this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

73
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,660
the questions that I hear a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot from</font>

74
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,760
people is is well isn't there something

75
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,820
that we can do to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

76
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,469
better well the common law system which

77
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:46,270
has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around for thousands of years</font>

78
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:50,110
is very stable<font color="#E5E5E5"> it creates laws that are</font>

79
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:53,440
not in flux unlike the<font color="#CCCCCC"> civil system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

80
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:56,530
in the in continental Europe where you

81
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:01,510
can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two seemingly identical sets of</font>

82
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:03,520
facts and two separate decisions here in

83
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,520
the US and in other common law

84
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,969
jurisdictions you can very easily

85
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,690
predict what will happen in a future

86
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:15,960
case based on what has happened before

87
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:20,140
changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the law are very slow and</font>

88
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:22,030
methodical<font color="#E5E5E5"> every case that comes to an</font>

89
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,449
appellate court answers one very

90
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,960
specific

91
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:29,110
question and from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one specific</font>

92
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,239
question the one specific answer there's

93
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,460
usually another question that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be</font>

94
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,240
asked but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the courts will not deal with</font>

95
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:41,008
that they only deal with things that

96
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:44,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to them so what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does this create</font>

97
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:48,180
when you bring together technology on

98
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:51,009
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> law on the other well</font>

99
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:54,969
the way we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't know how the</font>

100
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:59,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">how the law will treat many aspects of</font>

101
00:05:54,969 --> 00:06:01,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology and and security issues for a</font>

102
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:05,349
couple different<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons first in order</font>

103
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:08,439
for very settled upon law to be created

104
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:10,830
it has to go through the system and to

105
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:15,099
actually reach an appellate court of

106
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:17,020
some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> and second of all a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

107
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:18,878
cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a lot of factual situations</font>

108
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:23,799
haven't even been brought up at the

109
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:29,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">trial level so until those happen then</font>

110
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:33,610
the questions will<font color="#E5E5E5"> remain well let's</font>

111
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:35,949
turn now to how attorneys have adopted

112
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,740
technology and what some of their

113
00:06:35,949 --> 00:06:39,969
perceptions are of it and i will say

114
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:44,409
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about today</font>

115
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:49,089
is merely anecdotal evidence and things

116
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:52,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">that i have observed in my own area and</font>

117
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:54,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">i have no doubt that in many other parts</font>

118
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,209
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> country attorneys may be</font>

119
00:06:54,659 --> 00:07:00,009
considerably more savvy but in Middle

120
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:04,899
America these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font>

121
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:07,060
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I notice well who are we talking</font>

122
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:09,669
about when we bring up the the legal

123
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:13,719
community most attorneys don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

124
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:17,378
deep understanding of<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology they</font>

125
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:20,080
simply will will use it but really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

126
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:22,569
understand it and part of the reason why

127
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,729
is that a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> attorneys since they do</font>

128
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:26,979
bill hourly they would much rather spend

129
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:28,539
their time billing hours instead of

130
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:32,110
figuring out how to use their computer

131
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:35,409
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is fine then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the bench</font>

132
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:36,330
and judges as you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

133
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:38,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">worse</font>

134
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:41,800
they you know they reach a certain point

135
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:45,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">and have lots of support staff that</font>

136
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,960
understands all the technology also

137
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,080
attorneys come from very diverse

138
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,359
backgrounds you have people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

139
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,789
undergraduate degrees<font color="#CCCCCC"> in political</font>

140
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,880
science you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some that do have</font>

141
00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:00,220
backgrounds in science and engineering

142
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,890
but what I've noticed is most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

143
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,980
good number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those individuals get</font>

00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:25,420
that attorneys have a very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> strong</font>

to work very well together whenever you

are using this technology so much you

201
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:49,870
have an obligation<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep things secret</font>

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't you aren't careful and you</font>

very much at all in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is attorneys</font>

205
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,090
of course that brought us this message

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you see at the bottom of many</font>

saying destroy all<font color="#CCCCCC"> copies of this</font>

210
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:13,240

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,970
right on that and start scrubbing off my

easy to implement especially for small

217
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:33,990
practices and it's the small practices

218
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:36,670
that really are at a greater risk for

219

breaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rules of professional</font>

because i had encrypted my message that

then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> department of homeland security</font>

and NSA would be then paying attention

issues of a very broad range and usually

00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:25,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">substitute teacher who came in to a</font>

00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:28,000
school in Connecticut<font color="#E5E5E5"> and during the day</font>

289
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,790
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> she was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there she started getting</font>

290
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,970
popups on her computer and those pop-ups

291
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:35,860
had pornography on them and throughout

292
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">the course of the day some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

293
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,880
students in the class came up towards

294
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:46,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">the computer and saw some of the</font>

295
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:48,939
pornography on there and oddly<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough</font>

296
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:53,950
these these were not six seven eight

297
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:56,380
year olds these were 11 12 year olds the

298
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:58,150
the local prosecutor decided that a good

299
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:02,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">use of resources would be to prosecute</font>

300
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:05,740
this this lady and let's first take a

301
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:09,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at the statute that she was charged</font>

302
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:11,530
under because there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

303
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:13,750
willful blindness it seems to me on the

304
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:17,290
part of the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> community who came</font>

305
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:19,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">to her defense so vocally as to you know</font>

306
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:21,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">what was she actually charged with</font>

307
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,579
because we have to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at that</font>

308
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:28,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">before we go making judgments on what</font>

309
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:31,830
the jury itself found the

310
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:35,550
the statute said that you could be

311
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:37,770
punished if you willfully or unlawfully

312
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:40,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">caused a child under</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the city under the</font>

00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:42,600
age of 16<font color="#CCCCCC"> years old to be placed in a</font>

314
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,060
situation where the morals of that child

315
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:50,850
are likely to be impaired that's what we

316
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:56,219
like to call a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big statute and willful</font>

317
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:59,550
means intentionally or deliberately it's

318
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:02,460
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a negligent statute some of the some</font>

319
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:04,790
of the coverage in the local paper made

320
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,020
it seem that that she should have been

321
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:09,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">punished because she didn't act</font>

322
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,920
reasonably in protecting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> children</font>

323
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,419
she<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't turn off the monitor she</font>

324
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:16,500
didn't jerk the plug out on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> computer</font>

325
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:18,839
and well we all understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to realized that there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

there who<font color="#CCCCCC"> have seen the warning from</font>

windows all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time that it is now safe</font>

329
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,930
to turn off your computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that a lot</font>

330
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">of people assume that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you don't see</font>

00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:35,760
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> little message then you can't turn</font>

332
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:37,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">off the computer so well well yes it</font>

333
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,050
does seem very logical to to us and

334
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:43,080
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> two parts the media to just</font>

335
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:45,240
shut off<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitor it's largely irrelevant</font>

336
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:50,520
under the statute that she was charged

337
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:52,410
under so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a take a look at</font>

338
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,750
some of the highlights from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trial</font>

339
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:57,930
transcript the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the local newspaper</font>

340
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,580
was good enough to release the the trial

341
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:02,190
transcript for everyone to take a look

342
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">at here are some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the quotes on here</font>

343
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:07,470
take them directly from the trial

344
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">transcript from the prosecutor were</font>

345
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,220
there any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other images that had been</font>

346
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:14,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">placed on your hard drive on that day</font>

347
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:18,650
before you at least saw it you saw at

348
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:22,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">least in the file format what is that</font>

349
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:29,160
seriously then did she log on to any

350
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:31,080
programs<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and and the there are many</font>

351
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunities to kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of laugh as we</font>

352
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:36,480
were going through here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure that</font>

353
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:39,530
the prosecutor was as giddy as I was 22

354
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,430
to site this<font color="#E5E5E5"> website in open court</font>

355
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:42,450
specifically to what I'm pointing to

356
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:45,530
hear my understand

357
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:47,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">is that this vaginal cumshots calm</font>

358
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:52,160
specifically this website again was

359
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:52,159
access to that pc in mr. naps classroom

360
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:01,290
now we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the defense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attorney</font>

361
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:04,020
and the defense<font color="#CCCCCC"> attorney</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case</font>

362
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:08,610
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed to do as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much as he</font>

363
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:13,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">possibly could to to help mr. marrow out</font>

364
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:18,120
and keep her out of jail and it's it's

365
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:20,910
as far as trial advocacy goes and the

366
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,790
techniques that that we all are trained

367
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:27,240
to use in school I didn't see very many

368
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:29,010
of them in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> case at all but that's</font>

369
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,850
beside the point that's very different

370
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:35,160
talk these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the questions</font>

371
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:37,560
where any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the adware spyware parasite</font>

372
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,710
and viruses updated on or before october

373
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:43,800
19th which is when this happened once

374
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:47,700
again what and that that was that was

375
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:55,950
actually a question to the school's head

376
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:58,590
of IT yeah i think it was no so and then

377
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:00,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally in the closing argument as if we</font>

378
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,669
couldn't figure this out before after

379
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:04,830
reading 340 pages of the trial

380
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:07,110
transcript he comes out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the jury and</font>

381
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:13,139
says I'm completely computer illiterate

382
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:15,780
and well well that may kind of bring the

383
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:19,800
attorney down to the level of the jury

384
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:22,889
and make them sympathetic to him and his

385
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:25,230
client<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not creating good law</font>

386
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,280
that's that's that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> good advocacy</font>

387
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,770
to say that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are completely</font>

388
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:32,940
illiterate in the subject that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are</font>

389
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:35,639
litigating well let's take a<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font>

390
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:38,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of the pitfalls in the handling of</font>

391
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,980
the evidence first of all when you when

392
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,899
the reports came to the principal and

393
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,170
the superintendent of the school they

394
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,870
sent the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the head of IT to check out and</font>

395
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:51,750
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what happened did he first go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

396
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:53,370
to the server and<font color="#E5E5E5"> check the logs no he</font>

397
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">went right to the computer and opened up</font>

398
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,039
the temporary<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet files and saw</font>

399
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,479
what happened

400
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:02,460
or on top of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the computer stayed in</font>

401
00:21:00,479 --> 00:21:04,710
the classroom and was in<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to be</font>

402
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:09,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">used for more than a week before it was</font>

403
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:11,729
seized by the police and all that

404
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:16,769
evidence was still allowed to to come

405
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:19,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the trial the police investigator</font>

406
00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:20,940
was asked this question did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you examine</font>

407
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:23,879
the hard drive for spyware viruses or

408
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:30,419
parasites whatever parasites are and the

409
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:34,320
answer was was no it wasn't all he did

410
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:36,539
was take a look and see what images and

411
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,668
what websites had been<font color="#E5E5E5"> stored in the</font>

412
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:42,749
temporary<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet files and he in the</font>

413
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:45,419
history that was all know kind of virus

414
00:21:42,749 --> 00:21:50,909
scan note me note know kind of scanning

415
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:54,320
on the computer whatsoever and in

416
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:56,940
considering that the statute<font color="#CCCCCC"> says that</font>

417
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,399
she had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to willfully and intentionally</font>

418
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:03,479
access these websites he completely

419
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:06,590
ignored the the possibility that that

420
00:22:03,479 --> 00:22:10,979
this could have happened unintentionally

421
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:13,830
was that his job um yeah I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I</font>

422
00:22:10,979 --> 00:22:16,080
mean if you if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be doing</font>

423
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:21,289
forensics on a hard drive but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

424
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:23,699
to collect all the information well the

425
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:26,669
prosecutors are required to give over

426
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:29,879
any exculpatory evidence to a defendant

427
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:38,450
and they certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't do so in this</font>

428
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:43,320
case um I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it certainly</font>

429
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:44,909
certainly underhanded and and then say

430
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,769
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will about attorneys about you</font>

431
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:50,700
know underhanded acts of attorneys<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I</font>

432
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:53,269
think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just pure ignorance on</font>

433
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,269
their part

434
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:03,610
right yeah

435
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:16,930
the cross-examination is is a complete

436
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,639
mess I personally I probably could have

437
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:20,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">done the cross-examination</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in about</font>

438
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,980
three sentences and and been done with

439
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:28,810
it and it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of drags on and on</font>

440
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:30,160
and on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and no real good facts come</font>

441
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,629
out of the cross-examination of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

442
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:40,410
individual as far as impeaching the

443
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:43,150
evidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they had yeah yeah Ollie</font>

444
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:44,170
they check the the filtering so they

445
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:46,720
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> websites were</font>

446
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:50,530
accessed but they didn't see the any of

447
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,880
that but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> now now that we talked</font>

448
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,950
about checking the checking the logs

449
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,620
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the individual that was</font>

450
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:58,510
in charge of computers there the

451
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,909
district and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he very clearly said this</font>

452
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:03,670
in court the district runs Windows 95

453
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:06,400
and windows 98 machines and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font>

454
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:09,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">a couple years ago they only had</font>

455
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,280
antivirus protection no kind of other

456
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:16,690
anti-malware protection on there at all

457
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:20,860
and he<font color="#CCCCCC"> did say that there was filtering</font>

458
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:23,140
software installed district-wide but

459
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:26,679
they didn't update it in fact they

460
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:28,870
didn't renew their license and it's it's

461
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:31,660
unclear<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me and front from the trial</font>

462
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:34,750
transcript it's it's it's murky as to

463
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:37,180
whether the filtering software stopped

464
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:40,750
working when that when the license ran

465
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:45,040
out but he clearly said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it wasn't</font>

466
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:47,050
updated and had he<font color="#E5E5E5"> updated the software</font>

467
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,350
like he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to and done his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> job</font>

468
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:52,060
then none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these websites could have</font>

469
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:57,669
been accessed either intentionally or

470
00:24:52,060 --> 00:25:00,330
unintentionally this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question to</font>

471
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:02,350
the head of IT for the school district

<font color="#CCCCCC">internet that yet but</font>

476
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:23,050
so why was some of the evidence excluded

477
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:26,360
and what happened and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all so it</font>

478
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:28,930
kind of I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I put this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the security</font>

they were angry that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a just a</font>

00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:38,620
procedural technicality that kept a lot

what evidence is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be presented</font>

is not just a technical a technicality

exchange the evidence you know what's

488
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:58,639

objecting the evidence because he didn't

497

have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a chance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see what was going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

effectively cross-examine on evidence

500
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:34,220
that was just then being brought to his

preclude him from saying adware or

that he believed that that the this

510
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:07,280
happened unintentionally on the part of

511
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:10,060
the defendant and in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> the prosecutor</font>

512
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:13,580
in a pool of tremendous trial advocacy

513
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:17,840
was was cross-examining doing a doing a

514
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:21,139
recross of the expert witness and he

515
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,750
asked him straight out what is your

516
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,370
conclusion about this case I don't know

517
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,680
if you know anything about

518
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:28,310
cross-examination but the idea just

519
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">asking an open-ended</font>

520
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,940
question like that you shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

521
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,940
because you don't know what's going to

522
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:37,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of the the the witnesses mouth</font>

523
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:39,080
and the expert did exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what he</font>

524
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:40,669
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have and he said it wasn't her</font>

525
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:45,290
fault it was caused<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the adware and</font>

526
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:50,090
spyware so his conclusion did<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font>

527
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:52,820
court and was heard by the jury but

528
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:57,520
let's talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the expert he was</font>

529
00:27:52,820 --> 00:28:01,460
extremely<font color="#CCCCCC"> rude to the judge and and</font>

530
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:04,090
spouted off on numerous instances that

531
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:07,370
he thought what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was happening was wrong</font>

532
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:10,189
after a long drawn-out objection he was

533
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:11,479
asked a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he told the person</font>

534
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was asking the question I don't</font>

535
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,650
think I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer that and the judge</font>

536
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:17,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">even though you're you're reading it you</font>

537
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:19,610
can tell that in a very fuming voice

538
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,169
said you answer the questions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

539
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:26,659
asked I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you if you can't and</font>

540
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:29,540
the expert witness certainly didn't do a

541
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:33,590
very good job of building any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

542
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:40,040
rapport<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jury or with</font>

543
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:43,220
the judge so who do we blame for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

544
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:47,420
wrongful conviction here blame everybody

545
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:49,820
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you ask me we blame the district for</font>

546
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:53,540
not maintaining their technology

547
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:55,750
correctly we've laid in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state for</font>

548
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:58,430
bringing this case in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first place</font>

549
00:28:55,750 --> 00:29:00,590
it's in my opinion it was absolutely

550
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:03,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">ridiculous to use so many of the state's</font>

551
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:08,899
resources to wrongfully prosecute

552
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:11,440
someone the defense<font color="#CCCCCC"> attorney was at by</font>

553
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:15,140
his own admission computer illiterate

554
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:18,920
there he had<font color="#E5E5E5"> very little business on</font>

555
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:21,140
handling this case in my opinion and the

556
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:25,640
expert as well because the expert did

557
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:27,140
not make his materials available to the

558
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:31,250
defense attorneys that I can give to the

559
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:33,710
prosecutor an expert witness needs to be

560
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:37,070
an expert at being a witness needs to

561
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:39,530
understand that we get the we get my

562
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:41,330
testimony out ahead of time we make sure

563
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:44,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">that everything is set to</font>

564
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:46,610
and you certainly don't yell at the

565
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:48,590
judge and and tell the judge that what

566
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:51,110
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing is an airplane</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crash</font>

567
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:59,419
which is what he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the judge</font>

568
00:29:51,110 --> 00:30:01,250
during an objection that didn't happen

569
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:05,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the trial it may have happened</font>

570
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:09,350
afterwards but know that that I didn't

571
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:12,290
see that in the transcript so the

00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:20,060
it warranted there was a lot of shouting

that that that this was a failure of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

look at the statutes and and and the

00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,130
procedure and have a respect for the

579

00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:44,600
how you got there it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably a better</font>

against attorneys and the courts isn't

593
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:24,439
going to do any good<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all well now</font>

594
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:27,200
let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what was the verdict</font>

595
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:32,090
she was<font color="#E5E5E5"> convicted of four counts of the</font>

597
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:38,750
believe the sentence was pending but she

598
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:40,250
faced up to 40 years in prison<font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe</font>

599
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:43,570
there will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> appeals cup forthcoming I</font>

600
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:49,390
don't know what I on what basis though

601
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:51,740
it ineffective assistance of counsel is

602
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:54,950
it's harder to bring than you would

603
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:57,649
think and him saying that

he is computer illiterate on its own I

don't believe would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to qualify</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">as ineffective assistance of counsel</font>

wouldn't would not render him

613
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:32,840
ineffective well then let's turn to what

614
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:38,000
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> last week and the the release</font>

615
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:40,939
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hd-dvd process and key well it</font>

616
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,269
was released weeks ago but it kind of

617
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:47,200
came to a head last week whenever<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

618
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:50,630
appeared on the website dead calm and

619
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:53,630
dig received a takedown notice under the

620
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:55,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">MCA and they had a choice name do we</font>

621
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:57,919
take it<font color="#E5E5E5"> down or do we fight the takedown</font>

622
00:32:55,610 --> 00:33:00,699
notice they did what they thought was

623
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:04,940
right in that situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and took it down</font>

624
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:07,010
they did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not however explain to their</font>

625
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:09,769
user base the reasons that they were

626
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:11,899
taking it down and they did not try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

627
00:33:09,769 --> 00:33:14,419
justify their actions saying we are

628
00:33:11,899 --> 00:33:16,820
legally obligated to do this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

629
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:20,570
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to do well the user</font>

630
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:23,240
base of digg com then decided that this

631
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:25,668
was censorship and this was wrong and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

632
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,100
was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> constitutional issue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and therefore</font>

633
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:31,039
decided to flood the website with the

634
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:34,070
key everywhere and the key has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

635
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:37,158
posted<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so many places on the internet</font>

636
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:39,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that one of the stats</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

637
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:45,909
read yesterday was that the key has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

638
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:48,289
accessed at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> million</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> times but</font>

639
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:51,080
let's take a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the facts and we</font>

640
00:33:48,289 --> 00:33:54,139
weathered what dig chose to do was

641
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:57,289
correct dissemination of this key is a

642
00:33:54,139 --> 00:33:59,629
violation of the DMCA whether or not you

643
00:33:57,289 --> 00:34:02,000
think it is ridiculous that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can you</font>

644
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:05,419
can you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you copyright works or</font>

645
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,359
whether or not the DMCA is is good law

646
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:09,230
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion is absolutely not</font>

647
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:12,199
if

648
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:16,070
is the law that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have the Digital</font>

649
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:19,638

650
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:22,879
notices were valid and it's not it's not

651
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:28,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">a First Amendment issue if you're going</font>

652
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:30,049
on to a privately-run website and you

653
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:31,669
decide that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the and they decide that</font>

654
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:34,399
they object to something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font>

00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:36,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing they can do whatever they want</font>

656
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:41,118
this is the we're private parties here

657
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:43,690
you're not you're not entitled by virtue

658
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,429
of it being on the internet to to do

659
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:47,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything that you choose just because</font>

660
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:50,379
you're on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet and sitting</font>

661
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,379
behind a keyboard

662
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:09,359
oh no i 100% agree that's ridiculous but

663
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:12,720
it is a component of something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

664
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:18,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">be used to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> circumvent copy protection</font>

665
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:20,910
and it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> a violation and be from</font>

666
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:22,950
the way I look at it is what an

667
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:26,848
individual wants to do if i wanted to

668
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:29,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">post the key on my website and in the</font>

669
00:35:26,849 --> 00:35:33,329
spirit of social of civil disobedience

670
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:38,069
then that's perfectly fine but to expect

671
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:42,839
a third party to acquiesce to something

672
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:48,359
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> believe and therefore put put</font>

673
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:52,980
their financials at risk is completely

674
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:58,770
arrogant and completely immature and you

675
00:35:52,980 --> 00:36:01,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think that I I think dig</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">have handled it better what they should</font>

00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:10,560
have done was<font color="#CCCCCC"> explained why they had to</font>

679
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:14,069
do it and then see what happened and if

680
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:18,660
in this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with the with</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the new user content driven sites that</font>

00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:23,160
that it's it's something they're going

<font color="#E5E5E5">to comply with the law they're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

687
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:39,000
put you at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the BRIT at risk then feel</font>

688
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:40,950
free to pull the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug on site it as soon</font>

689
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">as it just got started filling up and</font>

690
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:47,669
filling up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and filling up they could</font>

691
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:49,890
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> just jerked the plug so but let's</font>

692
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:54,150
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reality on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other side</font>

693
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:57,960
I'm certainly not defending the the the

694
00:36:54,150 --> 00:37:08,280
takedown notice or anybody acting under

695

<font color="#CCCCCC">the dmca the the the aacs needs to</font>

696
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:14,690
realize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is Pandora's box</font>

697
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:16,730
once it is out it is out and there's a

698
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:19,660
lot of talk of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them tracking down all</font>

699
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:21,770
the individuals that<font color="#E5E5E5"> posted the key and</font>

700
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:24,049
taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> action against</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them whether it's</font>

701
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:27,770
whether it's a stern letter or whether

702
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:30,830
it's a dmca takedown notice or filing

703
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:33,290
suit that's not going to help the

704
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:36,980
situation and it's not going to make

705
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:39,590
users worldwide feel any better about

706
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:43,490
the technology being in existence and it

707
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:46,160
will just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of rile up the crowd even</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">more but user-driven sites need to</font>

709
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,240
realize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they are served with</font>

00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:53,540
something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and they do plan on</font>

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:56,839
complying they need to have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font>

712
00:37:53,540 --> 00:38:00,430
plan in place to<font color="#CCCCCC"> deal with that and to</font>

713
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:03,730
deal with a user base that is going to

714
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:07,990
have a have a good amount of backlash

715
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:07,990
against that action in the first place

716
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:14,540
well the fundamental issues separating

717
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:16,820
law on technology that we talked about

718
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:19,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">the beginning the fact that the common</font>

719
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:22,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">law system is very incremental and very</font>

720
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:25,070
slow to respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus technology that</font>

721
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:29,930
changes day to day it's it's not going

722
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:32,980
to go away and we certainly don't need

723
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:36,350
more laws we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need legislators</font>

724
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:42,560
writing<font color="#CCCCCC"> any more laws like the DMCA or</font>

725
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:45,190
laws that are incredibly vague we need

to educate themselves on how to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

731
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:57,109
properly we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to educate themselves</font>

732
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:59,960
on how it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you go into court</font>

733
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:02,530
and admit in front of everyone that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

734
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:07,580
are completely computer illiterate and

735
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:11,000
we really need stronger advocates in the

736
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:13,790
courts that have technical backgrounds

737
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,950
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into trial work the evasion</font>

738
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:18,610
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of money intellectual</font>

739
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:22,870
property not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lie about that but</font>

740
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:25,660
the real need at this point is in

741
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:29,410
building the law from the

742
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:29,410
so are<font color="#E5E5E5"> there any questions</font>

743
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:48,960
um I I've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> rumors of that um I</font>

744
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:52,050
don't know if it will or not i mean it's

745
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,670
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that young attorneys are</font>

746
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:56,190
doing it probably won't make much of a

747
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:57,800
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that that certainly</font>

748
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:00,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">there will be more and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

751
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:07,290
completely ridiculous and completely

752
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:08,940
ineffective but at the same time when an

753
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:11,460
attorney goes to work for a firm that

754
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:13,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">represents the recording industry you've</font>

advocating the position of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the client</font>

764
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:50,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">know they got the takedown notice and</font>

765
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:53,900
they took<font color="#E5E5E5"> it down and then lost the</font>

766
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:57,480
fight against the users and said you

767
00:40:53,900 --> 00:41:00,450
will go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and try and fight this but</font>

768
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:08,450
it this is this is something completely

769
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:08,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">new and civil certainly civil</font>

770
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:29,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that that argument</font>

00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:31,920
certainly would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be made and it's</font>

772
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:33,720
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pretty good one but the</font>

773
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,250
argument on the other side is hey you

774
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:41,069
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have pulled the plug in sight once</font>

775
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:47,070
you saw what was happening that's your

776
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:48,990
own dated that's up in the air i I don't

777
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:54,119
know haven't put a lot of thought into

778
00:41:48,990 --> 00:42:01,160
that what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's it certainly</font>

779
00:41:54,119 --> 00:42:01,160
would all right

780
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:29,130
I don't know I would it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to</font>

781
00:42:27,869 --> 00:42:31,920
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the operator whether they're</font>

782
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:33,900
willing to bear that risk or not they

783
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,720
know that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> takeout notices are coming</font>

784
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,950
and clearly the organization has made it

785
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:42,359
clear that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to keep them</font>

786
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:44,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">coming and just like with rotating</font>

787
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:48,540
documents if you can reasonably

788
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:49,710
anticipate litigation it's reasonable to

789
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:52,950
expect that you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font>

790
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:56,010
takedown notice so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fight</font>

791
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:58,259
it go right ahead but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time</font>

792
00:42:56,010 --> 00:43:01,589
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be realistic and you've</font>

793
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:05,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">got to realize that eventually over a</font>

794
00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:09,750
number of years the law will fit with

795
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:13,859
reality I think we're seeing the reality

796
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:17,099
kind of catch up with with the idea that

797
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:19,470
leaving your access point unencrypted

798
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:21,270
and open to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world as a defense</font>

799
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:25,259
probably isn't going to be that

800
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:27,750
effective you know trying to get cute

801
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:30,050
with the law doesn't work out well for

802
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:30,050
anybody

803
00:43:35,509 --> 00:43:46,859
yes yes so big bear somebody's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

804
00:43:42,479 --> 00:43:48,538
have to bear the expense<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right well</font>

805
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:51,989
I thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> all for coming out early in</font>

806
00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:54,920
the morning and i'll let major get up

807
00:43:51,989 --> 00:43:54,920
here and get his talk started
