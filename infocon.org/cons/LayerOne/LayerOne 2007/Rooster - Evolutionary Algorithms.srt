1
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:37,089
okay all right um thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font>

2
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,739
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about a basically an</font>

3
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,239
introduction to evolutionary algorithms

4
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:42,550
and we'll try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

5
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,019
applications of it unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

6
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,890
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a clock back there so if i</font>

7
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:50,260
run long or short then we'll blame noid

8
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:51,430
I'm rooster I used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give talks a long</font>

9
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:55,239
time ago I don't know if anybody

10
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:57,579
remembers me I mostly focus on internet

11
00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:00,968
security but on the side I dealt with

12
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:04,000
viruses and bacteria type simulations

13
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:07,030
and worms and now I'm in school for

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,560
mathematical biology so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a this</font>

15
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">is actually the very big interest to me</font>

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,789
and I mine and basically coming learn

17
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,440
from this talk is not really so much

18
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:15,820
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say like this is how you write</font>

19
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,619
an evolutionary algorithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> write this how</font>

20
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,000
you write genetic algorithm it's more<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

21
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,340
put an interest in here<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how they</font>

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,330
work and what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do most of the</font>

23
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,300
work in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> area is completely</font>

24
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:27,340
theoretical it sometimes even hard to

25
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:30,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">find a problem that that can be solved</font>

26
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,450
by some of these solutions but in the

27
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">end it will it should get you thinking</font>

28
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:39,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">about possible uses or just you know</font>

29
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:41,920
move in that direction so a quick

30
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:44,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">overview um evolutionary computing is</font>

31
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,989
basically an optimization heuristic

32
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:48,970
algorithm and what heuristic algorithm

33
00:01:46,989 --> 00:01:51,759
basically means<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that it's a way of</font>

34
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:54,160
solving a problem by learning and not

35
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,530
expecting to reach the absolute best

36
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,970
solution its goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to get the closest</font>

37
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,550
is humanly<font color="#E5E5E5"> earned as computer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ly</font>

38
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:03,099
possible without actually being

39
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:05,170
necessarily having to reach the top and

40
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:08,050
we are doing this using biological

41
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,300
concepts somebody at some point said

42
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:12,640
that biology is nothing more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

43
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,470
algorithm looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> through a certain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

44
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,529
of space to determine a solution in the

45
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:19,120
our cases solution of survival so can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

46
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,410
use them can we emulate these kind of

47
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,640
things to be able to solve our own

48
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:26,079
problems so first we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the coast</font>

49
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,059
things in computer science terms because

50
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,340
all of this in the end comes down to

51
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,620
computer science and computer scientists

52
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,900
basically when you're in you're in

53
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,040
school getting your CS degree the

54
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,280
biggest thing they teach you in<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

55
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,220
classes is how to make your problems map

56
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,250
to something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

57
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,440
can solve how to base how to create

58
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,360
these kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of solution space and so one</font>

59
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,329
case we have what's called a search

60
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,640
space and a spur search space is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

61
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:58,040
a collection of all possible solutions

62
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,589
it's also includes a concept of piece of

63
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">crap also includes a concept of distance</font>

64
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,270
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the possible solutions so</font>

65
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,250
you can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of picture it as a big map</font>

66
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:09,050
as an example when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> brought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

67
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,910
a protein search so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

68
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">find some kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a protein let's say</font>

69
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:13,549
you're trying to have one that will

70
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:17,750
develop an antibody or something like

71
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:19,790
that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a particular virus there are 20</font>

72
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:22,700
different amino acids if anybody knows

73
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:24,260
that creating proteins so you have to be

74
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to combine all these amino acids in</font>

75
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,670
such a way to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create this this</font>

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,080
protein well that's infinite obviously

77
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,429
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's an infinite search space</font>

78
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,860
and it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> impossible to go through</font>

79
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:37,010
so even restricting it down say to a

80
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:40,010
chain of 100 min glasses or less strict

81
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:42,260
that down even with such a search space

82
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:46,160
you're still looking at a vast a huge

83
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,720
amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> data try to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through and say</font>

84
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">for instance we represent each amino</font>

85
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,780
acid by a letter A through I guess would

86
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">be L or V or whatever you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

87
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,280
some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an algorithm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go through</font>

88
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:00,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">that now traditional churches of</font>

89
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,060
anybody's from with binary or

90
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,549
traditional search is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort so</font>

91
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:07,610
searches do all kinds of things where

92
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:10,489
they split the split solutions and look

93
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,810
either side of it or other kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ways</font>

94
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:13,459
of mapping through it but there's no

95
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,170
learning involved today that it always

96
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:17,298
does the same thing over and over<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

97
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:20,779
what we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is find a way that</font>

98
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:22,070
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes sideration it figures out</font>

99
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:25,549
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more information</font>

100
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:27,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how to get that result and one</font>

101
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:30,650
analogy the computer scientists<font color="#CCCCCC"> use for</font>

102
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:33,169
this is called fitness landscapes so in

103
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:35,719
our example a fitness landscape will

104
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:37,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">represent a presentation of all the</font>

105
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,700
possible amino acid chains I can figure

106
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:43,030
it's like a big flat map and each step

107
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the map is an amino acid chain and</font>

108
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,960
each amino acid chain is made up of a

109
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,260
string and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll say that's a string</font>

110
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,549
length it's a length<font color="#E5E5E5"> of L the distance</font>

111
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">between</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the string is they're having</font>

112
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,360
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hamming distance</font>

113
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:59,469
and what all the Hamming distance is is

114
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,910
the it's a it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a term that implies what</font>

115
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,650
it takes for this string to become this

116
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,380
string so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance if you have a</font>

117
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:08,349
string that's aad and another<font color="#E5E5E5"> string</font>

118
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,960
that's a AAA the Hamming distance is one

119
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,370
because it only takes one one thing to

120
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure to change</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it strength to the</font>

121
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:18,880
other so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve for that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hammock</font>

122
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">stream and each amino acid chain you</font>

123
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,280
give it<font color="#CCCCCC"> out a fit amino acid you give it</font>

124
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:26,950
a fitness as well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that graph becomes</font>

125
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,260
just a flat graph which ends up being

126
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:32,080
with bumps because each amino acid has a

127
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,550
little bit more fitness or it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

128
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,380
little bit farther from another one so

129
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,270
you end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a terrain if you will</font>

130
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:41,920
and that's how a landscape a fitness

131
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:43,270
landscape is made so in our case we're

132
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at this as an actual</font>

133
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:46,510
train and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that our</font>

134
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,400
algorithm is a hiker traversing through

135
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:52,960
this terrain trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find our solution</font>

136
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,580
the first thing we can do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can try to</font>

137
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,700
find our solutions we can have our hiker

138
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:00,010
walk it through every single point on

139
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:02,110
the entire terrain start on the east

140
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:03,520
side take each step all the way through

141
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the west side all over the place</font>

142
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,229
and he will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> guaranteed that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they will</font>

143
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:12,460
find the absolute best solution

144
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:14,890
guaranteed obviously doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this um it's</font>

145
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,270

to ask me questions are raised your hand

147
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:21,849
or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> confusing</font>

149
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,630
highest point to find the best solution

150
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,700
there's no way around it in fact it is

151
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:31,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">the only certain way of finding the</font>

152
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:33,159
correct solution of course this is

153
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,469
overwhelmingly time-consuming and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

154
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">processor-intensive if you imagine doing</font>

155
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:42,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">something you know basically 800 zillion</font>

156
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:44,080
times another possible method of going

157
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,190
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> these Fitness landscapes is</font>

158
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,820
using something called hill climbing

159
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:50,410
hill climbing assumes that our pop our

160
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:53,320
search or fitness landscape looks more

161
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:55,360
like a mountain so that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom edges</font>

162
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,450
are all very flat where our solutions

163
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,740
are less likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be correct as it</font>

164
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">moves up higher and higher up the</font>

165
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,540
mountain to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the very top we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reach</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

166
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,220
most optimal solution so what we do is

167
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,420
we basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> start at the bottom and we</font>

168
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,220
just move<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

169
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,750
we don't move to the side we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> straight</font>

170
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,660
to the top until<font color="#E5E5E5"> we reach the top and</font>

171
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's our solution this is okay and</font>

172
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,750
it's very useful but it can be

173
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,609
particularly problematic if we're

174
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at a much more diverse type</font>

175
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:24,430
landscape and we'll talk about hill

176
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:27,160
climbing in a minute there are other

177
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">types of searches as well we can make</font>

178
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,580
more explorers and put them all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

179
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,229
place we could make them more

180
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,580
intelligent<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how they decide which</font>

181
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,440
direction they're going to go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

182
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,330
we'll look at genetic algorithms that do

183
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and then we can give them the</font>

184
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">ability to climb down hill as well and</font>

185
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:47,229
we'll see that simulated annealing does

186
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:50,050
that now the fitness landscape metaphor

187
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:52,120
isn't perfect it's uh it's a slightly

188

building a house you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't decide where</font>

199
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,830
of the house and then recursively coming

clothes and farther and farther until

201
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:20,020
you get to the point where you're ready

202
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:21,430
to lay the bricks out so if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is trying</font>

to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at things as a fiddle ask a poor</font>

212

that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all available to us which</font>

217
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,490
isn't necessarily true and we're also

218
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,590
assuming that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> methods are all paths</font>

219
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,960
are symmetric but if I'm at Point a and

I go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> point B that going from point B</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">either so we're making all these</font>

224
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,670
assumptions when inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Fitness</font>

225

we're trying to solve a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem that is</font>

that fits outside the fitness landscape

228
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,860
then we just find another we find

229
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,540
another way of solving it

233
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:34,200
talk about this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a second it's</font>

234
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:36,400
basically its main feature is for

235
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,470
maximizing or minimizing a function that

236
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,340
has a discrete state which means a

237
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:43,420
limited it has a finite amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> state</font>

238
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,980
you can think you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at as the</font>

239
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,060
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> are represented as vertices on</font>

240
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,100
the graph so you have the graph<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little crisscrosses an age solution</font>

242
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,690
is basically just that intersection

243
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,970
point of vertex in the graph the

244
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">algorithm will follow the vertex looking</font>

245
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,450
for a path up and as it follows that

246
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,250
finds that path up as we mentioned it

247
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,600
keeps<font color="#E5E5E5"> going up to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now there's a</font>

248
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,240
couple of different ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it can do</font>

249
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,250
this we have simple hill climbing which

250
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,500
basically finds it finds<font color="#CCCCCC"> the closest</font>

251
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:11,380
path up and just jets up it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and keeps</font>

252
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,180
going up and up and up like this now the

253
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,590
problem with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of course as you</font>

254
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,910
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine as you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> starting to move</font>

255
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,650
up you're more likely to hit will be

256
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:20,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">called your local</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maxima which means</font>

257
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:22,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if I've got say two mountains and I</font>

258
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:24,250
climb<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to the top of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this one it's a</font>

259
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,449
solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's not necessarily the</font>

260
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:29,500
best the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be at the top of</font>

261
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:30,970
this other mountain one way around<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

262
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">is using what's called steepest ascent</font>

263
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:35,830
search where we kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

264
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,540
the algorithm looking at all the

265
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:39,610
different possible gradients and it

266
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:42,430
chooses the one that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most the</font>

267
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:44,500
steepest and it takes that path up goes

268
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:46,000
to the next one looks around at the

269
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:50,550
which one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the steepest it takes that</font>

270
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,550
path up and so it climbs all the way up

271
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:57,520
see this ascension see and then but that

272
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,720
isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even perfect in itself right</font>

273
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,300
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> once again it is still possible</font>

274
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,450
even with that to end up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top of a</font>

275
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:06,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">small mountain so the next solution was</font>

276
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:08,320
the shot gun hill climbing and basically

277
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">what that means is as I'm taking the</font>

278
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,580
algorithm to his steps and I take it to

279
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:14,709
the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a mountain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I then randomly</font>

280
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,630
move to another place and I move up the

281
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,370
hill climbing algorithm and I do more

282
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:21,040
comparisons and I do this over and over

283
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,140
again at many different spots and then

284
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,030
in the end what should happen is they

285
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:28,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">should with all that randomization be</font>

286
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:32,050
able to find my optimal solution anybody

287
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,279
have any questions about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

288
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:37,399
the first one we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font>

289
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:39,500
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the first real real one other</font>

290
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:40,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">male timing is simulated annealing now</font>

291
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,860
this one isn't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a biological</font>

292
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:45,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">process but it's always gets thrown in</font>

293
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,819
mostly because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's wave manages through</font>

294
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,439
the search space and because it uses

295
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:53,060
populations now simulated so annealing

296
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:55,670
is basically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> process of metal</font>

297
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:58,099
heating up and cooling down and that's

298
00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:01,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the annealing property is how what</font>

299
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:04,399
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cooling property so when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> metal is</font>

300
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:06,410
heated up to its absolute boil up to its

301
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,910
melting point there's a tremendous

302
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,170
amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> energy if anybody seeking</font>

303
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,790
physics class they've seen this there's

304
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:14,180
tremendous amount of energy caught up in

305
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:16,269
this metal and how this looks is as the

306
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:19,670
molecules are shaking all<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the place</font>

307
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:21,560
now as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> metal starts to cool and the</font>

308
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,660
temperature comes down the molecules

309
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">have less space that they can move along</font>

310
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:28,009
around in and to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point of when they</font>

311
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:30,110
finally stopped moving and they do

312
00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:34,129
develop a a crystal<font color="#E5E5E5"> structure and that</font>

313
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:35,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">is done now in will see that this</font>

314
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:37,699
actually applies in our algorithm as

315
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:40,009
well if a an algorithm cools too fast

316
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:43,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right I'm sorry if a metal cools too</font>

317
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:45,350
fast then the crystal structure<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts</font>

318
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:47,300
to become too brittle and is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

319
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,130
the metal is pretty faulty you if you

320
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:53,740
control the way the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tenth the cooling</font>

321
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:53,740
happens it creates a much stronger metal

322
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:59,750
so what how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we then translate this</font>

323
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:04,630
whole concept<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this metal cooling into</font>

324
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:06,589
an algorithm and how do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it um now</font>

325
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:07,579
let's see okay so the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we're</font>

326
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:09,829
going to do is we're going to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

327
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:11,839
random solution now one thing we'll see

328
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:13,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">here with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> simula nailing vs.</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will look</font>

329
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,170
further<font color="#CCCCCC"> than genetic algorithms we're</font>

330
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to find one we're going to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

331
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:19,459
solution so we're going to randomly come

332
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,430
up with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution generate that and</font>

333
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:24,709
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be our current solution</font>

334
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:25,939
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assess the solution now</font>

335
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:28,449
one thing you're gonna find is all these

336
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:31,009
algorithms and stuff are fairly simple

337
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:33,500
some of the implementations inside them

338
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:35,180
are more complex for instance assessing

339
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,559
the solution it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to say</font>

340
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,138
just look to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see you to make sure that</font>

341
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:42,290
it's the best how you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a</font>

342
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:44,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">little complicated and depending on what</font>

343
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,529
your problem is simpler problems are

344
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:46,420
obvious

345
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:50,319
much easier to assess the more complex

346
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:52,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">ones so in this point in our algorithm</font>

347
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:54,939
we determine how close the optimal

348
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:56,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">solution is to the current solution of</font>

349
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:58,990
course that's depend on the problem

350
00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:01,540
being solved the energy in that solution

351
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:06,339
is then determined and<font color="#CCCCCC"> its termined by</font>

352
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:14,170
how well it solves a problem Yeah Yeah

353
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:20,379
right sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely i mean this is</font>

354
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:22,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">this a heuristics one right well in its</font>

355
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:27,959
not necessarily NP complete right it

356
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:27,959
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an np-hard problem its weight</font>

357
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:32,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well either way your optimal is a</font>

358
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:35,230
little computing<font color="#E5E5E5"> its best solution</font>

359
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:37,059
you're right we're optimal solution it's

360
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:39,399
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> we what we're choosing is being</font>

361
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:42,639
our representation of what we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

362
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:49,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">should be which satisfies a solution</font>

363
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:54,970
right sup satisfied right what's up

364
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:56,979
status<font color="#CCCCCC"> feiss right so so anyway the</font>

365
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:59,139
energy term by how well satisfies to the

366
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:03,120
problem then we randomly change the

367
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:03,120
solution of course how we randomly

368
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:10,930
what's oh how we do that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

369
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:12,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">dependent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the problem itself then we</font>

370
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,559
use acceptance probability to determine

371
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">if we're basically going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to accept this</font>

372
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:22,089
solution or if we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move on</font>

373
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:24,370
and basically it's dependent on how well

374
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:25,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">its fitness will determine if the</font>

375
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,329
temperature of the current solution is

376
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:32,050
lower more accessible we then run this

377
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:33,609
or we just automatically accept it if if

378
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">the temperature the current solution is</font>

379
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:36,790
higher<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in pass</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this algorithm</font>

380
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,339
right here just basically just this

381
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:41,829
equation and all it says is that if the

382
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:44,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">temperature is higher we are more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> likely</font>

383
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:46,149
to accept random crappy solutions if the

384
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:53,110
temperature is lower we're less likely

385
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:54,850
to and then then we basically then we

386
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,529
reduce the<font color="#E5E5E5"> temperature and we keep</font>

387
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,760
iterating through until the temperature

388
00:15:56,529 --> 00:16:00,080
reduces so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> point where our search</font>

389
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,439
base gets smaller and smaller smaller

390
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,930
and then we have a I showed a cooling

391
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,920
schedule here to determine when the next

392
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:09,040
what the next temperature is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

393
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:12,110
and this is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a geometric cooling</font>

394
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,760
schedule and then you just do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that over</font>

395
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:20,090
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> over and over again until you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

396
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:21,800
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a solution the different kind of</font>

397
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:25,190
parameters<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can adjust inside</font>

398
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:27,760
the simulated annealing is we can change

399
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:29,870
the initial<font color="#CCCCCC"> profit initial temperature</font>

400
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,930
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> initial temperature is going to make</font>

401
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:34,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">it either more effective or more fast or</font>

402
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:37,520
more or<font color="#CCCCCC"> more there's going to get</font>

403
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,990
quicker obviously you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure</font>

404
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's a high enough temperature that</font>

405
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:43,160
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do an expansive enough search</font>

406
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,180
but at the same time you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

407
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,750
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's something that can be</font>

408
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">completed in a reasonable amount of time</font>

409
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,600
we have to determine what our final

410
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,280
temperature is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be we looked at</font>

411
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,130
our last cooling schedule and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

412
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:56,870
end in 0 but not<font color="#CCCCCC"> all cooling schedules</font>

413
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,490
are necessarily in 0 you might end<font color="#CCCCCC"> up in</font>

414
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,660
the negative number somewhere and that

415
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:04,060
you have to make sure you account for

416
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:06,079
that and then the temperature function

417
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,909
pretty much there's many different kinds

418
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,419
of these like i showed the geometric one

419
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:12,470
you just have to it's all a matter of

420
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:14,270
kind of figuring out what your problem

421
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,160
space is and using that to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

422
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:18,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">determine how you want the cooling rate</font>

423
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:24,620
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the number of iterations</font>

424
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:28,760
at each temperature the next thing we'll

425
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:31,129
look at is swarm intelligence swarm

426
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,860
intelligence is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the more fat is</font>

427
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:36,010
kind of more fast anyone uses the idea

428
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:38,899
of collective behavior in decentralized

429
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:40,879
self-organized systems it's made up

430
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,680
basically you have individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> little in</font>

431
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,390
some cases they called agents<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some</font>

432
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,760
cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> our card particle particle is it's</font>

433
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,750
all basically what you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call it</font>

434
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,670
and it's made up of each<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of these</font>

435
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,110
individual ones and each individual

436
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:55,550
particles give it a set of rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

437
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:57,080
follow they this these rules kind of

438
00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:00,409
define the behavior of each individual

439
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,939
particle by itself and when in the end

440
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,310
this local behavior allows for images

441
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,560
emergence of global behavior so what

442
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:08,230
this means is um if you ever seen a

443
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,460
flock of birds or school of fish

444
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,710
basically they're all kind of grouping

445
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:15,649
together and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is how do they</font>

446
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:17,120
do that yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see flock of geese you</font>

447
00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:18,678
see the one at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the front followed by all</font>

448
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,149
the geeks behind them and you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

449
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,700
tempted to think that basically that

450
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:24,979
geese is in charge but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not sure</font>

451
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,570
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> ants colonies are the same kind of</font>

452
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,789
thing if I shoot<font color="#CCCCCC"> that geet that goose in</font>

453
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,809
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front that flock of birds didn't</font>

454
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:32,809
keep going they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to fall</font>

455
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:35,270
apart<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that no one bird is in charge</font>

456
00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:39,230
of this entire flock but in the end the

457
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:42,080
behavior acts as one entity and how this

458
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:44,659
does it is by using simple rules if say

459
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,500
well the bird is given herb in this

460
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:50,270
agent or this particle is given a rule

461
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,970
basically you're supposed to stay at

462
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:56,059
certain distance away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from another same</font>

463
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:58,220
agent as yourself and you have to not

464
00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:02,149
hit things maybe a couple of the rules

465
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:04,100
as a as those rules are processed over

466
00:19:02,149 --> 00:19:06,799
time things start to merge together and

467
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:10,189
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> develop this behavior so we can do</font>

468
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:13,549
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> very similar in in computers</font>

469
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:16,789
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one I was going to look at is</font>

470
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:18,889
called ant colony optimization<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ant</font>

471
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:23,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">colony optimization basically simulates</font>

472
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:26,899
aunt food searches so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way ants move</font>

473
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:29,480
let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have a brick and we</font>

474
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:31,399
have two pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of food one is farther</font>

475
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,020
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other one and I didn't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

476

slide for this unfortunately um and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

477
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't have a whiteboard which would help</font>

478
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:39,549
but to Ansley from either direction

479
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:41,720
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that going to that food source</font>

480
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:43,399
the shorter aunt is going to reach the

481
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,409
food source first is going to turn

482
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:46,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and come back the one of the</font>

483
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:48,320
longer paths going to take much longer

484
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,668
is going to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back around now they</font>

485
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,908
use pheromones that they leave and they

486
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:57,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">develop they create a trail down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or long</font>

487
00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:59,480
this of these pheromones what happens is

488
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:02,000
the shorter path has a stronger amount

489
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,860
of pheromones as the and goes along

490
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,600
comes back drops more pheromones the

491
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,279
other one has been exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

492
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,350
environment more so there's less

493
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,640
pheromone as the next aunt comes along

494
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,020
he's going to they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to look at</font>

495
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,279
that pheromone trails and they're going

496
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a decision on which path are</font>

497
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:18,440
going to take they won't necessarily

498
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:20,149
pick the trail with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most pheromone</font>

499
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,409
they may choose the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other one so there's</font>

500
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:25,668
a probability at that point of

501
00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:26,630
determining which trail to take more

502
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:28,460
will take the

503
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:30,350
sure the shorter path so I'm take the

504
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:33,350
longer but<font color="#E5E5E5"> as more and more start taking</font>

505
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:35,240
the shorter path you'll have more the

506
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,560
ant trail becomes where there's the vast

507
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,150
majority of them are following the one

508
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,500
and very<font color="#E5E5E5"> few ants are following the</font>

509
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,120
other to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> point where you see that</font>

510
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,250
string<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you see every once</font>

511
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:49,939
in a while where they're all following

512
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:51,380
the same path and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so they fall</font>

513
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:57,590
back so we end up creating somewhat of a

514
00:20:51,380 --> 00:21:02,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">positive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feedback loop um how do we do</font>

515
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:04,909
this in how do we do this in it as an

516
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:06,500
algorithm and this is the the easiest

517
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,810
way to picture how this algorithm is

518
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:12,560
useful is where I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen it uses in</font>

519
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:13,820
graph trying to analyze graphs or in the

520
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,760
routing I don't know how people do

521
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:19,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">networks but I've read some papers on</font>

522
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:22,100
how to use ant colony optimization for

523
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:24,169
advanced graph<font color="#E5E5E5"> our advanced network</font>

524
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:28,879
routing and the really complicated

525
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:30,230
networks so what we do is we create an

526
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,080
initial population began and we

527
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:35,510
distributed them all over the entire the

528
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,649
graph space and we have to distribute it

529
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,290
everywhere because we don't know the

530
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:41,710
proper path and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

531
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:44,690
particular one we're looking at paths

532
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:46,940
each ant keeps a list what's called

533
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:50,000
tabulous which basically is a list of

534
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,990
all the places that they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been so the</font>

535
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,620
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is important is that it</font>

536
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:57,500
doesn't keep a cross over at same path

537
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:59,270
so in the beginning when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ants making</font>

538
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,070
a determination of war the agent is

539
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:03,980
making the determination of which path

540
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,810
to take we have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> algorithm that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

541
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,920
actually going to an equation that's

542
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:08,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to stay the same through the</font>

543
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:12,560
entire process but<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the very beginning</font>

544
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:14,810
there are no there's no pheromones laid

545
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:18,110
down there's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the probability</font>

546
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:19,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">of either path is pretty open now so</font>

547
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:22,790
they so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be end up going</font>

548
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:25,100
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be zero or whatever it is a general</font>

549
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:26,570
probabilities for that and the algorithm

550
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,969
is pretty basic it's basically just a

551
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:32,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">function of the of the the heuristic</font>

552
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:34,880
measurement times the the pheromone

553
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:39,550
level as a summation of all of the ants

554
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,550
for all the trails pheromone levels

555
00:22:41,739 --> 00:22:47,389
so when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ant make it store so these</font>

556
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:49,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">are some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> equations we're going to</font>

557
00:22:47,389 --> 00:22:50,779
use the and makes it store it's going to

558
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:52,729
decide what the pheromone level of the

559
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:54,649
path is going to be and it determines

560
00:22:52,729 --> 00:22:58,729
that by it's basically the change in

561
00:22:54,649 --> 00:23:02,539
pheromone level is a is a sort of

562
00:22:58,729 --> 00:23:07,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for it's a given number a chosen</font>

563
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:10,549
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a end of this the pathway of</font>

564
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:12,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">the the path of the end but the actual</font>

565
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:14,479
pheromone level a constants are accused

566
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:16,669
of constant words you're leaving me

567
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:19,119
actual pheromone level is the is

568
00:23:16,669 --> 00:23:21,499
calculated by taking that change and

569
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:23,988
multiplying it<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the current path and</font>

570
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:26,090
then multiplying it again by by o'connor

571
00:23:23,989 --> 00:23:28,759
extras multiplying the change against

572
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:30,709
another constant which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is usually</font>

573
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:32,539
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero and one just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you a</font>

574
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit more randomness and then</font>

575
00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:36,109
adding that to the current path and then

576
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:38,690
you have what would be the current

577
00:23:36,109 --> 00:23:40,879
pheromone level and at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time the</font>

578
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:43,009
current the the pheromone evaporation is

579
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:45,199
calculated basically by multiplying the

580
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:48,669
pheromone level by a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number that's one</font>

581
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:59,929
minus our of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> constant probability</font>

582
00:23:48,669 --> 00:24:01,279
number oops so how does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> work each ant</font>

583
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:02,809
uses that initial probability of

584
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,210
cohesion like we looked at to determine

585
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:06,590
where to go in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and of</font>

586
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,239
course like I said it<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't have</font>

587
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,649
anything to do it doesn't the equation

588
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:13,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't have any numbers yet to fill in</font>

589
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:14,449
with it as an passes to her note that no

590
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:16,279
one is entered first into his tableau

591
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:19,609
list and then the pheromone level is

592
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:22,220
calculated and I'm using those equations

593
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:24,918
that we showed the actual pheromone

594
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:27,080
deposit is then is calculated<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

595
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:30,470
when all the ants have actually finished

596
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,960
all their their their<font color="#E5E5E5"> past they restart</font>

597
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">the cycle at that point we have numbers</font>

598
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,399
to stick in that probability so it

599
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:38,629
starts<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change as different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paths have</font>

600
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:40,789

603
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:48,320
said more and more tours happen the

604
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:49,849
number of paths becomes smaller and

605
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,330
smaller and eventually you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one path</font>

00:24:49,849 --> 00:24:52,330
determined

609
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:03,550
complicated routing systems people have

610
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:05,680
academically shown how that you can

611
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:07,570
solve some of those problems using ant

612
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,450
colony optimization I've actually even

613
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:12,760
seen papers written on how you are using

614
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:15,130
ant colony optimization for some

615
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:20,320
cryptographic analysis which is a little

616
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:27,340
out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we're doing on time</font>

617
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:29,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I'm going to talk</font>

618
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,179
about is genetic algorithms but i'm

619
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to give i guess the high school</font>

way that it does things and try to

630
00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:00,820
emulate that so the first concept is

631
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:03,300
evolution which is a change<font color="#CCCCCC"> in traits</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">within a population through inheritance</font>

633
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:09,220
this change happens through multiple

639
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,990
really this it's very one of the very

640
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:24,100
important keys to this whole process as

641
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:29,230
we change to happen to become<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

642
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:31,600
common oh yeah as these changes start to

643
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:33,370
become more common or even more rare we

644
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,070
have an evolution of process moving

645
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:37,600
forward happening another way of looking

646
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,919
at it could be called the spontaneous

647
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,899
generation of innovative functional

648
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,760

00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">from Darwin Awards as these organisms</font>

survive there is a higher probability

656
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:04,840
that its genetic controller we passed on

657
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:06,029
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is that if i can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> live i can</font>

658
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,340
have more<font color="#E5E5E5"> children</font>

659
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:09,929
and I can my<font color="#E5E5E5"> children can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have more</font>

660
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">children as they start to mate with</font>

661
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:16,919
people that also have a higher<font color="#CCCCCC"> fitness</font>

662
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:18,269
these traits are these traits are passed

663
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:20,519
to offspring have a higher problem

664
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:22,409
surviving these traits that are less

665
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:23,729
likely to survive meaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if I'm</font>

666
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:25,830
going to die<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I have children</font>

667
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:27,389

00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:34,889
traits are not going to be passed on and

669
00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:36,959
then it continues so the fundamental the

pronounce that diox<font color="#CCCCCC"> rub-on nucleic acid</font>

673
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:45,629
like I said right and it contains all

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> genetic code for all development</font>

675
00:27:45,629 --> 00:27:49,738
it's all those jeans it makes up the

676
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,210
fundamental pieces of the chromosomes

677
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:52,769
where the chromosomes are going to be

678
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:56,129
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for how the genetic</font>

683
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:11,759
of a mystery some of its for determining

684
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:14,700
how transmission rate happens many

685
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:17,279
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard junk DNA that's they will</font>

686
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,809
classify this as junk DNA lately<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

687
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,419
found that more and more of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

688
00:28:18,809 --> 00:28:23,668
actually maybe a little more important

689
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:25,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">than we thought and then when cell</font>

690
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:30,149
division happens each cell gets an exact

691
00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:31,978
replica of the DNA and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> genes are</font>

692
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:33,539
people are as part of the DNA and

693
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:37,889
they're a part that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually encodes a</font>

694
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:40,049
specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> protein so as you know how what</font>

695
00:28:37,889 --> 00:28:43,228
color eyes are clear hairs are our hair

696
00:28:40,049 --> 00:28:46,249
is how our eyes work all based on jeans

697
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:49,019
and the howard sequences these proteins

698
00:28:46,249 --> 00:28:51,389
also contain some regulatory sequences

699
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:55,019
for adjusting rate of wind transcription

700
00:28:51,389 --> 00:28:57,959
happens in our case proteins have our

701
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:59,309
working proteins um genes and

702
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,859
chromosomes working what's called

703
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:03,269
alleles<font color="#E5E5E5"> and allows a pair of jeans each</font>

704
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:05,570
appearing on the same chromosome and

705
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:07,799
that'll make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in a second</font>

706
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:10,109
chromosomes are basically a collection

707
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:13,979
of hundreds of thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of genes all</font>

708
00:29:10,109 --> 00:29:15,599
together inside the DNA structure or all

709
00:29:13,979 --> 00:29:17,159
built out of DNA and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're a</font>

710
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:19,740
collection of all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chromosomes is</font>

711
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:21,840
called the genome so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

712
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,670
you were to like create a number map<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

713
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,800
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> genes it's called genotype</font>

714
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:27,300
and if you in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your body or the</font>

716
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:32,760

00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:36,929
phenotype our chromosomes are what's

718
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:40,230
called mama magis and that means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

719
00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:42,420
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two pair of like jeans they're not</font>

720
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:44,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly the same they're like each other</font>

721
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:47,100
and the idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we got one from</font>

722
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:51,659
each of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> parents</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have 46 total</font>

723
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:53,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">jeans 22 of them homologous one pair is</font>

724
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:56,640
not and that's the XY gene which is

725
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:58,830
determines our what our sex is what's

726
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">that chromosome sorry did I say the</font>

727
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:06,270
wrong word oh yeah I said gene denied

728
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:10,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's 46 chromosomes 23 pairs 22 or</font>

729
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:13,320
Malgus one is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> or two or not now when</font>

730
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:16,020
sexual reproduction happens each sexual

731
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,909
reproduction cell has 23 question is how

732
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:20,010
do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> how did we go from 46 chromosomes</font>

733
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:21,809
to 23 chromosomes and this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

734
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:24,240
be this concept is going to become<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

735
00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:27,240
important in in our algorithm and its

736
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,520
concept called meiosis and it's how

737
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:32,850
sexual reproduction cells called germ

738
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,440
cells are made this happens when the

739
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:36,750
cells destined to become reproduction

740
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,540
cells are created in each of the cells

741
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:41,820
those cells the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of chromosomes</font>

742
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:45,178
that are passed on is reduced in half

743
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:48,659
and the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how and really it's</font>

744
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:51,660
done randomly so that when when the germ

745
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:54,150
cells created a completely random salute

746
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:56,070
a random algorithm is running your body

747
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:57,870
that says take this particular

748
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:59,700
chromosome from this one from<font color="#CCCCCC"> this allel</font>

749
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:04,559
and this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this one and so you</font>

750
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:06,150
develop the 23 chromosomes and that's

751
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,220
where and then when we're developing

752
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:10,260
those crossover those those chromosomes

753
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:13,350
we have a constant of crossover<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

754
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:15,690
is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of where the whole and this is</font>

755
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:20,010
how we is a sexually reproducing people

756
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:22,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">evolved crossover happens during the</font>

757
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:24,540
meiosis period so we develop we get a

758
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:26,340
chromosome from our parents and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get</font>

759
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:28,290
one from each of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> parents</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or a mom</font>

760
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:31,379
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> dad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and on each of those chromosomes</font>

761
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:34,080
is a bunch of genes now we might have

762
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:35,880
genes that are considered wild genes

763
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,860
basically mean they're the original way

764
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,210
the gene was meant non mutated some

765
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:43,379
people might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have mutated versions of</font>

766
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:46,679
these jeans when crossover happens it

767
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:52,950
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> decides which gene we should</font>

768
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:55,980
replace with another one so um we create

769
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:58,860
a new chromosome based on breaking apart

770
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:01,380
the two chromosomes and create the new

771
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:03,689
one that chromosome is then handed off

772
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:10,230
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to the germ cell and that's</font>

773
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:11,549
what's used for the reproduction so it

774
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:14,100
is random the frequency<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

775
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:16,559
recombination is determined by genetic

776
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,389
distance if two genes are are really far

777
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,120
apart from<font color="#CCCCCC"> each</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good</font>

778
00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:22,918
chance that they might they might

779
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,539
recombine or crossover if they're really

780
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:30,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">close to each other that you have a</font>

781
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:32,929
tendency<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stay more stable another</font>

782
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,399
important concept is mutation and

783
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:38,820
mutation is a change in the DNA through

784
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:40,219
some kind of outside influence it's

785
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:44,129
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen through ultraviolet</font>

786
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:46,200
radiation viruses I put in<font color="#E5E5E5"> here I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

787
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:48,570
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of interesting that if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do</font>

788
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,149
if you look at our DNA there's lots and

789
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:54,120
lots of samples of virus DNA in there so

790
00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:59,219
we are in effect kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> descended in a</font>

791
00:32:54,120 --> 00:33:00,928
way if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it viruses make</font>

792
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,070
mutations can affect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the somatic cells</font>

793
00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:04,889
and somatic cells just<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a</font>

794
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:06,299
non-sexual cell and that's where cancer

795
00:33:04,889 --> 00:33:10,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes from and some of the things like</font>

796
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:13,110
that the vast majority mutations are

797
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:15,779
either bad or neutral I give an example

798
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:18,990
here of one where it's beneficial it's

799
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:21,059
basically one example of a mutation

800
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:24,210
that's actually made<font color="#E5E5E5"> people either more</font>

801
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:26,100
resistant<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the HIV or in some</font>

802
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,919
situations where one parent had the gene

803
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:35,539
and one parent didn't that helps to

804
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:35,539
delay the onset of AIDS okay

805
00:33:37,109 --> 00:33:41,580
so we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about genetic algorithms</font>

806
00:33:42,269 --> 00:33:46,080
so what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing here is we're now</font>

807
00:33:44,499 --> 00:33:49,690
using those principles that we learned

808
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:52,029
simulate the evolutionary properties to

809
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:54,759
solve problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

810
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:56,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">to we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work over a population</font>

811
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:58,960
of solutions rather than in simulated

812
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:00,669
annealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hill climbing where we had</font>

813
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,599
one solution we were working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

814
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:04,509
actually going to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> with multiple</font>

815
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:07,539
solutions each solution represented as a

816
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:09,760
chromosome and the candidate solution

817
00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:11,109
that the we're looking through our coded

818
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,069
is they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are called phenotypes but</font>

819
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:16,418
they're basically in column chromosomes

820
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:19,480
typically solutions<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say are coded as</font>

821
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:23,940
binary strings and well I'll talk about

822
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:26,319
that in a second and here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font>

823
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,990
the steps<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we go through for the</font>

824
00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:31,599
genetic algorithm we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create</font>

825
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:33,250
the population where they<font color="#E5E5E5"> am going to</font>

826
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:36,669
select survivors based on a fitness

827
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:39,339
function we create offspring based on

828
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:41,558
these survivors and then we evaluate the

829
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:43,599
fitness function and determine at that

830
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:45,730
point we make a determination have I

831
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,730
have do we have still dramatic amount of

832
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:50,889
evolution if not then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably reach</font>

833
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:52,869
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our as much as we can do so</font>

834
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:55,359
we end the algorithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> also we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can end it</font>

835
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:57,250
based on how many generations we are

836
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,839
going to allow might say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we let</font>

837
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:08,020
five hundred generations and that would

838
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:10,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">be call a run so what we're trying to</font>

839
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:15,210
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> max match the idea of biology and</font>

840
00:35:10,059 --> 00:35:17,230
their fitness idea in in biology the

841
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:19,900
fitness function of biology is really

842
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:25,599
easy survival in our case<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not so</font>

843
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:26,920
simple inheritance it's basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

844
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,420
way the genetic operators going to work

845
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I'm going to go into what several</font>

846
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,950
different genetic operators but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font>

847
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:35,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk a second about the chromosomes</font>

848
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:37,450
chromosomes because how you represent

849
00:35:35,529 --> 00:35:40,839
your chromosomes your solutions are is

850
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:44,109
very important initially Jon horn is one

851
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:47,140
of the original adventures of the let's

852
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:49,630
see actually many we have myself so

853
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,740
these are random over time<font color="#CCCCCC"> we find the</font>

854
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,720
best solution

855
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,700
the design of the chromosome like

856
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,169
everything else is dependent on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your son</font>

857
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">the problem you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to solve and</font>

858
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,869
we'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a second when we're</font>

859
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:03,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at the different chromosomes</font>

860
00:35:58,869 --> 00:36:05,440
chromosomes binary encoding was

861
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:06,610
basically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

862
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,930
done and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because the inventor</font>

863
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:10,210
John one of the inventors John Holland

864
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:13,419
use this to solve the problems at the

865
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:15,310
time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we that's the one that's</font>

866
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,860
considered the most well understood and

867
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:19,360
the most often used and basically that

868
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:22,450
means that the chromosome is listed as a

869
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:24,460
bit string they work really well with

870
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:26,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">fixed length and fixed order binary and</font>

871
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:28,690
coatings the problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it can</font>

872
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:30,310
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more complicated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we change the</font>

873
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:32,920
length or change it change some of the

874
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:34,150
ordering one of those things that people

875
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,310
are researching but they don't

876
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:38,320
necessarily know the best way to use

877
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:39,610
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing another way of</font>

878
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,340
encoding it is what they call many

879
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:44,680
character and<font color="#E5E5E5"> real valued encoding what</font>

880
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:47,830
that means is that each gene if you will

881
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:50,589
in the chromosome chromosome is either a

882
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:52,630
character a word or maybe a real number

883
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:55,180
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too stout a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> binary number</font>

884
00:36:52,630 --> 00:37:06,160
and for instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> this could be effective</font>

885
00:36:55,180 --> 00:37:07,299
in some like cut oh yeah so the one

886
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,618
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about when you're</font>

887
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,020
thinking about these kind of algorithms

888
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:12,400
is what's called no free lunch I don't

889
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:15,340
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have heard no free lunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

890
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,170
it basically means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that no generic</font>

891
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:20,800
algorithm is going to be better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

892
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:22,510
specific one so the times when these

893
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,510
algorithms are most effective is when

894
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:27,430
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what algorithm to use so</font>

895
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:29,470
when you for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're doing a</font>

896
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:31,960
search or you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sword over</font>

897
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:33,850
finite file for instance you're never

898
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:37,810
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things because</font>

899
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:40,810
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> you we have binary sorts and we can</font>

900
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:42,400
use those much more effectively but

901
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:45,549
let's say we're trying to create<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

902
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:49,660
grammar parser right we could create a

903
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:51,940
grammar parser using a ton of reg axis

904
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:53,470
but that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be really complicated and</font>

905
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:54,880
if there's any changes over time it

906
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:56,649
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to would have to create</font>

907
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,900
more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more reg X's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to deal</font>

908
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:01,450
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that now but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is where these</font>

909
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:03,880
come in and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> help basically as their</font>

910
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:04,689
learning and then start adapting the

911
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,609
algorithm starts

912
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:11,829
can deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of changes and</font>

913
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:13,328
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they meaning it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is an AI</font>

914
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:36,480
Algrim that's what these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are these are</font>

915
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:36,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">we excited I algorithms right and it</font>

916
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:43,000
right and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I've seen things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

917
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:44,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and you know there's tons and tons</font>

918
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,790
of research in the end you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

919
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,920
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how these things work</font>

920
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:49,420
there's even<font color="#E5E5E5"> research done still trying</font>

921
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,190
to understand how genetic algorithms

922
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:53,349
work because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really clear they</font>

923
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:55,150
you know it's they develop some

924
00:38:53,349 --> 00:38:58,089
mathematical models around it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

925
00:38:55,150 --> 00:39:02,010
in the end you know they we've got us

926
00:38:58,089 --> 00:39:05,380
some some theories but that's about it

927
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:06,250
but yeah so there's the encoding is one

928
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,780
of those things where you've got

929
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:10,359
researchers all around the world and

930
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:14,589
universities just trying to resolve how

931
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:16,598
to encode problems correctly another<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

932
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:18,160
one way of people are doing coding is a

933
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:20,109
tree and coding and everybody knows what

934
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,899
a like a binary<font color="#E5E5E5"> tree looks like not all</font>

935
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:24,940
trees have to be binary but and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

936
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,890
works great<font color="#E5E5E5"> because as you know it gives</font>

937
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:29,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">you open end of this you can create you</font>

938
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:31,390
can this tree can go on but of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font>

939
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:33,280
that's the double-edged sword because it

940
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:35,529
can go on<font color="#CCCCCC"> forever and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course you</font>

941
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,109
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> losing your ability to be able to</font>

942
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:40,780
search this space<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the tree goes</font>

943
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:43,900
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you choose the</font>

944
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,069
best one like I said it's depending on

945
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,569
the problem you basically have two

946
00:39:45,069 --> 00:39:48,460
enamel analyze the problem and kind of

947
00:39:46,569 --> 00:39:52,300
decide from there you know what

948
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:55,260
direction<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to go in so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cross</font>

949
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:56,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">over so the genetic algorithm how to</font>

950
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:58,450
consider it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> considered one of the</font>

951
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:00,420
primary features that makes a genetic

952
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:02,230
algorithm do what it's supposed to do

953
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,220
actually one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I'd like to point out</font>

954
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">that i should have point out earlier</font>

955
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:07,118
there's actually even some contention

956
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,310
sometimes about what a genetic algorithm

957
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,710
is what I'm what I'm showing here is a

958
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:13,390
really a generic basis of what genetic

959
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:15,069
algorithms are and there are more

960
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:18,430
specific type descriptions and

961
00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:19,660
explanations so it's kind

962
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:23,950
interesting that way like i said it's

963
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:25,899
very is still very academic so that's an

964
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:27,879
operator and a genetic operator used to

965
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,230
force diversity in the chromosomes so in

966
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,240
this case our genetic we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

967
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:33,160
allows we don't work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> pears</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we just</font>

968
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:35,169
have the amount of chromosomes we have

969
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,790
as you might we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have and we randomly</font>

970
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:38,020
choose when we're choosing these things

971
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,950
like these<font color="#CCCCCC"> cross over we're just going</font>

972
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:42,309
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> randomly choose a couple of</font>

973
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:44,879
chromosomes but two chromosomes are

974
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:47,710
chosen and as an hour biology reference

975
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,329
and they are randomly broken and

976
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,500
attached the question is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

977
00:40:49,329 --> 00:40:54,670
determine how we're going to randomly

978
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:56,530
break these things and reattach them one

979
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:57,849
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first solution and I have some</font>

980
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:59,920
example code that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you in a</font>

981
00:40:57,849 --> 00:41:01,809
little bit and I use this as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

982
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,240
that ends up getting use is called a one

983
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:06,190
point crossover and what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

984
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:09,598
does is you track through two different

985
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:12,220
through the two different chromosomes

986
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:15,400
you pick a point where you want to do a

987
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:17,799
swap and then every all the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

988
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,569
that point down get swapped between the

989
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:24,339
two chromosomes and you have now<font color="#E5E5E5"> created</font>

990
00:41:19,569 --> 00:41:28,990
two new chromosomes the problem with

991
00:41:24,339 --> 00:41:31,089
this is that it yeah when you if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

992
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:32,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">too big you're starting to move large</font>

993
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:35,308
amounts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> data around and so your</font>

994
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:37,868
randomization is actually kind of narrow

995
00:41:35,309 --> 00:41:39,359
for one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you cannot combine all</font>

996
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:42,309
possibilities I give an example here of

997
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:44,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">11 dot star star star star 1 and star</font>

998
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:45,400
star star 11 star star you're never

999
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:47,710
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to make that convey</font>

1000
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:50,190
other combination so those are going to

1001
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:52,780
be solutions you're never going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find</font>

1002
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:55,150

1004
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:59,770
too tightly to certain data sets and it

1005
00:41:58,299 --> 00:42:01,509
has a tendency<font color="#E5E5E5"> for hitchhikers if you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine if I'm cutting a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">in there that's not very useful but it's</font>

1009
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:08,980
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be moved around more</font>

1010
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,960
more likely than not because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:15,730
large<font color="#E5E5E5"> the section section we're picking</font>

1012
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:17,770
up we end up with the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a loci</font>

1013
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:22,210
preference the the endpoints end up

00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:24,280
getting always<font color="#CCCCCC"> together so so to solve</font>

1015
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:26,890
that problem they decided they use to

1016
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:28,930
point crossover which basically means we

1017
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:30,940
should we choose two points in the

1018
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:32,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">algorithm or am starting the chromosome</font>

1019
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:34,120
and we swap in the

1020
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:36,460
take the chunk out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle and we</font>

1021
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:38,230
swap<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> helps a little bit</font>

1022
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:39,670
because we're working with smaller data

1023
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:42,640
sets so<font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime you work a smaller data</font>

1024
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:44,730
sets you're more likely to get a small s

1025
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,740
information and less correct less

1026
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:52,450
carryover from other solutions or less

1027
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:54,609
carryover will will happen this method

1028
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:57,669
it reduces the damage to<font color="#E5E5E5"> large data sets</font>

1029
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:59,980
and and also resolves the endpoint

1030
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:01,870
problem there's this one that's called

1031
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:03,220
cutting splice which is another one of

1032
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:05,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">those ones that's really theoretical</font>

1033
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,879
because in the end what happens with

1034
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:09,310
this one is you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to end up with</font>

1035
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,740

1040
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:21,640
kinds of faults but there are times<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you'd want to do</font>

1046
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:35,050
there's something out there as things

1047
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:36,630
got more advanced the they worked on

1048
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:38,500
what's called uniform crossover

1049
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:40,030
parameterised uniform crossover

1050
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,760
basically means we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to walk</font>

1051
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:45,070
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> every single</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the genes of</font>

probability mouse over it news that's to

1054
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:50,529
determine whether we're going to do the

1055
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:54,160
crossover or not and we'll do that

1056

<font color="#CCCCCC">different possible solutions one that's</font>

1061
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:07,960
not quite as time consuming maybe not

1062
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:09,340
quite as effective but more effective

1063
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,230
than even the two point crossover is

1064
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:13,450
what's called a half uniform cross over

1065
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:15,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we basically take half the bits and</font>

1066
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,799
swap them and we have an algorithm we

1067
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:18,970
take the Hamming distance and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

1068
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,990
divide that by<font color="#E5E5E5"> two and that's how many</font>

1070
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,770
solutions can be swapped like this

1071
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:29,200
however anything that requires a make

1072
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:30,870
sure you have no there no duplicates

1073
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:39,009
like the Traveling Salesman problem

1074

wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> effective with this the</font>

keeps offspring from being able being

too similar and slowing down the

<font color="#E5E5E5">determine how you're going to do this</font>

00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:05,590
through your crossover algorithm you're

in another pass over of a mutation

1089
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:20,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">important part and basically we decide</font>

which chromosomes are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move on</font>

00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:29,319
deciding chromosomes will survive the

1094
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:30,960
plan is to let the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fittest specimens</font>

1095
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:34,260
survive and let the less fit die off

1096
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,670
this has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be carefully balanced if you</font>

1097
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:38,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">may be right a couple run across a</font>

1098
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:40,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of chromosomes that it seemed</font>

1099
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:42,879
really fit and start focusing on those

1100
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:44,830
early on you're leaving off a whole lot

1101
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,840
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole lot of solution sets behind</font>

1102
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:50,290
and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than likely going to hit</font>

1103
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:54,610
a local optimum or local local solution

1104
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:57,040
that isn't necessarily the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> one too</font>

1105
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:58,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">weak a selection process meaning that</font>

1106
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:04,810
you're letting too many things reproduce

1107
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:06,550
and it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a really long time so</font>

the first way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first one was which the John Holland</font>

1111
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:16,209
made was the fitness proportionate

1112
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:17,620
selection basically the selection is

1113
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:19,870
proportional to how much what the

1114
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:21,400
fitness is and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'd show the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a roulette wheel selection and you</font>

1116
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,120
could picture a wheel and there's a

1117
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:27,610
roulette wheel a little arrow that comes

1118
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:30,490
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and each chromosome has a slice</font>

1119
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:33,130
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wheel dependent on how what its</font>

1120
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:35,729
fitness number is so the wheels spun as

1121
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:38,350
many times as there are chromosomes and

1122
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:42,270
where that word<font color="#E5E5E5"> out where that needle</font>

this doesn't it appears<font color="#CCCCCC"> to according</font>

well across smaller data sets it would

1128
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:55,810
be pretty effective over<font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely large</font>

data sets as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the as Italy it starts</font>

1130
00:46:55,810 --> 00:47:00,040
balancing out but if you're not doing

1131
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,290
very many spins

1132
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:05,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">it kind of loses its ability to be truly</font>

1133
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:07,210
random the next one was the stochastic

1134
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:09,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">universal sampling and it was basically</font>

1135
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:12,160
like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> roulette wheel but instead of</font>

00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:13,959
spinning the wheel it<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically randomly</font>

1137
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,940
placed points around the wheel and said

1138

those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the ones that are going to</font>

those across those ones are moving on

1140
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:25,210
the selection then at that point the

1141
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:26,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sigma scaling is the next one that they</font>

1142
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:29,140
developed and that was developed

00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:32,140
probably about 10 or 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1144
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:34,660
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it does is it applies</font>

1145
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:36,460
pressure let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> call it selection</font>

1146
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:38,649
pressure to each one to the fitness

1147
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:42,010
function or I mean I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">fistfight it applies selection pressure</font>

1149
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:45,640
in the selection<font color="#E5E5E5"> process so what it</font>

1150
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:47,620
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is it wants to make the</font>

1151
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:50,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">selection process constant through the</font>

1152
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:53,830
entire thing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is a chance</font>

1153
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:55,690
for crossover of maybe possibly less

1154
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:58,540
desirable results that may not

1155
00:47:55,690 --> 00:48:00,370
eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more desirable and if you</font>

1156
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:01,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">look it's a pretty basic algorithm and</font>

1157
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:04,029
basically what it's saying is we have we

1158
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:05,800
take the mean deviation we take the

1159
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:08,590
results as it is so far we divided by

1160
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:11,200
the main deviation of the fitness which

1161
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:13,450
in the very beginning the deviation is

1162
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,950
not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be very great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font>

1163
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:18,990
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be very big and</font>

1164
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:21,250
then the we've got a more liberal

1165
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:24,129
crossover<font color="#E5E5E5"> route selection process as</font>

1166
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:27,010
that deviation gets stronger though it's

1167
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:28,660
going to be less<font color="#E5E5E5"> and less crossover</font>

1168
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:29,950
happens or less most likely that the

1169
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:33,490
cost of that selection is going to

1170
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:36,370
happen so I at the beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1171
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:37,390
deviation will be high deviation for

00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:39,730
each individual not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be drastically</font>

1173
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:42,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">higher than me this forces more diverse</font>

1174
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:43,480
reproduction the the diversity<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1175
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:45,250
reproduction is really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font>

1176
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:50,410
important part of the genetic algorithm

1177
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:52,960
and for it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work next one look at the</font>

1178
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:55,240
Boltzmann selection and the idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1179
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,310
sometimes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want it to be even</font>

1180
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:59,109
or you don't want it to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> even across</font>

1181
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:01,210
the entire product of the entire

1182
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:02,350
selection process sometimes you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1183
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:06,220
be able to apply more pressure sometimes

1184
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:07,900
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to apply less pressure so in</font>

1185
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:09,640
the beginning it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible that you</font>

1186
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:11,590
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have less pressure you want the</font>

1187
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:13,629
development process or the selection

1188
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:16,240
process to be very weak to allow

1189
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:18,220
more recombination to happen but then as

1190
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,769
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get closer and closer to your</font>

1191
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:22,868
solution or you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe want it to</font>

1192
00:49:20,769 --> 00:49:24,279
be less reproduction happening more

1193
00:49:22,869 --> 00:49:26,200
focusing on the solutions you've got

1194
00:49:24,279 --> 00:49:33,369
kind of like in a simulated annealing

1195
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:35,410
way in the cooling process the next one

1196
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:40,480
the look at is called<font color="#E5E5E5"> rank selection and</font>

1197
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:42,879
this one is it takes away the fitness

1198
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,950
number out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire Islands entire</font>

1199
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,839
process so what it does is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

1200
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:48,788
determines which ones are the fittest

1201
00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:50,710
and doesn't really necessary keep the

1202
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:52,089
number it just says this one's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font>

1203
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:53,799
fittest the next one down the next it

1204
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:55,808
ranks them based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and then</font>

1205
00:49:53,799 --> 00:49:59,200
there's a probability of which ones are

1206
00:49:55,809 --> 00:50:02,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to then be selected so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what that</font>

1207
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:05,109
means is that the even if the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top</font>

1208
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:07,299
one is has a much<font color="#CCCCCC"> higher number the</font>

1209
00:50:05,109 --> 00:50:09,970
chance isn't actually any different for

1210
00:50:07,299 --> 00:50:11,859
the second one to be selected and this

1211
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:16,299
allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a much more even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> distribution</font>

1212
00:50:11,859 --> 00:50:17,920
of these chromosomes to be selected it

1213
00:50:16,299 --> 00:50:19,509
can be good in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning when the</font>

1214
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,029
absolute fitness of each individual

1215
00:50:19,509 --> 00:50:23,319
allows for<font color="#CCCCCC"> OC good at the beginning not</font>

1216
00:50:22,029 --> 00:50:25,200
knowing the absolute fitness of<font color="#E5E5E5"> each</font>

1217
00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:26,920
individual allows for more diversity

1218
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:30,419
sometimes though there are times you

1219
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:33,339
might need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this absolute fitness</font>

1220
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:35,470
one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this can actually be fairly</font>

1221
00:50:33,339 --> 00:50:37,509
effective or has proven to be fairly

1222
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:40,269
effective against noisy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fitness</font>

1223
00:50:37,509 --> 00:50:41,950
functions where you might call into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1224
00:50:40,269 --> 00:50:45,689
function and get different results at

1225
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:45,689
different times even<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the same input</font>

1226
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:51,279
well then there's tournament selection

1227
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,960
and this was kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> meant to make</font>

1228
00:50:51,279 --> 00:50:56,650
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speed things up a little bit</font>

1229
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:58,809
as it mentions on all selection requires

1230
00:50:56,650 --> 00:51:02,200
two different passes one to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1231
00:50:58,809 --> 00:51:03,569
calculate the fitness or the deviation

1232
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,879
depending on which<font color="#E5E5E5"> one you're using and</font>

1233
00:51:03,569 --> 00:51:08,769
calculating the expected value and it

1234
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,569
can be somewhat time consuming what this

1235
00:51:08,769 --> 00:51:14,078
does it basically pulls out to random

1236
00:51:10,569 --> 00:51:18,130
chromosomes a random number are selected

1237
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:20,319
and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> R is less than a parameter then</font>

1238
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:23,279
it basically it either chooses the more

1239
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:23,279
fit one of less fit one

1240
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:30,290
and then both are returned back into the

1241
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:35,360
population<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then show it possibly</font>

1242
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:37,130
selected again there's a concept of

1243
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,720
steady-state selection which I don't

1244
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:40,040
really know a whole lot about because

1245
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,859
I've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> really used anything like</font>

1246
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:44,150
this but basically the idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1247
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:46,460
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> replacing very many</font>

1248
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:48,140
chromosomes and this is suppose is it

1249
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:49,940
appears to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be mostly effectively used</font>

1250
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:52,339
against when you're using multiple

1251
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:54,890
chromosomes to solve a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem meaning</font>

1252
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:56,750
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're the results is actually the</font>

1253
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:58,609
time together these chromosomes is the

1254
00:51:56,750 --> 00:52:02,180
actual solution it's not using each one

1255
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:08,240
is its own solution and that's used in

1256
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:10,940
rule based learning so um in evolution

1257
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:12,740
again when different organisms start to

1258
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:14,360
become very<font color="#E5E5E5"> diverse they lose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1259
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:17,569
ability to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to reproduce with</font>

1260
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:19,400
each other the genetic information<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so</font>

1261
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:25,310
dissimilar that reproduction can't

1262
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:27,380
happen so even if sometimes like usually

1263
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:29,450
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happens you you can't even</font>

1264
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:33,320
generate offspring there of course rare

1265
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:39,950
exceptions like the liger which is my

1266

favorite<font color="#CCCCCC"> animal we can use this idea in</font>

genetic algorithms as well to once again

1268
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:46,220
force diversity once again diversity is

1269
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:50,120
really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most important thing in a</font>

genetic<font color="#CCCCCC"> algorithm a function is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

one<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibilities</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> function to</font>

1273
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:59,600
determine how similar two chromosomes

1274
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:01,340
are if you if you bring two chromosomes

1275
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:03,380
together and you're attending to do a

1276
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:05,450
crossover you can run a function over

1277
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:07,460
them and determine if they're too

1278
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:09,169
similar if they're too similar you can

1279
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:11,990
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be dumped right back into the</font>

1280
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:13,520
pool and two more chosen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way if</font>

1281
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:14,959
because the two chromosomes are too

similar any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of crossover that</font>

00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:20,240
happens won't be all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that effective</font>

1284
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:25,009
we're preventing incest which I hear is

1285
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:27,200
taboo we're not trying to make species

1286
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:29,000
we're just trying to make populations

1287
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:31,279
might get more diverse another

1288
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,930
possibility is creating<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think john</font>

1289
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">holland father this one as well create a</font>

1290
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:36,649
mating tag which is we put a tag<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

1291
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:38,359
chromosome which says I'm

1292
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:40,910
you know I don't know blood type B or

1293
00:53:38,359 --> 00:53:42,920
I'm this kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a mate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then when</font>

1294
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:44,690
you pass a function over it in that way

1295
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,400
does not to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually calculate how</font>

1296
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:48,680
similar it is just looks for the mating

1297
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,599
tag and says these two are<font color="#E5E5E5"> are exactly</font>

1298
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:56,868
are too similar so once again this

1299
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:59,650
doesn't happen I was time going oh and

1300
00:53:56,869 --> 00:54:06,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">my own was supposed to be almost done</font>

1301
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:08,150
all right I'll go faster uh well

1302
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:09,529
actually ok so the tuna<font color="#CCCCCC"> columns like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1303
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:11,660
said they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really well understood</font>

1304
00:54:09,529 --> 00:54:14,270
they're simple to describe in simple the

1305
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:16,549
code<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what the results you get end up</font>

1306
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:18,559
being pretty complicated schematic this

1307
00:54:16,549 --> 00:54:19,880
schematic<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not really i</font>

1308
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:23,089
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time to get into at this</font>

1309
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:25,369
point is basically was the original kind

1310
00:54:23,089 --> 00:54:27,349
of model that was come up with with how

1311
00:54:25,369 --> 00:54:30,369
these work and it's a theory where each

1312
00:54:27,349 --> 00:54:33,200
schema is basically a building block and

1313
00:54:30,369 --> 00:54:35,720
the theories of genetic algorithms focus

1314
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,490
on discovering and focusing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> recom</font>

1315
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:40,098
binding good building blocks in the

1316
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:42,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">highly paralyzed way and good solutions</font>

1317
00:54:40,099 --> 00:54:46,130
are made up of building blocks of good

1318
00:54:42,049 --> 00:54:48,259
building blocks so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's</font>

1319
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:49,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically the genetic algorithms and the</font>

1320
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:51,559
evolutionary algorithms is<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to</font>

1321
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,788
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> them out I have some code that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1322
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:55,099
was going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show that was written I</font>

1323
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:58,029
wrote that's an example of genetic

1324
00:54:55,099 --> 00:55:00,710
programming which basically is an

1325
00:54:58,029 --> 00:55:03,410
implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of genetic algorithms its</font>

1326
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:05,000
purpose is not to solve must make a

1327
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:09,339
solution but to actually make a program

1328
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,339
that is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best way to solve a problem</font>

1329
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:21,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">here does anybody have any questions</font>

1330
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:24,020
from that before<font color="#CCCCCC"> i bring this up okay so</font>

1331
00:55:21,529 --> 00:55:28,520
um basically what you see right here is

1332
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:30,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">uh there's some initial variables things</font>

1333
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:32,150
like the crossover probability of the

1334
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:36,200
mutation probability the maximum number

1335
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:37,940
of generations the maximum<font color="#E5E5E5"> chromosomes</font>

1336
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,379
we're going to have the maximum number

1337
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:41,420
of programs because this is basically

1338
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:45,049
building programs each chromosome is a

1339
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:46,640
program made up of instructions now this

1340
00:55:45,049 --> 00:55:48,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">is simple this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

1341
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:50,490
because basically what we've got here is

1342
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:52,890
a vm

1343
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:57,089
that vm basically takes a show that real

1344
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:59,129
quick that vm takes a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> limited</font>

1345
00:55:57,090 --> 00:56:03,240
amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of instructions as you can say</font>

1346
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:05,820
here it takes a dupe swap multiply add

1347
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:08,459
and cross and over check to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see if the</font>

1348
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:11,760
stacks over it just all those are the

1349
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:12,810
only options that it takes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're</font>

1350
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,330
going to do is we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a</font>

1351
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:17,759
program that this that uses this machine

1352
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:20,490
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> here to solve the problem and the</font>

1353
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,840
problem that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to solve or the</font>

1354
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:27,149
program<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem that we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1355
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:30,150
solve is<font color="#E5E5E5"> X cubed plus y squared plus Z</font>

1356
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:31,710
so very simple our fitness function is

1357
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:33,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very simple as well that's</font>

1358
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:38,730
really meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you what we've got</font>

1359
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:42,450
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you say we've got we've defined</font>

1360
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:44,130
our various variables I as you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

1361
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:46,470
here I've got what's called tier 1 tier

1362
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:48,360
2 and tier 3 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Max fit and that's</font>

1363
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:50,459
basically going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be our fitness and</font>

1364
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:53,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll show you the criteria that makes up</font>

1365
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:58,260
those there's those are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

1366
00:56:53,850 --> 00:57:00,420
important so if you see main the first

1367
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:04,050
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is it's</font>

1368
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:08,520
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do its Creed the setting up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1369
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:10,290
current population while we're before

1370
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:13,130
while we're within our max generation

1371
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:16,290
meaning where our number that we define

1372
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:19,800
we're well we initialize the population

1373
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:26,130
so take a quick look it's initialized

1374
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:28,050
population basically we're saying we've

1375
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:30,060
created a structure and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> creating</font>

1376
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:34,170
we're initializing each<font color="#E5E5E5"> member of that</font>

1377
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:37,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">structure and right there and basically</font>

1378
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:48,350
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a part of a program is fitness</font>

1379
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:48,350
as length fairly simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd</font>

1380
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:55,799
we initialize the population we perform

1381
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:57,920
our fitness check for the first time and

1382
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:02,040
then while we're during our generations

1383
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:08,580
we perform selection do the fitness

1384
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:11,940
check again a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> printing of stuff</font>

1385
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:15,060
and that's pretty much it that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> base</font>

1386
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:17,160
that's the fundamental of the of a

1387
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:18,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">genetic algorithm now the important</font>

1388
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,670
things at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point are what are its</font>

1389
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:23,220
fitness<font color="#E5E5E5"> is doing and how does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it do its</font>

1390
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:28,140
selection first thing we'll look as the

1391
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:31,799
fitness so the fitness check is

1392
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:36,080
basically we create a random solution

1393
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:40,350
for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> X cubed Y squared plus one we</font>

1394
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:41,730
then take that we make an answer based

1395
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,380
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so we create a random solution</font>

1396
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:48,180
for it we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just pop some numbers in there</font>

1397
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:50,070
we sent it to the virtual<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine and we</font>

1398
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:52,440
get results back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Fitness</font>

1399
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:55,170
basically says if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing back</font>

1400
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:57,660
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not a very good fit if we</font>

1401
00:58:55,170 --> 00:59:01,170
get one if we get a problem back but

1402
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:04,140
it's um we get a problem back it's

1403
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:07,770
possibly a pretty good to fit but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1404
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:09,359
get the answer back that from this from

1405
00:59:07,770 --> 00:59:17,100
our random selected number of characters

1406
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:19,790
then we know it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit right and</font>

1407
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:21,870
then it again then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just goes through</font>

1408
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:25,440
revaluing the fitness and saving the

1409
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:27,299
total fitness fairly simple once it once

1410
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,530
it's finished function is as you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

1411
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:32,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's fairly simple because their promise</font>

1412
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:34,800
trailer simple but basically we defined

1413
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:40,050
from telling it to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> through this</font>

1414
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:43,100
machine how to make the solutions and

1415
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:45,510
then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> celexa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> selection criteria</font>

1416
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:50,790
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> select process the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> select</font>

1417
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:56,040
parent let's say about this<font color="#CCCCCC"> 222 it's all</font>

1418
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:59,160
pretty straightforward and then perform

1419
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:01,710
reproduction we we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cross point we</font>

1420
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:04,319
use a random

1421
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:06,540
we use a random where the max is based

1422
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:10,619
on the current population and the

1423
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:13,170
program<font color="#CCCCCC"> the program</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> size add</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one then we</font>

1424
01:00:10,619 --> 01:00:15,300
run through different types of the

1425
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:18,420
different selection processes are

1426
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:20,760
different selection points and then we

1427
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:23,940
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a mutate point where basically</font>

1428
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:25,290
we just run through<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we do a random we</font>

1429
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:27,630
do a random number check again to make

1430
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:30,270
sure we actually want to mutate if we do

1431
01:00:27,630 --> 01:00:33,420
then we do the mutation we increase

1432
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:35,640
mutations and then the selection is

1433
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:38,070
basically based as you can see right

1434
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:40,980
there it just goes call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's like parrot</font>

1435
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:48,560
again and then form reproduction based

1436
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:51,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">on up here again so what I don't</font>

1437
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:53,490
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> get it for you this is a</font>

1438
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:55,830
combination of mine in somebody else's

1439
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:58,259
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to pull somebody else out of</font>

1440
01:00:55,830 --> 01:01:04,170
it and put mine back in but I wasn't

1441
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:05,820
fully done with it so um so<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh did you</font>

1442
01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:08,310
do plus<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really wanted to be in Java</font>

1443
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:14,420
not see but I hate translating things

1444
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:20,490
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> c</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to java uh that's pretty much it</font>

1445
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:22,290
does anybody have any questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1446
01:01:20,490 --> 01:01:29,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">right well thank you very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much oh yeah</font>

1447
01:01:22,290 --> 01:01:32,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">good oh so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I have to be honest</font>

1448
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:34,050
the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I've done secure in</font>

1449
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:35,310
my life but me learning genetic

1450
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:37,020
algorithms had really nothing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

1451
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:39,240
security so when I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about doing</font>

1452
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:40,500
this talk I talked with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of guys</font>

1453
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:41,819
as friends went from the ghetto hackers

1454
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:43,140
and we were trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out you</font>

1455
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:45,210
know what can we say was a good

1456
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:47,400
application for security for this and

1457
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:48,660
fried was very much like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

1458
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:52,650
to tell him<font color="#E5E5E5"> any applications they can</font>

1459
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:54,180
figure on their own but I you know if

1460
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:56,220
you do enough research you find one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1461
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:59,790
the big places<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is being used is in</font>

1462
01:01:56,220 --> 01:02:02,520
IDS's understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs because</font>

1463
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:05,099
basically what one in ids is is I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

1464
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:06,960
a problem and I've got a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1465
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:08,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">rules I need to compare it to and how do</font>

1466
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">I do that do I just run through every</font>

1467
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,030
single<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of them which would be an</font>

1468
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:13,410
exhaustive search<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically or is there</font>

1469
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:15,210
a smarter way to go through these rules

1470
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:17,580
and you know the calguns can tell

1471
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:19,050
with that and there's or using

1472
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:21,330
combination I've seen the<font color="#CCCCCC"> music</font>

1473
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:24,420
accommodation was simulated annealing to

1474
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:25,950
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do that so I don't have a I</font>

1475
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:26,880
was actually at one point<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking of</font>

1476
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:29,069
writing something that was a little more

1477
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,450
security based but it was it was taking

1478
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:33,089
too long but yeah that I mean that's

1479
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:36,180
fundamentally IDS's I've seen it used in

1480
01:02:33,089 --> 01:02:37,650
crypt analysis a little bit when looking

1481
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:45,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">through key spaces or something like</font>

1482
01:02:37,650 --> 01:03:01,670
that anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right all right</font>

1483
01:02:45,000 --> 01:03:01,670
well thank you very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much thank you</font>
