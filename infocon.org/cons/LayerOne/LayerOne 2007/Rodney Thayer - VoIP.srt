1
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:27,550
you put this on something different you

2
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,110
don't have my audio oh I see<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

3
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:41,500
have the mics and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking into got</font>

4
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:48,430
it yes I broke<font color="#CCCCCC"> my no I didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> break the</font>

5
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:55,170
mic I just clip off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mark just find</font>

6
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:57,610
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like that so that all right</font>

7
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,700
okay he's got reason sound good<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

8
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:02,110
um voice protocols aren't stable we're

9
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coming out with new products very</font>

10
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:07,270
fast which means people will tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

11
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,220
implement mistakes the vendors will take

12
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,710
shortcuts people will try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

13
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,940
market without bothering to do things

14
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,110
cleanly because they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

15
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,580
know everybody wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

16
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,200
their version of a white phone that also

17
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,509
plays music because Steve Jobs said he

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,460
might do that so you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of no</font>

19
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:24,640
race to market kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing and yet</font>

20
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,740
it's telephones so it's already legacy

21
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,630
stuff gear that I mean the current

22
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,250
generation of cisco phones were built in

23
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,630
the late 90s and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's</font>

24
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,909
perfectly reasonable because in the

25
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,759
phone world people take 10 min 10 years

26
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:38,320
to deploy a new phone system so whereas

27
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,150
you know you you walk into a shop and

28
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,009
found the running windows 98 we all go

29
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,930
ooh it I mean the vendor doesn't even

30
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:46,270
want you doing that and yet you can find

31
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:49,659
than those windows 98 vintage telephones

32
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:51,670
around with that level of technology and

33
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:54,310
security capability and that and all

34
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,510
that kind of stuff um new products that

35
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,659
keep coming out are coming out

36
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:59,920
vulnerable people are doing silly things

37
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,510
you know you hear stories about voice

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,000
phones being shipped with the debugging

39
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:06,460
turned on so if you bothered to rebuild

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,979
the canoe debugger gdv you could hook up

41
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,570
to the phone through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the debug port you</font>

42
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,980
know silly things like that so new

43
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,560
products are still<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming out vulnerable</font>

44
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,760
this is not like it's a solved problem

45
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,620
and I got to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a buzzword when I</font>

46
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,760
was doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides here so you know it</font>

47
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,350
used to be that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cool hot</font>

48
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,450
thing was to attack something that was

49
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,920
very popular like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows XP you know</font>

50
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,988
and as they get these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things more and</font>

51
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,910
more stable<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's sort of it's not the</font>

52
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:29,530
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cool target these days so</font>

53
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,500
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got you know like to cause celeb so</font>

54
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,610
I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> tarjay celebrate</font>

55
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,870
a new term which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know the hot</font>

56
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,370
target next week is going to be

57
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,650
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font>

58
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,940
to have XP to beat up anymore and of

59
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,620
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vista is all much more secure</font>

60
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,970
right so that's going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> boring so we</font>

61
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,400
have to anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're new targets</font>

62
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:47,520
coming out and what's a popular target

63
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,420
is something you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to think about the</font>

64
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,920
other reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about it is</font>

65
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,559
customers think they're buying secure

66
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,329
products you know Cisco is an example of

67
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,950
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because they put up billboards</font>

68
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,570
in Northern California that says they

69
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,910
sell secure networks doesn't mean they

70
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,980
sell secure networks you know if you pay

71
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">for an expensive billboard and pay a</font>

72
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,850
lawyer to sue some guy who you know

73
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:08,310
tries to do a talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> of black hat and then</font>

74
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,140
you ship VPN concentrators that use<font color="#E5E5E5"> FTP</font>

75
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,120
and clear text passwords to update the

76
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,679
configuration files then you've got a

77
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,450
what do you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus what do you do</font>

78
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,470
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going on here and the</font>

79
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,149
customers assume they're buying

80
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,430
something secure nobody ever get fired

81
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,530
for buying a cisco network right that

82
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,050
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I'm pointing out these</font>

83
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,150
issues in theory will make<font color="#E5E5E5"> things more</font>

84
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,739
secure going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward so this is you know</font>

85
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,930
one of those we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to make</font>

86
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,190
people's networks more safe and I'm not

87
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to break things I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not trying to</font>

88
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,170
hope the bad guys you know destroy the

89
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:39,600
world or<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything like that all right</font>

90
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:41,369
architecture this is basic stuff how

91
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,720
many of you are in with the lights off I

92
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,820
can't actually how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I ask questions</font>

93
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">who how would major have done this and</font>

94
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">win is contest I mean I can't buy asked</font>

95
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,230
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> you raised your hands I'm not</font>

96
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,640
going to see them<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I can't see</font>

97
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,859
any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you anyway let's try this anyway</font>

98
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,609
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you are managing a voice</font>

99
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:59,010
over IP network now<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a few brave</font>

100
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:01,530
souls how many of you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in</font>

101
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:04,048
the evaluation or purchase or deployment

102
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,560
or somewhere at that phase anybody going

103
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:09,989
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one you having a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good time</font>

104
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">20 over here some more how many of you</font>

105
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:17,910
are actively attacking voice networks

106
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:20,209
yeah yeah see good yeah fish barrel

107
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:24,479
point to reload yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really boring</font>

108
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:25,680
yes so anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the little just</font>

109
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,120
going through these remember when I'm

110
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,440
talking about components I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking</font>

111
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a bad guy at this point so I'm</font>

112
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,900
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about targets you know one</font>

113
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,210
man's product feature<font color="#CCCCCC"> set is another</font>

114
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,560
man's target list so these things are

115
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,020
what used to be private branch exchange

116
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">a--'s which means they're you know fully</font>

117
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,530
featured phone systems and if you talk

118
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,000
to an enterprise environment they expect

119
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,070
the phones to have all sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

120
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
doodads and gimcracks on them you are

121
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">supposed to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to get</font>

122
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,470
music on hold and follow me services and

123
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,480
conferencing and all sorts of cool

124
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,150
features they tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a thing a</font>

125
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,590
call manager at that's a cisco product

126
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,150
name but that's also the generic term

127
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:58,979
there's this widget in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle which</font>

128
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,090
is doing call processing in other words

129
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,250
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> target in the middle to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

130
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,810
after there's things that are doing

131
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,090
proxying because some of the protocols

132
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,710
were not designed to be nap friendly so

133
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,119
you have to have proxy capabilities so

134
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,680
there's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like sip</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rockies</font>

135
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,380
around doing that sipping session

136
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,450
initiation protocol there are gateways

137
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,400
there's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> old-fashioned plain old</font>

138
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,990
telephone system or pots you know so

139
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,239
there's gateways between the voice

140
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,220
systems and the pot system and gateways

141
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,690
between multiple voice systems so again

142
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,730
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got things at the edge and</font>

143
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,080
they're run by the phone department and

144
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,330
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know one would like to think these</font>

145
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,450
things were safe they apparently aren't

146
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,310
are not trusted because when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go start</font>

147
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,080
to do talks on or you know classes on

148
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,760
this and people you say what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

149
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,169
attacks do you expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see and they</font>

150
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,820
all assume some bad guys going to be

151
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:43,020
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a coffee shop in Beirut and</font>

152
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,909
you know connecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to their voice</font>

153
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:47,400
network and read the CEOs email because

154
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:49,530
the voice to potts gateway was stupid

155
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,929
something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

156
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,000
assume this is an issue then is all the

157
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:56,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">backend fancy stuff you've got directory</font>

158
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,960
servers so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

159
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,550
if you work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> an 80,000 person</font>

160
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,620
organization you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can pull up people's</font>

161
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,400
names and identify their phone number

162
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,320
and you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it through the phone</font>

163
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,179
that's all very cool that also means

164
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,469
that the right kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bot can crawl</font>

165
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,200
through and get your entire phone

166
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,310
directory and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you know what are you</font>

167
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,110
keeping your phone directory and if

168
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,460
you're lucky it's just names you know if

169
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,410
it's got titles and things like that you

170
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">get targeting information if I can find</font>

171
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:21,120
all your execs that travel and have

172
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:23,460
fancy things in their laptops or I can

173
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,600
find all the developers who you know how

174
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,859
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you are developers for big</font>

175
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,780
corporations have the source code of

178
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,909
admit<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to you you kept that laptop</font>

up in your room<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you get your second</font>

laptop down here you did do it that way

181
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,460
right and you're running cryptid<font color="#CCCCCC"> disks</font>

182
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,840
you know you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing this people</font>

183
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,710
can do targeting you got to think that

184
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,479
way you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to think like they're gonna</font>

185
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,669
be bad guys out there and then there's

186
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,740
voice mail servers you know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:49,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">times you eat i saw this about two weeks</font>

188
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:51,390
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> I keep collecting examples I'm</font>

189
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,520
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a conversation with the person</font>

192
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:58,950
crackberries for the executives and she

193
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,750
proceeds to check her voicemail

194
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,340
with me talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> her and she picks up</font>

195
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,530
her phone and goes bash bash bash bash

196
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,510
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> three-button</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know there's</font>

197
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,890
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a surfing over somebody else's</font>

198
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,480
shoulder to pick up there you know

<font color="#E5E5E5">password by looking at their keyboard</font>

200
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,650
you know if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> really good you can</font>

201
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:15,690
run exploits to do this with ssh by

202
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,830
catching keystrokes and their timing but

203
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,120
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to do any of that if they</font>

204
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a four character password they're</font>

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,840
all the same digit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they like will do</font>

206
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,039
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people watching so voicemail</font>

207
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,380
is a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great place to find weak</font>

208
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,180
passwords and of course nobody in

209
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:28,290
businesses or other other kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

210
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,150
environments<font color="#E5E5E5"> would ever leave private</font>

211

00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so anyway that's another</font>

213
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,120
target once you can get the phone system

214
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the you know all the data attack</font>

215
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,840
models together it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets kind of</font>

216
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,340
interesting of course then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got</font>

217
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,200
all the infrastructure stuff behind it

218
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,609
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> the phone people don't think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

219
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the network people may not think</font>

220
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,240
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you get this the standard</font>

221
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,800
things that you do in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a directory</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

222
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">what infrastructure environment but if</font>

223
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,280
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about them like targets about</font>

224
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,750
the phone system<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're they're more</font>

225
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,489
interesting targets interesting in

226
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,840
different ways so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like directory</font>

227
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,960
servers like these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are tied to</font>

228
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">Active Directory or something dhcp dns</font>

229
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,919
all these kinds of servers because the

230
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,630
phones are dumb the typical voice over

231
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,430
IP phone if it's an actual dedicated

232
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,450
instrument is stupid and speaking of all

233
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:11,790
sorts of information from the

234
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:13,830
infrastructure hopefully as log servers

235
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,210
although phones are even worse than

236
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,859
computers in general about having

237
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:19,620
instrumentation and then there's all the

238
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,060
routers and switches and stuff if sort

239
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,730
of in a perfect world the phones would

240
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,320
be like the voice over IP telephones and

241
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,180
things doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would just be standard</font>

242
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,090
network devices and so that wouldn't be

243
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:32,490
an interesting comment but you get

244
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:34,020
various vendors like<font color="#E5E5E5"> nortel and cisco</font>

245
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,580
where there are special things and

246
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,620
switches to know about handling phones

247
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,970
and their special things in the routers

248
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,190
and so somehow we've managed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

249
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:42,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">voice specific components and so now</font>

250
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll find products</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are voice over</font>

251
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,710
IP ready it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of like you know if</font>

252
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,000
you I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to keep track i haven't</font>

253
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:50,700
found one yet i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> waiting for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a voice</font>

254
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">over IP ready power strip you know nice</font>

255
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,550
dumb stupid power<font color="#E5E5E5"> strip and say you know</font>

256
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,020
because they're used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find SNMP</font>

257
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,510
manageable power strips even if they had

258
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,980
no computer in them or windy windows

259
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,630
compatible power strips<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean you see</font>

260
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,950
any strange things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be</font>

261
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:07,110
compatible because there were special

262
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:08,230
products<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so i've got oh that's</font>

263
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,180
interesting

264
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,710
all right you can't see the edge of the

265
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:14,650
slide you're not going to miss too much

266
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:16,240
anyway this is a diagram I ripped off

267
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,650
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> another presentation and apparently</font>

268
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,090
there's copy protection in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the diagram</font>

269
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:20,800
no actually the pictures are

270
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,090
sufficiently exotic those black clouds

271
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,349
were just clouds that said switch

272
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:26,560
network in them so there's nothing big

273
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:29,560
their classic voice network kind of

274
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,000
saying I've got phones up here tying

275
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,489
into switches that<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they have phones</font>

276
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,040
on them going to some switch fabric and

277
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,930
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's servers and desktops and</font>

278
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,370
things tied into some<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and that's</font>

279
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,959
tighten some of the switch fabric and

280
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,340
they're all plugged together and there's

281
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,330
various and sundry infrastructure stuff

282
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:46,420
in the middle that was what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in this</font>

283
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:48,670
box so now I've got my phones<font color="#E5E5E5"> and my</font>

284
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">computers tied together so the phones</font>

285
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,670
are a good path to attack the computers

286
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,620
and the computers are a good path to

287
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,939
attack the phones and apparently the

288
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,650
voice vendors don't actually draw

289
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,970
pictures like this and go<font color="#CCCCCC"> Luigi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

290
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:00,220
attack all those things<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the other</font>

291
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">places so you know this isn't a network</font>

diagram this is a targeting map you got

293
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:08,980
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now protocol</font>

elements so phones voice phones white

295
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,790
phones excuse me are doing a bunch of

296
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:14,260
voice protocols this is this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

297
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,569
here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they're doing all the</font>

298
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,890
extra bits to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> things work and this</font>

299
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,990
is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the places that the vendors</font>

300
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,730
will get things wrong or be sloppy and

301
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:24,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">therefore there's places you can have</font>

302
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,900
exploits happening so you get the usual

303
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,700
suspects for protocols for something

304
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,590
that's trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run as a simple dumb</font>

305
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,730
appliance the main ones kind of

306
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:33,100
interesting here is they'll tend to have

307
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,590
an HTTP server in them a web server in

308
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,660
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone so you can configure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it this</font>

309
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:40,000
means i have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a web server which means</font>

310
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:42,219
you know go back through your copies of

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,440
the archives of every web server attack

312

313
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,770
that on the phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's a little</font>

00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,530
stupid device and you know that might be

00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:52,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">worth doing then the lower level stuff</font>

316
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,640
it's all the usual kinds of protocols

317
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:57,160
with a few extra<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of modern fancy</font>

00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:03,819

<font color="#CCCCCC">they might be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> running TLS if they're</font>

324
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:13,480
boring protocol components right I mean

00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been building TCP implementations</font>

327
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,810
like that same with IP some of these

00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">things and yet phones can get these</font>

329
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">things wrong these days because they're</font>

330
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,579
products and they go through new

331
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,020
development cycles and then they're

332
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,490
adding in fancy extra features like

333
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,949
quality<font color="#E5E5E5"> of service so they can do</font>

control<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much bandwidth you get or</font>

to 1<font color="#CCCCCC"> X or some of these other extra</font>

337
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,190
features because they're trying to sell

338
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,960
hot new products and every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you add</font>

339
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,820
another protocol in is another chance

00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,050
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendor to screw it up and for</font>

341
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,420
them to shift the product with bad

342
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:49,359
defaults and for the people who deploy

343
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:51,670
it to configure it in securely or not

344
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,770
knowingly or unknowingly configure it in

345
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,030
securely so all these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are every</font>

346
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,079
time they add another feature to these

00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:58,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of things it adds another</font>

00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you could call it the attack surface</font>

350
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,270
but you know there's actually some a

351
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,130
technical study area called attack

352
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,720
surface analysis which requires<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,800
at code and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that and all I'm</font>

354
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,450
saying is every time they add a new

355
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,979
protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> buzzword on the marketing slick</font>

you can tell it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the product just</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">got a little dumber all right things</font>

that have happened in the past if we're

359

trying to do exploits in the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

360
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,939
useful to look at what's gone on in the

past most environments<font color="#CCCCCC"> slopes the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">computer stuff we've done you know we</font>

expect bugs in the past to have been

364
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:33,040
fixed<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we assume that you know if</font>

365
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:36,400
something gets talked about by cert and

366
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,709
on CNN and you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the media and</font>

00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft publishes patches against it</font>

00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:42,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">and blah blah blah that this would make</font>

369
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,109
things visible enough that other vendors

370
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,360
would figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about this so</font>

371
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,640
like ping of death finger death started

372
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,470
happening in the late 90s<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you think</font>

373
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">that anybody who built a test plan for</font>

374
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,650
an IP protocol stack since then would

375
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,730
have said all well we make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

376
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,770
a test for ping of death in there

377
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,450
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would want to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font>

378
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:01,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things keep coming up stuff like</font>

379
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:03,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in the voice world there's the</font>

380
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,390
standard space stuff so you got sip than

381
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:08,860
RTP and<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of ETF protocols and</font>

382
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:11,050
unfortunately because voice systems last

383
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,760
a long time vendors have this penchant

384
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,380
for doing proprietary protocols and

385
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,510
they'll get away with it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

386
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:19,030
closed environment in the old<font color="#E5E5E5"> days you</font>

387
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:20,470
bought<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7,000 phones from nortel and you</font>

388
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">bought all the nortel widgets to plug</font>

389
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,370
into your<font color="#E5E5E5"> phones and it all was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

390
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:27,160
closed system so nobody cared about the

391
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,540
protocols so the net result of that is

392
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,490
you get some old<font color="#E5E5E5"> things floating around</font>

393
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,959
crusty old protocols that didn't

394
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:36,089
work well when they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> brand new and</font>

395
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:39,069
and yet get used today so like in the

396
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:40,870
ccitt standard space that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the x.25</font>

397
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,220
and and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff that was around</font>

398
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:44,350
before the internet the stuff that was

399
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,480
popular in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80's they had a protocol co</font>

400
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,760
h.323 which was for video conferencing

401
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,950
and it had a call setup protocol called

402
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">H to 28 now in case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you hadn't noticed</font>

403
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:54,940
we're all using tcp/ip in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

404
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:56,680
these days and part of the reason is

405
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,660
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ccitt protocols were</font>

406
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,239
terribly complicated hard to implement

407
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,399
hard to make them interoperate and had

408
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:05,170
all sorts of encoding formats that were

409
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:06,910
too complicated and it was just a pain

410
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:08,589
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> neck to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it running</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but the</font>

411
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,610
phone vendors didn't notice this because

412
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:11,950
they were building things in their own

413
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:14,260
clothes little world and you then get

414
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:17,589
things like like attacks against<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

415
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,939
asn.1 ber encoding format which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

416
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:20,560
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happened in the SNMP</font>

417
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,390
world and it's happened in the

418
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,829
certificate world and then you know a

419
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:25,540
bunch of grad students in<font color="#CCCCCC"> finland</font>

420
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,880
bothered to write a<font color="#CCCCCC"> java program that</font>

00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">fuzzed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> h 2 28 and they suddenly can</font>

422
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,720
start finding bugs like this in phones

423
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,089
this is an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of something that</font>

424
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,100
happened and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the classical cycle</font>

of the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Avaya shipped phones they</font>

426
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,709
thought they tested them I'm not sure

427
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,480
how much they did I<font color="#E5E5E5"> assume they tested</font>

428
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:42,099
for something they certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't test</font>

00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,730
ever send that they assume they were in

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">they found a bunch of bugs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in that</font>

434
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,620
that's an example of this sort of thing

it becomes famous support protocols

you want people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have attacked web</font>

444
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,930
servers people have attacked<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ldap</font>

445
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,240

446
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:22,959
the directories people attack the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

447
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,490
and the phones the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP capabilities so</font>

448
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,619
they would tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these generic</font>

449
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:29,770

00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:32,260
having a badly implemented dhcp client

451
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:34,390
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I don't think Cisco</font>

452
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,920
actually invented dhcp but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think they</font>

453
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:38,290
had people<font color="#CCCCCC"> around when it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> invented</font>

454
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,760
so you think they'd get this right I'm

455
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:41,829
sorry that's that's a naive way to look

456
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,900
at it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in reality what happens is you</font>

457
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:44,270
know they've acquired some startup in

458
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,550
the last

459
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:48,920
five years which you know paid some

460
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,420
bunch of 55 programmers in India to

461
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,589
implement something really really fast

462
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,900
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've never implemented before</font>

463
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:55,460
and so you basically get fresh raw

464
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,319
implementations of things even out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

465
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,150
big big companies so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get you can</font>

466
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:03,320
get vulnerabilities in the in the most

467
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:05,209
boring places on the server side you get

468
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,980
the equivalent of kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things they</font>

469
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,480
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing call management it was</font>

470
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,130
this box in the middle of a call manager

471
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,830
and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to send it control</font>

472
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:16,700
messages he's got more lights he's

473
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:18,350
putting on anyway well I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> more it</font>

474
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,880
because I can't see the clock I can't

475
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,580
see my keyboard anyway because it's

476
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">designed to record I know so the call</font>

477
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,730
manager in the middle is accepting

478
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,140
messages from the phones and they again

479
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,360
think it's a benign environment so

480
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,530
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> things like there's a message</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

481
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,300
get sent when you pick up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> phone and</font>

482
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,280
pick up the handset and the phone goes

483
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">off-hook you know well what happens if</font>

484
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,579
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10,000 those a second hitting</font>

485
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,340
the callmanager they don't think things

486
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,900
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's like a one packet UDP</font>

487
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:44,600
message in some cases so it would be

488
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:46,160
simple to do that and again there's it's

489
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,200
a server in the middle so all the usual

490
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,410
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of server attacks like ldap and dns</font>

491
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,450
and DCP and stuff like that if this is a

492
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,640
you end up with some protocols which are

493
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:57,020
new new enough that other people haven't

494
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,490
bothered to attack them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they might</font>

495
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,650
be looked at if you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

496
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:03,080
out the phones like if you can screw up

497
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:04,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">the quality of service processing you</font>

498
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">can make it so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bandwidth management</font>

499
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,209
for the phones is bad and then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

500
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,119
the phone audio<font color="#E5E5E5"> quality can be reduced</font>

501
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:12,800
so in the voice world you can do denial

502
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,510
of service attacks much easier because

503
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,740
people are listening to the signal and

504
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,390
you know if you screw up the timing on

505
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,160
somebody's<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP connection and the pack</font>

506
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,690
it has to do packet retry underneath

507
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,459
your browser you're not going to see

511
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:30,740
do that right and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know normal people</font>

512
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,150
wouldn't mundanes would not do that but

513
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,550
they'll notice the phone quality go

514
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">glitching if you've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got the audio stream</font>

517
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,500
had some of these newer protocols you

518
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,780
can get cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it's a place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

519
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,430
off and bother to attack that you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I haven't I know I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">think there's any buzzers against qos</font>

522
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,500
values you know at the moment but that's

523
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,550
that's the kind of thing somebody would

524
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,190
go off and

525
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:57,450
then there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the infrastructure bits</font>

526
00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:01,080
remember I do all the switches and extra

527
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:03,060
networks there the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco example its</font>

528
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,699
systems done a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

529
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,290
early in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of voice over IP and so</font>

530
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,180
because they've done a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> good stuff</font>

531
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:11,340
there's a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of examples of little</font>

532
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,170
mistakes they made here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so</font>

533
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,179
they have this thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> called CDP which is</font>

534
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:16,650
cisco discovery protocol so mistake

535
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,810
number one they have a proprietary

536
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:20,610
protocol they didn't do a standard space

537
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:22,409
one which is cool and hip and that's the

538
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,870
way cisco does things but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font>

539
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">that cisco invented and only people who</font>

00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">reviewing it and you know they don't sit</font>

542

around thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to attack</font>

543
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,620
it apparently so you'll get stunts<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

544
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,660
they did the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco discovery protocol</font>

545
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:39,780
message that comes out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a phone that</font>

546
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:42,060
says hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm a cisco phone and when you</font>

547
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,770
turn on network access control speaking

548
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,300
of endpoint security here you turn on

549
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:48,270
network access control on your cisco

550
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,310
switches under some conditions if a

551
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:52,590
phone sends the CDP message<font color="#E5E5E5"> says hi on</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the phone it says oh well i'll let you</font>

553
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,679
on the network anyway because you're not

00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:57,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">a windows box so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't ask you to run</font>

all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that network access control software</font>

556
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,830
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have to let you in now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">20 years to do with real protocols and</font>

563
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,230
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I can generate a CDP packet</font>

564
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,060
that says hi I'm a phone and you know

565
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,860
everybody can do that is just do a wire

566
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:22,260
sharp trace and take the packet replay

567
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:26,010
it it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> not hard so you get this</font>

proprietary protocol which was trying to

570
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:31,440
wedge some features in past the you know

571
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">past the protocol stack can end up</font>

572
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,960
causing flaws there are network access

573
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:39,810
control based issues other than CDP

574
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,150
there was a report about a week ago some

575
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:45,179
kid in some high school got expelled

576
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:48,030
because they turned on knack at his high

577
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,980
school and apparently<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you report back</font>

578
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,750
to the knack software that your

579
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,310
operating system is the null string it

580
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,200
assumes you're a phone or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like</font>

581
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:57,899
that and it just lets you on the network

582
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,140
and this kid found this disgusting flaw

583
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:04,559
in their protocol and Exploited it and

584
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,970
so he got expelled<font color="#E5E5E5"> which you know</font>

585
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,799
it's a kid maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> he shouldn't have been</font>

586
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,360
jacking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the school's computers you know</font>

587
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:11,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that whole philosophy good</font>

588
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,620
boy bad boy debate but the vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> ships</font>

589
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,139
something that was configured this way

590
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:18,928
and they put it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> high school so that</font>

591
00:20:16,139 --> 00:20:20,340
says the requirements were screwed up it

592
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:22,100
says the implementation<font color="#E5E5E5"> was screwed up</font>

593
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,908
it says the deployment was screwed up

594
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,199
you know it says whoever did the

595
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:26,610
security review was like we're putting

596
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,799
it in high school so there's high school

597
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:30,178
kids out there you know as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font>

598
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,289
bought a copy of hackers you know when

599
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:32,999
you freeze frame it at the point where

600
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:34,799
engine unusual Angelina Jolie looks the

601
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:35,850
cutest you know it open it's like what

602
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,100
high school kids haven't heard of

603
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,840
hackers hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wow let's see you gotta do</font>

604
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,408
an age check now so anybody here was in

605
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,699
high school no they're hiding no okay

606
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,110
fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> well it's a weekend you never can</font>

607
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,649
tell kind of scruffy characters show<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

608
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:51,289
these conferences anyway um

609
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:54,449
infrastructure protocols IP layer things

610
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:56,070
you know we we've been finding you know

611
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,389
we do goofy little things just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

612
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're trying to get warmed up to do</font>

613
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,418
some work<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out if you send</font>

614
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:03,240
different linköping messages to cisco

615
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:05,999
phones you can sense what model phone it

616
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,940
is now if they can get that kind of

617
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:10,710
protocol implementation wrong and it's

618
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,600
cisco you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> presumably better</font>

619
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:15,990
than you know some random vendor and

620
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,428
taiwan who's making<font color="#CCCCCC"> cloned phones so you</font>

621
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,869
know they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get it wrong other people</font>

622
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:20,340
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get it wrong and IP is an</font>

623
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:22,889
example of something they screwed up the

624
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,418
ping time the ping message format and

625
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:25,830
these things are written<font color="#E5E5E5"> down and have</font>

626
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:27,509
been for 20 years it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

627
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:30,149
an exotic old protocol exotic new

628
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:32,249
protocol it's hard to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> arp things you</font>

629
00:21:30,149 --> 00:21:33,899
know once<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've got phones hooked up the</font>

630
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,190
switches now the switches are part of

631
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:37,949
the critical infrastructure for my

632
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:39,419
phones and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> even better to freak</font>

633
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,379
people out by dropping all the phones in

634
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:42,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">a building than dropping all the</font>

635
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:45,090
computers because it scares more people

636
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:47,249
and so things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> arp storms screwing</font>

637
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:48,570
on with our tables and switches trying

638
00:21:47,249 --> 00:21:50,249
to make the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and think that the</font>

639
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,360
same phone is on seven different ports

641
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,350
icky things you used to do to to to

642
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:56,879
attack switches<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're back in that back</font>

643
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:59,189
in two thousand when much was giving

644
00:21:56,879 --> 00:22:01,289
switch tak talks at black hat you know

645
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:03,539
all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> old crusty stuff try it because</font>

646
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:05,220
it might still work because you know the

647
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:06,899
phone system<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinks it's a closed system</font>

648
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,220
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not and they assume</font>

649
00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:10,830
nobody would ever know the protocol is

650
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,740
running inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the boxes all right</font>

651
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,689
vendor behavior again

652
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,700
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the bashing here and I use</font>

653
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:18,440
specific vendor names but the point is

654
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,320
you end up watching people do these

655
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,400
patterns and you end<font color="#E5E5E5"> up wanting it's a</font>

656
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,710
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to think about this because</font>

657
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,120
you can see where they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going and</font>

658
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,590
where they're not spending their energy

659
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so you can use that to identify</font>

660
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:32,480
possible areas to attack things<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

661
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so let me tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you who I'm talking</font>

662
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,010
about / vendors just get calibrated here

663
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:39,409
you got the people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

664
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:41,030
telephone hardware like<font color="#E5E5E5"> avaya and nortel</font>

665
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:44,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">know companies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that used to make</font>

666
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:46,490
telephone gear sort of pre<font color="#CCCCCC"> ATT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> break up</font>

667
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:49,070
the first time you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

668
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:51,309
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they have started doing</font>

669
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:53,600
networking stuff also<font color="#E5E5E5"> in various ways</font>

670
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:55,040
abaya you know can't figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

671
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,260
spell switched and so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> new deals</font>

672
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,210
with extreme or various other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people you</font>

673
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,559
get people<font color="#E5E5E5"> like nortel who bought Bay</font>

674
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">networks so they actually have all the</font>

675
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,399
gear themselves if they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run it</font>

676
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,140
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you get other combinations</font>

677
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,150
then you get a network hardware vendors

678
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,800
like Cisco and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3.com but where you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

679
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,690
a cisco<font color="#E5E5E5"> now grew into doing the phone</font>

680
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,300
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the from the the networking</font>

681
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:15,500
side and 3.com I don't know I well as a

682
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,419
tipping point person the room so<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

683
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,920
not say<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything too snarky about 23</font>

684
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,330
combi know it kind of looks like they

685
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,710
kind of slink out of town stop building

686
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,780
routers and switches and terminal

687
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,250
servers and ethernet cards and started

688
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,800
declaring themselves a phone company

689
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,750
that had an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ids subdivision near as I</font>

690
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,280
can tell that's what they did I've said

691
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,690
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in front of the 3com engineering</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VP</font>

692
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,850
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he actually didn't like stop me but</font>

693
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:36,050
anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3com used to be a network</font>

694
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,370
hardware vendor and now they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

695
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:38,690
phones so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> curved why i put this</font>

696
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:40,520
in the category you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> three comments</font>

697
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:42,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">no excuse for getting any protocol wrong</font>

698
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,670
in any phone they ever ship ever since

699
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:46,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">they were around when the ethernet</font>

700
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:48,200
standard was written so no excuses none

701
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,760
anyway then you get the network

702
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,830
operators who are also doing goofy

703
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,330
things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got singular and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Verizon</font>

704
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,309
and orange and you know whoever else is

705
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,840
out there and they again think they're

706
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:59,389
in a closed environment they can just

707
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,580
control the entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing and that gives</font>

708
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:04,580
a really bad security attitude if they

709
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,899
have any security clue at all then you

710
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:09,379
get the instrument vendors you know

711
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,910
voice phones are cool so voice over IP

712
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,470
phones are cool so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to have</font>

713
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:15,530
the you know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

iphones from 3.com<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean from the 3com</font>

715
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:18,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">no that's not one of the iphone vendors</font>

716
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:20,149
who from<font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco or apple and then you</font>

717
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have you know you go to see bid</font>

718
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:24,470
or some show like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they'll be</font>

55,000<font color="#CCCCCC"> taiwanese vendors of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> voice phones</font>

720
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:28,380
you know with a big sign that says worse

721
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:30,120
we do 40 bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> WEP on our wireless phones</font>

722
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:33,000
or you know like stuff like that that

723
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,139
really happens so you get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

724
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,610
as it turns<font color="#CCCCCC"> into more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and more of a</font>

725
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">commodity you'll get more and more</font>

726
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:39,030
phones that are are vulnerable coming

727
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,370
out because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll be the chief</font>

728
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:43,649
products then you get the protocol stack

729
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:45,000
houses one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ways that works when</font>

730
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:47,190
you get a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol rolling through</font>

731
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,870
the industry is you'll find there'll be

732
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:52,170
some bunch of guys in a corner somewhere

733
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:54,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">as we know how to build sip or RTP or</font>

734
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:56,520
secure RTP or they figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to</font>

735
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,350
reverse engineer at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco's voice</font>

736
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,330
protocol when they have a piece of

737
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:02,010
software that runs on windows XP that

738
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:05,189
makes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> soft phone something like that</font>

739
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:06,480
so those days those folks who used to be

740
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:09,570
called Stackhouse's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol</font>

741
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,580
stack houses they'll sell a protocol

742
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:13,379
stack to a vendor like they'll sell it

743
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:15,169
to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Korean mobile phone vendor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">having voice over IP that kind of thing</font>

745
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:19,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is cool because you can you know as</font>

746
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:20,129
a company trying to build a product you

747
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,570
don't actually have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hire engineers</font>

748
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:23,280
you just find somebody who's already got

00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:25,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">it in your write a check that's cool</font>

750
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">that way it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not cool from the point of</font>

751
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:30,420
view if you get no genetic diversity and

752
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,040
we have seen issues with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the SNMP</font>

753
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,120
vulnerabilities that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ripped</font>

754
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,879
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five years</font>

755
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:38,850
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're partially because SNMP</font>

756
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,470
research was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the primary vendor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of SNMP</font>

757
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:41,760
implementations and they had the same

758
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:43,920
code in lots and lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors</font>

759
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,450
products and therefore they had the same

760
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,640
vulnerabilities and lots and lots of

761
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:49,080
vendors products so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really should</font>

762
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,340
pay some kid in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back room to build</font>

763
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,199
this protocol with their bare hands in

764
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,120
some cases because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know otherwise</font>

765
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:57,350
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just as bad as your</font>

766
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:00,330
competitors in terms of security<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues</font>

767
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:02,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right then their priorities now this</font>

768
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">is obvious to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of us but I need to</font>

769
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:05,610
remind you<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this because I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking</font>

770
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">about why you would look at how where</font>

771
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:08,250
would you look for potential

772
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:09,360
vulnerabilities so you know they're

773
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,460
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about stockholder value</font>

774
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,659
it's like you know notice customers have

775
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're like I have to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down to</font>

776
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,380
number six before<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in so</font>

777
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,760
there's stockholder value which means

778
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,810
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell stuff it doesn't</font>

779
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,370
actually have to work they just have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

780
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:22,950
sell it and then there's the image

781
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:24,389
because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look cool you know so</font>

782
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:27,240
we have to have cisco phones being

783
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,950
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a product placement on Eureka</font>

784
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,390
watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> that TV show it's like you ever</font>

785
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,550
notice with all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the executives have</font>

786
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:34,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">cisco voice phones so they're doing</font>

787
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">product placement things so you know we</font>

788
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,900
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to build real code we can</font>

789
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually get our products and placed in</font>

790
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,270
scenes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hollywood</font>

791
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,440
must be cool you know market share is

792
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,690
important so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to have your</font>

793
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,190
product out everywhere your market

794
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,630
position whether you know you know come

795
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:48,220
up with some statistic to cook to say

796
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,740
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of something than</font>

797
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,390
somebody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you get the</font>

798
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:54,310
optional things like maybe it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be nice</font>

799
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:55,510
that the product was stable it doesn't

800
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:57,370
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be it has to get through</font>

801
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:59,410
the sales process I mean the demo has to

802
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:00,699
not blow up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have to stay a thing</font>

803
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,560
has to stay alive long enough so the

804
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,480
check clears from the customer but<font color="#E5E5E5"> after</font>

805
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not clear it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can be</font>

806
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,140
anything after that customer

807
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,940
satisfaction is optional you know

808
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,320
they're thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the suit they're</font>

809
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,690
selling the phone systems to they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

810
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,340
care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the geek way to keep it alive</font>

811
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:16,930
so that's way down there and security<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

812
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,610
very optional secure nobody would care

813
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:20,260
about security you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no</font>

814
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:21,729
nobody really cares<font color="#CCCCCC"> above this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

815
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,700
it's a Looby okay if the entire phone

816
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:26,410
system died right so there's that's way

817
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,610
down the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so if you're trying to</font>

818
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:29,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about where to look for weaknesses</font>

819
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:30,909
in people's products you got to remember

820
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,550
this sort of priority kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing here</font>

821
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:35,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">so a sexy phone that had you know a</font>

822
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:38,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">voice over IP phone that had Dolby 5.1</font>

823
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:39,940
surround sound and looked really cool if

824
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,010
you were running it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Brit of the</font>

825
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,050
command center and on Stargate Atlantis

826
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:45,490
when they were dialing the gate make it

827
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:47,260
push a button and it related to the gate

828
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:48,670
dialing protocol that would be so worth

829
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,140
putting that feature in there and I

830
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:51,340
don't care if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does clear text telnet</font>

831
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:53,620
sending JavaScript that's

832
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,760
unauthenticated with local control it

833
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,669
would be fine that would be that would

834
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:59,050
be an acceptable product plan so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

835
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:03,670
a who knows what they're going to think

836
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:06,310
like stupid vendor tricks vendors do

837
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:08,500
some dumb things that they don't realize

838
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">that look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this from the outside</font>

839
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:12,070
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you know developers you know</font>

840
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:13,480
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know developers don't stand up</font>

841
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:14,620
here and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to other people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

842
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,510
know hide in the back room and drink

843
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:19,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jolt Cola and write code</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know</font>

844
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:21,850
whatever and so this like<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some</font>

845
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:24,550
disconnects<font color="#CCCCCC"> that astounding that you see</font>

846
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:25,840
in big and small companies they'll tend

847
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:28,120
to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> things on a resource-poor</font>

848
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,879
platform they'll make comments like I

849
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,790
can put Dolby 5.1 surround sound in and

850
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,290
i can add 506 different chips in there

851
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:37,090
to do enough crypto to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> digital</font>

852
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:38,620
rights management soleta can ship<font color="#E5E5E5"> iTunes</font>

853
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,870
because they signed a license with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple</font>

854
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:43,179
but God forbid I could digitally sign

855
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:44,620
anything in the protocols they'll say oh

856
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,720
I can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have no</font>

857
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,800
resources well they do have the chips

858
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,170
they just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend the money in the</font>

859
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">right place they'll do partial protocol</font>

860
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,389
implementation

861
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:53,529
you keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> going until it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> works good</font>

862
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:55,869
enough and then you stopped you don't

863
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:58,299
actually build the whole protocol they

864
00:28:55,869 --> 00:29:00,070
don't do testing this is sort of some

865
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:02,049
vendors you know seem boobs are develop

866
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,789
this habit over sort of the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

867
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:05,710
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's okay to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not test things</font>

868
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:07,570
very much just sort of ship them out

869
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,669
there you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customers will test</font>

870
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:11,470
them during beta test you know the the

871
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:12,759
the Microsoft example not not the

872
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:14,619
Microsoft anything wrong with this but

873
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:16,539
you look at some of the numbers that you

874
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:18,459
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> auntie's betta run was seventy</font>

875
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:20,259
thousand users or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

876
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:23,440
they have 70,000 idiots out there doing

877
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:25,359
free QA it wasn't really freaky way but

878
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a net result of these long beta</font>

879
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:28,840
programs that people have so you end up

880
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">with free testing coming out of the</font>

881
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,570
customers so why pay for Q wave if you

882
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">can get the customers to do it for free</font>

883
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:36,158
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've sent you a check they</font>

884
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,509
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to add security requirements</font>

885
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,009
you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea that I might attack</font>

886
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:42,369
the phone didn't seem to occur to these

887
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:44,529
people and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these products are</font>

888
00:29:42,369 --> 00:29:46,059
going to design it certainly after the

889
00:29:44,529 --> 00:29:47,619
industry started to become security

890
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:50,139
literate so you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco phone</font>

891
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,999
that was designed<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 1998 and maybe it's</font>

892
00:29:50,139 --> 00:29:54,279
okay that had few security features you

893
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:56,019
know any<font color="#CCCCCC"> cisco phone that shipped in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

894
00:29:54,279 --> 00:29:57,669
past two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a supposedly fresh</font>

895
00:29:56,019 --> 00:29:59,379
product and fresh code you know what's

896
00:29:57,669 --> 00:30:00,580
your Excuse why do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think nobody's</font>

897
00:29:59,379 --> 00:30:02,350
been doing bad things to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

898
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:05,289
the past two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they got</font>

899
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:07,119
that kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a in effect they wanted to</font>

900
00:30:05,289 --> 00:30:08,710
feature creep so you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> week I've</font>

901
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,749
got a phone next week I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to phone</font>

902
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:12,190
with the display then I want to display

903
00:30:10,749 --> 00:30:14,289
with a web server in it then i'm going

904
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:16,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to download images then i want to sound</font>

905
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:18,429
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to play music then it's got</font>

906
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:20,169
to play itunes then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have to do camera</font>

907
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:22,090
phones and just keep going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and going</font>

908
00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:23,529
going adding features into these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

909
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,629
and every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time they add more features</font>

910
00:30:23,529 --> 00:30:29,019
you get more integration points where

911
00:30:25,629 --> 00:30:30,668
they can potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> have flaws they</font>

912
00:30:29,019 --> 00:30:34,600
don't seem to understand modern networks

913
00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:36,999
the phone telco types doing doing this

914
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,469
product<font color="#CCCCCC"> review thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I did I talked to a</font>

915
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:39,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">bi and I'm trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to configure their box</font>

916
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:42,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I said so where do i plug in the</font>

917
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:44,350
syslog server you know it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine</font>

918
00:30:42,249 --> 00:30:47,649
it's on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the net I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to look at</font>

919
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:49,209
the IP packets it's a server so I asked

920
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:50,199
how to plug in syslog I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

921
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:52,450
a fair question what do you do for

922
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,700
logging and their response was what

923
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:56,169
logging I said you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you do</font>

924
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,070
if you have like customers have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue</font>

925
00:30:56,169 --> 00:30:58,299
and they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see if there was a</font>

926
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,889
glitch in the product and their response

927
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:01,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">though is oh there's an analog port in</font>

928
00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:01,530
the back and the think and phone home

929
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:03,960
and have the

930
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:05,490
air guy come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out it's like we don't need</font>

931
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,470
logging who would need logging of things

932
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,820
you know now that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a little</font>

933
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,290
better now because you get things like

934
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,850
regulatory requirements which so you

935
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:13,620
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to see the logs and show</font>

936
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:16,740
the auditors so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a little</font>

937
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:18,629
better I'm finding<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you should do</font>

938
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,430
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it more secure nobody</font>

939
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:22,260
pays attention to me if I say if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

940
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,940
don't do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may fail the audit and</font>

941
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,820
the CIO gets to explain it to the boss

942
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,260
that gets money sometimes you might fail

943
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,460
the audit is apparently a good pick up

944
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,920
line to get people to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> money on</font>

945
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,910
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps if you can prove it but</font>

946
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,360
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that's still it gets some</font>

947
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:38,910
thinking it actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets them thinking</font>

948
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:41,250
so I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about security or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> role</font>

949
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:42,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">based management or auditability or any</font>

950
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,620
of these things we're trying to do in

951
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,750
the rest of the networking world of

952
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:47,790
trying to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> things better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

953
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:49,770
they do proprietary protocols now we

954
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:52,050
keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> going through this people build a</font>

955
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:53,790
proprietary protocol you know six guys

956
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:55,560
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the back room or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe one guy in the</font>

957
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:57,690
back room you know designs this thing

958
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,830
cooks it up thinks it up prototypes it

959
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:00,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">ships</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the code all the rest of the</font>

960
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:02,610
developers they put this thing in the

961
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:05,310
product they assume you know they show

962
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:07,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">key way all the cool features and nobody</font>

963
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:09,240
ever actually bothers to fuzzy or check

964
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,889
it for validity or see if there's any

965
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,930
edge cases or that kind of thing and

966
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:15,180
then it gets deployed to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> field and</font>

967
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:16,890
then some high school student in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Germany</font>

968
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,930
whose board sits around you know rights

969
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:20,700
of poor line perl script it<font color="#CCCCCC"> fuzzes</font>

970
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:22,050
something and things fall over you know

971
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,430
we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> this happen over and over</font>

972
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,810
again maybe we offer you know maybe

973
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:27,510
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Perl scripts longer than four</font>

974
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:28,830
lines but not necessarily and so

975
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:30,720
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> if there's a proprietary</font>

976
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:32,340
protocol on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> product it's flawed you</font>

977
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,630
know just day one it's flawed because

978
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,280
somebody's don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find something someday</font>

979
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:37,740
because you that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have peer</font>

980
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:39,480
review and standards protocols processes

981
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,820
and all that kind of stuff because this

982
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,200
is a bad idea and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know we all the</font>

983
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:45,060
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> business learned this a long</font>

984
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,440
time ago but the vendors keep doing that

985
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,120
because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cool way to you know</font>

986
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,310
do the shared all about the shareholder

987
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,870
value kind of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know and</font>

988
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:54,090
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> being optional we don't care</font>

989
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:55,260
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so if it's got proprietary</font>

scary things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I bet there's aren't</font>

1002
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:18,179
already there so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> something will</font>

1003
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:20,769
be it'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to bring in new people</font>

1006
00:33:22,899 --> 00:33:26,979
so you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> this bad cycle if they do a</font>

proprietary protocol you know the five

guys who built it bring build the first

1009

version it works fine then they

1010
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:35,320
outsource all the code to dr. Stan and

1011
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:37,359
give them<font color="#E5E5E5"> the protocol spec which wasn't</font>

it's also probably not got to do with

00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:11,290
should be a life cycle process and they

1059
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:13,270
should have specs and requirements

1060
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,740
documents and test plans and all all

1061
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:16,079
that stuff they teach you in school that

people do when they develop<font color="#E5E5E5"> software</font>

1063
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,130

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these processes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you can find</font>

1065
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:24,280
things where their deficiencies you can

1066
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:25,750
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an outsider when you start</font>

00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,580
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at products you know if they</font>

ship you a product<font color="#E5E5E5"> with spelling errors</font>

1069
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:32,470
in the text messages coming out of it

1070
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:33,670
that's a signal if you see you know if

1071
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:36,250
you go read<font color="#CCCCCC"> the release notice you</font>

discover<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the qos implementation in</font>

1073
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:39,670
the phone you're looking at has been

1075
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,850
weeks because they keep getting it wrong

1076
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,460
and obviously that codes brittle and

1077
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:46,810
unstable so you can see things by

1078
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,760
looking at the deficiencies and software

00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:55,480
by screwing up that they can not to be

1082
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,530
security literate they don't assume they

1083

have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry about this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff until</font>

things they went to edge case testing

1095
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,900
can tell this is going on because when

1096
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:22,810
people sell things like like the new

1097

1100
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:30,370
to see if it's got flaws you know those

1101
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:31,750
things sell well if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're if all the</font>

1102
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:33,220
vendors already had this working they

better because they weren't doing it at

1107
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,030
all before you get vendors who will ship

1108
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,940
things that they say well you know put a

1109

firewall in front of that cisco routers

1110
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:51,520
if you plug in the FX I fxo card which

is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing that has the analog phone</font>

1113
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:57,400
in and you turn on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine and you</font>

1114
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:59,950
bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> up you enable the interface it</font>

1115
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:03,070
turns on h.323<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is the protocol</font>

1117
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:07,240
that's fine but it turns h.323 on with

1118
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:08,950
no authentication at all which means if

1119
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">you take your randoms windows but random</font>

00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,100
authentication that wouldn't stop you

1126

answer was oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> well that's just the way</font>

1130
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:31,290
it is you were supposed to do enough

1131
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:33,240
switch<font color="#CCCCCC"> AP a CL</font>

1132
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:34,890
between that you'd stop it so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1133
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,799
like you know Don't Ask Don't Tell don't

1134
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:39,240
don't attack you know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing it's</font>

1135
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it's okay i can ship an insecure</font>

1136
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,790
product because you could put enough

1137
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:43,529
layers of stuff in front of it so it

1138
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:45,420
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm calling us</font>

1139
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:48,510
prophylactic solutions and that is a

1140
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,890
technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> term not a rude comment but</font>

1141
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:51,300
you know it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll put a firewall in</font>

1142
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:53,220
front of Mike my product because it's

1143
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,810
too weak people think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a</font>

1144
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,839
reasonable thing to say when they sell

1145
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:59,820
products that's just silly in my opinion

1146
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:01,710
um vendors day they want to do network

1147
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,000
access control so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know cuz you know</font>

1148
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:04,890
endpoint security is hot you know

1149
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,450
addison-wesley paid my buddy mark to

1150
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:08,040
write this book<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1151
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,629
care about endpoint security and you

1152
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,980
pick up the news you know newspapers

1153
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,150
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> cover these things and they're</font>

1154
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">all talking about network access control</font>

1155
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:15,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">and network knack and nap and all these</font>

1156
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:18,480
other you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it starts with and it's a</font>

1157
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:20,220
three-letter buzzword that's all fine

1158
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,690
and good except then you discover they

1159
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:23,640
normally men network access control

1160
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:25,860
means control of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows desktops</font>

1161
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,450
which is nice windows desktops should be

1162
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:29,610
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right antivirus software and</font>

1163
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:31,589
all that crap i agree but what about the

1164
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:33,900
printers and the phones and the access

1165
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:35,670
points<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all the other IP address of a</font>

1166
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:38,280
widget you have on your you know your

1167
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:40,530
network the the monitoring cameras that

1168
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,200
you put up outside every door that had a

1169
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:45,180
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a proximity card on it because</font>

1170
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">you went to the talk the other day you</font>

1171
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff is on your</font>

1172
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,220
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so they want to do network</font>

1173
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:52,710
access control and control everything

1174
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:54,779
and know every user and yet there you

1175
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:57,180
can't assume anymore that it's a

1176
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:58,950
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a human next to it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1177
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:00,330
can identify the user name you know

1178
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:03,240
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the username for the phone</font>

1179
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:05,009
outside the door to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the garage that you</font>

1180
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:08,100
can you know pick up the call in you

1181
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:09,450
know there's no user there so they kind

1182
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,250
of their schizophrenic about whether

1183
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:12,839
knack is in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture or not and they</font>

1184
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:14,640
act like everything has a network access

1185
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:16,980
control and it's all the world is now

1186
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,240
safe well the world isn't now safe the

1187
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:22,260
world is now safe if you have a really

1188
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,029
simple network they you know they date

1189
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,650
sheet on the the non voice protocols the

1190
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:27,360
protocol stacks all that stuff they do

1191
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:28,980
immature implementations of the voice

1192
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,600
protocols that are there because printed

1193
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,850
rush products to market so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's standard</font>

1194
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,170
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of vendor flaws that happen he's</font>

1195
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:35,549
added another light obviously the

1196
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:39,570
questioning is going to increase here

1197
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:41,010
and then they have a flawed proprietary

1198
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:43,200
protocol so they keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing these kinds</font>

1199
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:44,130
of habits and you can watch the habits

1200
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,930
happen and then you can

1201
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,400
if they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of stuff you</font>

1202
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">can use that to identify this memory</font>

1203
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,090
flaws in their product<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're trying</font>

1204
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,919
to look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerabilities sir all</font>

1205
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:55,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anyway so sort of you know</font>

1206
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,400
vendors are stupid you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and it takes</font>

1207
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,560
a lot of vendors to change the light

1208
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,660
bulb and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be flaws in</font>

1209
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,370
the stuff just assume that so anyway

1210
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:05,609
that's kind of the attitude<font color="#E5E5E5"> going into</font>

1211
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:08,220
this and yes that's negative and snarky

1212
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:11,940
and all that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> unfortunately true more</font>

1213
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:14,870
than it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right predictions</font>

1214
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:16,560
let me just back up another one thing

1215
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,790
you know if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to write</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1216
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">zero-day about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know because</font>

1217
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,520
something you saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you're seeing</font>

1218
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,930
this you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't put my name in the</font>

1219
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,250
comments of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code just you know have</font>

1220
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:24,690
a good time whatever use some

1221
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,700
responsible disclosure procedure you

1222
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:27,840
know enjoy yourself whatever you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1223
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,279
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah I might predict something I</font>

1224
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,540
mean I'm not like<font color="#E5E5E5"> right all the time but</font>

1225
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,880
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> once a while actually do get</font>

1226
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:34,590
things right so anyway some predictions

1227
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,210
and the idea here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is think about things</font>

1228
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:37,620
i'm predicting if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to go</font>

1229
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">chasing vulnerability so you're trying</font>

1230
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:42,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look for if you're trying to go</font>

1231
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:45,510
hunting for things first thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1232
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:47,130
legacy telco stuff so before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1233
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:48,810
internet before the dot-com Internet

1234
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:51,120
boom thing you know we have these

1235
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:53,160
telephone networks that very fancy they

1236
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,839
had ISDN a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of other actually</font>

1237
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,850
fairly sophisticated protocols built in

1238
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,260
but they were all totally closed systems

1239
00:40:56,850 --> 00:41:00,210
and so they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> often completely</font>

1240
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,370
unsecured they have no passwords or they

1241
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:03,720
ran telnet or all those other kinds of

1242
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:05,819
ugly things that people used to do in

1243
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,709
the bad old days so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're pedasi</font>

1244
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:10,140
possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely unsecured targets</font>

1245
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:12,690
and if you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a modern</font>

1246
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:14,250
infrastructure the box that did the

1247
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:15,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">old-fashioned telco stuff may just be</font>

1248
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:18,390
across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the aisle from the brand new box</font>

1249
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:20,310
that does voice over IP which means you

1250
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:21,900
may have some internet accessible thing

1251
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:24,360
sitting across the aisle you know

1252
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:26,190
connecting to this old kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of gear and</font>

1253
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:28,890
so you may be allowing remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font>

1254
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:30,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">ability and these old protocols people</font>

1255
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:32,759
don't understand because you know

1256
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:33,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically it was before the ipod it</font>

1257
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,430
can't be<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-tech right away that's</font>

1258
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:37,080
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the boundary now you know if you</font>

1259
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:38,490

1294
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:58,000
happens if they have this kind of a box

00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,150
know they're assuming I'm sure they

1302
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:12,339
assume that nobody you know on the

internet today can spell ISDN remembers

1304

1319
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:40,868
you finish going through this agony to

program your motorola v3 razr<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1321
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:44,140
singular network when you get to the

1322
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:47,319
section where it says how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

1323
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:48,990
email it says put in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hostname and it</font>

1324
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:52,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">will send on port 25 to that host</font>

1325
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:54,600
anybody so all singular

1326
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:56,430
um internet limited literate phones are

1327
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:59,460
capable of<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to port 25 anywhere</font>

1328
00:43:56,430 --> 00:44:01,080
they don't block that going out so if

1329
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:09,510
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a really good spam</font>

1330
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:11,069
zombie<font color="#E5E5E5"> network take the phones yeah and</font>

1331
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:13,410
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> given this you know the passwords</font>

1332
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:20,670
up there on the website talk about the

1333
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:22,920
years worth yeah yeah and if you change

1334
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:25,050
your service plan for singular they seem

1335
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,730
to sometimes kind of reset your password

1336
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:29,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">on your voicemail also so they have</font>

1337
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:32,880
other problems but they're part of AT&T

1338
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:36,510
now so we're all safe yeah the new AT&T

1339
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,430
the new insecure apt so anyway futures

1340
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:39,690
areas they're going to be problems so

1341
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:41,850
there's all kinds of new platforms

1342
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:43,380
coming out<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got windows platforms</font>

1343
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:45,330
so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's windows and I mean I</font>

1344
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,500
gotta care is windows the thing is

1345
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:47,940
interesting is if you talk to someone

1346
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,970
who does work in the kind of embedded

1347
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:52,410
space using<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows and their various</font>

1348
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:53,910
Microsoft seems to keep evolving the

1349
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:55,740
products and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't keep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> track</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of what</font>

1350
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:59,390
they currently are I've heard windows ce

1351
00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:01,950
e windows mobile windows XP embedded

1352
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:04,710
various and sundry names of things which

1353
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:07,200
are in some way<font color="#CCCCCC"> shape or form windows on</font>

1354
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:09,030
some platform and so windows mobile

1355
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,529
happens to be one of the instances of it

1356
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:11,910
now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you start talking to</font>

1357
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:13,050
developers who live in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this space you</font>

1358
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:14,609
ask some of the sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the simple</font>

1359
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:17,430
questions like is there a Windows Update

1360
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:18,870
and sometimes you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer is no</font>

1361
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:20,580
they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a mechanism to ship</font>

1362
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:22,290
us updates<font color="#CCCCCC"> never mind us putting them in</font>

1363
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:24,900
the phone into the platforms the target

1364
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:26,340
platforms so you end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with questions</font>

1365
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,350
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you pick this operating</font>

1366
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:30,240
system fine what if somebody finds them

1367
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:32,460
exploit some dll you know how do i get

1368
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:35,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dll's out on to all the phones how</font>

1369
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:37,230
do i do uptake in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> phones so this is</font>

1370
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:39,180
kind of you know and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's in fact the</font>

1371
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:40,500
same platform you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can start to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1372
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:42,270
about potentially the same kinds of

1373
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,710
exploits working and again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

1374
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:44,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're on those lots of operating</font>

1375
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:47,340
systems here not just picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1376
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:49,020
Microsoft or anything so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you</font>

1377
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:51,270
get is there a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an update</font>

1378
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">mechanism and think about what would we</font>

1379
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:54,750
do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what would they do if we had</font>

1380
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:56,549
a zero-day against<font color="#E5E5E5"> blackberries you know</font>

1381
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:58,440
while we tell the blackery<font color="#CCCCCC"> do we tell</font>

1382
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:59,760
the people at rim to you know refresh

1383
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,260
the network and update all the phones

1384
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,030
well they seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to do that</font>

1385
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:04,190
these days they know they crash the

1386
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:05,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">American network to we</font>

1387
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:07,670
go and they crash the<font color="#CCCCCC"> European Network</font>

1388
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:09,020
last week and I'm sure the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in</font>

1389
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,890
Japan are totally freaked because you

1390
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,509
know they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that update</font>

1391
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:13,250
they are next<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and I'm sure they'll</font>

1392
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:14,750
say we have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all worked out now you</font>

1393
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:17,810
know right until Japan goes offline for

1394
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:18,740
six hours so and the poor people at

1395
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:20,240
rhythm I'm sure they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not happy</font>

1396
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:22,189
they're doing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry to bash on</font>

1397
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,868
them but you know it happens so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

1398
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:24,950
the sort of example of you know because

1399
00:46:23,869 --> 00:46:27,020
the simple thing is you know the event

1400
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:28,790
if there's a flaw and the vendor knows

1401
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:30,259
about it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys know whoever did</font>

1402
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:31,790
responsible disclosure and then they

1403
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:34,369
build the update then you get a ship

1404
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:35,540
ship the update out and that's that gets

1405
00:46:34,369 --> 00:46:38,569
more and more complicated with small

1406
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:41,240
small devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> iPods you know if ipods</font>

1407
00:46:38,569 --> 00:46:42,680

likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that sort of thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if</font>

yes I<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a push updates the phone um</font>

1455
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:29,120
there's something it's not the vendors

1456
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:32,240
the operators and the FCC won't let you

1457
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:34,310
update phones that fast so assuming

00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,810
Microsoft Word Perfect and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple were</font>

1460
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:38,120
companies were perfect you still have

1461
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:41,660
issues about getting updates<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1463
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:47,779
sometimes and well in mobile I actually

1464
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:51,200
haven't tried windows mobile at the last

1465
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:54,200
time I looked as X being embedded<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

1466
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,730
can yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and that's what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is now</font>

1467
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,049
and the phones are still moving targets

1468
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:59,030
so who knows what phones are gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1469
00:48:57,050 --> 00:49:00,560
a year in a year you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know life cycle of</font>

a phone is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about three months you know</font>

1471
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:04,430
they pull up new devices you know the

1472
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:05,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">motorola v3 razr came out and there was</font>

1473
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:06,830
the it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cool hips thing to be</font>

and then they came<font color="#E5E5E5"> out with a v3r in the</font>

1477
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:14,000
v3s and turns out that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just keeps</font>

1478
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,140
throwing implementations over the wall

1479
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so they don't pay attention the</font>

00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:18,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">issues they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have in them because they're</font>

00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,210
generally those are going to be if<font color="#CCCCCC"> once</font>

1488
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,009
we get into things me more and more

00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:20,379
keep doing fresh versions of things and

1514
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,490
so they're fresh and they're vulnerable

old because it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 10</font>

1516
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:26,439

00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:27,880
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the voice specific things so they're</font>

00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:33,190

00:50:41,769 --> 00:50:44,500
they're going to you know people are

going to suddenly want to do music on

1532
00:50:51,279 --> 00:50:55,569
and forth and they'll keep shipping

1533
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:56,769
things fast which means you'll get

vulnerable things being shipped

1535
00:50:56,769 --> 00:51:01,118
vulnerable protocols because you'll end

1536
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:03,819
up with all the vendors trying to chase

1537
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:06,339
the same thing so you know they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1538
00:51:03,819 --> 00:51:08,650
do cameras or they want to do dolby 5.1

1539
00:51:06,339 --> 00:51:10,089
surround sound or something silly like

1540
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:11,799
that oh they're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to plug into a</font>

1547
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,410
you need extra extra batteries you know

1548
00:51:24,759 --> 00:51:27,849
it'll suck power do this you know you

1549
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:29,618
could build<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tax and suck power out of</font>

1550

the batteries you know renting a no-op

loop<font color="#CCCCCC"> for her costs power so maybe that's</font>

1552
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,950
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good enough exploit you get these</font>

have voice over IP and a tcp/ip stack

1555
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:43,390
and it's a gsm phone or whatever phone

1556
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:45,549
on the on the other side so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

00:52:16,569 --> 00:52:19,839
again and all the time you're still<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know conference call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1575
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:24,038
were listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so this all sounds</font>

1576
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:25,839
wonderful as a feature capability

1577
00:52:24,039 --> 00:52:27,190
however you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get things like you just</font>

1578
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:28,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">handed that off across three different</font>

1579
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:30,490
authentication systems which you have to

1580
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:33,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">have wired together intimate</font>

1581
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:35,600
huh blindly yes you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust them</font>

1582
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:37,100
so yeah you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trust t-mobile to</font>

1583
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,600
get their phone thing right inside their

1584
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:41,089
water their authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

1585
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">rightness of their wireless then you get</font>

1586
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:44,330
the fact these are dual stack platforms

1587
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:46,700
so you've got two protocol stacks wedged

1588
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:48,560
in small device by people with too

1589
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,750
little budget<font color="#E5E5E5"> being rushed to do it too</font>

1590
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,070
fast so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good way to take a</font>

1591
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:54,080
bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> of really smart people and have</font>

1592
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:56,540
them build<font color="#E5E5E5"> really buggy code sort of the</font>

1593
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:58,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">general effect you'd get out of that and</font>

1594
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:00,080
then you get all these edge cases due to

1595
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:03,320
hand off<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocols so you're changing</font>

1596
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:05,360
networks and you're you know you acquire

1597
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:07,790
an address on a new network your dhcp

1598
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:09,350
lease changes underneath other other<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1599
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:11,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">know connections and stuff like that and</font>

1600
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:13,040
protocol edge cases are the kinds of

1601
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:15,620
things that vendors tend to test for

1602
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,840
badly and attackers tend to test for

1603
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:19,460
well because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you can sit around</font>

1604
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,930
you know in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your house you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drinking</font>

1605
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:22,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">jolt cola you know writing Python</font>

1606
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:25,160
scripts that generate bizarre connect

1607
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:26,480
messages and they all should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be handled</font>

1608
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,710
if everything was done properly<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1609
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,290
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of goofy stuff that</font>

1610
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:32,510
people will get wrong and then they

1611
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:35,330
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are new paths to attack other</font>

1612
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:37,610
things so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get into an enterprise</font>

1613
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:39,080
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the GSM network now or from</font>

1614
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:40,910
t-mobile if you actually can do this

1615
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:43,490
convergence walk back and forth thing if

1616
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:44,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">people do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that enough things badly about</font>

1617
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:46,339
how they integrate these systems

1618
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:49,400
together you can attack businesses

1619
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:50,420
through the phone system<font color="#E5E5E5"> now not just by</font>

1620
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,540
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know go through their</font>

1621
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:55,010
firewall and you get new paths into sort

<font color="#E5E5E5">of research sharing resource sharing</font>

1623
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:58,790
kinds of environments so you get things

1624
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,350
where you know you plug your phone into

1625
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:02,480
the docking station at home and it's

1626
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:03,610
also your iPod so of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course you want to</font>

1627
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,170
have it hooked up<font color="#CCCCCC"> so you can play your</font>

1631
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,660
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> boxes are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the same network</font>

1635
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:21,859
can you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can attack your stereo</font>

bought off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of itunes did you know if you</font>

1644
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:39,420
nice place to deploy a virus anyway did

1645
00:54:37,070 --> 00:54:40,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">i say that you can attack your BMW</font>

1647
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:45,029
daimler chrysler products have gear in

1648
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:51,420
them so you can your plug your<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPod in</font>

1649
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:53,819
and it connects in so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm is windows CEO</font>

1650
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,500
that makes me feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> really safe being cut</font>

1651
00:54:53,819 --> 00:55:03,270
off by a z4 next time I you know dry as

1652
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:06,599
i drive back<font color="#CCCCCC"> up by five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the home so</font>

1653
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:08,430
they have been failures so there have

1654
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:10,650
been failures of cars with software

1655
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:13,020
software failures of cars Yeah Yeah

1656
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:14,400
right and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is your mobile</font>

1657
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:16,740
device is going to be involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in all</font>

1658
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,609
this and so these are attack vectors you

1659
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:19,020
know if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think like a</font>

1660
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:20,460
bad guy you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would you try to</font>

1661
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,839
do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it what can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I do with the phone</font>

1662
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:24,900
exploit well if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can start to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attack</font>

1663
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:27,450
your car at school or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can attack</font>

1664
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:29,760
your you know if you download<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bootleg</font>

1665
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:30,660
movie that you get off a bit torrent you

1666
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,599
know because<font color="#CCCCCC"> she thought you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were cool</font>

1667
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:35,549
and it's got some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of bizarre active</font>

1668
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:37,770
content in the movie and then you stuff

1669
00:55:35,549 --> 00:55:39,390
in your DVD player<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then the you know</font>

1670
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:41,069
the exploit walks through the home

1671
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:42,270
network into your phone and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1672
00:55:41,069 --> 00:55:43,799
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phone and go to work and then</font>

1673
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:46,829
it can climb into your interpreter

1674
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:48,990
employers network you know that sounds

1675
00:55:46,829 --> 00:55:51,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> calm Clancy novel proposal</font>

happen somebody could do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> silly</font>

1678
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:57,869
like that and you know depending on what

00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:59,040
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of environments out there that's</font>

00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:03,990
like that you know somebody pissed<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1683
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:06,059
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rara a who's trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do bootleg</font>

1684
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:07,259
movies who's trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know exploit</font>

1685
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:08,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">other people who were downloading that</font>

1686
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:10,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of stuff you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know so you make the</font>

1687
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:13,799
bootleg movie be you know you know some

1688
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:15,599
exotic you know girl doing yoga kind of

1689
00:56:13,799 --> 00:56:17,009
thing so everybody will download a copy

1690
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,089
now we can't do Paris Hilton anymore

1691
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:21,329
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> she can't make any more movies</font>

1692
00:56:18,089 --> 00:56:22,230
from jail we assume right so you know

1693
00:56:21,329 --> 00:56:24,349
you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some other kind of</font>

1694
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:27,630
boot like movie everybody has a copy of

1695
00:56:24,349 --> 00:56:34,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">ya behind bars yeah yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Paris behind</font>

1696
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:38,579
bars the next movie yes anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh anyway</font>

1697
00:56:34,369 --> 00:56:41,579
crypto so I do crypto stuff a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> voice</font>

1698
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:42,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">vendors don't understand crypto first of</font>

1699
00:56:41,579 --> 00:56:44,640
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> they always say the hardware can't</font>

1700
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:46,109
handle it they saw as crypto is hard

1701
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,730
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have two lots of CPU cycles</font>

1702
00:56:46,109 --> 00:56:49,290
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to have special trips and</font>

1703
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:50,970
things like that these are the same

1704
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:54,420
people who have<font color="#E5E5E5"> SIM cards that are due</font>

1705
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:57,140
RSA encryption already so the hardware

1706
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:59,220
can handle it that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just an excuse</font>

1707
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:01,920
people will do things like have

1708
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:04,169
authorization systems that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> log in to</font>

1709
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,660
do something and your login never times

1710
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:08,310
out so if it's your desktop computer and

1711
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:10,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">you log in your gmail account and never</font>

1712
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:12,480
times out well yeah fine whatever but if

1713
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:14,520
you log into something on your mobile

1714
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,140
phone with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your phone with voice</font>

1715
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,190
over IP that's your convergence phone

1716
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:20,100
and then you leave the phone on the

1717
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:21,270
subway and the authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> tokens are</font>

1718
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:23,460
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting on the phone or in the</font>

1719
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:25,350
cookies or whatever the jsessionid is

1720
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:27,660
still there or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is and that's</font>

1721
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:29,310
immortal then somebody can<font color="#CCCCCC"> pick up the</font>

1722
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:31,950
phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> clone the data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

1723
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:33,570
authenticate is you so that's a crypto

1724
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:35,370
problem and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the algorithms</font>

1725
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:39,090
broken it's that people are misusing

1726
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:41,520
this stuff all<font color="#E5E5E5"> irregular rules about</font>

1727
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:43,440
crypto don't use proprietary protocols

1728
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:45,570
don't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> up your own crypto algorithm</font>

1729
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,830
don't roll your own implementation with

1730
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:48,810
your bare hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> unless you really know</font>

1731
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:50,310
what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing make sure you do some</font>

1732
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:53,100
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> to check it to make sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1733
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:54,900
does actually work properly you know all

1734
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:56,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">that kind of stuff about crypto you know</font>

1735
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:58,710
and it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> these being small devices</font>

1736
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,450
and new implementations we're always

1737
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:01,500
getting sort of people showing up going

1738
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:02,730
all we can do our own special

1739
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,140
implementation because we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool and</font>

1740
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:06,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">different we know this is okay to be</font>

1741
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:07,740
doing this it's a closed environment

1742
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:10,470
will get<font color="#E5E5E5"> away with it nobody would ever</font>

1743
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:11,819
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at our encryption algorithm so</font>

1744
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:14,970
anyway that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing things</font>

1745
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:16,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that and the crypto should work the</font>

1746
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:18,450
RSA stuff should check the signatures

1747
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:20,160
you know if you have a web browser doing

1748
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:22,410
money kinds of things through<font color="#E5E5E5"> your phone</font>

1749
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:24,299
or through your you know or your your

1750
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:26,339
voice phone has a big fancy display to

1751
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:28,320
show customer IDs and stuff you should

1752
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:30,450
actually do all the proper crypto stuff

1753
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:31,950
and people forget this they'll have

1754
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:34,500
there have been phone shipped that

1755
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:36,000
didn't check the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSL signatures there</font>

1756
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,590
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been phones checked ship that had</font>

1757
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,050
bad roots in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> more don't let you load</font>

1758
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:41,670
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> roots that's another thing about the</font>

1759
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:43,410
phones being different look at the roots

1760
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:45,150
loaded into a blackberry and look at the

1761
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:47,250
roots<font color="#CCCCCC"> loaded into a windows mobile</font>

1762
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:49,230
device and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know look at the roots</font>

1763
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:50,820
loaded into a motorola razr and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll</font>

1764
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:52,350
find different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things it this is the</font>

1765
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:53,940
world where you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk into a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> singular</font>

1766
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:55,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">store and hear some customer to next</font>

1767
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:57,270
counter yelling at the person behind the

1768
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,729
counter because they're getting a root

1769
00:58:57,270 --> 00:59:00,779
certificate not loaded

1770
00:58:58,729 --> 00:59:02,279
actually heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in a singular store</font>

1771
00:59:00,779 --> 00:59:04,259
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get those errors all the time</font>

1772
00:59:02,279 --> 00:59:07,049
because I be crypto things but end users

1773
00:59:04,259 --> 00:59:08,999
hitting root errors anyway so you know

1774
00:59:07,049 --> 00:59:11,489
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and and people want to use the</font>

1775
00:59:08,999 --> 00:59:13,078
the phone for other things so the voice

1776
00:59:11,489 --> 00:59:14,609
over IP stuff is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be sitting</font>

1777
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:17,700
there with browsers try and do other

1778
00:59:14,609 --> 00:59:19,410
kinds of authentication and stuff these

1779
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:21,689
devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to have keys stored in them</font>

1780
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:23,279
somehow so you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure the</font>

1781
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:25,079
keys are you know stored safely and

1782
00:59:23,279 --> 00:59:28,829
securely and you can't read the things

1783
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:34,880
out that<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of stuff see how am i</font>

1784
00:59:28,829 --> 00:59:36,779
doing on I'm 10 minutes over right yep

1785
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,890
there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> hook thing in the back room</font>

1786
00:59:36,779 --> 00:59:39,109
you're not waving at me of course you

1787
00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:42,538
may be but I can't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you in the dark</font>

1788
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:44,190
anyway I'll go speed up data formats

1789
00:59:42,539 --> 00:59:46,920
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the implementations wrong</font>

1790
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:49,799
again stuff like that um targets cool

1791
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:51,299
targets rich media things you know

1792
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:53,099
multimedia stuff quick time and you're

1793
00:59:51,299 --> 00:59:54,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">in your phones you know being able to</font>

1794
00:59:53,099 --> 00:59:56,339
send voicemail messages or animated

1795
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:57,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">voicemail or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something to your voice</font>

1796
00:59:56,339 --> 00:59:59,519
phones we are having your<font color="#E5E5E5"> system side</font>

1797
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:01,950
together you know aggressive active

1798
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:03,598
content you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> JavaScript's not</font>

1799
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:05,009
suppose to be doing things attacking the

1800
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:06,359
phone stuff itself you know what if we

1801
01:00:05,009 --> 01:00:08,640
had weird signals coming in attacking

1802
01:00:06,359 --> 01:00:10,739
the Codex so you that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> proto</font>

1803
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:12,058
decodes taking the audio<font color="#E5E5E5"> signal and or</font>

1804
01:00:10,739 --> 01:00:15,119
generating the audio from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the binary</font>

1805
01:00:12,059 --> 01:00:16,559
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the digital data we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can have a</font>

1806
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:18,150
tax against that people are putting

1807
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:19,859
games on phones so they start putting

1808
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:22,619
games and things like games on boys

1809
01:00:19,859 --> 01:00:25,049
phones eventually web to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bueno fad</font>

1810
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:27,719
services you know dodgeball every

1811
01:00:25,049 --> 01:00:28,799
anybody used dodge ball here it's like

1812
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:30,450
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> were you everybody was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using that a</font>

1813
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:32,759
torque on last year and I'm thinking so

1814
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:35,460
all the hackers in one city are

1815
01:00:32,759 --> 01:00:38,069
trackable by one service run by Google

1816
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:39,479
and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to like you know I'm</font>

1817
01:00:38,069 --> 01:00:40,739
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send you an SMS and then we're</font>

1818
01:00:39,479 --> 01:00:41,848
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to the ATM and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font>

1819
01:00:40,739 --> 01:00:43,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">get the three hundred dollars i'm going</font>

1820
01:00:41,849 --> 01:00:44,969
to pay you 20 day that you gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> me and</font>

1821
01:00:43,589 --> 01:00:46,288
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to track</font>

1822
01:00:44,969 --> 01:00:48,089
that we're all running dodgeball anyway

1823
01:00:46,289 --> 01:00:49,529
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got these web two point O</font>

1824
01:00:48,089 --> 01:00:51,509
services which assume you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share</font>

1825
01:00:49,529 --> 01:00:54,779
a lot and sharing a lot usually means

1826
01:00:51,509 --> 01:00:57,089
not very secure anyway enterprises you

1827
01:00:54,779 --> 01:00:59,039
can attack enterprises with VoIP phones

1828
01:00:57,089 --> 01:01:01,410
it's another target another patakha pass

1829
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:03,749
this is a bad thing they're all running

1830
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:05,129
exchange Microsoft Exchange which it's

1831
01:01:03,749 --> 01:01:06,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">not like exchange is a bad thing but</font>

1832
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:08,670
it's a sophisticated system and you've

1833
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:10,019
now added a new path into it so you get

1834
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:12,269
new corrupt potentially coming into your

1835
01:01:10,019 --> 01:01:12,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">email infrastructure plus you get things</font>

1836
01:01:12,269 --> 01:01:16,439
like

1837
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:18,450
cisco unity server i think is the

1838
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:20,520
product name which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is essentially an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old</font>

1839
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:22,529
copy of exchange running on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows 2000</font>

1840
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:24,720
that Microsoft that<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh cisco refuses to</font>

1841
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:26,430
let you update this is a classic<font color="#CCCCCC"> case of</font>

1842
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,990
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> assuming exchange is perfect</font>

1843
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:30,569
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft ships me perfect but uh</font>

1844
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:32,549
maintenance releases I still can't use

1845
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:33,900
it because the way Cisco did things so

1846
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:36,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get funny combinations because</font>

1847
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:38,640
you've got sophisticated email<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems</font>

1848
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:40,710
voicemail and email going back and forth

1849
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:42,900
you know blended attacks what if we have

1850
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:45,750
spam causing you to hit a phishing site

1851
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:46,890
which causes you to click download

1852
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:48,330
something which would attack your voice

1853
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:52,200
phone you know what if we have that

1854
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:53,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">combination people put fancy things in</font>

1855
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,529
their phones and now you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more data</font>

1856
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:57,690
there so it's a better target so you get

1857
01:01:55,530 --> 01:02:00,210
the you get the sales guy who has the

1858
01:01:57,690 --> 01:02:01,710
fancy blackberry whatever phone and they

1859
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:02,850
download a copy<font color="#CCCCCC"> the business plan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on to</font>

1860
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:04,110
the phone and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they're running</font>

1861
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:05,700
around doing things and they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

1862
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:07,440
voice over IP clients so they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

1863
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:09,779
do vonage or skype or something like

1864
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,330
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now you've got all the</font>

1865
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:13,290
conditions where you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1866
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:14,819
interesting piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1867
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:17,190
vulnerable target that you know how to

1868
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:19,050
attack so you can have you know reasons

1869
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:19,980
to go after phone so even better and

1870
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:21,900
then of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's all the traffic</font>

1871
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:23,280
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can identify your</font>

01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:24,330
voice traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can see your motions</font>

1873
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:29,840
where you going and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're logging</font>

1874
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:32,759
into stuff like that anyway um voice

1875
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:34,860
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the when they deploy these</font>

1876
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:36,630
infrastructure things they they tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1877
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:37,980
take the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> types and make them</font>

1878
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:39,720
play with<font color="#E5E5E5"> phones or take the phone types</font>

1879
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:42,540
make them play with<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks so you get</font>

1880
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:44,100
up with competency gaps because they

1881
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:45,570
don't overlap people<font color="#CCCCCC"> would use through</font>

1882
01:02:44,100 --> 01:02:48,330
phone stuff tend not to have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:50,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">iOS wizards and people who do iOS you</font>

1884
01:02:48,330 --> 01:02:51,690
know if you have a CCNA or ccie or

1885
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,859
whatever you got you probably don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1886
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:55,170
every single command in your nor

1887
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:58,020
telephone switch so the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing both</font>

1888
01:02:55,170 --> 01:03:00,240
directions so you get combinations that

1889
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:01,950
are issues and you get again places you

1890
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:04,290
can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> for exploits people will use</font>

1891
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:05,490
old copies of iOS because they think if

1892
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:07,350
it was part of the phone system<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

1893
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:08,609
going to leave it alone for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1894
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:11,160
you want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> running 10 year old</font>

1895
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:12,260
copies of iOS know you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Cisco</font>

1896
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,339
wouldn't say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a good idea but</font>

1897
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:15,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">people might think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that because</font>

1898
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:17,250
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way they look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at their their</font>

1899
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:19,569
phone system so you get attacks that way

1900
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:21,190
is people will run really old here

1901
01:03:19,569 --> 01:03:23,140
you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't catch people running</font>

1902
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:25,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">Windows 2000 servers mostly these days</font>

1903
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:26,890
you know the vendor tells us not to you

1904
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:29,859
know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of reasons not to</font>

1905
01:03:26,890 --> 01:03:31,930
whatever but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in voice</font>

1906
01:03:29,859 --> 01:03:35,380
environments using things of that age or

1907
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:38,739
older so anyway making things better

1908
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:40,239
just quickly the real things the way to

1909
01:03:38,739 --> 01:03:41,949
make things<font color="#E5E5E5"> better is it would convince</font>

1910
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:44,259
people to stop buying stuff that's not

1911
01:03:41,949 --> 01:03:46,329
secure so the real kind of exploit

1912
01:03:44,259 --> 01:03:48,069
that's really valuable is you know if I

1913
01:03:46,329 --> 01:03:49,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a phone call from some sales vp at</font>

1914
01:03:48,069 --> 01:03:51,910
nortel it says somebody screwed up a

1915
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:53,499
sale because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer bothered to</font>

1916
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:55,089
ask questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> about security and they</font>

01:03:53,499 --> 01:03:57,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">bothered go around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nmap on the phones or</font>

1918
01:03:55,089 --> 01:04:00,759
something so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way to make it</font>

1919
01:03:57,549 --> 01:04:02,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is to make the sales be impacted</font>

1920
01:04:00,759 --> 01:04:04,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">by the security problems you know</font>

1921
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:07,089
dropping O'Day and scaring how other

1922
01:04:04,269 --> 01:04:08,258
<font color="#CCCCCC">people is lots of fun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but if we can</font>

1923
01:04:07,089 --> 01:04:09,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually get the sales process to be</font>

01:04:08,259 --> 01:04:10,779
impacted<font color="#E5E5E5"> by this this would be the way</font>

1926
01:04:10,779 --> 01:04:14,829
and potentially nasty things you know we

01:04:13,809 --> 01:04:16,479
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know lawyers going</font>

1928

after<font color="#CCCCCC"> us evil hackers who are looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1929
01:04:16,479 --> 01:04:18,999
things you know why aren't the customers

1930
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:20,769
suing the vendors when they ship

1931
01:04:18,999 --> 01:04:23,529
screwed-up stuff want their class action

1932
01:04:20,769 --> 01:04:25,118
lawsuits you know if you could lose your

1933
01:04:23,529 --> 01:04:27,009
business if you had no phones for 24

1934
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:29,049
hours lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people their businesses</font>

1935
01:04:27,009 --> 01:04:31,239
that can say that which means that's

1936
01:04:29,049 --> 01:04:32,890
target which means if that happened

1937
01:04:31,239 --> 01:04:35,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the vendor shipped</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in secure</font>

product that they were negligent about

1939
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:40,150
that's potential lawsuit so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font>

01:04:38,829 --> 01:04:41,469
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other way to get this to</font>

1941
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:43,059
work betters you know sue people when

1942
01:04:41,469 --> 01:04:45,819
they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be when secure stuff I know</font>

1943
01:04:43,059 --> 01:04:47,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that suggests being litigious but that's</font>

1944
01:04:45,819 --> 01:04:48,430
I mean if they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use the</font>

1945
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:51,160
lawyers to hit us we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should use the</font>

network anyway it's kind of obvious but

1949
01:04:55,299 --> 01:04:59,769
whatever vendors should not forget it's

1950
01:04:58,059 --> 01:05:01,930
an IP node they seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to not think about</font>

1951
01:04:59,769 --> 01:05:03,399
that think about the security

01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:05,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">requirements you know send people to</font>

security anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> test the products please</font>

1955
01:05:07,269 --> 01:05:10,118
test the products<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't ship things that</font>

1956
01:05:08,709 --> 01:05:11,618
aren't tested they look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they're not</font>

1957
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:13,539
tested I mean I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure they do some</font>

1958
01:05:11,619 --> 01:05:15,039

they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> tested and you should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1962
01:05:19,509 --> 01:05:22,959
is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right term for the update</font>

1963
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:25,299

1965
01:05:25,299 --> 01:05:29,410
that well yeah except if there's no such

01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:34,970
there's no easy way to you know I can't

1969

I can't go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my customer and say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

1970
01:05:34,970 --> 01:05:37,879
whatever Microsoft told you run the

01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:39,980
update mechanism follow their advice

1972
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:42,140
faithfully just do what they say and

1973
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:43,820
you'll be way better I mean that's true

1974
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:45,348
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I can't say you know go to</font>

completely up to date you can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1979
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:54,770
they are naming mechanisms do this sort

1980
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:57,109
of thing and don't go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> denial about</font>

1981
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:58,339
outside security research vendors keep

1982
01:05:57,109 --> 01:05:59,750
doing this like oh there is anything

1983
01:05:58,339 --> 01:06:02,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong with our phones you guys are all</font>

1984
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:04,130
just making mistakes so there's been

1985
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,480
lots of that happening presumably that's

1986
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:07,480
the level before they start suing people

1987
01:06:14,109 --> 01:06:19,069
they have no concept that you'd want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1988
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:21,589
maintain your phones I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1989
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:22,760
planned obsolescence I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

1990
01:06:21,589 --> 01:06:23,930
assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep the</font>

1991
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,849
phone for ten years and keep it the way

1992
01:06:23,930 --> 01:06:26,810
it was because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that's</font>

1993
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:29,300
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that people kept writing the</font>

1994
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:30,589
requirements and that sounds fine but

1995
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:32,869
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually we end up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

1996
01:06:30,589 --> 01:06:34,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">phone which is in fact windows XP you</font>

1997
01:06:32,869 --> 01:06:36,859
know inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing that happens to be</font>

1998
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:38,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">very small</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and look like a phone or</font>

1999
01:06:36,859 --> 01:06:40,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">something like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows XP and which case</font>

2000
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:43,399
it's a modern operating system with

2001
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:44,780
modern sophisticated features and modern

2002
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,280
maintenance requirements and so you

2003
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:48,680
should do the modern thing to update

2004
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:49,940
from the modern vendor and that's all

2005
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,589
assuming that everything all the vendors

2006
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:53,480
doing the right things cuz you know

2007
01:06:51,589 --> 01:06:55,580
software has bugs and you have to

2008
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,900
maintain it that's the way it works you

2009
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:57,920
can't know 10 year old code is you

2010
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,450
cannot assume that's going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

2011
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:02,900
forever and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of what the</font>

2012
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:08,060
attitude they used to have so anyway ah

2013
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:09,770
ah let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> see vendors dump phones and the</font>

2014
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:11,240
newbie developers I i think that the

2015
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:13,940
phones tend to be the low-end thing and

2016
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:15,859
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh you tend to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put the new kid on</font>

2017
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:18,740
it it looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that based on some of</font>

2018
01:07:15,859 --> 01:07:21,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bugs spend some money on testing</font>

2019
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:23,270
implement Foles protocols don't give

2020
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:26,390
priority to look at feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> over secure</font>

2021
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:28,160
your look and feel is cute stable and

2022
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:29,598
secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be nice also if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can make</font>

2023
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:31,580
your phones unstable I can scare people

2024
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:32,900
very much done so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can ruin the</font>

2025
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:35,589
stability that that's an interesting

2026
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:38,630
thing to do anyway all right

2027
01:07:35,589 --> 01:07:40,400
yeah security research anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> brit</font>

2028
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:43,040
phones are brittle basically phones are

2029
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:57,530
brittle anyway that's it sorry to come

2030
01:07:43,040 --> 01:08:00,319
on thank you yes I can't see you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

2031
01:07:57,530 --> 01:08:30,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorry because the lights are like over</font>

2032
01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:33,290
here question yeah yeah if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going</font>

2033
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:36,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do access control in your switch make</font>

2034
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:38,299
it voice literate do enough things so

2035
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:40,310
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can put some security capabilities</font>

2036
01:08:38,299 --> 01:08:42,589
in that and don't just assume you can

2037
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:45,049
have this massively active thing like

2038
01:08:42,589 --> 01:08:48,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">8021</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like an 80</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to 1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> X client to to do</font>

2039
01:08:45,049 --> 01:08:49,640
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they could do more</font>

2040
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:54,949
things in the switches that they wanted

2041
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:57,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I have not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found any products</font>

2042
01:08:54,948 --> 01:08:58,818
doing it right I have found products

2043
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,929
that claim they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it I've seen some</font>

2044
01:08:58,819 --> 01:09:01,670
things that are that are have enough

2045
01:08:59,929 --> 01:09:03,290
horsepower some of the things which are

2046
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:05,380
called secure switches they tend to be

2047
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:07,130
firewall for<font color="#E5E5E5"> port kind of devices</font>

2048
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:09,500
juniper make some stuff like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

2049
01:09:07,130 --> 01:09:11,359
juniper netscreen naevus networks

2050
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:12,649
concentra there's a few other vendors

2051
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:15,199
out there doing things like that which

2052
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:16,580
basically do control per port and if

2053
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:19,519
they did the right set of things they

2054
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:20,809
could quite capably defend a phone that

2055
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,580
way but they don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it</font>

2056
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:24,170
they're busy obsessing on you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

2057
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:27,219
run windows on this thing and they'll

2058
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:27,219
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what user logged in</font>

2059
01:09:29,618 --> 01:09:40,880
yes you'd have to write firewall rules

2060
01:09:31,639 --> 01:09:42,109
for phones well that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

architecture bug wouldn't know I haven't

2062
01:09:42,109 --> 01:09:44,449
found people dealt with that they don't

2063
01:09:43,309 --> 01:09:47,179
seem to actually think machines are

2064
01:09:44,448 --> 01:09:48,979
mobile like that yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

2065
01:09:47,179 --> 01:09:51,109
roaming stuff but that's that's another

2066
01:09:48,979 --> 01:09:52,848
set of problems and no I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

2067
01:09:51,109 --> 01:09:54,289
I've that there they've got that salt

2068
01:09:52,849 --> 01:09:54,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">really this is an example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if I don't</font>

2069
01:09:54,288 --> 01:09:57,230
think they thought up the security

2070
01:09:54,980 --> 01:10:00,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">requirements for that users have I</font>
