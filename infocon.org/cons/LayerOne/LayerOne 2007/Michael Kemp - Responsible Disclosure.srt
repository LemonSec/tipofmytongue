would argue<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so to introduce what</font>

I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about there's</font>

the disclosure of vulnerability

information security flaws whether or

60
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:04,560
not it's responsible or otherwise is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

61
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,940
divisive subject area as I'm sure you're

62
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,390
all familiar there are multiple flavors

63
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:11,220
on the subject area and the vendor

64
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:14,369
researcher expectations of what

65
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,260
constitutes a responsible piece of

66
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,019
disclosure or full disclosure are

67
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,649
entirely different as are their

68
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:23,790
expectations regarding the results<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am</font>

69
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:27,120
one thing which is important to remember

70
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that with regards to our disclosure</font>

71
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,329
and the disclosure of security

72
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,739
vulnerability information there are host

73
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:33,750
of legal implications for both

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,950
researchers and renders less<font color="#E5E5E5"> so pro</font>

75
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:39,030
vendors obviously because they've got

76
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,798
bigger legal teams developing an

77
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,410
understanding of what sort of

78
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,570
information to disclose when and more

79
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:47,070
importantly to whom is actually vital if

80
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,480
you actually double the risk getting

81
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:52,049
prosecuted getting separate jail or

82
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,970
basically pissing off Microsoft earn a

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:56,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of history and so it's good</font>

human beings have always kept in she had

86
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,710
secrets really but regards to the

87
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:07,440
disclosure of vulnerability details that

88
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:10,100
usually is usually referred back to the

89
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,109
locksmith debate of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 19th</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> century</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

90
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:15,570
that's why I just went in<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a quote</font>

91
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:17,820
basically what happened was in London in

00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:21,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">the 19th century the sky called AC</font>

95
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,890
was presumably done and to assist

96
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:33,750
locksmiths in that crack unfortunately

97
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:36,240
the media its own and just a share that

98
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,340
they've always been dimwits and actually

99
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,990
said well you know up writing a book<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

100
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,950
how to pick locks probably might help

101
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:45,180
burglars more than locksmiths and

102
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,890
unfortunately the boundary rates in

103
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">London didn't actually agree with them</font>

104
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:51,229

00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:56,070
whether or not to disclose and indeed

107
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,050
what sort of information to disclose is

108
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:01,080
one of the oldest history one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

115
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:24,600
into a bit more specific perspective

with regards to computer security in

should do full disclosure or if you

00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,700
should disclose anything basically that

122

because up until that point and any

vulnerability information by and large

130

probably agreed in a less visible form

shall we say another interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> recent</font>

actually lead to a situation where you

you've got responsible which straight on

<font color="#CCCCCC">bending for the world that you've got</font>

00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,690
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> numb disclosure which</font>

00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:03,360
obviously self-explanatory okay so um in

00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:05,850

00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,640
distinct life cycle depending on where

00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,730
discovered the bowl then you've got to

253
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,150

255
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:26,579
then maybe there's a fix<font color="#CCCCCC"> right then I'm</font>

00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,359
hopefully those two events a<font color="#CCCCCC"> moveable</font>

257
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:32,670
but that depends how you go about things

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so what happens between the exploit</font>

comes in pretty obvious statement

help replicate vulnerability with the

anything takes longer than five days in

00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:48,390
the entire process so the RFP guidelines

receive us a response within seven days

about here using words like<font color="#E5E5E5"> may is</font>

research group and process of releasing

consistency in research company policies

surprisingly<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough and indeed</font>

hellbenders should actually respond to

00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:12,280
that are those policies the important

463
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,860
the most important thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remember</font>

464
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:17,020
about all this is that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

regardless<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what their policies say</font>

474
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:40,629
because you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> hindered a data to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:46,990
and as a result the disclosure policies

477
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:49,570
seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a hugely moveable feast</font>

478
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:53,400
which is all largely dependent on their

479
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:56,320
economic needs and demands all right

480
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:59,470
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all probably bald and you're all</font>

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,480
credibly incredibly they stopped because

482
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:05,500
that is incredibly dry I agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

483
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:10,690
but the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I've mentioned all</font>

484
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:12,520
that framing information is as a member

to the vendors and what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

basically what you do in such a scenario

504
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:01,750
is all dependent on what agreements are

not to expose<font color="#CCCCCC"> the client so obviously if</font>

non-confrontational as possible you've

also got me as technically specific as

possible so that weeks down the line

collaborate and that includes

588
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,120
researchers and vendors you know and

589
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,010
vendors have to know that researchers

590
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:30,659
after knew it that's the nature of this

of them you know another interesting

00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">point is that the vendor mean we still</font>

618
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:37,919
is you might get sued which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know is</font>

always a bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a deficit and you might</font>

also get a job which getting fed by

00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:50,899
career to frame them in a bit more

624
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:59,120
are with done CFO wasp basically about

it was one<font color="#E5E5E5"> or two years ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now guy</font>

627
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:09,080
basically had a sniff around a website

00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:13,520
for the disin army appeal basically did

629
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:15,740
about your genital URL manipulation if

watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on the first note to see</font>

638
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:35,270
in security number didn't go to jail but

639
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:40,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">the point is although that was probably</font>

benign research or be unsupported

research by the solutions provider he

<font color="#E5E5E5">basically did something which was benign</font>

00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:51,470
and splendid up losing his career so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:56,720
know it is an issue and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> becoming</font>

645
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:58,399
more of an issue um historically there's

646
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,620
always been a substantial gap between

647
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:04,279
how researchers are perceived by vendors

648
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:05,658
and how they perceive themselves if

649
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:07,580
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that research who you think</font>

650
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:10,100
you do a good job that's why you do the

651
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,899
job you do and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're a vendor you</font>

652
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,459
see secretary searchers depending on

653
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:15,139
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they have a job or not as</font>

654
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:19,250
a colossal pain in the ass because they

655
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:20,929
cost you money<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know um depending on</font>

656
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:25,250
what can sort of companies you end up

657
00:28:20,929 --> 00:28:26,960
dealing with researchers can only be

658
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:29,450
seen as a minor consideration of

659
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,610
something to do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to deal</font>

660
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:34,210
with in the entire process of building

661
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:36,590
and deploying your code or worse

662
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:38,720
depending on what history the vendor has

663
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,799
as somebody is maliciously inspired now

664
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,570
if you're not politically inspired

665
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:46,730
that's colossal pain in the arse and

666
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:49,669
vendor attitudes and indeed researchers

667
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:53,360
attitudes to vendors aren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> leech aging</font>

668
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:55,880
but there are still<font color="#E5E5E5"> with huge remains of</font>

669
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,610
the old combativeness between vendors

670
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">and researchers this is especially true</font>

671
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:02,570
if you're working as an independent

672
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:04,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">researcher and not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working as part of a</font>

673
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:11,470
security research group you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font>

674
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:14,390
easier to the little or otherwise

675
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:20,840
discard an individual as it is to

676
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:23,929
accompany in it so the problem is how do

677
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:28,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">you actually deal with compulsiveness or</font>

678
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:29,300
silence that presents itself from a

679
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:32,780
vendor when you actually want to push up

680
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:35,330
full<font color="#E5E5E5"> details and you could react</font>

681
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:37,639
according to rfp and a host of other

682
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:39,770
guidelines and policies by<font color="#E5E5E5"> forcing</font>

683
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:43,179
response by aggressively just pushing it

684
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:43,179
out there by the full disclosure<font color="#CCCCCC"> model</font>

685
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:48,010
depending where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit this maybe isn't</font>

686
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:51,889
the best idea you could have ever had

687
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:53,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">because at the moment at least in the UK</font>

688
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:56,179
and to my knowledge in over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

689
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:58,040
US they're increasing calls from eight

00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:08,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean specific example the UK have</font>

693
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:11,059
recently updated computer misuse act and

694
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,860
as it sounds at the moment computer

695
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:14,330
misuse that<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically says if you attack</font>

696
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:17,870
a system maliciously you go to jail

697

burial in the updated version which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> for or by somebody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who'd never</font>

699
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:23,929
worked in the security industry and any

700
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:26,809
capacity whatsoever basically it says if

701
00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:28,520
you write exploit<font color="#CCCCCC"> code you go to jail if</font>

702
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:30,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">you write a tool which allows people to</font>

703
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,510
attack systems you go to jail so

704
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:35,970
basically if you write a Perl scripts

705
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:42,450
you go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> jail not great</font>

706
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:44,880
I am the climate politically in both the

707
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:47,730
US and the UK and indeed across Europe

708
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,950
has altered substantially in the last

709
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:51,360
five or six<font color="#CCCCCC"> years I'm really say why</font>

710
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:54,270
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will become a political</font>

711
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,550
screed and but basically you've never

712
00:30:54,270 --> 00:31:00,150
got a situation where hacking and as a

713
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:01,560
result<font color="#E5E5E5"> a security research which</font>

714
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:03,360
probably not be hacking depending on

715
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,889
which side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the ship you settled can</font>

716
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">never be considered</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as an act of</font>

717
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:10,470
terrorism you know it can't that would

718
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:13,560
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very in mind those circumstances it</font>

719
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:15,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">can actually be that long before full</font>

720
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,909
disclosure is actually perceived and

721
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:22,080
reacted to as a terrorist act<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

722
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:24,420
terrorist threat<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it another</font>

723
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,520
important point is that although full

724
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:28,410
disclosure may force the vendor to

725
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,870
respond because they have to because the

726
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:32,700
details around there in the short term

727
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:34,199
and it may be the shorter long-term

728
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,200
depending on what sort of issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">found it's definitely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to increase</font>

731
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:45,510
that's not cool ethically that's not

00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:49,400
cool security<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about increasing</font>

00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:59,280
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically if you go unresponsive or</font>

00:31:55,110 --> 00:32:01,110
otherwise naive a vendor what the hell

736
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:07,530
do you do to actually combat their

you're in first instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our ability</font>

the vendor instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them of</font>

these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> already off to a good start</font>

745
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:32,419
basically if there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation where</font>

all you are communication breaks down

00:32:34,129 --> 00:32:39,439
for whatever reason a<font color="#CCCCCC"> researchers to</font>

749
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:42,109

detailing<font color="#E5E5E5"> their intention to publish was</font>

00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:47,840

00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:58,690
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the responses you get back</font>

757
00:32:55,539 --> 00:33:01,609
and publish a non technical advisory

00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:07,369
with a reasonable amount of time fill in

759
00:33:01,609 --> 00:33:09,918
for vendor response and again attempts

766
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:24,350
you publish the sacrificer but don't

employ included any exploit code

768
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:28,039
obviously that sounds incredibly lame

but the minute you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start putting in a</font>

full release this this is different<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

783
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:08,480
what's out there is much that unlike RP

00:34:06,109 --> 00:34:10,460
guidelines and most evil top row

785
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:14,629
policies your first response is a

786
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:16,730
wonderful disclosure basically your

787
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:19,460
first response if the communication

788
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:22,760

790
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:27,319
you very generic details issue exists in

791
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:29,270
black yeah you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow that up with</font>

792
00:34:27,319 --> 00:34:31,460
a set advisory but with no exploit<font color="#E5E5E5"> route</font>

793
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:32,929
so that basically means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though</font>

794
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:35,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">you reported the issue it can't actually</font>

795
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:37,329
be exploited which<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously reduces a</font>

796
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:40,490
restoring the prize of RS good and

797
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:42,770
because there are multiple opportunities

that obviously reduces<font color="#CCCCCC"> Emily leave the</font>

liability the may impact on you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

802
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:54,969
and obviously one point of consideration

803
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:57,070
is the time scales you know three<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font>

804
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:59,319
is a hell of a long time if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

805
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:00,850
small<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue but then three months is a</font>

806
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,410
hell of a short amount of time if it's a

807
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:04,900
major issue so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously cover</font>

808
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:08,379
up to consider that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a as a blend you</font>

809
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:10,300
know and there are a number of issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

810
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:12,610
it is much<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the legal</font>

811
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:15,010

812
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:18,580
still sits with the researcher or indeed

813
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:22,869
the researchers company and the model

814
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:24,790
still creates combativeness between both

815
00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:30,340
the researcher and vendor communities

816
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:32,650
you know because a sacrifice rate if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

817
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:36,660
want to call it that doesn't have any

00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:39,760
area<font color="#CCCCCC"> code</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> although that prevents</font>

819
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:43,020
malicious use of the vulnerability

820
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:46,690
discovered obviously impacts bone and

821
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:48,609
impairs legitimate continued research of

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue or class of issues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you've</font>

823
00:35:48,609 --> 00:35:54,069

824
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:56,470
research your there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> emergency patch</font>

825
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:57,490
here and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire point of this is to</font>

826
00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:04,450
find a property and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the problem</font>

827
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:06,160
fixed so what the solutions well are the

828
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:08,410
solutions is a bit as a first questioner

829
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,330
vendors and researchers at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the moment</font>

830
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:13,029
operate according to their own rule sets

831
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:15,130
and their own perceptions of rule sets

832
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:18,930
in as much so you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IRS on one</font>

833
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:20,980

834
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:22,450
vendors<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that way of doing things</font>

835
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:25,600
researchers have that way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of doing</font>

836
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:28,830
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's still to count you know very</font>

837
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:32,049
that in mind maybe this is just an<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

838
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:34,119
something like sir acting is like a

839
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:35,950
clearing body wasn't actually that bad

840
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:40,260
an idea especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen as it reduces</font>

841
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:42,730
legal responsibility liability and

842
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:47,380
basically if you have a mediating group

843
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:50,790
that is composed of representatives from

844
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:54,700
both researchers fenders companies and

845
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:58,390
both sets of communities then you know

846
00:36:54,700 --> 00:37:01,810
Paul although the aims of researchers

847
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:04,270
and vendors differ yeah obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

848
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:06,790
goal in the end game in this is the same

849
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:09,820
which is vendors want to produce secure

850
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:14,820
software and it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice if they</font>

851
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:17,800
did produce secure software you know so

852
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,599
for vendors<font color="#E5E5E5"> a neural anelia sold off</font>

853
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:23,230
quick process at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

854
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are security comes action music</font>

encrypted email to this address yeah

862
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,779
they should have a security responsible

you can provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> a temporary workaround</font>

benefit of the doubt although some

904
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:30,790
vendors can be incredibly obtuse and

00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:55,140
researchers have lost a career

credibility and indeed their careers and

962
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:00,009
although guys like lame-o attacked you

963
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:00,970
shouldn't be in jail you should never

965

00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:16,839
what to report on when and the risks

sit on any volunteer tells at your point

because at the end of the day silence

973
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:36,129

brawl with potential legal ramifications

things even<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an individual methodology</font>

1014
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:24,809
and you can't just go around posting

1015
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:27,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">blendy thousand or more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because if</font>

1016
00:44:24,809 --> 00:44:30,680
they're severe enough the possibility is

1017
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:30,680
they might decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have you for it</font>

1018
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:37,529
only write this this is an interesting

1019
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,240
one and it's also an incredibly ass

1020
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:44,250
enabled don't know how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you went</font>

00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:46,740
a smooth con but basically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> x MS</font>

security something<font color="#E5E5E5"> or other at Mozilla</font>

1024
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:55,740
basically claimed quite perversely an

1025
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:59,280
alt oddly rather than the researcher at

1026
00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:02,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">the moment has got all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the power no</font>

1027
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,470
actually they haven't and if you are a

1028
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,109
bender you've got considerably more

1029
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:09,419
power than an individual researcher you

1030
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:12,089
have a legal team of specialists to go

1031
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,829
after researchers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know about you</font>

1032
00:45:12,089 --> 00:45:15,960
but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a legal team</font>

1033
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:17,369
of specialists the size of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mozilla's so</font>

1034
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:21,420
I suspect she might have been pulled

1035
00:45:17,369 --> 00:45:23,549
over and the same cold Dave I tell

1036
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:26,190
basically claimed that responsible

1037
00:45:23,549 --> 00:45:28,980
disclosure<font color="#CCCCCC"> poll process was a vendor</font>

1038
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:30,630
ruse so basically prevent security

1039
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,220
details being pushed out into the wild

1040
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:33,080
and the

1041
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:35,240
only real alternative available to

1042
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:38,690
researcher was to actually sell your

1043
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:40,490
wares to him now as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier he</font>

1044
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:42,440
basically makes money if you sell your

1045
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:46,990
wares to him so I wonder whether that

1046
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,990
motivated by altruism<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it is</font>

1047
00:45:47,109 --> 00:45:51,410
at the moment the simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact is that</font>

1048
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:56,899
vendors are getting more and more

1049
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:58,759
twitching legally yeah it may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1050
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:01,430
the license agreements for their

1051
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:03,619
software aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> well defined after all</font>

1052
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:06,649
and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is movable argued in at</font>

1053
00:46:03,619 --> 00:46:08,810
all your your idea of acceptable use and

1054
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:12,320
their idea of acceptable use might be

1055
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:14,119
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> different as ain't never been</font>

1056
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,980
argued legally and if you try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to argue</font>

1057
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:19,820
argue illegally I think it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

1058
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:22,609
tricky sell and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what's going</font>

1059
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:24,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">on vendors are actually using the stick</font>

1060
00:46:22,609 --> 00:46:26,390
of intellectual property more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

1061
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:28,670
are basically saying if you find an

1062
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:31,490
issue in our technology or in our crowd

1063
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:34,040
you in some way imprinted upon our

1064
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:38,598
intellectual proper now the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1065
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:42,710
using your thing tonight is judges and

1066
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:45,140
juries and warriors understand IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

1067
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:47,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">get it they're used to it you know so</font>

1068
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:49,879
the minute vendors start coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> back the</font>

1069
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:51,259
research is using the stick of IP you're

1070
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,660
basically presented with a situation

1071
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:55,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">where legally everybody knows what's</font>

1072
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:57,348
going on apart from the researcher I

1073
00:46:55,550 --> 00:47:00,080
don't know about you<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think</font>

1074
00:46:57,349 --> 00:47:02,780
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding an issue is an infringement</font>

1075
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:04,369
upon intellectual property it's not even

1076
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:07,099
if you completely reverse engineer their

1077
00:47:04,369 --> 00:47:09,400
firmware so what that's him<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the day</font>

1078
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:12,980
your bill there to find security

1079
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:16,790
vulnerabilities not actually clone their

1080
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:19,640
firmware for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> um at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> moment</font>

1081
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:21,230
the situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it stands maybe this is</font>

1082
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:25,790
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lack of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> legal understanding i</font>

1083
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:28,910
don't know but if it goes to call<font color="#CCCCCC"> t with</font>

1084
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:31,750
the biggest legal staff<font color="#E5E5E5"> wins from that</font>

1085
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:35,598
and frankly is axon<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm in as much that</font>

1086
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:37,430
obviously the researcher losses and if

1087
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,190
the researcher<font color="#CCCCCC"> loses then arguably</font>

1088
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:40,930
securities a whole loses out

1089
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:43,000
you don't want to be taking people<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1090
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:44,259
call it's as<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple as you basically</font>

1091
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,640
should be working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with people and not</font>

1092
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:50,589
against<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so the end of the day what</font>

1093
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:54,098
I'm trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out with this is that</font>

1094
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:56,259
self-determination as an industry about

1095
00:47:54,099 --> 00:48:01,690
what to do with bond details doesn't

1096
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:03,940
work you know arguably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the security</font>

industry and hyphens has evolved and

1098
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:08,650
matured recently you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know over the last</font>

1099
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:10,299
few years it's gone from two guys in a

1100
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:12,460
bedroom to multinational companies you

1101
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:14,530
know the days<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bedroom enthusiast</font>

1103
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:18,970
also never got huge corporate cartels

00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:21,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know bearing in mind that there are</font>

1105
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:23,379
huge corporate cartels which sold you is

1106
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:25,599
to push out security solutions<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

1107
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:27,520
security research maybe they should

1108
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:30,000
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> acting like huge cartels and</font>

1109
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:33,400
actually have a defined set of processes

1110
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,950
why they won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that is their goal is</font>

1111
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:38,200
to arguably turn a passbook get in get

1112
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:40,689
out catch em and not actually improve

1113
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:42,549
security I could join<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nurse'll run</font>

1114
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:46,359
against why that<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't work but I</font>

1115
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:49,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't but the disclosure processes as</font>

1116
00:48:46,359 --> 00:48:51,040
they exist needs to be regulated both

from within the industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> and from</font>

1118
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:56,050
without to ensure that vendors and their

<font color="#CCCCCC">Eagle legal teams can't actually target</font>

1121
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,549
in responsible researchers can touch the

impacts pull the perception of the

1123
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:06,369
industry as a whole which is what

1124
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:11,680
something at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment when relatives</font>

does<font color="#CCCCCC"> no pull it's like at the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

day the type of the cisco<font color="#E5E5E5"> tabata last</font>

1127
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:19,750
year cisco went after a researcher you

1128
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:22,030
know they apply pressure to his boss and

1129
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:24,579
went after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that researcher basically</font>

1130
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:26,290
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> his boss or his bosses didn't</font>

1131
00:49:24,579 --> 00:49:28,210
actually have a defined an acceptable

1132
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:36,990
way of doing things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was agreed with</font>

1133
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:39,990
everybody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the point is and</font>

1134
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:42,259
maybe and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a maybe the</font>

1135
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:46,790
research community as a whole needs

1136
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:49,100
regulation and agreed guidelines yeah

1137
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:51,060
obviously because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the way it works</font>

1138
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:56,540
regulation current from from government

1139
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:58,560
in army and it seemed well why not

1140
00:49:56,540 --> 00:50:01,410
because governments have their own

1141
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:03,509
agendas at the end of the day the

1142
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:05,009
government's goal other government is to

1143
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:08,070
stay in<font color="#E5E5E5"> power it's not to improve</font>

1144
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:18,810
security is sustained<font color="#E5E5E5"> power that's why</font>

1145
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:29,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">it can't come from government what why</font>

1146
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:31,440
Carly come from the community yep 10 so

1147
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:33,180
why don't my club me at least to talk

1148
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,830
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> those agendas air them and</font>

1149
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:36,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually come to some agreement instead</font>

1150
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:38,279
of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> operating in our own of</font>

1151
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,640
individual vacuums and all risking our

1152
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:43,770
own individual little prosecution's that

1153
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,359
seems a really stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> model if you're</font>

1154
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:47,460
basically saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one thing stopping</font>

1155
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:50,040
people actually working together is

1156
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:52,220
their inability to communicate learn to

1157
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,220
communicate

1158
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:22,348
no that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that's not a community in</font>

1159
00:51:19,289 --> 00:51:24,329
the traditional sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of we have a nice</font>

1160
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:25,950
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> regulated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> council and we have</font>

00:51:24,329 --> 00:51:41,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">aldermen and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the rest of it now</font>

1162
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:43,140
closed not know the put the point I'm

1163
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:44,910
trying to make this<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't about</font>

1164
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:47,848
enforcement this is actually a foul

1165
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:51,058
agreement at the end of the day this

1166
00:51:47,849 --> 00:51:53,069
isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> about regulated and enforced</font>

1167
00:51:51,059 --> 00:51:54,420
guidelines while I'm actually suggesting

1168
00:51:53,069 --> 00:51:56,819
is that people should actually start

1169
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:58,890
collaborating and agreeing a responsible

1170
00:51:56,819 --> 00:52:01,558
way of doing things whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not they</font>

1171
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:04,670
sign up to that so what but if you do

1172
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:09,150
sign up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that you what's the point the</font>

1173
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:19,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">poppy if you help their teeth how do you</font>

1174
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:22,559
get how do you get to yes but it's that

1175
00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:24,869
point my point my point is involve the

1176
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,160
government involved vendors fine but

1177
00:52:24,869 --> 00:52:32,430
don't let the government's and the

1178
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:34,500
vendors dictate policy yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

1179
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:36,390
saying they're not all I'm saying is

1180
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:39,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the regulations can't come from one</font>

1181
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:39,920
single party that's my pulley

1182
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:48,020
yeah but that the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it's not</font>

1183
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:50,210
about protection at the moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> not none</font>

1184
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:51,470
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current state</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the world is</font>

1185
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:59,710
about protecting the individual

1186
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:59,709
researchers that's my point I've course

1187
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:05,540
boards date<font color="#E5E5E5"> also can play a partner I</font>

1188
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,890
completely agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the only and</font>

1189
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:08,839
plastically agree with you they have to

1191
00:53:08,839 --> 00:53:13,130
can't be in charge of enforcement the

1192
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:15,980
same way that a software company cannot

1193
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:17,810
be in charge<font color="#E5E5E5"> of enforcement this is why</font>

1194
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:20,450
there should be a collaboration between

1195
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:22,820
all parties and an<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual agreement</font>

00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:33,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">we don't like the way you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

1202
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:49,430

1205
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,220

government deciding what can and cannot

1207
00:53:55,220 --> 00:54:01,250
be published because if you did that

1208

this conversation amongst ourselves and

1264
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:35,779
most vendors and basically amongst the

<font color="#CCCCCC">pulled at large because at the moment</font>

1266
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:41,940
the researcher is basically responsible

1267
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:43,680
for their own actions which<font color="#E5E5E5"> vary looks</font>

1268
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:45,359
great from a personal libertarian point

1269
00:57:43,680 --> 00:58:38,368
of view but not so great if you start

1270
00:57:45,359 --> 00:58:40,560
going to jail yeah sounds expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1271
00:58:38,369 --> 00:58:42,359
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the likes of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> matador at</font>

government and God knows how many other

00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:49,130
governments involved guess what

1275
00:58:44,580 --> 00:59:04,920
expensive an issue and that the point is

1276
00:58:49,130 --> 00:59:08,030
as a researcher yes but you know yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1277
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:10,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">the prom the problem with that model is</font>

1278
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:14,190
dangerously close to extortion that you

1279
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:16,280
know which I think has got legal

1280
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:16,280
ramifications

1281
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:38,829
yeah but the tipping point model has

1282
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:41,440
just described there and as just defined

1283
00:59:38,829 --> 00:59:44,230
by the cash equation is driven by cash

1284
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:46,060
it isn't driven by a goal and altruistic

1285
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:48,220
goal to protect the researcher in keeps

1286

increase secure a is about<font color="#CCCCCC"> making money</font>

1287
00:59:48,220 --> 01:00:00,430
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little money driven business it's</font>

1288
00:59:50,950 --> 01:00:02,950
not in there yeah depending on how

1289
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:06,790
depending on who the actual vendor is

1290
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:08,169
and how big their legal flowers I think

1291
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:10,089
you're placing an enormous amount of

1292
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:16,599
trust in a third party company which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

laugh at look after me then guess what

1298
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:49,839
you've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> got rid of your individual</font>

1299
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:52,230
rights under the point is even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1300
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:52,230
contract

1301
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:03,259
yep that's it beats a b2b fabric to be

1302
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:05,480
fine with you though multiple members

1303
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:07,369
are contracted employee of ISS guess

1304
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:09,890
what the minute about<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor with a big</font>

1305
01:01:07,369 --> 01:01:12,890
enough legal muscle length on them they

1306
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:15,410
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> well we'll have words you know so</font>

1307
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:17,150
you're basically saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tipping</font>

1308
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:19,368
point is bigger than software companies

1309
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:21,170
financially and big<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough to stand up</font>

1310
01:01:19,369 --> 01:01:23,300
to their legal seems only know in you

1311
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:25,609
know that if a vendor applies in look

1312
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:33,230
precious as I'm legally or economically

1313
01:01:25,609 --> 01:01:34,790
don't give it up I you say you're

1314
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:39,140
actually claiming the tipping point is

1315
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:48,140
big enough to combat huge software

1316
01:01:39,140 --> 01:01:50,150
cartels I work for tipping point the

1317
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:51,859
pages of when we are disclosing the

1318
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:53,240
information to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors we don't like</font>

1319
01:01:51,859 --> 01:01:54,680
ask them for money we just tell them

1320
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,720
this is the 1 over<font color="#CCCCCC"> G so you want to</font>

01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:59,720
fight it off<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean we are giving a free</font>

1322
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:01,399

a very erratic I with Microsoft that way

1331
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:23,060
like when we just felt some things to

1332
01:02:19,730 --> 01:02:24,770
them and even they like what they tell

1369
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:20,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">culper end yes so is it is the goal to</font>

1370
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:30,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually make money on this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok why not</font>

1371
01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:31,650
but is that the goal yeah yeah it's a

1372
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:34,110
nice but I've gotta agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you but</font>

1373
01:04:31,650 --> 01:04:39,660
the minute it starts becoming an agenda

1374
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:41,280
into an orbit cell yeah but i agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

1375
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:42,960
you at the moment is it stands very not

1376
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,090
but the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a minute it starts</font>

1377
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:47,160
becoming a profit-driven thing the

1378
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:49,619
people only disclose to people that pay

1379
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:51,859
them then guess what we're all kind of

1380
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:51,860
screwed

1381
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:30,430
but the plot the point is it as it

1382
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:31,930
stands and this is why I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1383
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:33,759
what I'm talking about there isn't

1384
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:36,040
actually any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them it's all that up in</font>

1385
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">the air in that ephemeral the there</font>

1386
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:39,730
isn't actually any levels of protection

1387
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:42,819
other than what protections individuals

1388
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:44,320
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> build in for themselves web that by</font>

1389
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:48,730
selling stuff to tipping point or

1390
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:50,290
whomever<font color="#E5E5E5"> or by actually adjusting their</font>

01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:14,980
you very much and<font color="#E5E5E5"> undoubtedly we can</font>

1395
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:16,600
continue this conversation later when

1396
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:19,410
i'm drunk and probably a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more lucid</font>

1397
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,410
as possible over

1398
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:53,790
I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> having a go at sitting boy by</font>

1399
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:57,620
the way now I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say is that</font>

1400
01:06:53,790 --> 01:07:03,690
needs to be defined almost dissolved oh

1401
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:07,549
yes of course yantis that was my wave

1402
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:07,550
signal terminals but he didn't work
