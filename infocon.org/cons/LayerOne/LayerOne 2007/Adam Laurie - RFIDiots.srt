<font color="#E5E5E5">RFID now and today I'm going to talk</font>

8
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,760
about far if<font color="#CCCCCC"> Id probably most of you saw</font>

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">Zach's excellent presentation yesterday</font>

10
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,260
on access control systems I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

11
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,640
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about the front ends rather</font>

12
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,619
than the back ends but we'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

13
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,670
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same issues but from a</font>

14
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:45,270
completely different angle you can see

15
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,670
my stuff on tripod org and RF idiot dog

16
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,200
which is where the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFID stuff is try</font>

17
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:54,450
phone apps mostly about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Bluetooth</font>

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:58,170
and anyway you can own with that so

19
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:01,440
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start you guys we do the</font>

20
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,470
previously feeds on talked about the

21
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">DMCA to a certain extent and we've now</font>

22
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:09,810
in the UK got some pretty dumb laws and

23
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,800
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just updated our computer misuse</font>

24
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:16,140
act and now we've got this new clause

25
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,350
which basically says if you if you

26
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:22,049
produce a tool that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> likely to be used</font>

27
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:27,570
in a computer crime then you've broken

28
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:30,150
the law so yeah which kind of makes life

29
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,459
difficult for researchers because until

30
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,870
the old tool starts to be used you don't

31
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,730
know what it's going to be used<font color="#CCCCCC"> for and</font>

32
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,610
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about it if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> applied</font>

33
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,768
that law to something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> nmap then</font>

34
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:43,320
clearly when the guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> first row nmap and</font>

35
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:45,060
published it there there's a good chance

36
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,609
that that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to look for</font>

37
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,100
vulnerabilities and to break<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> law so</font>

38
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:53,810
it's now a very gray area as to where we

39
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,810
stand as far as the law is concerned

40
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,060
well exactly so the question is does

41
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,590
that include screw the screw driver

42
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,080
manufacturer so I sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of look at the</font>

43
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:06,050
parallel well<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we applied that kind of</font>

44
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:09,110
thinking to the physical world where

45
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:10,940
would we be now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I spend a lot of time</font>

46
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,099
sort of hanging out in hotels and stuff

47
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,989
and some of you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd tend</font>

48
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:19,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fiddle with the technology in moto</font>

49
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:21,319
and I was at a hotel recently and they

50
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,090
had there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> brand-new hotel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

51
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:24,440
saw the state of the art<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I</font>

52
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,079
thought I'd have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting things</font>

53
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,370
to look at and I decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at</font>

54
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:31,640
something physical rather than

55
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:33,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">electronic and see you know if we if we</font>

56
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:37,880
applied those laws how would that work

57
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:42,290
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> physical world and so the tools</font>

58
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:44,329
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I used are it's multi tool here so</font>

59
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,980
obviously this is a dual purpose tool

60
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:49,489
and is therefore very evil and should be

61
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:53,840
immediately made illegal and these very

62
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:55,910
very dangerous objects the guy who came

63
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,780
up with these has really obviously a

64
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:01,880
very twisted mind and should be locked

65
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,850
up because<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are very very bad at</font>

66
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,560
which you'll see in a minute so I made a

67
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:11,650
little video<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what I did which I'm</font>

68
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:14,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to play for you and normally I ask</font>

69
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:17,478
actually when I give my talks on

70
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:19,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">bluetooth there's three of us and we</font>

71
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:21,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in turns to who's going to be</font>

72
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:23,870
the lead speaker and we had this kind of

73
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:27,380
competition going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see who can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font>

74
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,610
most hands raised during a talk and you

75
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,960
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say right everyone raise</font>

76
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,979
your hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had to come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up with an</font>

77
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,150
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> question and so I thought of one</font>

78
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:39,590
which I thought might win me the

79
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:41,000
competition so for this one I need to

80
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:45,320
know everyone raise your hands anyone

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,280
here has ever stayed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hotel yeah I</font>

82
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,930
where'd everyone in the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

83
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:55,369
those people how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you have ever</font>

84
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:57,800
used the hotel safe okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> about half of</font>

85
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:01,370
you okay how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of those believe with</font>

86
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:04,560
its secure none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you oh one of you</font>

87
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:07,960
okay so why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use it</font>

88
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,940
yeah safer than<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave handing it to the</font>

89
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,380
guy as we walked out in reception<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

90
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,830
Sonia I made this little video of me

91
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,690
playing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hotel safe and I showed</font>

92
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,849
it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a guy who was another speaker at a</font>

93
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,440
conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was at and he's he said</font>

94
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,470
well what would be really funny is if

95
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,630
you get someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read out the brochure</font>

96
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:29,290
for this hotel safe while you're doing

97
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:31,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you're doing so I asked for someone</font>

98
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:37,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the audience preferably you know</font>

99
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:38,410
someone female sexy got a good vibe<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

100
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,880
in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

101
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">I already have a volunteer that meets</font>

102
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,969
all the criteria so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> he'll come up</font>

103
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,910
boots so basically she's going to read

104
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,900
out the brochure while I play the video

105
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,330
I've deleted the name of the

106
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:55,150
manufacturer to protect the criminally

107
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:59,919
negligent so you want to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that mike</font>

108
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:01,450
fowler the podium musket and when I tell

109
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">you I'll show you the video after</font>

110
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:06,070
because you don't get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see it which</font>

111
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,990
isn't but i'll show you up it<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so when</font>

112
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:11,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">i tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you if you could read that don't</font>

113
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:21,030
we just test the mic friends were so

114
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:24,390
good with clothes<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let's try this</font>

00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,050
only are they getting away with doing

143
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,479
that but it's now illegal for anyone to

144
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:04,120
notice or to point it out to them so I

145
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:07,419
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's bad and we should try and</font>

146
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:11,139
really push to change that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and to to</font>

147
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:14,380
challenge that so any effort<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be no</font>

148
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:17,590
fight for dmca<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the in the UK the</font>

149
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:21,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">police and justice act should be</font>

150
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:23,619
followed up vigorously really<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

151
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:27,969
the reason we're actually here is talk

152
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:29,050
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFID so as a kekkai</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nestor day is</font>

153
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,449
there any chance you could actually

154
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,979
point that light or kill it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

155
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:34,979
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in my face</font>

156
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:44,370
they're mostly passive chips okay well

157
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:49,770
that's fine then I'm happy can you turn

158
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:51,540
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> off of it ok so we're mostly talking</font>

159
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,400
about passive devices there are active

160
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,620
ones which have batteries and stuff but

161
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,390
the ones I've looked at so far a passive

162
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,790
now I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go into too much</font>

163
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">detail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about how they work</font>

164
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:02,760
electronically but I am going to talk

165
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,240
about how they work at the kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

166
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:10,890
protocol level and the look the logical

167
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:14,640
level some of you may have noticed the

168
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:17,400
title<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my talk it was called hacking</font>

169
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">RFID without soldering iron or a patent</font>

170
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:24,420
attorney now there was a case recently a

171
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:27,300
company who shall remain nameless who

172
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:30,420
prevented a talk being presented at

173
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,969
black hat and again it's you know what

174
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,969
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the high not being</font>

175
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,560
allowed to talk about insecurities

176
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:39,450
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> they threatened to sue the</font>

177
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,280
company who are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present under</font>

178
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:44,040
patent laws because what they were doing

179
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,170
was cloning their devices and replaying

180
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,959
them and by doing so they had<font color="#CCCCCC"> created a</font>

181
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,939
device that used their patented

182
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,060
algorithm and therefore had breached

183
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,590
their patent and so rather than

184
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,300
addressing the problem they throw their

185
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:00,510
patent attorneys at it and say right

186
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,069
well I said problem solved you can't do

187
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:06,480
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> breaching our</font>

188
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:09,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">Payton so everyone's happy so we'll talk</font>

189
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">a bit about their stuff as well so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

190
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:17,339
the two kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of youth that these types</font>

191
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:19,170
get generally used for is the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

192
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:22,110
type things which we'll talk about in

193
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,310
some detail and then the more advanced

194
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,470
ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> are smart cards where you're</font>

195
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,319
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a conversation with the</font>

196
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:33,360
chip and again we'll talk about those in

197
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:36,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">more detail so the idea only stuff the</font>

198
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,540
kind of things that's used<font color="#CCCCCC"> for animal</font>

199
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:41,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">IDs is probably the oldest tagged inner</font>

200
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,819
ear tags that tell you which number this

201
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:48,800
cow is some hotels are now using them as

202
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:51,680
door entry keys car immobilizers

203
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,099
and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of one-offs key part of stuff</font>

204
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:58,160
at that luggage handling has anyone been

205
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,959
through Tokyo Airport recently yeah

206
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,019
you'll probably find if you look on your

207
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:04,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">bag you've got an RFID tag stuck to the</font>

208
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:18,709
bag<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they have automated systems</font>

209
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:20,750
for directing the luggage okay okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

210
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:23,660
apparently the tags look like an<font color="#E5E5E5"> H and</font>

211
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:26,089
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chips in the middle and the legs are</font>

212
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:29,750
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> antenna so they're quite easy to</font>

213
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:32,930
spot and human implants<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a kind</font>

214
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:36,380
of scary thing which again we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

215
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:39,229
to talk about in more detail so this I

216
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:42,350
came across<font color="#E5E5E5"> this cartoon to do with</font>

217
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:48,560
human<font color="#E5E5E5"> implants which I thought was quite</font>

218
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:50,300
amusing now you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hell of</font>

219
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,250
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more than a camera and an mp3</font>

220
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,410
player in it to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to bend over to</font>

221
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,390
have one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these installed Britta I</font>

222
00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:01,490
just thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that was kind of a</font>

223
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:03,770
funny take on it so these two rather

224
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:06,020
nervous looking gentlemen are about to

225
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:08,630
have an implant done or in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

226
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:12,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">he's just had one so this guy on the top</font>

227
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:15,290
is a journalist and he's visiting a

228
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">beach I think it's in Spain where</font>

229
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:20,599
they've signed up to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> program where</font>

230
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:24,649
all the beach vendors<font color="#CCCCCC"> accept an RFID</font>

231
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:27,230
chip as a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of digital wallet and so</font>

232
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:29,959
you can buy drinks and you can rent deck

233
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:32,270
chairs and you can you know go into

234
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:35,779
clubs and stuff like that by just having

235
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:37,370
your things can and it's kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

236
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:39,260
idea you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it means you don't have to</font>

237
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">take your wallet to the beach where it</font>

238
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:44,689
might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> Solan you can leave it in your</font>

239
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:49,250
hotel safe<font color="#CCCCCC"> instead where it will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

240
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:51,110
perfectly safe the other guy he's from

241
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,940
the Mexican government and they're

242
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:56,959
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> using this for access control</font>

243
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:58,279
so basically he can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into parts of</font>

244
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,199
the building that other people can't

245
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:02,870
because he has a chip implanted that

246
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:05,569
lets the reader know he's there

247
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:09,020
and in the UK they talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about putting</font>

248
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:10,490
it in mental patients I think there's so

249
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,319
you know you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a completely gar gar</font>

250
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,390
patient that walks out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hospital you</font>

251
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,570
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> scan him and see who he is and send</font>

252
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:19,760
him<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the right ward and I think</font>

253
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:23,570
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of there's quite a lot of</font>

254
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:26,450
it here being pushed by a company that

255
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:28,190
are promoting it for medical uses so I

256
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:30,800
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're pushing it more on the</font>

257
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,420
basis that if you have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> accident you</font>

258
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">can be identified and they can figure</font>

259
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:40,310
out what your blood type is and all that

260
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:42,860
kind of stuff now the whole basis of all

261
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:46,160
this technology is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you've got a</font>

262
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:48,980
unique ID<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay absolutely guaranteed</font>

263
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,010
that ID cannot be cloned you go to the

264
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,180
manufacturers websites and they will say

265
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:55,520
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've got patented</font>

266
00:13:53,180 --> 00:14:00,430
algorithms this is not possible to

267
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,430
produce<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I two units with the same ID</font>

268
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:08,719
so I don't know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of you were at</font>

269
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,779
Def Con last year guy called Jonathan

270
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:16,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">West who has presented a device which</font>

271
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:18,290
basically clones tags so and you can

272
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:20,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">download the source code and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

273
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,459
schematics for the device it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20</font>

274
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,410
bucks worth of bits you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> build that</font>

275
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:30,739
and it will clone pretty much any<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFID</font>

276
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:33,230
tag so of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course when that happens the</font>

277
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:36,230
industry comes along and comes out with

278
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:39,560
a defense why this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't a problem and I</font>

279
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:41,810
sort of like to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

280
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,010
scene where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> techie comes back from</font>

the conference<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he goes to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his</font>

282
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,819
management and says oh my god you know

283
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,260
they're cloning our tags game over

284
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,680
anyone complain a tag and walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

285
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:53,330
the door and the executives that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

286
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,069
well you know run<font color="#CCCCCC"> along little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> techy</font>

287
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,140
will think about this will come up with

288
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">a solution so thank God for the</font>

289
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:01,360
executives because they came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

290
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,360
perfect solution

291
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,460
so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't look like the original</font>

292
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,310
what's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem anyone can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see that</font>

293
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:15,490
smoke that so you know run along no

294
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:18,579
problem here so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was their</font>

295
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:20,230
defense it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really it's not really</font>

296
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,940
a clone because it doesn't look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

297
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,650
original so we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about</font>

298
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:26,320
the problem anymore so we got into an

299
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:27,699
argument about semantics rather than you

300
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dealing with the actual technical</font>

301
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:33,460
issue but obviously you know we

302
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:35,500
understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the reader doesn't</font>

303
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,810
physically look at the device it just

304
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,410
reads the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tag and if it gets the</font>

305
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:43,900
same ID and it's effectively the same

306
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:47,800
device so as far as the readers

307
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:49,840
concerned that equals that now when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

308
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,969
started researching this talk I<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a</font>

309
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,060
look you know Jonathan<font color="#CCCCCC"> rest who says</font>

310
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:56,800
device is there but there are also if

311
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,010
you search on the net there are a bunch

312
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:04,300
of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> projects where they've done</font>

313
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:06,819
similar stuff and you know these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all</font>

314
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:09,790
fairly easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find projects and in fact</font>

315
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:12,370
this last one is a circuit city you know

316
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:16,209
do your own cloning device over the

317
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:18,430
weekend project so but not to worry none

318
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:24,220
of them look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a tag so we're all</font>

319
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:26,949
perfectly safe this isn't an issue so I

320
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,840
took<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as a challenge could we</font>

321
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:31,180
actually get past the semantics argument

322
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:34,270
and really look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this and see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if there</font>

323
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:37,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">really is a issue here and to do that we</font>

324
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:39,670
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create a true clone so one that</font>

325
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:42,609
not only has the same digital number

326
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:46,900
digital identity but physically the same

327
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:49,630
form factor<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first we</font>

328
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:51,910
have to understand how the ID is

329
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:55,540
presented and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> its structured and so</font>

330
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:58,810
on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I took</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the example of animal</font>

331
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:03,520
tagging now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a standard called I</font>

332
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:05,619
so 11 784 or<font color="#CCCCCC"> ft XP and basically it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

333
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,440
three fields you get an ID and it

334
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:10,629
consists of<font color="#E5E5E5"> three parts the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first part</font>

335
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,430
is a flag which just<font color="#E5E5E5"> says if it's an</font>

336
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:15,310
animal application or non

337
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:18,040
application then you get a three digit

338
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:21,250
country or manufacturer code and then

339
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,780
you get your local unique ID so the

340
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:27,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">country or the manufacturer will issue</font>

341
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:29,530
the national ID and the way that's

342
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:33,639
actually transmitted from the tag to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

343
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:35,710
reader is you design it to work on a

344
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,930
particular frequency<font color="#CCCCCC"> so most of these ID</font>

345
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:41,890
only tags actually work<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the 1 25</font>

346
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:46,630
kilohertz range the smart cards tend to

347
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:48,760
work in 1356 megahertz you will transmit

348
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:51,520
the data at a certain bit rate which

349
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:54,760
tends to be frequency divided by some

350
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,550
factor of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 you'll send it with a</font>

351
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,860
particular encoding mechanism so whether

352
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:02,350
it's FSK or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Manchester or by phase or</font>

353
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:07,300
whatever and then you send a specific

354
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:09,070
bit pattern so some of these some of

355
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,500
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> parameters are in common between</font>

356
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:13,600
the different standards so they have a

357
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,940
header or a bit pattern structure that

358
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,100
allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to identify themselves as</font>

359
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,780
being tagged<font color="#E5E5E5"> taipei instead of take type</font>

360
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:25,719
thee even though the rest of the

361
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:28,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">parameters may be the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

362
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">to take an animal ID and read it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

363
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:35,290
dumb reader what I would get is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight</font>

364
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:39,970
byte sequence of numbers and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

365
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:41,770
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the structure here so the first few</font>

366
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,150
bites<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the national ID and you've got</font>

367
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:45,220
the country and then you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got the</font>

368
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:47,470
application code and you have to perform

369
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:52,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">a few operations on that number to</font>

370
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:54,760
actually translate it to the real IDs<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

371
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:57,399
basically you take the raw ID you

372
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:01,620
reverse it reverse the bits you then

373
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:04,240
reverse each nibble you then right shift

374
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,699
the country code and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gives you the</font>

375
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,370
decimal code which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can then look up</font>

376
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,610
there's a website<font color="#E5E5E5"> on I car door guy car</font>

377
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:14,500
is the organization that control<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

378
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:17,770
manufacturers IDs you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look</font>

379
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:20,980
that up and so in this case ID 985

380
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:22,150
equates to<font color="#CCCCCC"> dest Ron fearing and they've</font>

381
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,900
issued the local

382
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:28,410
idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 312 blah blah blah so that's</font>

383
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">quite simple and this is all published</font>

384
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:32,770
so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> download the specs and you</font>

385
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,680
can read how that works in more detail

386
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:37,800
so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to encode the ID obviously</font>

387
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:42,640
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> reverse that whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> process I</font>

388
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:46,330
create my<font color="#E5E5E5"> 64 bit roar ID and then have</font>

389
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:50,590
to add the binary headers so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I stick a</font>

390
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:54,129
header on the fixed bits in between the

391
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:56,530
the ID bytes is basically the headers

392
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:59,590
are a bunch of zeros so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a one</font>

393
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:01,420
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> nine zeros or something and so what</font>

394
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:05,459
they do then is they break up the ID<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

395
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:07,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">24 bit chunks and they stick a one every</font>

396
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,310
four bits and what that does is it

397
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,050
prevents the header from being

398
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:14,050
accidentally repeated in the bit stream

399
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:15,460
so that the nine zeros can't exist<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

400
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:20,200
the data because there's a one every

401
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:23,110
four bit so we now<font color="#CCCCCC"> have our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> raw 128 bits</font>

402
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:28,650
of data so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually deliver</font>

403
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:31,000
that to the reader I thought about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

404
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:34,120
from the manufacturers point of view if

405
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,340
I was a manufacturer making RFID chips

406
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,840
and there's this huge explosion of you

407
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,780
some proliferation of different

408
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,669
standards I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> making</font>

409
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:47,560
from scratch every different type of

410
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:49,690
RFID tag so it seemed to me that what

411
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,929
they would do is they would produce a

412
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:55,480
tag that was able to be switched between

413
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:57,130
the different formats because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that unit</font>

414
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,170
that makes their life much easier lower

415
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:02,200
manufacturing costs stocking costs and

416
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:05,350
so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I looked around the market and</font>

417
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,500
sure enough I came across a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

418
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:11,020
tags that actually follow this

419
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:15,340
philosophy so there's a device called a

420
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:17,760
q5<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what the q5 does is it allows you</font>

421
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:22,689
to set each of the parameters

422
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:24,040
independently so you can take you can

423
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:27,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">set the bit rate you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can set the</font>

424
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:30,100
modulation you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> 224 bits of user</font>

425
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:31,720
programmable data I need to program 128

426
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:35,110
so that's plenty of room for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font>

427
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:37,690
my ID in and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell it how many</font>

428
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:39,760
bytes to actually spit out when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

429
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,679
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> open up so these are dumb tags they</font>

430
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,330
just they sit there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when they get</font>

431
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,100
energized they start barfing the bit

432
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:49,000
pattern out so you tell it how many bits

433
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:51,309
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 224 to actually spit out the</font>

434
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">other approach is there's a device</font>

435
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:56,080
called a high tag<font color="#E5E5E5"> too and thats similar</font>

436
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,809
in that you can program it to tell it to

437
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,850
use different parameters but it has

438
00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:02,350
already pre-programmed personalities so

439
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:06,850
it has three<font color="#CCCCCC"> different modes of</font>

440
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:10,649
operation and they they translate to a

441
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:14,230
certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit rate modulation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so on so</font>

442
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:18,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">and those three modes actually as it</font>

443
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:22,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">happens</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I equate to the most commonly</font>

444
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:25,600
used ID or door entry systems car

445
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:27,190
immobilizers and animal tax so quite

446
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:34,320
handy the three things that we might

447
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:37,120
find interesting till we say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I</font>

448
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,490
now know that this stuff exists and I

449
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,139
know how to produce the data so I

450
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:43,470
started looking around that you know

451
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:46,510
where can I get one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these and I had</font>

452
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:48,789
an office you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we have a door entry</font>

453
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:50,679
system at my office so I had a look at

454
00:22:48,789 --> 00:22:54,669
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually moved office so it was</font>

455
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:57,570
now redundant and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> found that I could</font>

456
00:22:54,669 --> 00:23:00,340
actually reprogram my existing door<font color="#CCCCCC"> tape</font>

457
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:03,908
so if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just set the bit rate set the</font>

458
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,740
modulation program the the ID into it it

459
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:10,270
should then behave like the thing I'm

460
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:12,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to emulate so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give</font>

461
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:15,210
you a quick demonstration of an access

462
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:19,330
control system it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as pretty as ax</font>

463
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:21,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">its is actually a bit of gaffer tape and</font>

464
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:25,649
a battery and you know an LED rather

465
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:27,690
than a nice unit but

466
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:31,620
and actually this this raises an

467
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:34,310
interesting issue because obviously I

468
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:36,540
flew here how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people flew here to</font>

469
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:41,280
view I can't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you anymore because I'm</font>

470
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:43,379
busy looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> good in the lights so I</font>

471
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,810
flew here and I have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff in</font>

472
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:49,650
my bag which could be misinterpreted so

473
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:51,540
you know you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so I tend to</font>

474
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:54,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">carry it in my hand luggage so I can</font>

475
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:55,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">explain when when you know the officers</font>

476
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:58,290
want to know why I've got things with

477
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:02,160
batteries and circuit boards and and so

478
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:05,610
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I was coming through the security</font>

479
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:08,010
checkpoint and in front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of me there was</font>

480
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,659
a couple with a newborn baby<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

481
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:11,730
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got their pram and they've got</font>

482
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:13,950
their baby they got a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of luggage</font>

483
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:17,430
and they're scanning it all through the

484
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:19,110
Machine and the white gets sent through

485
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:21,300
and the baby gets sent through and the

486
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:24,209
pram gets sent through and finally the

487
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,800
guys left on his own with a sort of

488
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:29,300
little zippy bag thing and inside the

489
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:33,450
bag there's six bottles of milk<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

490
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:35,810
the customs of the security guy says

491
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:38,760
where you can't take liquids on board

492
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:40,440
and he's like okay well we've got a

493
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,860
12-hour flight we've got a newborn<font color="#E5E5E5"> baby</font>

494
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,330
this is his milk needs to go through so

495
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,429
he calls their supervisor over and the

496
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:49,439
supervisor said okay no that's fine

497
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:52,230
milks an exception in a baby milks

498
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,590
inception you can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that through but</font>

499
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:57,720
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to prove that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's milk first</font>

500
00:24:54,590 --> 00:25:00,840
so he<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to take the lid off each</font>

501
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,610
bottle and taste each one and first of

502
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,330
all I'm saying they're thinking hmm what

503
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:05,330
kind of milk is that

504
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:10,750
you really love your wife don't you

505
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:12,250
anyway so he takes each bottle and he

506
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">sends it to them by this point there's</font>

507
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,070
you know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> all taking time and</font>

508
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,350
there's a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a crowd building up</font>

509
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:18,939
behind us and there's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know two or</font>

510
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,980
three security guys the guy from the

511
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:24,220
machines come over and they're all kind

512
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,570
of milling around and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm thinking great</font>

513
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:28,000
that's all I need you know I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

514
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:29,860
bag full of electronic crap and there's

515
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,330
you know bits and pieces that they're

516
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,639
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to really look at if they</font>

517
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:35,199
want me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pull it out and it's all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

518
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,060
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen and their circuits and</font>

519
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's wires amid batteries and there's</font>

520
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:41,649
all sorts of crap and I've now got these

521
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:45,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">three guys all standing there and a big</font>

522
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:46,960
crowd of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people behind me so they're</font>

523
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at it and they're looking at it</font>

524
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,220
and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of nudging each other and</font>

525
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:59,140
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them turns to me</font>

526
00:25:51,220 --> 00:26:02,830
and says no fluids in there are no fine

527
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:04,300
money go that's good so you know it's

528
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:06,970
crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what's happening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

529
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,530
moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> is people are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> focused on shoes</font>

530
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,880
and fluids and anything else you know

531
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:11,860
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it looks like a bomb that's</font>

532
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:17,040
fine don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even bother checking what it</font>

533
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:21,699
is it's not fluid so yeah bit crazy

534
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:25,270
anyway so if i plug this in so what

535
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:29,800
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got here is an access control</font>

536
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:31,450
system this is the reader this LED

537
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:35,680
lights up if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I open the door</font>

538
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:38,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">successfully so if i take the correct</font>

539
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:42,940
door tag hopefully you'll see can you

540
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:45,210
see the LED okay so basically that would

541
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:49,780
be the door actuator that opens the door

542
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:51,910
if i take my door tag nothing's going to

543
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:55,270
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the wrong door</font>

544
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:59,040
tag so what I'll do now is we try and

545
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:59,040
reprogram this to be that

546
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:38,789
how's that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that readable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so but</font>

547
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:56,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use is an off-the-shelf</font>

548
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:59,049
compact flash format reader writer and

549
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:02,830
this is a little keyboard wedge reader

550
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:07,270
so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> these tags are sold under</font>

551
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:08,889
the brand unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and you can buy a</font>

552
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,389
unique reader and this is a keyboard

553
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:12,970
wedge which if you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of these on</font>

554
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:14,940
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will just type it into the system</font>

555
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:19,200
as if you typed the idea on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the keyboard</font>

556
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,200
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font>

557
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:31,960
should get so basically just preventing

558
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:37,120
the tag to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reader gives me its ID</font>

559
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:38,500
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so as this is branded unique</font>

560
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:43,719
I've written a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> program called</font>

561
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:50,170
unique I tell it is unique tag that's

562
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:56,320
just ID and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write it I'll take</font>

563
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:58,270
my blank tag and in theory that's now

564
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,960
done so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been reprogrammed to be</font>

565
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:10,600
that ID so if I got it right what should

566
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:14,590
happen if I hold it up I'm now in your

567
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:18,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">building so as you saw the kit to read</font>

568
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:19,540
the CID is simply that so if I had that

569
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:22,060
in a little handheld and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> walked past</font>

570
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:24,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">you read the key out of your pocket</font>

571
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:26,409
that's all it<font color="#CCCCCC"> took a couple of seconds</font>

572
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:36,450
to get that ID and I've now cloned your

573
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:36,450
door entry system so I'm sorry say again

574
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:43,600
did I use the same device to write it

575
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:45,250
now this this is a read-only device

576
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty cheap it just</font>

577
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:50,260
reads the ID<font color="#CCCCCC"> number this was the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one I</font>

578
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:53,560
used to write it which is a compact

579
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:56,410
flash writer I'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

580
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:59,320
hardware towards the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end but this stuff</font>

581
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:02,670
is freely available and it's I mean it's

582
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:05,320
not cheap but it's not usually expensive

583
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:12,190
do ask questions as we go along by the

584
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:13,330
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's that's the ID systems</font>

585
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:17,950
the other thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to talk</font>

586
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:21,490
about was cloning an animal tank so

587
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:24,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">normally I would bring my cow along but</font>

588
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:27,250
she got detains of security something

589
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:29,919
something to do with fluids under 94 but

590
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,950
so i have i have with me my little mouse

591
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:35,600
friend

592
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:37,399
who actually if anyone's interested if

593
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,469
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get implanted this is the</font>

594
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:44,029
needle that they're gonna stick in you

595
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:46,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so he squeaked a bit when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I put it</font>

596
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:49,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">in him but not too much going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pass</font>

597
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:52,959
that around oh sorry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font>

598
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:56,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">now now permanently tagged but nevermind</font>

599
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:59,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so basically normally what I do is</font>

600
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:03,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have a little webcam so I can show you</font>

601
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,970
what's being shown on the display but i

602
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,500
cleverly did an update and broke my

603
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:08,990
drivers so it's not actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

604
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:12,830
this morning so what I'll do is I'll

605
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:14,720
just pass this around and basically you

606
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:18,860
press the red button<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it will start</font>

607
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:21,370
scanning and then you when you hear a

608
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:27,620
beep<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read the ID so it's read off</font>

609
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:29,539
9680 470 double 897 so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just pass</font>

610
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:40,370
this around and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can start having a</font>

611
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:43,399
look at it so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is I'm going to</font>

612
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:44,689
try and reprogram this tag so it's now

613
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:46,610
completely different<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard the</font>

614
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:49,130
original standard that I programmed it

615
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:52,039
to be as unique I'm now<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to program</font>

616
00:31:49,130 --> 00:32:00,139
it to be an FTX be tagged and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and be</font>

617
00:31:52,039 --> 00:32:01,760
the same ideas for the mouse so first

618
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:03,260
thing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do is reset the tag back</font>

619
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,658
to its original state when I first

620
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:08,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">started doing this this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was the only tag</font>

621
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:10,610
i had and i quickly broke it obviously

622
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:12,590
you know when you're experimenting and

623
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:15,379
you're messing around with head of

624
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:17,029
formats and so on it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy to send</font>

625
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,639
it the wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and the tag just</font>

626
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:23,000
decided it's not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play anymore</font>

627
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:25,539
and I then found a manufacturer who sold

628
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,919
blanks so I bought a pile of blanks and

629
00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:31,789
after a while I broke all of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

630
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:33,500
so one day I was on a very long train

631
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:35,870
ride and I was going to a job and I had

632
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:38,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">like four hours to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kill so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I sat down</font>

633
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:41,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">and thought I need to fix this so I</font>

634
00:32:38,419 --> 00:32:45,650
actually came up with a program

635
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:49,570
these tags are these are the q5 tags so

636
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:49,570
I came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a program that fixes that</font>

637
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:10,280
so that resets it back to a default

638
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:13,040
value and I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> then program it so I</font>

639
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:15,470
tell it's an animal tank I then give it

640
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:27,639
its local ID so whoever's got the reader

641
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:27,640
if you could shout out the number yeah

642
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:41,570
ok so again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I tell it i want to write</font>

643
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:43,070
the tag actually in the in the interest

644
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:45,230
of trying to follow the original form

645
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,610
factor what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do instead of</font>

646
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:50,720
writing it to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got one of these</font>

647
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:53,659
tags in my wrist so i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to program</font>

648
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:58,480
my reprogram my tag to be the mount ok

649
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:58,480
so i will<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

650
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:14,110
never do live demos<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so in theory</font>

651
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:21,490
that's now<font color="#E5E5E5"> reprogrammed so whoever's got</font>

652
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:23,070
the scanner ah yeah I'm not crazy enough

653
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:25,509
to have one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those needles stuck</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in me</font>

654
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:30,450
it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> found into my watch strap</font>

655
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:30,450
so if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> scan the mouse first</font>

656
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:52,690
press the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cut okay I'm read the ib ok so</font>

657
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:59,200
now scan my wrist John a terre i am that

658
00:34:52,690 --> 00:35:06,750
mouth thank you my wife will be

659
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:06,750
delighted so unique ID I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

660
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:22,240
does it only work across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same chip</font>

661
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:24,580
type of form factor the q5 device is

662
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,740
sold in dozens of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different form factors</font>

663
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:30,960
so you can get it<font color="#CCCCCC"> from these kind of</font>

664
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:33,279
cards credit<font color="#E5E5E5"> card shaped cards key fobs</font>

665
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,480
you know ones that look like this you

666
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:39,190
can get ones that are impervious to heat

667
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,250
little males that you can mail into

668
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:44,110
wooden planks all kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> formats so</font>

669
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:46,390
whatever it is you're trying to clone

670
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:48,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a very good chance you will find</font>

671
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:52,330
the physical format that matches the

672
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:54,040
original so some of the issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought</font>

673
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:56,200
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know why this this is a</font>

674
00:35:54,040 --> 00:36:00,130
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously you can track</font>

675
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:03,129
individuals you know i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> using a little</font>

676
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:05,440
reader like this but if you've ever been

677
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:07,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a shop you know and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

678
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,280
security gates as you walk out those two

679
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:12,710
gates that catch you shoplifting

680
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:15,140
those are basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the same</font>

681
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:16,550
technology so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could position those</font>

682
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:20,540
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the place and anyone who walks</font>

683
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:22,400
through them you'll read their IDs or

684
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:24,009
you can wire rapid or anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> that walks</font>

685
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,010
through the door frame you'll get them

686
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:30,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">hi them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> antenna under the floor whatever</font>

687
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:32,360
so pretend the potential to track people

688
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,310
which means you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can then obviously</font>

689
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:36,760
target individuals if you're looking for

690
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:39,080
a certain person arriving on the scene

691
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,990
impersonate people to get access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

692
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:44,060
buildings but also the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> round</font>

693
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:47,180
provide an alibi you know if we start

694
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:49,670
using these for compliance so say

695
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:52,370
somebody's on probation and they have a

696
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:54,890
tag implanted and they have to go to a

697
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:58,299
police station once a week or once a day

698
00:36:54,890 --> 00:37:00,680
and prove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they are there if i</font>

699
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,960
reprogram my tag to be them then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

700
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:04,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">provided them with a perfect alibi I've</font>

701
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,890
got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> police saying yeah he was here</font>

702
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:09,890
in the police<font color="#E5E5E5"> station at eleven o'clock</font>

703
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:11,450
when that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bank was being robbed so and</font>

715
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:54,770
that don't rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on raw IDs okay so we're</font>

718
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:04,220
conversation with the tag and the

719
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:07,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">example that I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use is the UK</font>

720
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:10,759
passport of the the e passports in

721
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:12,860
general now I quite often get asked how

722
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:16,190
do I know if my passport has a chip in

723
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:18,470
it this logo here

724
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:20,599
that's an international standard if

725
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:22,220
you've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new passport and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

726
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:24,680
that logo on it then you have a chip in

727
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:26,029
your passport if you don't then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

728
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:29,569
probably don't have a chip in your

729
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:32,359
passport but that's the clue if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

730
00:38:29,569 --> 00:38:34,040
from the UK the other clear is there's

731
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:38,779
this dirty great tip in the back of your

732
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:40,910
passport but I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know why we do that</font>

733
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:43,640
but most countries don't that the chip

734
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:47,180
is hidden so what they're actually doing

735
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:50,690
with this stuff is they're storing data

736
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:53,210
about you on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the passport if you go and</font>

737
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:55,520
look at the standard there's defined in

738
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:57,980
the standard 48 different fields<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data</font>

739
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:00,530
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to store in these</font>

740
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:03,170
passports and that includes stuff like

741
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:04,760
you know biometrics fingerprints your

742
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:09,050
facial image so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> picture that's in</font>

743
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:11,000
the past for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the document you use to get</font>

744
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:13,130
the passport in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so if</font>

745
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,540
you produce the birth certificate that

746
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:17,000
will be scanned<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stored on the</font>

747
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:19,190
passport your home address your phone

748
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:23,770
number your profession all kinds of

749
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:26,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff so really an ID thieves paradise</font>

750
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:28,640
so it's got all this really secure stuff

751
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:32,839
on it or important data it's obviously

752
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:36,618
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect it right so they use</font>

753
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:39,680
encryption they use pseudo-random IDs so

754
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:43,280
unlike this tag when you present the

755
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:45,799
passport to a reader this tag gives off

756
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,740
unique ID with a passport it gives off<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

757
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:50,540
pseudo-random ID so I can't just walk

758
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:53,899
past you and find out your passport

759
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:56,089
number is 1234 and I can now track you

760
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,079
because next time I scan your passport

761
00:39:56,089 --> 00:40:01,700
is going to give out a completely

762
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:04,520
different number to read the data from

763
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:08,598
the passport I need to authenticate so

764
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:10,460
they've encrypted<font color="#CCCCCC"> the communication</font>

765
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:12,740
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the passport and the reader and</font>

766
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:14,869
they've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with three days and</font>

767
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:19,669
that's a standard called basic access

768
00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:22,730
control now the standard says you don't

769
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:24,560
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it you can allow people</font>

770
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:26,390
to just log in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and read it without doing</font>

771
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,140
any kind of authentication

772
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:32,509
but if you do then you have to use the

773
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:35,868
basic access control standard and that's

774
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:37,519
all laid out exactly how it works the

775
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:40,279
other thing potentially you can do is

776
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:41,990
encrypt the content but<font color="#CCCCCC"> again that's</font>

777
00:40:40,279 --> 00:40:44,359
optional it's up to each country whether

778
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:46,519
they do the encryption or not and if

779
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:49,130
they do in this case it's also up to

780
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:59,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">them how they do it did you have a</font>

781
00:40:49,130 --> 00:41:04,420
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so the question was because</font>

782
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:07,099
three days is a symmetric key algorithm

783
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,750
how do you you really got one key that's

784
00:41:07,099 --> 00:41:12,440
shared by everyone or you've got some

785
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:14,029
massive key management problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok all</font>

786
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have to do some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of key change</font>

787
00:41:14,029 --> 00:41:20,589
so you do what you do is actually you

788
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:24,500
you do some hashed challenge responses

789
00:41:20,589 --> 00:41:26,119
so yes good point so what they've done

790
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:30,680
is they've standard those the way you

791
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:32,960
figure out the key it's different<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

792
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:37,089
each passport but the way you find it is

793
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:39,710
the same ok so<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically you read the</font>

794
00:41:37,089 --> 00:41:42,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">DMR Zed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the machine-readable zone at the</font>

795
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:44,750
bottom of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the passport you take the</font>

796
00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:48,140
first field which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the passport number</font>

797
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:50,000
you take the date of birth and you take

798
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:51,410
the expiry date of the passport<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

799
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:59,839
add those things together and that's

800
00:41:51,410 --> 00:42:03,460
your key that's very secure so I'm

801
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:09,319
actually going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to demonstrate doing this</font>

802
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:10,700
so change reader again this is an

803
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:16,279
off-the-shelf reader this is the high

804
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:19,328
frequency stuff so quick change<font color="#E5E5E5"> of kit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

805
00:42:16,279 --> 00:42:19,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">also meet</font>

806
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:48,710
okay so normally what would happen is

807
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:50,329
you would hand your you would hand your

808
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:52,339
passport<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Board of Control and</font>

809
00:42:50,329 --> 00:42:53,960
they would take it they'd run<font color="#CCCCCC"> it through</font>

810
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:56,630
a machine called the name as a breeder

811
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:59,690
and that would read the bottom line<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

812
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:02,000
the mrz and derived the key from it

813
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:04,520
because i don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MRA reader we</font>

814
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,030
have to type it in so here's one I

815
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:15,170
prepared earlier so if i put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

816
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:17,359
passport there so it's now read it's

817
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:22,069
logged in it's now reading the trials as

818
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:23,839
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see it's read the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mrz</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

819
00:43:22,069 --> 00:43:25,400
so that's the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> name and the date</font>

820
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:28,730
of birth and stuff stored in the

821
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:32,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">passport it's now reading another file</font>

822
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:36,710
each<font color="#E5E5E5"> item is stored as a discrete file</font>

823
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:38,210
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stored so</font>

824
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:41,630
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see I was much better looking</font>

825
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:43,910
when I had this passport even<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

826
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:48,170
lights and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that this is actually my</font>

827
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:50,629
son's passport and this is what stored

828
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:52,069
so none of this has taken off my<font color="#CCCCCC"> artist</font>

829
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:56,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is actually stored in the passport</font>

830
00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:58,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">so his image name date of birth expiry</font>

831
00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:01,550
date all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff is directly</font>

832
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:05,329
stored on the passport<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so if you</font>

833
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:08,060
now wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a duplicate at this</font>

834
00:44:05,329 --> 00:44:10,220
passport you've got not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a rough</font>

835
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:12,290
idea of what should be on there but the

836
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:18,169
exact data that should be on the real

837
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:20,380
passport which I can't help feeling is

838
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:20,380
bad

839
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:26,140
plus whatever data they used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font>

840
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:27,640
passport actually at the moment this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

841
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:30,250
all that's stored on there I haven't

842
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:32,250
seen I've looked at probably six or

843
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:35,050
seven<font color="#E5E5E5"> different countries passports and</font>

844
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:37,660
so far the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only thing I've seen stored</font>

845
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:40,510
is this stuff the newer stuff like the

846
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:45,730
fingerprints and so on isn't yet stored

847
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:47,830
on any<font color="#E5E5E5"> passports but in the UK by 2010</font>

848
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:49,360
you'll have to actually to in order to

849
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:52,060
get a passport you will have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

850
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">fingerprinted and rs scanned and a whole</font>

851
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:57,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">bunch of other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff you're going to</font>

852
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:57,420
have to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> up those 48 items of data</font>

853
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:15,760
the other thing sorry gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok how</font>

854
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:17,380
difficult is it practically for somebody

855
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,650
to clone your passport because they have

856
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:23,560
to actually get hold of it thank you the

857
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:26,200
well there's two outs of to that one is

858
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:29,410
once you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the blanks are</font>

859
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:31,089
available it has been done german

860
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:32,620
researcher whose name escapes me just at

861
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:35,320
the moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> but i can find out if you're</font>

862
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:37,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested afterwards has already proved</font>

863
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:41,410
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can just take this data and</font>

864
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:44,470
copy it directly to a blank the blanks

865
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:47,980
are worth about a pound each maybe a

866
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:52,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit more so it's definitely</font>

867
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:53,680
doable the one of the defense's I mean

868
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:56,500
I've been having some discussions with

869
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:58,450
the UK Home Office about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff not</font>

870
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,230
directly through the newspapers of

871
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:02,868
course

872
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:05,869
I do stuff they publish a story they

873
00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:08,420
issue a rebuttal one song but<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the</font>

874
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:10,220
things they said was ok so you've copied

875
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:12,170
the passport which you had in your hand

876
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:16,279
and you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have photocopied what's</font>

877
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:20,540
the big deal and so I was challenged by

878
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:23,210
a UK newspaper called the Daily Mail to

879
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:25,520
say well would it be possible to read

880
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:27,260
the passport without actually having it

881
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:30,020
open in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands and being able to</font>

882
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:31,910
read<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ml Zed and I believed it was</font>

883
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:34,609
and so they challenged me to actually do

884
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:35,960
that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the way it worked was I</font>

885
00:46:34,609 --> 00:46:38,660
went to their office<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they had</font>

886
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,820
someone apply for a new passport and it

887
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:42,109
arrived and in the sealed envelope they

888
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:46,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">gave me the sealed envelope and said</font>

889
00:46:42,109 --> 00:46:50,060
right now read that possible and I read

890
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:55,580
it in about four hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically so I</font>

891
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:57,650
brute forced yes there's no shielding in

892
00:46:55,580 --> 00:47:00,109
the UK passport the only passport I've

893
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:04,340
seen so far<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has any shielding in</font>

894
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:05,960
the cover is the US passport so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

895
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:07,340
had been a<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. passport in a sealed</font>

896
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:10,280
envelope I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been able to</font>

897
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:13,190
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the UK passport when it's closed</font>

898
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:15,230
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can read it but incidentally the US</font>

899
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:17,900
passport if you just allow it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to flop</font>

900
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:19,550
open like this the shielding actually

901
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:24,920
acts as a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of amplifier makes it</font>

902
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:27,440
even easier to read but the reason that

903
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:33,710
was possible so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I try and read this</font>

904
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:38,770
guy again say I didn't know the last

905
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:41,750
three digits of the passport number i

906
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:44,090
can just brute force it there's no

907
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:46,220
protection in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> passport to stop me</font>

908
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:49,720
just doing repeated access attempts and

909
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:49,720
failing and trying again yes sir

910
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:54,790
right so the question was now I did it

911
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:57,369
once would it take four hours to do the

912
00:47:54,790 --> 00:48:00,640
next one no it would be considerably

913
00:47:57,369 --> 00:48:04,180
faster because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> keyspace</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

914
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:06,220
to check included what i<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought was</font>

915
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:07,660
roughly the current passport number

916
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:09,970
because we issue the passport

917
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:11,649
sequentially I knew roughly where they

918
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:14,470
were what I was doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> was checking about</font>

919
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:15,820
10,000 numbers once I've done one on a

920
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:18,098
particular day I would have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

921
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:19,450
better clue as to where we were in the

922
00:48:18,099 --> 00:48:21,970
sequence so I probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> only have to</font>

923
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:25,839
check about a thousand so it would be

924
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:27,459
about 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> times faster and this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

925
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,440
for new ones yes I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not a</font>

926
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:33,339
practical this is not a practical attack

927
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:37,030
against random passports you see in the

928
00:48:33,339 --> 00:48:39,190
street<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the point was that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

929
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:41,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> defense that it was impossible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

930
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:42,670
read a passport without having it

931
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:46,869
physically in your hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and open was</font>

932
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:56,200
was failed was not true so any other

933
00:48:46,869 --> 00:48:58,119
questions okay so question is so you can

934
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:02,220
copy one but can you forge one so can

935
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:05,320
you change the content of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> existing</font>

936
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:07,839
passport or create a completely

937
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:15,550
arbitrary one so when I was reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

938
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:18,880
files as I said each one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is stored</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

939
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:21,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">discrete file so each object each of the</font>

940
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:24,099
48 items is in a file stored on the

941
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:29,618
passport so the image is in a file

942
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:33,910
called EF dg2 and I extract that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

943
00:49:29,619 --> 00:49:36,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">jpeg there is a device there is a file</font>

944
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:41,230
called the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> object the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fso d and</font>

945
00:49:36,869 --> 00:49:43,330
e FS OD contains digital signatures for

946
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:46,540
each of the other files and the

947
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:49,140
signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> for itself if we look at that</font>

948
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:49,140
with a hex editor

949
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:59,150
you can see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in there there's</font>

950
00:49:54,470 --> 00:50:01,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">the signing authorities public key</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

951
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:04,610
so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> check the signature against</font>

952
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:06,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">the public key of the authority that</font>

953
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:09,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">issued it which you read from the</font>

954
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:13,400
passport anyone spot the deliberate

955
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:15,920
mistake<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so basically you're</font>

956
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:18,020
checking the validity of an object

957
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:21,080
stored on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this object against an object</font>

958
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:23,480
stored on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this object so i give you the</font>

959
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:27,310
new key that matches the signed stuff

960
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:27,310
that I've given<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and it's game over</font>

961
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:39,290
I'm sorry at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the border they yeah so</font>

962
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:40,910
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> the defense against that is at the</font>

963
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:43,509
border<font color="#CCCCCC"> they would have the public keys</font>

964
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:46,970
that they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check against</font>

965
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:49,130
you've got something like 28 countries

966
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:52,279
signed up to this these keys are going

967
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:55,250
to expire monthly i believe so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

968
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:59,000
going to have a massive key distribution

969
00:50:55,250 --> 00:51:01,790
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> CR</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> l's and so on which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we know</font>

970
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone who does PK</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I will know that the</font>

971
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:08,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">crl issue is one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the biggest issues</font>

972
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:11,300
you have to deal with so again I brought

973
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:14,180
this up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the UK and said well it's not</font>

974
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:16,820
secure because I could forge the key and

975
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:20,240
they said oh no there's there's a thing

976
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:22,850
called the PKB so the PKB is the public

977
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:24,680
key directory and it's an internet

978
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:27,950
accessible directory of all the public

979
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:29,330
keys and all the revocation lists for

980
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:32,330
all the countries signed up to this

981
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:34,460
project so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read the specs I'm sure</font>

982
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:35,960
enough the spec says there is a PKD and

983
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:37,490
it will be publicly accessible over the

984
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,830
internet and here's how you talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

985
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:41,270
blah blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I contact the UK</font>

986
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:45,290
passport office and say how do I get

987
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:47,180
access to this no response I'd search

988
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:50,150
the internet for any clues as to how you

990
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:53,990
the website of the working group they're

991
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:58,040
actually defining the standard for the

992
00:51:53,990 --> 00:52:00,600
PKB they finally ratified their design<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

993
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:03,300
think in june of last year

994
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:06,290
and they put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out to tender at that</font>

995
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:10,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">point and i believe they appointed a</font>

996
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:12,600
company to<font color="#CCCCCC"> deliver this system in around</font>

997
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:14,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">october of last year so if this system</font>

998
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:17,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">is already deployed and working and</font>

999
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:21,690
being used that will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fastest</font>

1000
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:25,200
government IT project ever done I'm the

1001
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:28,910
entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> history of the world so I just</font>

1002
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,910
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe it exists at the moment</font>

1003
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,700
yes so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is are they signed</font>

1004
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:38,300
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's typical</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Authority this is the</font>

1005
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:41,669
public key of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> certificate authority</font>

1006
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:45,120
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way the PKB works is each country</font>

1007
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:47,490
sets up its own authority and they have

1008
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:51,049
write access to the PKB so they can

1009
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:54,149
update the public keys for their country

1010
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:55,980
so it's up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the person checking</font>

1011
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:58,140
the document to go and get the public

1012
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:59,940
key and check<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it matches the one on</font>

1013
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:02,790
the passport<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that the signatures</font>

1014
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:13,880
match for the objects that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are signed</font>

1015
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:13,880
with that key any other questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

1016
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:33,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">right okay okay so the question was have</font>

1017
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:36,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">I had any discussions with them about</font>

1018
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:38,759
disabling the chip or you know what

1019
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:42,630
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the response if I try and use a</font>

1020
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:45,360
device with the chip disabled the

1021
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:47,400
standard specifically says having a

1022
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:51,360
non-functional chip should not prevent

1023
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:54,300
you from crossing a border ok so the

1024
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:56,820
device isn't expected to necessarily

1025
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:59,160
work and in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a recent audit</font>

1026
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:02,820
office review of the technology in the

1027
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:05,609
UK like most countries our passports

1028
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:07,920
last for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years the chips are</font>

1029
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:10,190
warranted by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the manufacturer for two</font>

1030
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,190
years

1031
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:17,140
so I think it's not a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem if it</font>

1032
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:19,090
doesn't work but if it didn't work the

1033
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:20,650
second time they'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably make you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pay</font>

1034
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:23,320
so the first time they'd say you need a

1035
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:25,750
new passport will replace<font color="#CCCCCC"> it second time</font>

1036
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:27,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">it'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you pay and the third</font>

1037
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:29,440
type may might detect some kind of

1038
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,120
pattern forming here and decide to

1039
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,830
prosecute you because you know this

1040
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't mine this belongs to well this</font>

1041
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:37,720
belongs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my son but mine belongs to</font>

1042
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:51,190
the government as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so I'm not</font>

1043
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:52,839
allowed to interfere with it right so

1044
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:55,090
you don't bother replicating wrong with

1045
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:57,120
a chip you just do a blank one which

1046
00:54:55,090 --> 00:55:00,160
doesn't have the logo on or whatever

1047
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:03,339
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to work because for</font>

1048
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:05,470
example in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US if I have a passport</font>

1049
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:09,100
as a UK citizen if I have a passport

1050
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:12,220
issued after October of last year and it

1051
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:14,290
doesn't have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFID chip in it then I</font>

1052
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:18,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">cannot participate in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> visa waiver</font>

1053
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:20,560
program so the US<font color="#E5E5E5"> has actually forced</font>

1054
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:23,170
this technology on to the rest of the

1055
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:27,160
community by imposing that restriction

1056
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:28,870
so everybody had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to adopt a passport by</font>

1057
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:30,549
October of last year otherwise their

1058
00:55:28,870 --> 00:55:37,810
citizens couldn't travel freely to the

1059
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:39,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">US anymore well as I said if you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

1060
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:42,900
RFID passport and the chips not working

1061
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,900
you'll get away with it the first time

1062
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:53,050
yes you could and you'd get away with it

1063
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:54,939
once so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can either disable your</font>

1064
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:57,010
existing chip or you can forge your own

1065
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:59,890
and not have a chip in it at all but the

1066
00:55:57,010 --> 00:56:01,210
end result will be the same that they

1067
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:03,100
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably let you through the border</font>

1068
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:06,300
once and the second time they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

1069
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:06,299
to ask awkward questions

1070
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:23,329
Terrace will get through once which is

1071
00:56:08,339 --> 00:56:27,450
all they need yes sir ok so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Creator</font>

1072
00:56:23,329 --> 00:56:29,220
if from the point of view / identity

1073
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:31,618
theft could you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just walk past some when</font>

1074
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:34,288
I'm read their passport<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer no</font>

1075
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:36,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know the key details</font>

1076
00:56:34,289 --> 00:56:38,700
so in order to log in I need to know

1077
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:41,910
quite a lot about the passport to be

1078
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:44,220
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the three days basically</font>

1079
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:47,399
authentication so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really a</font>

1080
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:50,220
threat as far as sort of drive-by

1081
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:52,170
attacks go but the real issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1082
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:54,118
from my point of view is when they first

1083
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:57,809
introduced these they said this is going

1084
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:59,960
to increase your<font color="#E5E5E5"> security I can't see</font>

1085
00:56:57,809 --> 00:57:02,609
anything about<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that chip in there</font>

1086
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:04,410
containing digital copies of my data

1087
00:57:02,609 --> 00:57:06,450
that does anything to enhance my

1088
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:08,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">security this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not a better more</font>

1089
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:21,328
secure passport than the old one that

1090
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:23,309
didn't have a chip in it you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

1091
00:57:21,329 --> 00:57:25,460
so the comment was you could read the

1092
00:57:23,309 --> 00:57:28,019
chip and then offline brute force the ID

1093
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:30,690
know that the mechanism is it's a

1094
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:33,419
challenge response so you say to the

1095
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:36,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">passport here's a random number hash</font>

1096
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:40,140
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> mikey and it says back go away</font>

1097
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:46,499
that's the wrong number yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so did you</font>

1098
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:47,910
see if you're sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> next to someone in</font>

1099
00:57:46,499 --> 00:57:50,700
an airplane for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten hours you could</font>

1100
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:53,399
brute force it yes and in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've got</font>

1101
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:54,930
a little bluetooth reader that allows me

1102
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:59,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">to plump the reader somewhere and sit</font>

1103
00:57:54,930 --> 00:58:01,019
somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> else doing the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actual work so</font>

1104
00:57:59,819 --> 00:58:02,519
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we're running out of time</font>

1105
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:05,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">so I'll just quickly flashed through my</font>

1106
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:05,359
final slides

1107
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:11,590
so the obvious threat we can we prove

1108
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,090
that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the key data from other</font>

1109
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:15,700
channels we don't physically need the

1110
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:17,920
passport in our hand I've also found

1111
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:20,830
like an profiled passports to a certain

1112
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:23,290
degree so I can tell when I see a

1113
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:25,210
passport even without logging into it or

1114
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:29,650
trying to read the<font color="#E5E5E5"> details so just</font>

1115
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:33,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">random person walking past I can figure</font>

1116
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:35,470
out to some degree which country you

1117
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,360
come from for certain countries so i

1118
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:39,580
reckon at the moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can determine a</font>

1119
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:41,650
US passport<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can determine an Italian</font>

1120
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:49,000
passport and I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> determine an</font>

1121
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:51,190
Australian passport so the code that

1122
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:55,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">i've been using here is all open source</font>

1123
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:57,130
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can download it it's currently</font>

drives a couple of different

1125
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:02,410
manufacturers devices ACG and frosh

1126
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:06,370
there's an open source project called

1127
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:08,290
open PCD which we're about to<font color="#CCCCCC"> start work</font>

1128
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:10,240
on trying to get my code working with

1129
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:13,360
their hardware so you can build<font color="#CCCCCC"> your own</font>

1132
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:19,930
interested but I build these things ACG

1133
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:21,460
don't normally sell to end users they

1134
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:24,100
don't have any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of finished products</font>

1135
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:25,900
that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just buy from their site so</font>

1136
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:28,720
i buy the components and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i solder them</font>

1137
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:30,190
together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I sell them it's not</font>

1138
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">something I particularly want to do so</font>

1139
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:34,390
if anyone finds people who are shipping

1140
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:36,820
ready-made readers that happen to be a

helpful at the beginning they suddenly

1145
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:50,410
notice what I was doing which i think is

1146
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,609
a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a shame because you know it's</font>

1147
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:54,790
in all of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> interest that the</font>

1148

technology is secure but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of</font>

1149
00:59:54,790 --> 01:00:04,029
typical<font color="#E5E5E5"> of commercial industries looking</font>

1150
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:06,160
at people pointing out mistakes and

1151
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:07,750
that's pretty much it any other

1152
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:13,450
questions

1153
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:15,580
I think the reprogrammable cars will go

1154
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:17,020
away now I really don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so i think</font>

1155
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:18,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the problem is just the way they're</font>

1156
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:23,050
being used<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you shouldn't rely</font>

1157
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:26,050
an rfid tag is an authentic it's not an

1158
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:29,200
authentication token it's an ID token so

1159
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:31,090
you shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> rely on a unique number to</font>

1160
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:34,120
say not only is this what it says it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1161
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:35,740
but it's guaranteed to be you know being

1162
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:37,450
operated by the person who's authorized

1163
01:00:35,740 --> 01:01:22,750
to use it you have to have some second

1164
01:00:37,450 --> 01:01:25,210
factor of authentication if I've

1165
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:26,950
understood you could you could you block

1166
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:30,370
people from being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to read your tag</font>

1167
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:34,299
by broadcasting another tag is that what

1168
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:36,250
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying yes on on on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> low</font>

1171
01:01:39,310 --> 01:01:45,810
in the field it's not going to work the

see a grown man<font color="#E5E5E5"> sacrifice his colon</font>

1182
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:17,600
I think here's a task that we would all

like to contribute to and I know some of

01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,030
have to think about them but in any good

1188
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:27,440
cause there will always be some

1189
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:29,960
collateral damage so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

1190
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:32,390
risk that we should take so everyone

please reach in your pocket<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>
