1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:07,810
hello

2
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,879
my name's Maryland I'm with the internet
for nine and easy 310

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,179
and currently working in Los Angeles at
a startup

4
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,198
where I implemented this technique for
the first time

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,810
um call or boris that's the

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:26,580
name in the scripts that I produced
which will be available

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,740
see as after the conference I

8
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:36,739
essentially I'm going to operate in

9
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:44,220
the network is slow

10
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:01,210
okay I'll that's a drink for me

11
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,658
a

12
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:29,659
sorry it's on my laptop either go

13
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,890
share

14
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,259
II if you can hit that you can probably
get the talk

15
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:43,549
they're here I now the networks
cooperating

16
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:46,979
so what is our bars it's basically using

17
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,679
CFS FreeBSD and all bunch a very scripts

18
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:57,680
bus a written in Python to manage the
system

19
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,410
and you may have remembered from talk
opening

20
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:07,820
I mention I'm basically a setting up a
cloud system what I mean by that

21
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,459
is I wanted something do basically a
deployed a

22
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,940
many systems for special purposes so
that I could have little tears stuffs

23
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,680
easy to manage pretty much like ec2 iraq
spacer

24
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,620
any other cloud provider that you're
familiar with only I wanted to do it

25
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,410
myself

26
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:32,410
on my own hardware and for free but of
course nothing is free

27
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,120
so for my system you will need FreeBSD

28
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,040
I started working with previous the
seven that's the first real estate have

29
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,569
the FS built into it

30
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:49,238
I in a while CFS version 3 or greater

31
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:53,909
most things now care about version 5
there's like a virgin sex file system I

32
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:54,390
think

33
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,760
about come out come out on the pipe so
those are constantly moving

34
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,260
but a you know

35
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,709
these guys they have today or you could
try it yourself

36
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:13,709
on another system which will talk about
later world at

37
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,659
her to click

38
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,820
yeah

39
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,690
yes

40
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,760
okay

41
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,108
cell if you wanna wear with CFS says

42
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:34,510
it's basically signs file system that
they invented

43
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:40,090
and licensed its a binary tree file
system with copy on write some antics

44
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:46,200
which basically makes it very perform at
under pretty much all circumstances and

45
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,349
also adds

46
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:51,569
a whole buncha other side well have the
%ah circumstance he loses

47
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:54,619
you live memory and a lot of space

48
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:58,269
is going to be constantly moving stuff
around however

49
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:01,650
sign you know has live in chairs and
stuff

50
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,989
so there's a lot of time money producing
quite a lot souls

51
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:08,379
say make CFS really really nice system

52
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:11,540
essentially with CFS

53
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,849
you get the ability for individual file
systems to

54
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:20,649
take that specific cool up devices being
set up marrying on the

55
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:26,549
was as you can see being set up extra
devices for caching action devices for

56
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,120
right logging all those kinda things
change trees performance

57
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,669
and reliability I with CFS you can do
snapshots

58
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:39,270
Paul partitions and most importantly for
this system

59
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,859
with CFS you can send and receive the
snapshots between systems

60
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,770
oh and then also on the

61
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,460
side note freight train ass which is a
FreeBSD based

62
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,739
home now system that as many as if as

63
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:00,240
for some time so what are jails

64
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,030
jails are a core feature free VST
sometimes known as like a super chérie

65
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:11,138
essentially what they do as they use the
same colonel

66
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:15,389
with some extra protections in between
for process

67
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:19,639
blocking and stuff but she is the same
devices all the same

68
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,889
everything just like on the real system
it's kind of some way to open VZ

69
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:27,870
if you know that system so you get quite
a lot of performance

70
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,030
for these little virtualized systems
that you create

71
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:35,258
and ostensibly there also sick air

72
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:38,340
enough so that people can break into the
house system

73
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,989
I for my purposes

74
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:48,990
the main benefit is that they're
lightweight

75
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,689
if you are a lunettes or Oracle fan

76
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:59,740
his son is now dad you could be looking
at Lenox containers this is a reverse

77
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,430
reset feature the likes colonel it's
pretty much similar

78
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,509
to jails on so there's there's what they
call zones

79
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:12,050
also CFS has found its way it selects

80
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,080
its ZFS online access obviously

81
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,159
I and basically a

82
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:22,498
on latex maze gmake

83
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:26,949
my system is BST make so my system will
not be portable so the next

84
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:30,960
but you could go ahead and have a shot
yourself also of note

85
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,049
the butter FS exists that's

86
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,169
Linus is attempt to make a ZFS like
system

87
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:40,169
however he

88
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:44,020
doesn't quite have the whole tooling at
so you might want to look at the FS

89
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:51,020
on the next

90
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:59,600
as I take a short break well it like
this and to ask a simple question

91
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,530
whereas virus seriously

92
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:11,530
where is he

93
00:07:11,609 --> 00:07:15,799
doesn't matter

94
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,160
I

95
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,970
so currently with the system you need to
set up

96
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:25,280
a first environment which airs following
their original requirements you need a

97
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:25,969
server

98
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:30,710
this probably several running FreeBSD
they need to have CFS on them

99
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,380
I my systems run ZFS on the rear

100
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:40,020
so every file system on the system is
the FS many mice traps

101
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,270
door for scraps from there

102
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,530
you can simply to him to build world's
and install it

103
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,760
into a jail which as

104
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,770
in and previous day they live in a
specific file system

105
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,570
I don't know if you remember from the
original

106
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:05,570
slide basically

107
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,930
what characterizes jail are these
virtual systems

108
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,060
is a mount point on a filesystem

109
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,820
and hostname another anything about
jails

110
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:23,050
and why I named it or bars as recently
in jails got support for

111
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,970
embed jails are then jails so

112
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,530
you know ultimately could keep chasing
its tail forever and ever

113
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:35,098
and you know have a cloud system within
a cloud system

114
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,490
wide want to do that I don't know

115
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:46,490
it's good it

116
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,579
a

117
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:56,459
as touchpad is not forgiving when you
don't know how to use it

118
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:03,459
another drink for me for

119
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,110
at so as I said

120
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:11,639
you got share previous the host system
you build yourself a template

121
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:15,910
thats can take you quite a while you're
building whole world

122
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:19,010
which and if you're not familiar FreeBSD
thats

123
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,279
every part of the entire system
everything and I spent everything and

124
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:22,779
then

125
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:26,130
everything says being dealt finally

126
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,839
much everything fell you going to that
jail system you set up

127
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,769
all the basic kinda stuff a for example

128
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:37,149
and my setups angel is set up a build
server

129
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:40,500
so they don't have to build packages all
the time course you can use the public

130
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,370
servers or someone else's

131
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,810
no problem or just build bill packages
that will

132
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:49,089
however you like after you have your
base

133
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:53,399
template setup you make yourself a
snapshot this simply

134
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,500
as store ZFS snapshot on the ice machine

135
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,110
and from there you can begin cloning
that template

136
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,540
to create jails on your system

137
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,630
a it automatically added all the files
and stuff for you so that they get set

138
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,010
up

139
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:13,649
though it's not perfect so you know it
of course are encouraged to

140
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:18,319
check on your config files before you
Gary loading things that might break

141
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:18,760
stuff

142
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,199
um ultimately

143
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:27,370
after that you know you should be
getting going again

144
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,399
have however many systems you want I've
been able to support

145
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:35,050
anywhere from 10 to

146
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:39,660
10 systems that are using you know a
fair amount resources on one machine

147
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,839
aside from IO desk as always

148
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,480
you know the manometer to on some things
that are just simple services

149
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,680
I've been able stuff like a hundred at
these jails on their

150
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:56,939
has again light weight is where it's at
finally

151
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,940
as we provide a command to migrate your
jails

152
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,029
from system to system once again this
just implement some

153
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:07,630
as the FS command and at circa big files
for you

154
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:13,209
I am why and that the main reasons I
started the stark

155
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:16,449
though its cuz I wanna get some

156
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:19,810
and put back from the community see
whereas names are

157
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,890
because you're not you meet your needs
by Matt be

158
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:27,140
my needs and you know if we need to work
together to make a better system

159
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,579
that we can all have my stuff one

160
00:11:31,579 --> 00:11:35,349
thing you should be aware that you're
not familiar with visit with

161
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,410
jails and such in the previous deal and

162
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,819
I certain things need to be configured
separately

163
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:45,819
for example bind as special
configuration settings that need to be

164
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:47,630
sad if it's raining inside the jail

165
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:51,079
always have things you know they're in
the man pages

166
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:54,260
so be sure to check them out at

167
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,430
ZFS on I've 386 systems

168
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:02,130
is poorly poorly configured it basically
just doesn't give enough

169
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,540
access to ram because the FS is RAM
hungry

170
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:11,130
so I should probably also mentioned the
requirements such economy lot around

171
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,500
this isn't gonna work on a

172
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:21,500
on an old 512 might lead system

173
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:31,610
UK and check out this stock at this URL

174
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,720
when it is available short after the

175
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,040
after the conference you can email me
you can

176
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,400
visit us on IRC for you can get the code
for the scripts

177
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,209
I'm get have a also after the conference
on

178
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:49,770
of I get have

179
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,930
so that

180
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:57,810
is the overview talk unfortunately I was
not able to get my

181
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,160
demo together but

182
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,810
and trainee much just

183
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,640
the output I have those make commands
which I will reduce play

184
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:14,010
because all I would want to demonstrate

185
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:21,010
is how easy it is to manage

186
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,999
so and a live demo

187
00:13:26,999 --> 00:13:30,930
I wouldn't have built world we would
have been here all day I would've made a

188
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:31,660
snapshot

189
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,939
that takes seconds I

190
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,209
when it made a clown that usually takes
seconds

191
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:41,910
and I wanna dance a migration between

192
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,969
summer my remote machines but I

193
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,040
really didn't trust the security of this
conference either so

194
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,699
yeah I think I did get there I am I
would like to open for its any questions

195
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:57,740
anyone has a good one friends and get a
geek

196
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:04,740
have a FreeBSD shirt for you

197
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:09,989
and I guess

198
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,790
mall

199
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,800
yes exactly and my my production setup

200
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,300
I have six systems I have one main house
where all the templates lie

201
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,689
and and I just saw they had deployed
from

202
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,209
that system to any of the others and
then I can also

203
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:31,399
send templates back to the main system

204
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:35,399
if they need to be modified and such
like that so it's

205
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,410
like I said this is our it's basically
very much like

206
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,410
easy to other cloud services that just
another with

207
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:45,719
but its cobbled together from make files
in Python scripts and FreeBSD

208
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:52,630
and I think that man when's the share

209
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:59,630
him

210
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,650
so that's beer says they're any other

211
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:10,569
thing I wasn't clear on his for

212
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:14,750
lighted that's all CFS

213
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,670
thank honestly it for me the cool thing
about this

214
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,880
as its Jess really small

215
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,950
sample connections between these

216
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,510
huge tools that other people developed
and just

217
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:35,510
never thought to put together these what
this way I at over the network and I

218
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,780
don't like him you can also do I heard
you can also do it within the same

219
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,310
machine

220
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,199
a yeah I

221
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,600
exactly

222
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,980
exactly like I said anywhere from liked
and say

223
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,260
not not generally but I've done up to a
hundred and stress testing and

224
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,240
enough I guess that's one kernel so it's
not like

225
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,100
it's not like you're doing is an system
where you're going to end up with

226
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,220
all these emulated devices and all these
emulated colonels assists

227
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:15,220
just one

228
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:22,730
alright well I guess I am

229
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,380
a little early

230
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,160
yeah should probably talk slower

231
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,270
drank more thank you guys and

232
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:40,270
spirits

233
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,860
0 and finance that contact info I'll
leave it up

234
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,889
while you're leaving
