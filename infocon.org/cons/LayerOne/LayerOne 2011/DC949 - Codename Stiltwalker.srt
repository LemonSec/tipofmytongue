66
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,978
read

67
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:22,089
yeah alright alright we'll have to do
that

68
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:25,400
and I we spent you know eight hours so
its Macondo

69
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,380
working that didn't work out so well but
we're making progress

70
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,650
just nine with their CB

71
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,880
had a a different motivating

72
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,150
I recently left Maryland and Virginia
I'm kinda bored

73
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,940
and we what what can I fucked up

74
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,180
that's not boring a recap just let's it
will be planted a seed my mind we

75
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,949
actually won

76
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,110
so resolutely somewhere in my mind recap
was floating around

77
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,630
alright recap is only got funding fuck
up talk it up

78
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,870
cert for digging into it minds want
things in

79
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,620
I hate about him cuz this is the guys
like to work with and they do really

80
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,160
good work

81
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,090
and I found out that they were still
also still working on it so we join

82
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,130
forces in

83
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:11,060
could instill Walker was born officially
you're working on it doing

84
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,340
lexicon how many words are in

85
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,830
audio recaption 58 in different groups
won't

86
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,320
was was in reaction 58 colors numbers
vehicles all kinds of things

87
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,699
and I'm but it is you

88
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,560
be upwards any response words that ok
after work 50 is not a big word

89
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,940
there's there's I think because over
there is a milestone in

90
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,210
in each other now there six words total
that it says you

91
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,810
and you to respond 506 correctly and
then you can

92
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:48,169
win that capture so yen one reason is
for humans to sometimes were dominant

93
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:49,109
can figure things out

94
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:54,360
so you may have seen the tree was
wasting your shoes last night I had

95
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,500
somebody is

96
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,889
I words written on them and i was just
because we're Orton won some church do

97
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:01,720
security guys

98
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,690
but do these are strange one of work we
don't know what these are

99
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,930
and I'm sure there's a reason for them
but they don't match anything else

100
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,990
and they were talking maybe one out of
five thousand captures

101
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:19,990
arm reticular things gonna play the
first one

102
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,080
were company %um

103
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,550
green using

104
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,259
so a christmas comes early magic thing
in the world aliens one word it is

105
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:35,729
because we know there's only six words
that come out of the system

106
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,190
and even with a Christmas there was all
there were seven words if you chop up

107
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,930
the Christmas so we assume that acres
one word

108
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,880
it does not actually rally on a
christmas or Christmas to rate we don't

109
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,039
know what it is

110
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,780
so going to sing really there's some
other weird things that we don't

111
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,198
and I'm will it work poland

112
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:57,490
doing homework line

113
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,770
line so no you ever listen to you

114
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:05,020
recaptured young closely there's the
four runways which is the word that you

115
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,349
want

116
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:08,880
you don't get known as the background
noise they can have better creation to

117
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,159
use Dropbox from being able to you

118
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,289
figure out where the word is on did take
a listen to this instance you going to

119
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:17,960
go with this is

120
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,138
him

121
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:24,740
more Gary money

122
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,000
can so it will be quiet with this but
getting one to go the background noise

123
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,400
was

124
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,530
well-meaning do you mean for that

125
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:40,059
up yeah we played again when I'm them

126
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,240
here

127
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,860
more Gary humanity mom

128
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:50,430
Cup anyone it in fact that we're speech

129
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:53,780
yeah nailed it so really interesting

130
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,948
so what now now we were reverse the
whole audio and knows the Packers beat

131
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:00,900
again

132
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,758
hearing held

133
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,569
he you might have heard aces something
about struggling to stay open

134
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:12,710
we actually a lot of time with singles
backers I was going to go where they

135
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,120
came from

136
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,319
turns out there radio broadcasts that
Google a

137
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:21,009
chopped up unused three times as three
distinct difference and will be played

138
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:22,580
in the background for the noise

139
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:26,090
I initially heard that would holy shit
you're using Google Voice

140
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,549
phone calls as background don't asshole

141
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,089
a up turns out

142
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:36,089
not so much but that would agree the
radio broadcast

143
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:40,180
interesting doing as im

144
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:43,620
so the first thing you do when breaking
any have to really is

145
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,850
split it into pieces trying to it all
together

146
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,920
pretty hard and there's fifty words

147
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,339
sick yet going up by right so you're not
gonna guess that

148
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,810
so you split we can anyone guess looking
at that age

149
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,369
where the six words all our

150
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,890
mom so that spectrogram its

151
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,540
the on the xx's time and y-axis

152
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,920
is frequency you do our best for your
chance for a form to split it up by

153
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,490
frequency over time and time and the
colors the

154
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,160
able to the brighter it is the latter is

155
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,310
so you look at that the background only
goes up to about 3.4

156
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:28,339
killers whereas the word go up to about
five

157
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:32,750
so if you just look you can kinda pick
up the words pretty easily

158
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,830
that's kind of a long to which part

159
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:39,810
this thing okay so

160
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:44,380
Rizzo are for splitting there are
solving technique was to say okay

161
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,939
let's look at those images well everyone
this chair

162
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,110
looks the same everyone that scissors
looks the same so let's get something

163
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:52,870
that

164
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,089
Watson images as whether the same so

165
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:59,870
a Google for and found yeah

166
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,970
and found P hash PS

167
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,019
is a library that tells you how similar
images are

168
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:10,450
and so well just split up the words

169
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:13,880
saw a bunch of samples then find ones
that are similar

170
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,570
you look through all the words that book
that are scissors

171
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:21,839
does that the target one look like a if
it does you found the Ritz is urs

172
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,360
so on the right there there's four
examples three-member the same word and

173
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,320
one of them is

174
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,360
not can anyone guess which one not

175
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,640
yeah ditsy

176
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:39,130
yeah so Abyan Dr share in C is the word
scissors

177
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,820
and then I just we downloaded and Saul

178
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,240
44,000 samples known

179
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,130
50,000 site fifty thousand samples by
hand

180
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,269
we then a double there by the entire set

181
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:56,320
so we listened with a hundred thousand
words essentially

182
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,380
and then we got the spectrograms have
all this bottom-up

183
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,899
and so now you download a cash up you
split it up

184
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,839
you take each word and you use P has to
compare this

185
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,070
spectrogram slice with your samples and
then again and again and again

186
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:17,010
I love it enough times need to be fine
the 50 closest ones

187
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,019
and five closest ones are the work

188
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:23,279
Sol search for the Bibles one share at a
distance

189
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,490
well searchers out the distance love the
lows distance

190
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,779
is the word so that's what I was over as
we didn't do as well as the next

191
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:35,870
on doing

192
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,470
sarajevo movs to and it was working at
193

193
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,660
present overall II model %uh blah blah
blah blah

194
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,339
and United group oversaw have been
drinking

195
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,930
no comment Mike same I am

196
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,099
so he and his men and I

197
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,100
had a machine learning class certain
standards free online classifieds

198
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,630
magazine

199
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,389
abkhazian and I was like no one we just
didn't play

200
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,649
all that on you did through tonight
we're

201
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:12,050
and doesn't get the answer me are going
to be late rent

202
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,219
sOooo thats one day

203
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,399
trying to do and I'm

204
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,730
so machining is as a great learning
which basically means

205
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:27,160
machine can't figure it out myself in
East numbers in there do you

206
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:30,800
get started and that's what this is all
it was all about we had it all

207
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,910
lives in catches to you

208
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,350
train the computers are new white

209
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:41,450
want and black an orange and

210
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,550
great night verbal giving me know that
one but

211
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,260
wondering where you really don't know
when they sound like what they look like

212
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,600
statistically speaking

213
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,329
from does know your noses standpoint so
it didn't know that the word is red

214
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:56,579
but it knows that it was like this then
I

215
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:00,149
do you disaster which did not press

216
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:03,839
sewing machine then I remembered is
included in the regression

217
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,750
so and explained everything we might
read

218
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,220
their I'm I'm is going with the resin is

219
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,490
a is actually pretty tough to explain
machine learning

220
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,540
I N you know 20 minutes

221
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:23,899
%uh but he uses me rendre as many majors
manner so anyone who have you natalie

222
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:28,480
knows what those words mean there's no
time to explain how long

223
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,829
no networks were still I'm not 100 right
but damn

224
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:36,180
yeah Dame

225
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:41,130
so no new networks work

226
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,250
I okay they're doing graphic we have CNN

227
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,510
amongst in the middle and seven right so
don't let

228
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,730
is the actual are you

229
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,329
file and very limited numbers basically
so we have

230
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:59,300
how much audio is between 0 and 2.6
niners

231
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,079
how much are you doing here 169 hers and
by the way to create

232
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:07,000
and no one's a born everything coveted
late how much higher than that

233
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,300
mid-range which pays like from know when

234
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,729
stereos kinda its same name but it isn't
a whole lot more banks

235
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,329
so it means that we have heard 2048

236
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:22,329
bands in our no example

237
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:26,399
I goes through miscalculations income
that doesn't know is

238
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,660
on spinnin and then it doesn't know it
using the same process to get you

239
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:36,350
the outward so the other news in the
radar red blue all over every target

240
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:39,440
words that were the more there's going
to be a long so it'd be a

241
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,050
openers in the rain $20 million in
hebron

242
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,389
and them so

243
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:50,790
okay if you think about the word red
when they're saying it there's going to

244
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,149
be a certain amount of days

245
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:55,220
a certain amount a mid-range and some
guys

246
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,300
and I have broken up into you more a
different come here nine

247
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,269
come so this is what we read but look
like

248
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:08,260
now so much baby been arranged by
tonight

249
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,089
the word blue is gonna have a different
singer its you're different than it is

250
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:12,529
there

251
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:15,760
and you come up when not much bass

252
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,290
good morning little rain on the
mid-range and not so much

253
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,519
on the eyes green is the reason you're
on a gathered

254
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,370
get licence somewhere that we don't know
now than when

255
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:30,980
cutie gets that what were you think that
is it was 103

256
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,410
red blue or green

257
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:38,110
green you're wrong okay red yes

258
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,970
and the baby touted closes to the Red

259
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,480
in every different iteration so okay you
know

260
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,829
on hiatus very high and it wave are
waiting for him so thats

261
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:53,388
a big penalty towards green and we do
there

262
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:57,490
without even thinking about is your
measuring the distance so the air raid

263
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:01,680
between what we have and every single
different

264
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,029
a thing that we know about so what
you're gonna come up with is

265
00:16:06,029 --> 00:16:09,720
okay well is pretty similar to read it's
not 100 percent

266
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,149
generated but his pretty clothes closet
and your dream

267
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:17,829
so and those three our best guess is red

268
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:21,469
and have a certain certainty that as
well

269
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:26,949
during

270
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:30,160
alright so the problem is

271
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,290
it every red sounded absolutely
identical

272
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:37,849
and there's no background noise then
this work perfectly only one sample

273
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,730
doesn't matter does not match and we're
done

274
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:45,769
with back runaways like there might be a
different database because you have

275
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:49,070
some backwards word that has amazing I
am

276
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:53,130
mid-range as well so who

277
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,759
their own over bisbee present for you
what does read them back

278
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,149
and you have a whole bunch of different
Reds news is one example

279
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:04,619
what Yahoo different directions for each
share

280
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,649
he sent his resume its own and be like
red

281
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:11,850
red red so there ought to be slightly
different

282
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:15,539
and RN every human is the No

283
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:19,569
that so how do you draw a line through
that to say okay this is mine

284
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:23,668
represent weren't ready is it might be a
little bit different than that based on

285
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:24,339
the

286
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:27,750
background audio maybe would envision
election but

287
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:31,030
dozen basically it and as long as you're
close to the line

288
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:35,809
then we do you close to the word red so
we just say okay just draw a best fit

289
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:36,460
line here

290
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,559
and that I'm you know through

291
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:43,678
all the point now because any two points
actually but it is true

292
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,679
and be really close so is one way to say
ok it is that we read

293
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:52,200
but what if you made it slightly curved
bed

294
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,289
ok a little bit better then miss
probably more accurate

295
00:17:56,289 --> 00:18:01,710
we've made all the more curved with me
to relieve your VDI

296
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:06,340
now busy every point perfectly so your
every b0 RN

297
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:10,090
turns out that only matches that
particular and biking to work with that

298
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,490
particular background noise

299
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:16,690
which is not terribly useful so this
line probably is not as accurate as the

300
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,990
previous line

301
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,049
it matches am a letter but when
generalized you

302
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:28,570
other samples as well so

303
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:32,710
is trade of rain you know you don't want
to be to you down about it and Adam

304
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,230
some street minded you know is pretty 40
everything

305
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:41,330
but don't overdo it and have it matches
one sample really well but not match

306
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,490
only thing that actually are red

307
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,770
so yes mind and middle ground

308
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:50,440
turns out missionary do that boris which

309
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,770
I'm ok with that buzzword for may rent

310
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,510
so that the units are these no nudes are
hidden there

311
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:01,190
and each one represents a different
lines though one might be

312
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,480
really is really one might be less
really and

313
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,500
all had a very variations

314
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,160
and the reason they're different is
because we do randomly initialized

315
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,679
and then as we train we ate closer to
you what it should be

316
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,900
and more retrain more they're going to
converge and will be here last train too

317
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,000
much for too little

318
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,490
just like Goldilocks not do not recall

319
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:30,510
and Adam we may be used as brothers get
from

320
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:34,610
the employer's I'll sound do you are
hidden nodes

321
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:38,039
entering the same process on the dinners
the route we're

322
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:42,070
so will have a number %uh are certainly
more

323
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,189
we r 0 percent certain as word spread

324
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:50,080
an marine resented blue

325
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,668
n97 presented as cattle

326
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:57,010
okay well then the worst probably had
also reaches cattle

327
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,299
and move on an expert

328
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,760
doing that %uh soldiers

329
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,620
turns out in the machine learning
doesn't get raped overtime

330
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,539
but we have certainly we can do better
than just

331
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:14,730
ones that who

332
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,850
rather than having won so overwhelmingly
reasonably fast

333
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,299
why not use more than one solar so we
have

334
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:25,400
a neural network with 15:36 who knows

335
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,020
and another neural network with 2048 and
another one is trying to conserve sample

336
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,330
his training train on

337
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:38,570
500 iterations running to the train then
won a strain on 5,000 iterations that

338
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,658
took a week and a half to train

339
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:45,590
and so when yeah on a quad core

340
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,030
3.3 gigahertz processor so

341
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:52,200
it was a long training set that drew us

342
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,620
drove us nuts trying to waiting

343
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,789
just see how well it did but so our
current best

344
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:03,059
so over has a best solving chain

345
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:06,360
has thirteen different solvers with the

346
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,168
one he had schism you know there's only
one variation twelve different neural

347
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:11,549
networks in front of it

348
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:15,539
that solve it get a certainty value and
then we just picked the high certainly

349
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:16,370
value

350
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:23,370
and so we just

351
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:32,860
them

352
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:38,250
yeah so that question was all is 58
words the standard recapture

353
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,840
well when we go to recapture there are
there's only

354
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,699
58 where's week yeah and we figure that
out by

355
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,970
doing for 50,000 words

356
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,350
manually and so besides those one-off

357
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:56,909
one out of five thousand there's only
fifty eight years was only 50 we're

358
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:57,480
sorry

359
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,730
yet but Google a here

360
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:07,730
so no cursing on know there's 3
background checks that are used for each

361
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,760
sample

362
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,510
there there

363
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:18,430
there's tons of them but they only pick
3 resentment plain black

364
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:25,430
again

365
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,800
okay so we saw them in several we did
you 50,000 to begin with

366
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,620
we saw a min set so the first set was
6,000 and I think that we like

367
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,070
I don't maybe five hours %uh words are

368
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:47,280
now and then another 52 double their
high and other than when you're

369
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,510
listening to you

370
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:53,490
bone boat boat boat boat boat boat boat
boat

371
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:57,280
cattle know anything 7

372
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,680
it I it will drive you bonkers

373
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,500
you have to take a break now again

374
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,570
good double wall oven hijacked USA Inc
in high-tech he was a

375
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:12,919
seriously you ever wanted to listen for

376
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,960
one word for several hours the time give
us a call

377
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,380
is like we my workers in the future
needs more validators it maddening

378
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:26,150
sitting in yeah his ability as you do
you up to 10

379
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:31,680
join date: Peter I we can take this good

380
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,280
so 10 the samples would have been in
August unicycle was it was really hot

381
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,090
boat is it horrible sample

382
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,909
because unlike any of the other words
boat is very special

383
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:45,330
forget boat

384
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:50,270
10 the inflections has a significantly
higher amplitude

385
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:54,129
than the rest of the versions about so
you see no headphones

386
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:57,570
about manly validating et cetera boats
you're hearing

387
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:02,189
boat boat boat boat boat boat boat boat
boat

388
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:07,450
to your superpowers hope you got you
don't play your drums out what I don't

389
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,980
immediately trying to make sure

390
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,480
you 100 percent accuracy in Manly value
examples because

391
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,870
you want your own network of used to be
valid that what we're doing

392
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:20,090
so we he's right you take a break maybe
once an hour

393
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,230
any comeback six hours later to another
hour because it

394
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:30,230
absolutely maddening I'm

395
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,470
I'll up 31

396
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:43,490
no doubt at that as the sitting at the
TC yep

397
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:47,350
yep I am

398
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:52,360
freedom

399
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,280
his I don't know if I'm

400
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,840
we're trying to make sure our side in
order in we're drinkin n you know

401
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,110
scioto questions it was have a good time
you really good was in fact

402
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:07,169
or the person the question was you have
the background noise you

403
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:10,330
yes you might not be the background
rivers audio

404
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:15,120
and the other foreign audio with viewers
why not try stripping out back

405
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,570
great idea we tried that like all right
sleep one person is hillary was was

406
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:23,310
let's get every single sample the
background noise and you have builders

407
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:26,330
pull it out you want to get it done back
and

408
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,429
desert know it but that great great

409
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,500
even more then big reviewers

410
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,200
the background what does repeat that in
multiple samples I members all of them

411
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,470
and listen to them in a row

412
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:42,000
listening for reviews in the u.p so you
can place in different places only be

413
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,860
noticed who resembled the world's

414
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,189
talking about %uh build cute over
struggling to keep it open

415
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,840
you might hear that several times their
exams the tough part is though there's

416
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,250
three simultaneous

417
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,440
instances all that noise at the same
time

418
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,480
gonna and I'm not I'm not gonna do
anything like I'm

419
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,090
was surprising was dating a girl nothing
I guess my question to the N

420
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:08,020
you know review just chillin

421
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,720
wasn't oh yeah soldiers out requestion

422
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,370
really hurting great personal liberty to
do several

423
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:18,510
somewhere let you know what let's just
try to ignore you

424
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,220
in not worried about it as a unit and
that we miss you

425
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,110
turns out it was really well him so
unintended

426
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:31,260
the unintended and his and engine back
on topic than three times ever back to

427
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,920
me where

428
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:36,570
so yeah use of background that's always
the first one doesn't get

429
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:40,100
a hyena certainty for you so yeah

430
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,750
moving on doing I back to me

431
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,790
so really interesting link we were a lot
agree

432
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:50,720
interesting tech about the known hours
this is really fun

433
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,240
kinda linguistics them so if the words

434
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,910
prisons blue for the bus how would I
spell the word blue

435
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:02,050
guzzles always valued boue Plew

436
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:07,610
yellow Bolu not generally accepted
spelling the word blue

437
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:11,610
it was you on facebook but her

438
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:15,149
more French on

439
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:18,480
but they own the how how could they even

440
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,480
distinguished like what is the proper
spelling for the word blue with so many

441
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,500
different ways to spell

442
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:28,160
and we found that it doesn't seem to be
spelling issues with an attic space

443
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,560
so very succumbing sundays are good
evening was familiar with that um

444
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,810
is long is it pronounces the phonetics

445
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:38,840
in your response has the phonetics it is
80

446
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,389
that validated answer you catch a result
%uh

447
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:48,190
is that %um armory you know

448
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:51,370
wrong way third I N

449
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:55,080
and Marty I'm dirty

450
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,320
so even beyond it having how different
reasons but words

451
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,000
we think that sometimes balance just a
reminder that you can spell spirit

452
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,300
spooky Halloween and its ability to
capture

453
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:12,129
dude what the hell's going on as a very
interesting way to do things

454
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:15,230
solely by it was removing the O's SPN

455
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,540
value again and I found authoritatively

456
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:22,570
three days ago sorry we have to be there
are scaling

457
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:25,909
will be so effect or they would be a pal

458
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:30,700
ability Thursday because the one very
another age thing which is unacceptably

459
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,950
you can kinda strange word being coming
to respond correctly

460
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:39,650
but really incorrectly as well examples

461
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:43,240
what i'm talking about. you can actually

462
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,290
board words that are merges

463
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:50,470
a balanced samples and Holyrood use the
key space

464
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:53,540
media so that was in the right there

465
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:57,879
three different words that all million
to one response

466
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,130
Sumer bucking bull areas with that so
bridges

467
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:06,620
on 44 is the words were said is very
commonly mistaken by any missing over

468
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,429
them it's really are

469
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:10,740
go toward looking at work and bored

470
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:16,650
matches bother them to look at the book
well I think twice before he doesn't

471
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,820
work

472
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,810
its yeah also another 10 million seven
very hard over

473
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:27,409
n solvent as well the spoon spoon or
getting suggesting territory

474
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:31,590
well spoon I was messin but he s

475
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:34,810
as in tsunami also meant to spin

476
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:38,429
but it also matches is booted which is
because he's good

477
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:42,840
so this company is is almost like is
king textually trying to you

478
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,919
force the word to be right for us

479
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,910
the gap and in getting was good body

480
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:54,120
we go Minister yes I still the briefers
in the reagan

481
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,949
fantastic that the top 11 bandwagon this
is actually a

482
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:02,080
second version of that merge the first
murders another really great herbert

483
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,689
the eulogy for between bandwagon the
spelling

484
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:09,630
it was now it's thirty taking the T was
born the spelling for the two for

485
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,800
merging bandwagon

486
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:16,000
was be a G n silent G

487
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,330
with the NCO then we also have banking

488
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:22,919
esprit de Ingles lacked a massive by the
way

489
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:26,440
we were used his pace by about over the
next month well we're

490
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,060
we modify slides today here reformers

491
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:34,639
them is it

492
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,900
yeah it's not on them card

493
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,900
reversing so that workers before on

494
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,050
initially we hand pallet all the mergers
like

495
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,669
foreign for good well since I can try
that would restructure were down church

496
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,430
word up in

497
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:53,180
really fun to find that trick to
reducing the space fantastic

498
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:56,970
we only have like 60 emerges we want
more

499
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:01,240
as more mergers means lowers the space
in higher accuracy

500
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,610
so we build a fully automated workforce
emerged binder

501
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,780
n it spit out dozens ovum in just

502
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,940
the 24 hours really surprise it worked

503
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:17,000
effect it was a lot to find the three
for mergers very interesting

504
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,550
um it will download a sample picked you
were that random

505
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:24,110
Levenstein justice them como with a

506
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:27,590
new string that is a small distance
between

507
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,860
the parent strains is are bitterly
submitted

508
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,169
and if it comes back correct from Google
like all call that worked

509
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:38,880
excellence a vid so it's only by the six
words we were you

510
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,210
word verification like this you actually
just don't respond on the six word

511
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:46,970
you like other words were both blue

512
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:50,320
table Carol his bracket

513
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,720
and we just don't give trained dog
training

514
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,100
and then we get one of those five it a
comeback right we have emerged from the

515
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,330
wrong we don't emerge

516
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:02,820
really fuckin fantastic stuff

517
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,990
so in fantastic alright so

518
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:09,690
now at this point we have so many
emerges that word

519
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:13,390
came about from the Brewers merge finder

520
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,850
that we have multiple merges for
multiple words is in the air balloon

521
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:17,459
Mike

522
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,210
we have blue and black war which is
better to use when you have a blue your

523
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:21,730
top

524
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:25,770
radio respond your honor is what I'm
eighty percent sure it's blue

525
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:29,879
whether I'm fucking 20 percent we want
to make sure we have this solemn

526
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,170
sorry buddy contextual merging be some
certainty

527
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:38,820
to the neural networks is back its top
three i'm gay soldiers this one features

528
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:39,419
this

529
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:44,540
and your pleasure that I can percent is
my head

530
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:48,500
so I

531
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,750
110 percent certainty um

532
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:55,580
but it takes to stop hot words that the
neural network change things that is

533
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:59,600
and says do we have emerge for these
words in our database

534
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,740
we do cool use that so even if indeed it
wasn't sure we get along

535
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,480
is right common second-guess begin to
write this writer has blurred

536
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,610
yes get a ride so even wrong

537
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:15,199
right in one again right

538
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,270
mister day Darren

539
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:21,430
Adam

540
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:24,910
so who we want is the lesson

541
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:28,060
I came from research on

542
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:31,480
are you need catches dans in general

543
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,760
Justin at indy it was not

544
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,000
I was going on in the morning leaders in
the old time which

545
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,130
I didn't see them upbringing runs my

546
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:46,050
will that's interesting at this point

547
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:49,629
and many more up yeah okay so

548
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:53,720
I am we know that the route you

549
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,490
different because there's no love you
have a system and

550
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:01,790
before what you heard today annually
anyways

551
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,940
and he said he and everything's total it
was in

552
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:09,040
numbers the room through nine and added

553
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,080
so you randomly yes the

554
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,830
answer you hear a 100,000 times dozen

555
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:20,040
ramen diseases and the

556
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,639
other people attacked the university's
there's not a win against

557
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,409
home you are used in the present and the
words only Werder Bremen vs

558
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:32,418
you have one 38

559
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:36,719
billion that is different than 100,000

560
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,600
for you are getting that I am

561
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,000
yes we did is apples and oranges grapes
but no one

562
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,918
we met anyone who had attacked the news
and we only know you will have been all

563
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:50,279
season

564
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,550
up until today I

565
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:58,010
telling hah the old building wasn't
nobody had nosebleed

566
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:01,420
still include your name boden Catalan

567
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:05,950
and rocket doing you will be ridden that
is

568
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:09,500
down as no more

569
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,560
will be there okay so

570
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,109
how to desired University there

571
00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:20,460
%uh standard driving and you don't win
and

572
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:24,350
they try to listen i characters will be
has been steadily

573
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:28,330
they got 11 by being present the

574
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:31,680
or so credited down

575
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,450
but they're dating the yen the board
that

576
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,839
if you live in $1,200 rise %um

577
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,290
prized and no okay

578
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:45,740
reasonable I'm I disagree

579
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:51,129
through 1988 present and he ended the
old resume so

580
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:54,690
you know Taylor installed but

581
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:58,470
um look so

582
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:02,950
this is the point in a tourist boat
today although the underlying demand it

583
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:03,529
was running

584
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:06,820
and see what the a

585
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:10,030
de Villiers he was

586
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:14,060
to burn down I the teamsters did so

587
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,549
and how we bring you then yeah but in
the video above

588
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,440
are our system running even asked

589
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:27,230
Michael down you never remembered by the
demigods you don't know what has

590
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,340
happened early prenatal video

591
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:33,190
who learn you don't make the same
mistake

592
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:37,320
do you live demo and have a video back
here at

593
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,050
so here's selenium which is a great
interviews were runners-up

594
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:46,070
actually the Stillwater iraq you use
correct the donor base to blow your

595
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:46,570
budget

596
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:49,590
as you see is moving slower but it is
big and they were correct correct

597
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,830
correct

598
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:54,060
and this is taking too long seems ok
that's pretty awesome

599
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:57,180
excellent was legal oh yeah experts let
him just awesome

600
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,740
slams awesome when it works so basically

601
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:04,250
it pulled up Google demo page for

602
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:08,570
recapture and then you gotta hit the low
but this is giving all you 1

603
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:11,770
that'd downloaded solves it

604
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:15,680
explains it's all said then posit that
put it back in

605
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,580
visited by Aunt and that you get to see
whether occurred in a

606
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:24,529
and so important tax second yeah is a
bargain for buyers must have a Crohn's

607
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,500
pretty awesome

608
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,800
and a no yes they do not a

609
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,230
yeah please westall analytics

610
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:35,890
anyway up and moving slower than just
doing that

611
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:41,790
the right now but now we're part is
about .5 seconds to download and then

612
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,060
later cement

613
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,990
and our solar doesn't between .3 in 15
seconds

614
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:51,950
so by comparison to listen to it is it
used to be 80 seconds long

615
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:55,589
so if you're human doing it you can do
it 116

616
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:59,700
the speed that we could as a computer

617
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,850
the network speed is actually the
biggest I am

618
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:08,380
bottleneck in solving this the neural
network is do be fucking bastard as all

619
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,280
BS

620
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,000
well I guess as well and by the way
that's ragazzi yeah last

621
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,160
okay we're really broke its

622
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:25,200
are he's land managers will that up but
yet so 9921 present as ok last night

623
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,600
and we will discuss ways to use the
funding we him

624
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,710
we didn't he 19 percentage for a little
bit

625
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:35,620
and as you sort making the system more
accurate 8 becomes

626
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,770
really order only insane RAM

627
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:42,890
to gather that last little bit
percentages and has been treated poorly

628
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:46,690
there's no way we get more than they did
you resent ninety-four percent

629
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:50,240
ninety-seven percent radiators and shit
I'm

630
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,399
stocks they were here doing i think im
going up im if we did ninety-nine

631
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,340
percent of my

632
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:59,120
while Johnny Walker Blue Label laundry
go on stage you know everything

633
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,160
do on

634
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:08,120
because it buckingham so we actually
started with israeli sessions because it

635
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,910
takes it is a good amount of time that
really don't worry

636
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:15,009
and after he's been a good and manually
deleting all the samples

637
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:18,090
government so weird party last night in
the

638
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:22,190
on the karaoke room into a bus home
we're going to have a good time

639
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:26,180
like alright cool the neural networks
trading you know what's going on

640
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:30,029
blown up in we should

641
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:34,080
you guys we had broken percent is that
is what I hear from Jebel

642
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:40,490
has been tested so this guy ME two days
ago CAA invalid a whole new methodology

643
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:42,220
for creating a lot worse

644
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:46,569
for other the sample to go into it just
to try and get less than a percent so

645
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:47,060
the

646
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:50,290
last did you ever the last minute the
11th inning

647
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:54,529
we kneel ninety-nine percent that's why
we're going longer little

648
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:59,240
you by the way we tell you everything

649
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,020
Olympic a quick moment wait a little
that whole Gloucester

650
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:06,220
a medical doctor after right fucking now
kudos

651
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:10,640
well done well played up know every
other you think you'll agree but

652
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,660
well plated cell

653
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,810
at Def Con in bugsy together in

654
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:22,940
will have shots and is not over

655
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:26,650
gave on the game is important

656
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:30,760
where's my people limited a

657
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,340
building don't want them people your own
you later on

658
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:38,859
oh you doing anyway going back to thread
up

659
00:40:38,859 --> 00:40:42,200
so finish thing that happens when you're
trying to break

660
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,330
recapture art if you get below 60
percent in

661
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:50,640
on

662
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,220
Cup up anyway %uh

663
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,230
thereafter on chairs again people
monetarily

664
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:00,490
yeah only two people did

665
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:03,810
here I so

666
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:07,259
it gets below 60 percent then you can
rate limited

667
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:12,810
you get to know you am no do you get
vandalized at home yeah I

668
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:19,810
you're drunk 3s anyway I haven't
reported this as

669
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:25,460
ago you able

670
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:28,530
this option people

671
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:33,740
so when you're doing ok ashes apparently
they the officials are hard

672
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:37,770
so if you get below 60 percent the audio
the major the image

673
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:42,090
normal movie image you can get a couple
other law annually have to get one is

674
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,340
right

675
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:47,590
lives if you get below six and then get
headband

676
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:51,920
then you have to get the image exactly
racks with both words

677
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,970
and so that was the problem and so below
60 percent it's off because we have them

678
00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:00,580
star testing in then switch had he is
and then start testing

679
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:04,580
then switch I've used and you have
continually that is in order to get your

680
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,700
actors

681
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:09,589
that we are about 60 percent they must
think we're human cuz

682
00:42:09,589 --> 00:42:13,750
not really matters anymore when you
getting these work University

683
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:19,130
yeah like universities was six different
when you go over sixty percent there

684
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:23,710
Pharma just give you as many as you ask
for so them

685
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:27,359
you must be human you're solving and
bask in that case the audio to play

686
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:30,960
a

687
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,010
return text group

688
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,420
we are as human being thing

689
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:41,460
oh this is Bill my favorite board so

690
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:45,130
I'm once when we were doing this we
thought mmm

691
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:48,660
they wouldn't possibly give us the same
sample more than once

692
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:52,480
me sexy what they give us the exact same
sample more than once

693
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,950
it's just on a very large scale they
have between 20 and 25 million hasher's

694
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,830
so over long enough scale you get to my
guess

695
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:05,259
so you just need download and solve a
lot of them

696
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:08,720
like $50 million so download install

697
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,480
$50 million yeah thousands homeless or
service could do between when we figure

698
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,190
that out and now

699
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:18,780
mean you against his ass in a nascent oh
so you

700
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:22,580
their exponentially harder so as we got
a $50 million it gets harder and harder

701
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,500
to get unique

702
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:28,500
samples so when we first started off in
samples we get a unique but every time

703
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,980
but fifty million

704
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:33,660
you only get a unique one 39 percent of
the time so

705
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:37,230
if you just use that look up table %uh
25 so we have

706
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:40,870
you get 61 percent accuracy because you
just looking at

707
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:43,960
looking up I'll is the md5 their yet

708
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,500
cement and then you go systems actually

709
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:50,800
and rather than taking .5 seconds like a
neural network one

710
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,660
it takes point zero zero five seconds

711
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:58,529
so yes and it's always right because
we've already

712
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:02,920
submitted it once before it was right
then binders that right

713
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:09,920
I

714
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:17,620
so if you're gonna have a capture system
you should not give out the same

715
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:21,230
cash in a more than once not as though
the points

716
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:24,609
I it's a one thing

717
00:44:24,609 --> 00:44:26,860
wanted I

718
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:30,890
so the one thing we don't know is
whether the pre generated or

719
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:34,330
they've its gonna fly we don't know
one-time

720
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:37,690
they generated all twenty to twenty-five
million captures

721
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:41,150
or they only have fifty words may only
have

722
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:44,940
so many background noises so they just
generated but there's only so many

723
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,800
combinations so there's only so many
captures

724
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,840
and so we're not sure on that my guess
is they

725
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:54,390
they don't they don't live because
nobody would be that stupid

726
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:58,319
regenerate it but then again nobody
would do yeah

727
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,940
nobody would also you know not include
frequencies

728
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:06,590
I'll the words in the background noise
but they did that so who knows

729
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:10,560
but anyway don't you oh man

730
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,950
so this is the fuck you cool are the
presentation that

731
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:18,890
che I added like an hour ago when we
were sitting around

732
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:22,529
trying in but this is how the
spectrogram looks

733
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:27,660
prior to two hours ago you can easily
pick up to six words

734
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:31,670
is a pretty easy you can see them

735
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:38,050
this is how it is as the two hours ago

736
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:40,510
yeah so I

737
00:45:40,510 --> 00:45:44,140
we hear this a version of this talk

738
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:47,190
slim version was talk and outer zones so

739
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:50,900
mmm yeah but

740
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,230
in East slightly harder to split we'll
see how it goes

741
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:58,349
when we get time and we feel like
training a lot more sex

742
00:45:58,349 --> 00:46:03,470
on

743
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:06,569
so if you can see the wearer's

744
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:10,079
year cleared here year here

745
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,180
this can yeah game

746
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:16,609
yeah there is no

747
00:46:16,609 --> 00:46:22,029
10 words not 6 we don't know how many
have to get right

748
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:26,369
I I've tried as a human to try and solve

749
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:30,900
somebody's I got about 103 right

750
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,470
it done it before and during

751
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:39,109
there and sober and with a an accomplice

752
00:46:39,109 --> 00:46:42,750
he a

753
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:45,780
bill before it was Edward

754
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:50,380
every 4-6 word now at 10 before a second
down 28 seconds

755
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:56,369
and human went from I would estimate you
must be at least 70 percent with the old

756
00:46:56,369 --> 00:46:57,190
system

757
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:00,810
eighty percent thereabouts now wherever

758
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:05,400
now the new system would actual humans
who had studied recapture the last four

759
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,010
months

760
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:09,560
are getting 30 percent basically

761
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,839
Road there's their own product like

762
00:47:12,839 --> 00:47:15,930
yeah and when one other thing is is

763
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:20,328
this might in his acquittal saying is I
don't know for sure when I was your

764
00:47:20,329 --> 00:47:23,680
but they might have just implemented ish
a burglary capita

765
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:28,160
talk with us in our talk I and then what
meanwhile they're scrambling to try and

766
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:28,710
fix it

767
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:32,670
could be could not be I don't know we
don't know we're looking forward to you

768
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:37,220
the next round of disc is really good
yes and that's all that really is a

769
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,790
about that but recent Vegas

770
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:41,980
seriously you

771
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,170
so I'm just gonna play the old version
versus the New Berlin

772
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:49,730
your listener from he

773
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:55,140
more Karen

774
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,270
so that was the old one

775
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:01,829
and let's see if you can tell the
difference between the new one

776
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:07,609
him

777
00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:12,020
long

778
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:18,430
them and it goes on for 28 seconds worth
but I'm going to make listen to the

779
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:19,160
whole thing

780
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,660
yeah and so so

781
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:27,118
the to have them tried to do it light
legitimately as humans who have

782
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,770
you know study this last four months

783
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:33,950
yeah I just finished right now but this
road is

784
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:38,960
do it as it having just done catches all
you catch is less for months

785
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,270
and they got two out of five yr 2006

786
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:47,180
and so I'd like to see what normal
people have been studied it lasts for

787
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:47,919
months could do

788
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,310
but as

789
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:54,420
essentially if you're blind they're not
gonna us I'm

790
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:58,160
ascent his question was so it's
essentially useless

791
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,480
yeah he said

792
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,390
is essentially useless and the answer is
yes next question

793
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:11,960
him maybe rate is that your computer

794
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:16,040
as possible I'm is that correct when I
take

795
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,529
depicted in red with my fingers but at
maybe nm

796
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:25,710
next yes we've had this

797
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:29,480
from a my home his home

798
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,680
this local places to order a

799
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,868
at for GE shit I

800
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:39,319
Mike all that and everyone getting the
same version

801
00:49:39,319 --> 00:49:46,319
so this is and has a

802
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:51,109
I am yeah well will be

803
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:54,130
look good we spent about two hours ago

804
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:58,180
we are working on it we're on the case

805
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:04,950
yes you and the bearded

806
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:08,049
I wanna hear questions there

807
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:15,050
leave peco raised

808
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:26,759
all week or a

809
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,619
hitting the question what do you wanna
wait a week

810
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:35,130
integrated maybe maybe we do maybe don't
I don't know

811
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:38,490
we'll see I'm not I'm not going pay

812
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:43,220
I'm not gonna give them the event to
tell him whether or not we're working on

813
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:43,520
it

814
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:50,520
so yeah

815
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:09,590
them

816
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,170
bed

817
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:23,170
okay I'm in a good thing previous
question here

818
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:34,270
grasso the question was when we did
placed it on

819
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:37,560
fanatic are so for ordered it

820
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,759
or good worker

821
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,940
so yet as good as dead I'm

822
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:47,710
at day and I think that

823
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:53,300
so the question was I when we base our

824
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:58,010
on every Benedict sanctions that whole
word

825
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:01,790
working on I

826
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:06,990
up that's a good idea it turns out were
not so good at that

827
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:10,089
you know audio processing with
scheduling

828
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:14,930
tries that opens the works and turns out
more ninety-nine percent

829
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:20,859
working as far as I'm concerned but we
doubt that we're done experts anything

830
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:24,430
he just learn your own hours I have no
knowledge at all %uh

831
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:30,430
are you anything and this guy is like
honey badger is not give a fuck

832
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:34,399
ok I'm we just like

833
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,100
was fucking up into what happens in the
99 percent later

834
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:42,480
here we are I'll

835
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:49,030
more to say in

836
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:52,450
okay so again going back to Canada Goose
entertainment

837
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:57,419
I'll there's no worries now there's
Island and in October

838
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:03,020
when those were the words prior to an
hour ago butterflies word as well

839
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:06,530
but well

840
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:09,560
they they didn't hour or two hours
before

841
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:12,850
the talks so kinda makes me think that

842
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:17,549
hey we should change it is mess with
them the upcoming

843
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:22,100
anyway oh yeah the background noises
they used to be

844
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:25,450
public radio backwards run through it

845
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:29,540
now under actual english words just at a
lower volume

846
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,700
so while it's playing they say the word

847
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,589
pink forward and you can hear that but
you type it is wrong

848
00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:40,520
so that long yes also

849
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,910
the actual words are longer and

850
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:47,240
are on a slow town where the background
words

851
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:50,629
are high a high tone is a real quick so
the sickening

852
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:53,740
verses when is in the I

853
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:57,470
the actual word is he Inc and so

854
00:53:57,470 --> 00:54:01,339
that might be one way we do some that is

855
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:04,470
I'll oh and if you didn't notice from
last night

856
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:08,709
girls at the same frequency background
were there now as the actual words

857
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:11,810
so they release all this and said

858
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:16,190
we probably shouldn't do that here

859
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:20,090
a good idea a good values talk we're
gonna be doing anyway

860
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:23,370
or something or

861
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:27,330
her mouth right now one or the other but
because the words are much slower Lee

862
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:31,860
fork yesterday it's a lot more data

863
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,510
admiral network in more data typically
means more accurate

864
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:41,240
just sayin good

865
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:48,240
I all right go ahead I had well you get
ahead of ourselves

866
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:57,170
back to

867
00:54:57,170 --> 00:55:00,890
ice on the other hand is one out during
a yeah

868
00:55:00,890 --> 00:55:07,890
Armada when him and then you open smile
big numbers or is this

869
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:15,440
alright we'll talk later

870
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:24,600
wanna any issue socks

871
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:38,510
oh so here's here's why we're the cool
thing about that it we have repaired

872
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:41,730
but was I mean don't think you realize
early on as a little

873
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:44,790
if you're trying to create a audio
capture

874
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:49,960
where there's a human voice speaking how
would you develop a system to throw up

875
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:50,770
automated

876
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:54,750
you know I'll phonetics detection it
like we talk in a speech to text and

877
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:55,220
other things

878
00:55:55,220 --> 00:56:00,149
how to do that the background audio is
still human voices so it throws off

879
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:04,290
whatever is trying to analyze it and
after the guest mix we didn't actually

880
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:05,170
fuck it right

881
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:08,880
but that doesn't make sense to be
rightly that make sense

882
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,750
kind again yeah yet but we did we did we
did

883
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:17,380
to the Google Voice is the shit
Ektachrome I gathered that the question

884
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:21,660
was that we try to go into a legitimate
again injuries but yesterday I tried it

885
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:25,910
who they gotta go to %uh to %uh speech
to text

886
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:30,259
plugin system for chrome and the person
you like plug it into that what does

887
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,780
that work the answer is hell no

888
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:36,400
and it and the next thing the former
words aware that we

889
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,420
we worked on 'em it seem to use the

890
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:43,680
exact same a speech to text resort XP
system

891
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,580
as Google Translate City Walk it was
really impacting the same words and pop

892
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,040
now

893
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,140
the way for was remarkably similar to
what you were getting outta

894
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:54,160
kept the recap system so we know when
the other

895
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,279
general reno reasonable amount of doubt
that they're using their own texts P

896
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,690
systems a general audio

897
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:03,440
so we tried these the beginning like
going past soldiers on same words but

898
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,670
ultimately we just ignore all the
background is

899
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:09,180
trained on the garbage in nine members
and later

900
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:12,319
%um

901
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,990
cyl if you think about all the things
that we use to beat the system

902
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:20,830
it was splitting was a key part of it
which as he's always spectrogram

903
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:24,910
is there much more difficult now I

904
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:28,790
yeah nets that that's not so easy as
doing

905
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:32,460
other way and heating good

906
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:36,990
now not now registering area not quite
as easy as that

907
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:40,640
so they've made it a lot more difficult
for us it was a little more difficult

908
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,089
for humans and no

909
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:46,020
people will accept that people like
Twitter and Hotmail

910
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:52,540
I am I'm just saying

911
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:55,550
CNN form

912
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:59,240
4chan at moving on

913
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,439
as it did now to go back

914
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:06,740
Justin

915
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:09,750
it's the most unorganized but this never
but bucket

916
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:14,160
I one thing that actually covers will we
didn't come before us how we could

917
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,100
accomplish the basic splitting for the
entire column

918
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:21,540
so we go through we start at 270 pixels
and

919
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:25,570
after you remove the border which is
right above where the background noises

920
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:30,310
as an is pointing I know

921
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:35,029
twice that should Adam pointed to it and
we start there

922
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:38,850
and we keep going until we get to a
non-black pixel then

923
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:42,009
you keep going to get to a black pixel
and that's the call

924
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:45,790
but it turns out you include a lot extra
stuff and sometimes

925
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:48,880
when the words are closer than this this
is the ideal case

926
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,670
%uh spectrogram a lot of times two
columns are right next to each other

927
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:56,950
as you don't know that one word or two
and so you'll have to go through n

928
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:01,730
I'll start I start from the top and the
code goes down

929
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:04,860
and it trying to find the point where

930
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:09,200
there's a non-black pixel and so in

931
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,500
yes anyway

932
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:16,260
it starts at the very top once it got
the words that are on trend

933
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:19,680
and then it goes downward it sees how
far down and get

934
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:24,040
forget a non-black pixel if it gets
below a certain threshold

935
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:27,870
then we know we should trim that and
forget about that we know that part of

936
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:28,430
the word

937
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:34,350
so be deterred anyway

938
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:38,360
that is held is putting out with them
didn't work but I mean obviously

939
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:44,360
that's not going to work now the atom

940
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:49,660
anyone anyway continuing on from the
slightly been on for like 15 minutes

941
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:52,879
0 yeah code release yet

942
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,560
back getting back to this question
everything has been released

943
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:00,670
the md5 list which was an md5 sixty-one
percent of the captors

944
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:04,030
that's pretty much pointless now so they
change the mall

945
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:07,050
before it was like the greatest thing
ever because you need the right

946
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:10,100
your you needed nothing to get 61
percent right

947
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:13,799
because we read it all but now it
doesn't even matter

948
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:18,520
the data values we have our best one in
there is everyone we tried

949
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:22,259
101 to

950
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:25,360
oh yeah data values are what the neural
network needs

951
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:29,750
in order to I am take a sample in this I
word is

952
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:33,070
we have all those but once again they're
pointless because they were trained on

953
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:35,250
the all set upwards and so

954
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:40,000
defeated new one is not give you an
answer we have all our code which is

955
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,360
its done so that we could add new
solvers in New splitters

956
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,990
so that you can add additional
functionality such as

957
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:51,049
when they changed in a week more today

958
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:54,310
we thought it was gonna be a week but
they changed it like today so

959
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:58,450
will add a new splitter and a new solar
to it and it'll

960
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:01,839
continue going and so that's a

961
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:05,530
I we set up for you want to read
repository and there's also a source

962
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:06,480
tarball

963
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,690
if you go to that address which is just
DC nine tonight at work such projects

964
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:12,160
still Walker

965
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:16,319
I'm interview didn't find any way to get
to the old

966
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:20,680
that system let us know we will be very
happy

967
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:25,190
and we will share with everybody

968
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:29,430
people the that few people we shares
were there are those easy

969
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:32,919
words you're selling various pop

970
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:37,570
words you is being moody reach you get
his new

971
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:40,990
Lee booking psyllid

972
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:44,299
because that's not fucking funny his
game with the

973
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:47,930
Cooper because we're not sell out of
mana a

974
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:51,240
not this game with the developers is
good keep going

975
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:54,569
and is just the next up it's been fun

976
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:59,030
got a lot more fun 'em

977
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:05,570
estar I'm excited good

978
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:09,320
we're going to be gone till when good
have

979
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:12,640
to answer whoever said they want the
corpus for

980
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,660
it's like to get your 2 gigabytes

981
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:20,529
yeah but you its to you by its and

982
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:23,680
Worley said open up later

983
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,940
up think

984
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:33,940
on

985
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:39,319
so all you have a great question before
now's the time to use both dad

986
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:43,030
their

987
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:47,260
you in a green and with a beard yes have
you got in contact with many linguists

988
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:50,650
because it seems to me that you could
use a linguist in this sort of thing

989
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:54,670
I had the person was have reluctantly
linguist and the answer is

990
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:58,600
no UK I we yes I agree

991
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:02,290
d are you willing was know but I know
them alright well look it up

992
01:03:02,290 --> 01:03:07,500
will do done expected

993
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:14,500
user okay

994
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:22,410
I so the question was we're going to the
super bad

995
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:26,499
by point by second for capped at when

996
01:03:26,499 --> 01:03:30,240
it takes 82nd way to capture and the
question was

997
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,839
do you think that this is why day you
know found you out

998
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:38,730
them so we had about ninety percent last
light

999
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:41,819
three to four months yet another
senators

1000
01:03:41,819 --> 01:03:46,529
last three to four months and so you
think they change it prior to that

1001
01:03:46,529 --> 01:03:48,819
because we gave a preview talk it out
his own

1002
01:03:48,819 --> 01:03:52,109
and so they did not being

1003
01:03:52,109 --> 01:03:55,480
so I don't think that

1004
01:03:55,480 --> 01:04:01,200
are tiny amount of traffic compares to
you are semi timing amount of traffic

1005
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,288
compares to you everybody who uses
recapture

1006
01:04:04,289 --> 01:04:07,349
I'll yes and

1007
01:04:07,349 --> 01:04:10,990
we do I'll my one server did tell

1008
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:15,200
32 302 about 500,000 today

1009
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,269
and plus Seaview survey twisted

1010
01:04:18,269 --> 01:04:21,348
at least 500,000 a day people own site

1011
01:04:21,349 --> 01:04:25,410
that the eight hundred thousand a day
and I had another sir that about 200,000

1012
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:27,879
my laptop did a hundred thousand

1013
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:32,089
his servant at 400,000 so or approach to
$8.2 million a day

1014
01:04:32,089 --> 01:04:36,220
but that's nothing compared to you all
the forms that use it

1015
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:41,629
all tweets whether use it but mated

1016
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:46,589
he so the next person that tests or
accuracy

1017
01:04:46,589 --> 01:04:51,328
may just be on wanna recaptured clients
that use it

1018
01:04:51,329 --> 01:04:55,859
yes because then they won't be able to
tell she's

1019
01:04:55,859 --> 01:04:59,089
work you're trying to be nice but well
PocketNow

1020
01:04:59,089 --> 01:05:02,140
I was real or not here

1021
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:06,299
but we did notice one strange little
only thing that happened while we were

1022
01:05:06,299 --> 01:05:07,779
testing very early on

1023
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:11,980
it just both servers were or Christine

1024
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:15,730
you know accuracy in my servers were
harvesting accusing

1025
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:21,329
go to something strange is in know we're
like will increase drastically for both

1026
01:05:21,329 --> 01:05:21,960
of us

1027
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:28,019
but only one %uh visited that'd be fine
we realize that

1028
01:05:28,019 --> 01:05:32,549
it was possible that we may have been
accidentally did I love servicing the

1029
01:05:32,549 --> 01:05:33,420
demo page

1030
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:36,460
I good weeks to us

1031
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:39,910
up us was that didn't meet you years ago

1032
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:44,038
Street in Vegas but then that went away

1033
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:48,640
so maybe they don't really the harbour
group but what's going on or they

1034
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,828
you know just put the VM's which inmate
faster

1035
01:05:51,829 --> 01:05:55,079
I don't know my mind is

1036
01:05:55,079 --> 01:05:58,380
deviate caught because we were very
aggressive in

1037
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:01,789
maybe although

1038
01:06:01,789 --> 01:06:05,859
they did change your system like two
hours before out of here

1039
01:06:05,859 --> 01:06:11,109
so maybe now I my next question

1040
01:06:11,109 --> 01:06:18,109
money 1

1041
01:06:20,339 --> 01:06:25,160
up the question was if we were just
downloading the challenge

1042
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:30,029
challenges will real time solemn so you
go to the demo hedge thats one get

1043
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:30,710
request

1044
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:35,589
and they give you back the challenge I T
and the link to the audio

1045
01:06:35,589 --> 01:06:38,819
then you get the audio link you pull it
down so that's

1046
01:06:38,819 --> 01:06:42,490
an audio download let's not forget
request then use all that

1047
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:46,089
anti-semitic so that's another give us
all all in all it takes three get your

1048
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:46,808
class

1049
01:06:46,809 --> 01:06:53,809
to summit eight catches you gonna write
me

1050
01:06:57,499 --> 01:07:01,939
yeah 0 so

1051
01:07:01,940 --> 01:07:05,180
so the question was it %uh submitting

1052
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:08,969
hosted for votes I am plates and the
other where the

1053
01:07:08,969 --> 01:07:12,449
matches took them off and so maybe

1054
01:07:12,449 --> 01:07:17,979
I'll we did have an option to not use
word Matt merges

1055
01:07:17,979 --> 01:07:21,509
but we can use it because we want to see
the highest accuracy we could get

1056
01:07:21,509 --> 01:07:24,599
and words might word merging helps on

1057
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:27,680
yeah up

1058
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:31,328
question the back as word merging still
work

1059
01:07:31,329 --> 01:07:36,029
new stock it

1060
01:07:36,029 --> 01:07:40,209
they just changed it the question was
that word merging still works on the new

1061
01:07:40,209 --> 01:07:40,930
system

1062
01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:44,839
so we don't know how many were there are
we found about that we found out this

1063
01:07:44,839 --> 01:07:46,739
well you're testing our demos

1064
01:07:46,739 --> 01:07:51,709
for right now yes and so it is

1065
01:07:51,709 --> 01:07:56,359
when we saw that we weren't able to get
the point mom

1066
01:07:56,359 --> 01:08:00,308
I tried getting a couple is right as a
human

1067
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:03,930
make I don't want to use their service
him

1068
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:07,969
and I have not wanted rewriting we are
dead

1069
01:08:07,969 --> 01:08:11,119
and that their helms out and were like
although this word

1070
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:14,349
already get there but you did so I'm
gonna answer that

1071
01:08:14,349 --> 01:08:19,920
we couldn't do it so chanted any changes
in very soon

1072
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:24,509
is hi I

1073
01:08:24,509 --> 01:08:31,509
yet so next person you know

1074
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,990
then got back to during hearings in and
resentment and

1075
01:08:34,990 --> 01:08:38,550
in wrong yet rated No no it doesn't

1076
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:41,990
I we did New Year

1077
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:47,920
used did change ever adjust and don't
age I'll

1078
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,550
we go to let you and it turns out he's
everywhere

1079
01:08:51,550 --> 01:08:56,029
which is very important for us and very
important bird

1080
01:08:56,029 --> 01:09:00,700
Google as that is ready to be blind
people

1081
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:05,000
not that people II don't mind people

1082
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,050
3 yep

1083
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:12,779
praise God home

1084
01:09:12,779 --> 01:09:15,849
you know I remaking Nokia Lumia

1085
01:09:15,850 --> 01:09:21,890
do thank you because cocaine blue labels
pocket a tactic

1086
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:26,930
if you've never had it a blue Johnnie
Walker

1087
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:30,530
Blue Label and coke if it tactic

1088
01:09:30,529 --> 01:09:33,670
for two reasons 88 really good

1089
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:37,359
and add it pisses some people up a

1090
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:42,060
and guy like you are you crazy people of
scaling good

1091
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:46,910
home room is bringing a physically
blocked the recent I'm not

1092
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:48,540
extraordinarily

1093
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:51,589
pissed off about the being
countermeasure did

1094
01:09:51,589 --> 01:09:56,050
he is that he is really mad I'm I'm
frustrated me excited

1095
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:59,330
but this one reason alone when that
super business because that is exactly

1096
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:01,019
what I would have done it

1097
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:04,400
if they are giving a talk to me they
fucked up in writing about it

1098
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,620
our talked about the our report and they
didn't mean

1099
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:10,660
kudos I'm excited for that

1100
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:14,230
as that man black man

1101
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:19,919
a group

1102
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:23,030
rape a

1103
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:29,300
sky to the west murder

1104
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:32,520
aren't we proud to be extra successful

1105
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:36,290
more breaking their system I am

1106
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:39,960
I am personally I I think my colleagues
are as well

1107
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:43,050
call thank you yes

1108
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:46,020
well I am a doctor you know I am is
deemed

1109
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:50,989
so him

1110
01:10:50,989 --> 01:10:57,989
humid

1111
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:02,509
branded comment does not count

1112
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:06,010
word I'm next step

1113
01:11:06,010 --> 01:11:10,060
car so we try to recapture

1114
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:17,060
on by mine is

1115
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:28,330
we're getting 99 percent they texted

1116
01:11:28,330 --> 01:11:31,880
on it ever talk which isn't a true

1117
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:35,500
and it will be the same thing I will die
if I was in their series

1118
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:39,520
I am but yeah

1119
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:43,930
so you can get are coded I you have
downloaded and

1120
01:11:43,930 --> 01:11:47,650
make it better and make it work for the
new system basically do is

1121
01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:50,790
find a way to put it and then did

1122
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:54,969
softened up manually and retrain it and
you will have broken recapture

1123
01:11:54,969 --> 01:11:58,160
idea and he added there

1124
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:02,739
I

1125
01:12:02,739 --> 01:12:06,919
dolphin

1126
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:09,930
don't believe the countermeasures that
we hadn't thought about

1127
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:14,040
when we're thinking what would you do if
your Google was

1128
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:18,390
by in

1129
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:22,260
we thought that they would just after
our talk because we didn't vision that

1130
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:23,590
they would know about Andrew

1131
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:28,180
you don't change in an hour before we
thought that they would just leave it up

1132
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:29,170
and then all the sudden

1133
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:32,620
all everybody gets our code and then
starts attacking recapture

1134
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:36,870
and so we thought they just take down
the audio version and so

1135
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:41,230
then we were we were ready to if they
took down the audio version filed an 88

1136
01:12:41,230 --> 01:12:41,959
complaint

1137
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:45,739
but they just changed instead

1138
01:12:45,739 --> 01:12:50,280
I'm so what are the only things I had
planned was Senate email TV

1139
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:53,880
Stanford people who got 1.5 percent

1140
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:58,250
and today hey you take this machine
learning class from

1141
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:01,600
this standard professor II

1142
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:06,610
unwrap going to have a hearing words and

1143
01:13:06,610 --> 01:13:10,670
win like we did ever losing it

1144
01:13:10,670 --> 01:13:14,600
email the Carnegie Mellon people because
be lead person that

1145
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,989
endeavor said 0 I V

1146
01:13:17,989 --> 01:13:21,830
rehab to on a resume she said

1147
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:24,880
she made recapture that in I

1148
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,750
is secure basically I think you're
against

1149
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:31,989
yeah I admit that I think is the I

1150
01:13:31,989 --> 01:13:37,059
like oh we we made sure they don't do
automated baggage system

1151
01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:41,000
because we'd all these different things
we'd as we look at them like

1152
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,210
head that was a really good design plan
but

1153
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:49,330
we still needed me mean don't change
anything

1154
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:54,040
and making good decisions just not good
enough and we're gonna email

1155
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:57,500
all those people in one single email
thing pay

1156
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:02,540
good machine learning class you take him
this evening but I think you win

1157
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:06,830
and I do you think you secure it but you
didn't all in one email

1158
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:10,070
and they just don't mind under

1159
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:14,200
be because google updater should and

1160
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:17,349
now I gotta break it again before it's
an email

1161
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:20,800
so and from doing them

1162
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:23,950
next question

1163
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:27,389
yeah

1164
01:14:27,390 --> 01:14:31,760
I am doing now

1165
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:38,760
on

1166
01:14:46,889 --> 01:14:53,889
the original one yep

1167
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:58,509
the question was the other question was
why didn't we just

1168
01:14:58,510 --> 01:15:01,599
shop of the bottom half only and was
outta

1169
01:15:01,599 --> 01:15:05,760
and we tried that in all fairness it
probably wouldn't work

1170
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,159
but but that I i'm just saying

1171
01:15:09,159 --> 01:15:13,098
like all also ultimately results speak
for themselves

1172
01:15:13,099 --> 01:15:16,280
in 99 percent if you break

1173
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:19,540
a capture system with one percent it's
considered broking

1174
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:22,860
if you break with 30 percent that is
their destroyed

1175
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:27,219
is fucking under heard up to break you
ninety-nine percent

1176
01:15:27,219 --> 01:15:30,290
to talk about going with this I'm can

1177
01:15:30,290 --> 01:15:33,949
drunk by Yahoo him to go go

1178
01:15:33,949 --> 01:15:37,530
someone calls me on stage ball is
overdose

1179
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:43,730
shut up so we thought about splitting
even tried splitting on

1180
01:15:43,730 --> 01:15:47,388
be 170 pixel which is the part where
just the words

1181
01:15:47,389 --> 01:15:51,429
are but that little Orange Park the very
bottom

1182
01:15:51,429 --> 01:15:54,599
is extremely important to the
spectrogram so

1183
01:15:54,599 --> 01:16:01,599
and to be hashed so we decide to keep
that yes

1184
01:16:02,449 --> 01:16:05,940
so when you're looking to try and pick
up those

1185
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:09,440
words you meet that part right there so
we tried it

1186
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:13,269
because this latter methodology was
let's try everything

1187
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:17,389
and whatever works I'll keep doing and
so we tried

1188
01:16:17,389 --> 01:16:21,099
its you know only using the top or that
picture but it didn't work

1189
01:16:21,099 --> 01:16:24,719
agrees with this way

1190
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:28,230
good we're not done trying to be

1191
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:32,070
recapture we have a lot more ideas

1192
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:35,940
in the works and that sepia far we have
a new library look at

1193
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:40,808
as a lot more work to do and

1194
01:16:40,809 --> 01:16:44,210
linguist a clever one

1195
01:16:44,210 --> 01:16:48,000
and other pate in every way

1196
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,040
we're not done we have a lot of ideas

1197
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:55,290
and lime

1198
01:16:55,290 --> 01:17:02,290
and on I feel

1199
01:17:10,679 --> 01:17:17,040
beige cardigan byproducts

1200
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:20,440
Skype

1201
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:23,509
I do have one less thing to say it's
concerning layer 1

1202
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:26,520
not not the water we love you no

1203
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:31,130
%uh this paper dined at least a good
chocolate we gave her first hot here

1204
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:35,730
layer 1 and when we realize that still
walking was gonna turn into something

1205
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:39,348
a little bit bigger than we planned like
respect around the weekend inmates and

1206
01:17:39,349 --> 01:17:40,230
haven't bought in

1207
01:17:40,230 --> 01:17:43,549
it turned out to be fucking hot sauce
epic in

1208
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:47,429
as I put my described people if you're
using a sexy

1209
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:52,030
timbers I figured where's the best place

1210
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:55,780
that we give our kids and who's gonna
talk and that places where one because

1211
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:57,769
we have a special place in our player
one

1212
01:17:57,770 --> 01:18:01,940
that's all there is to it this is it

1213
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:08,940
this is it this is where it's at well
thank you tonight

1214
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:12,070
I as soon as next speaker's get setup
will have

1215
01:18:12,070 --> 01:18:15,360
mingling with bonnet but you very fine
gentleman so stated
