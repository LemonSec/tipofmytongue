didn't even spend half the time that
doesn't it

37
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,350
pulled off a

38
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,009
assistance can sending us an estimate
these are the first two

39
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,150
that's historical

40
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,760
we're going to look at a lot of that new
york or what it will be consistent with

41
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,950
improved upon that

42
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,670
setup where they come from

43
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,449
hasn't talked about bob

44
00:01:57,449 --> 00:01:59,840
argued that when you think it will not
work

45
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,740
so when people start to meet with
concepts research work in a new platform

46
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,190
but what do you swear off

47
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,300
basically scripted has come out because
our company was acquitted in two

48

50
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,119
we'll be talking about profiting howdy
howdy actually make a point where they

51
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:19,040
make in a proper way to get a good way
for

52
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,269
everything to do it

53
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:23,439
made more than just food for thought

54
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,879
doses of modern problems

55
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,768

00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:32,529
money from it

58
00:02:32,529 --> 00:02:35,599

78
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:32,859
we can't wait to be that directly to the
state europe or australia wherever

79
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:34,879
or here in north america

80
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,899
cheerios marvels of material are
smartphones incurable we'll see the same

81
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:40,139
kind of

82
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:41,250
attack that

83
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,549
well so we see if they seem to areas

84
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:44,619
uh... dvd

85
00:03:44,619 --> 00:03:48,869
roughly the russian speaking areas and
the uh... there's the chinese

86
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:53,239
not quite exact match differences in in
these times the nearest

87
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:56,429
it's about double

88
00:03:56,429 --> 00:03:59,270
and most of the law into our seniors are

89
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,609
so what risks

90
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,589
high-definition profit as a

91
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:05,379
mobile no it's today or

92
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,268
producer without a writer

00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:10,969
a lot of people do it it will be to do
with the use of all mail you do is go to

94
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:14,309
myself he put it out there so if you put
on the website itself

95
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:15,660
now there are three things

96
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:19,630
produce a product in and send again just
like with the younger pc with your a

97
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:24,210
prime mortgage people decide to sell
custom-made rourkela doesn't mean that

98
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,739
were sitting there was a cellular custom
chart

99
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,500
besides your your your specific

100
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,300
answers

101
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,439
simply because there is a sign up for a
p memory service in our shop

102
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:37,889
you can do it in on this evening and get
money back from that basically you can

103
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:39,709
do some of the serbs honestly

104
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:43,349
pete wilson estimates that there were
ruled by a truck doesn't somebody n_b_c_

105
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:44,940
did on the three dollars now

106
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,209
download site

107
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:48,260
or after the parcel precise

108
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,589
but let's just get as far as possible

109
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:51,830
as many people as possible

110
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,349
and have the money or frozen

111
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:55,080
and sending the seas

112
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,930
sign ups and purchases to u_s_

113
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,230
basically that simple

114
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,900
for distribution

115
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,570
the high tech to make money

116
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,430
carrefour highways up the first when we
were talking about a week seem quite a

117
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,189
bit is the premium rate messages

118
00:05:09,189 --> 00:05:12,909
as the dollar was being returned to be
able to call it uh...

119
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:16,409
it is a subscription services i think i
get the latest weather reporter

120
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,979
dresser

121
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:21,180
somebody that you might have gotten it
basically was assigned to this list

122
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,640
that's that's the easiest way

123
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,149
more bands there

124
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:26,139
not thirty beastly

125
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:29,870
more best technique is on something like
a check fraud or a black as you know

126
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,749
where

127
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:33,030
you get the malware too

128
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,929
basically sent back to your website and
have a nice little website or

129
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,090
some other kind of thing in your report
sending new factory there were two

130
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,049
bookmarks or a permanent onto the
website automatically

131
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,060
or even falling off of the policy that
adds

132
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,970
and then

133
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:53,599
you now will send you to that at least
field that you could send to fix it

134
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:56,650
that far from a lot of different uh...
mobile phone se

135
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,198
a few hundred thousand

136
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,409
different i think this is different
phones

137
00:06:00,409 --> 00:06:02,289
for a heart attack

138
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:06,029

something on your website around
certainly device

149
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:35,009
to take away from that you've taken
mention the gravitational pull has about

150
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:36,039
the attack

151
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:41,219
nipping and tucking in aggregate that we
saw that or use it to the student id

152
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,780
the other witnesses a little different
pessimist fishing and injection of

153
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,809
estimates

154
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:50,699
desert blooms and have an example it
around a little pieces

155
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,529
be doing too much and that's the message
busiest affects the tone forty

156
00:06:53,529 --> 00:06:55,900
characters to put a message of something

157
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,330
dot blot you can do to get convince
someone decided it's time for the

158
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,679
benefit of the narrow sororities

159
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:03,128
became a toll on that

160
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:06,849
let's do something like injecting
existing customers and the inbox renewed

161
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:07,990
you can copy everything

162
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,180
because over the terrorist network

163
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,470
somebody will also be a few differences

164
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,219
it will just fix it

165
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:15,280
interfaces

166
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,839
if u on the other hand if you're if you
have for some way to check that

167
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:22,289
your old president rapid s_o_s_
initiative using your bank's the phone

168
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:25,989
number or your service number for for
the banker food for the if police or

169
00:07:25,989 --> 00:07:26,909
whatever

170
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:28,789
into into the indian box

171
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:31,068
given across a rice it's a tax id number

172
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:33,690
it's what's expected to know if it is
that in itself

173
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:36,879
since another waited to drive if he
doesn't know

174
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:39,659
decision or did i cut a deal with

175
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:43,079
and we got destiny accounts this is
another check making deals with with

176
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,579
your ears and eyes

177
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:48,339
and what kind of just ducking your skype
account or your actual japan is a very

178
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:50,929
popular route

179
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,279
service in town

180
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,639
them by ten cents

181
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,119
the disney at its opposition the legal
to to convert to the virtual money into

182
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:00,800
two two two points

183
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,149
yeah december that's actually without
money actual currency

184
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:08,199
but there are services overlooking the
foreign organization money

185
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:10,900
acts like a third party service you go
there is a look at some of my means

186
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,669
account

187
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:13,198
let me just

188
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,669
not that quite legal

189
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:18,688
and same thing skype me when i get the
cash out what you could do is actually

190
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:20,710
spelled out attack somebody else

191
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,659
so the concept is

192
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:25,659
you've got going for you both for a lot
of later this month on second hand

193
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:27,989
and people run your accounts

194
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:31,229
it's uh... another way to do it and i
think in russia losses would cash out

195
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:33,449
dot on this important issue karen like
it

196
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,260
uh... ten bucks a record

197
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:41,740
you could not go to another service and
cash out that prompts

198
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:47,000
and now let's look at uh... detection
and houses aviation techniques for valor

199
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,280
pretty straightforward for for towards
the west

200
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,980
recruiting them our strengths and behind

201
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,620
either accept client or some part of
fieldwork

202
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,830
stoical for smoking at our client

203
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,380
so using

204
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,230
occasion also we're seeing more pastel
action check into view application to

205
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,550
the just taking it

206
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,870
bill does occur real application of some
of the android market or some other

207
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,840
legitimate market repackaging today
because of their code into a delicious

208
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,520
sets of sexual not

209
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,560
and indeed that isn't enough

210
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,650
and two-thirds of their discussed that
the distribution point

211
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,420
so you've got nowhere you put into a new
digital map

212
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,890
distant as many as possible

213
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,430
chances in the german apt

214
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:30,329
you put that into a state out free bugsy
apt outside paris

215
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,640
here's a new album version of why i
think you are a new version of to face

216
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,060
book an official client

217
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,300
it's free

218
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,569
people going to go out and and uh... you
end up with

219
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:44,470
so that's one way to get past
civilizations

220
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,450
the more advanced once again doesn't
stop

221
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,540
and other civilizations that there is a
conviction

222
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,380
or obligation to be for some of them if
someone tell approaches

223
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,090
that one of the mighty tasty l as of
this message and that's the number two

224
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,880
the messages i sent it

225
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,870
filipino innocent has it within uh...
standard image for final some h_m_o_

226
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:04,510
homepage

227
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,110
what this format is exactly the same
kind of very holed up

228
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,990
or very common interest four four

229
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,280
it's being intensively studied tank in
itself

230
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,199
very simple

231
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,149
ding is that we can avoid

232
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:20,350
executive everybody but more so from the
delegate he had to file an item

233
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,210
basic unit basic option

234
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,940
season noticed immediately that
something is wrong

235
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,360
uh... the one on the bottom is the
sample size per word

236
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,250
consistency

237
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,950
because of this takes a

238
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:34,710
if you go to some estimates which is
conversant in winter

239
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,450
but there are also gordon smith is

240
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,170
android delivery was another another
person and by the back door and a bunch

241
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,610
of other things

242
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:47,140
it used to de s a much better out of the
lord for standard honorable

243
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,380
compared to the same

244
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,970
hiding a nation of file

245
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,110
increases traffic because it's uh...
europe where is that you get a sense

246
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,400
information back to the attacker and it
because whatever commands gets back to

247
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,000
our ticket ticketmaster gets back on the
attacker

248
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,760
octavia d_s_

249
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,530
which is much better but the senator
cipher except

250
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,939
we have the finance so we have to keep

251
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,430
nothing useful

252
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,589
just think the president of the piano

253
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:15,000
uh... another check made out mobile
number uses a hide itself or to be

254
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,650
security on your in your view on your
uh... machine

255
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,959
reform actually

256
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,389
eyes to mickey's install uh...

257
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:26,340
windows mobile there was a info jack
would fit into a similarity to install

258
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,050
your aps without any kind of props
on-site athletes all home

259
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:35,050
something more permanent current more
recently is untrue and go into a tree

260
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,420
which included to implement the peace
with the ability is a review of the jury

261
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,459
believes it with your phone if you had a
problem you wanted to get fall that's

262
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:44,910
before me three teams out there for a
large amount of racism

263
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:46,319
customize a bit

264
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,060
uses they took those two

265
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,170
but i think that in our decide what they
were going to install into various parts

266
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,060
of the system where you can get to
normally

267
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,449
saturday night as a false until you
remove listen to that

268
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,370
and that's what we're doing on on it

269
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,910
on iphone we have geography tax but we
haven't really seen those in the same

270
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,130
way as in in the wild because

271
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,170
not too many people are beginning to
catch you get your legitimate operating

272
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,459
so the question

273
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,110
on a bus stop at them

274
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,400
is that would do it because

275
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,670
piltdown

276
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,020
uh... the only thing we see in the wall
of the most recent was up

277
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:23,829
for a very good resembles a loan from
uh... mastercard in october

278
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,660
market was lazy people open up a lot of
the demo where do you know

279
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,309
use the with him on fibers of the
children they don't come out exploit

280
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:36,150
one of the warning messages in the
informative messages from the export

281
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,579
and then added some code to basically up

282
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,060
reviewed the data from

283
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,050
for this

284
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:45,240
the square scanner as first gathers at
the little luck recruiter that's that's

285
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,240
always forever to do it for you guys
wear

286
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,739
places here you had something to write
on

287
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:52,610
he cited for thread

288
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,600
probably secure until you get hit by
something like this where

289
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,890
uses exporting z-axis earphone jailbreak
sit and copies or links to both of which

290
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,689
is scanned or out

291
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,840
for standards and if it is coming up the
car

292
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,289
frenzied insisted that that was
basically

293
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:10,020
in fact in corporate website in fact

294
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,920
and in side accords you see the takes on
screen

295
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,770
natural record as everett

296
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,810
disconnects

297
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,520
let's look at some real examples of
for-profit not

298
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,350
java rupture ob

299
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,640
really progress because it's like uh...

300
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,910
they're just really simple program to
send us some aspects like people five

301
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:32,810
institute break-up in russia currently
it's so easy to get get me out

302
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:36,060
got a premium rate number person for the
service number we can get paid

303
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,689
everything from someone it takes to

304
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,399
biggest policies up like a

305
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,620
can deal same-sex so he could do

306
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,510
this what is it a little bit more
actually because at least exercise of

307
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,610
their various uh... countries

308
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,890
outcasts and ukrainian home all
different countries different numbers

309
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:51,600
and

310
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,650
means the wider for the waiter gang
behind her

311
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,420
and very envisions

312
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,079
surtax

313
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,390
uh... something more interesting is that
would be fun passing

314
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:05,720
missiles the out a busy fishing program
for met with a more popular so smitten

315
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,930
sites in russia

316
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,890
the contact

317
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,100
so it looks like a lot of the mobile
after your program you login and you

318
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,079
could you just gets an immediate effect

319
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:14,819
very nice

320

on how to make money off of that

321
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,370

tried and mostly taxes they tend to be

331
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,310
more coming out of time

332
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,250

your phones getting slower it's getting
harder to use whatever

340
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:14,660

00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:36,960
banks

350
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,840
but they don't mix one pkg

351
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,940
one way to make money

352
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,320
another older wiser

353
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,890
fight on the record eight how this was
the python script that known

354
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,360
what to do

355
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,500
it doesn't as well as any to be just
show that yes that

356
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,930
it's not just shamanic is intimately
said was let's listen in to reduce the

357
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,180
world's easing

358
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,130
up i thought was a really simple one
indeed sent out ubuntu message to a

359
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:02,460
premium increases

360
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,540
uh... something worries that this is a
very n_p_r_ once again

361
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,079
this is one of those uh...

362
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,640
other attacks where you're trying to
generate afterwards

363
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,630
added bookmarks to file for assert your
fellow i had a separate pro-german

364
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:18,240
locked automatically dixit open up the
the page of the press

365
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,760
growing browser to the page of the year

366
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,069
smartphone for

367
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,470
is basic just drive traffic towards
uh... before

368
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:27,910
which if you've added a few other

369
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,480
more shiny thing so it's like to see a
lot

370
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,190
few information or

371
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,750
any other tools you have a more

372
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,720
effective they're dangerous tool

373
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,710
this little simpler but it shows it

374
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:44,360
tearing up the pieces that is to put it
together to do something that works

375
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,620
out which is followed by something like
in spirit dot a

376
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,940
this is going to be a patch but it was
really uh...

377
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,240
it was really the injecting a semester

378
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,950
fishing drinking a fishing as a lesson
to your inbox cell one eighty seven

379
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,110
degrees

380
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,829
bird it pretends to be something that
the real thing

381
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:04,349
you know it doesn't have to do what is
going to be which is like a pretty

382
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:07,939
assistant to develop speeded up whatever
you do any of that

383
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,630
instead he put a nice little message
from staying with your facilities bank

384
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,020
unless it looks like they came from the
service of the bank successfully if

385
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,699
you're counting attacker hacker whatever
something along those lines

386
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:20,250
and if you don't run into this

387
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,530
blah blah blah site

388
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:25,760
you're gonna get a disconnected or
minimizing the login

389
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,669
funding to develop a good fishing

390
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:29,580
the attempt

391
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,510
did you buy it more because it appears
much more than two because it came from

392
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,389
your bank

393
00:17:33,389 --> 00:17:36,439
as long as there's no way to tell from
the message salt

394
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,600
but it wasn't an official estimates in
that

395
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,039
people twenty twenty six

396
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,670
not theoretical accidents

397
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,810
and that's a good uh... i would say
sections of the few more interesting

398
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,059
service has been in years

399
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:53,210
drew a quick and brittany brown was a
bunch of at the gym in az encoding

400
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,020
getting to it once did coating that you
don't like that

401
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,110
that does what you want to put the real
attitude to someone else

402
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,629
takes more personal regular out

403
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,970
uh... once again as a t s and producer

404
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,850
command control commands and to have to
treat them

405
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,879
and also shows that uh...

406
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,450
data set out to get your aggressively it
puts a euro tourette

407
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,370
sixteen year old with the uh... career
with the

408
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:20,399
information there based on your mind you
i location data things like that

409
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,700
and he said to the back of the phone

410
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,520
and had to make money with something
like this how do not make me something

411
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,680
like this exports solicited medical
service so

412
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,380
instead of uh... with the other s
listening to listen to some districts

413
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,520
whatever you're getting

414
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,970
and send it back out it's a lot like
uh...

415
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:39,470
another one of the suit alleges that
this is grammar signal to assist in the

416
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,460
mobile

417
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,269
that pat was trying to rub

418
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:45,360
basically that was just a very simple
estimates for different

419
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,030
this is that possible plus the back door
plus a few other things

420
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:52,170
has all happened since they simply

421
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:55,470
so you'll be forwarding door out your
account activation number although

422
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:59,690
detailed and invited if you thought they
were getting a restless molly moore

423
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:03,690
nonetheless and and you can ask your
contacts if you get more targets

424
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,220
not necessarily i mean it was it was
interesting

425
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,910
islamic alligator once

426
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,370
uh... scheme is really nice

427
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:14,580
what's it was usually happens executive
bounces

428
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,240
sinister

429
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,350
dot a

430
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,760
uh... so it's like to share photos that

00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:26,450
friend i simply cannot out there and
what not but that was that the uh... to

433
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,899
talk is a data collected

434
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:31,070
street one commissioner leon right now
under triangulation

435
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,189
bunch of things

436
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,240
and thanks a lot like in any

437
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,290
holding everything was instead of uh...
opt for less than a student would assist

438
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:39,940
him in

439
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,190
it did the same thing as those of the
semester and introducing underpinning of

440
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,210
russia

441
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:48,340
it was sending signing up to a number of
the service providers in which gives you

442
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,590
money coming your way

443
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,990
like the weather or what they need these
services are or don't serve as a result

444
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:55,910
services

445
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,340
and also the same time to get his
defeating the messages that you don't

446
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,659
like to see the confirmation

447
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,710
sylvia's you don't see the donation for
a free service and that okay

448
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,420
ideas over anything you want to be in a
moment

449
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,790
defending chord with you i would be
great now

450
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,080
when there are a couple of people like
this mystical

451
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,980
uh... something similar something it was
uh... juice on a sunday another one and

452
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,780
bring it with other people called he's
onto something

453
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,370
uh... this person to get calderon

454
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:27,299
periods pretty quick albert's of every
time you a little bit of the term refers

455
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,010
not that it's all right

456
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:32,580
you can only see january every time i
was beautiful babies

457
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,649
uh... but this isn't the same thing as
being the steps that we've been in the

458
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,810
in descending sign of the services

459
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:42,409
pre-release is would you make the money
in the civil war the propaganda

460
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:45,780
back to that somebody's got to me as odd

461
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,129
intranet specifically

462
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,800
certainly alone

463
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:55,000
mobile phone users if you steal you know
one luck long as the local currency one

464
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,310
along

465
00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:00,030
on the users at an early on either
that's a good good amount of money

466
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,800
me i think it's about six to one seven
two one to the u_s_ dollar but he still

467
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,830
has a good amount of money from a lot of
these so it's a

468
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,449
sealed off from a lot

469
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,320
and now this one is t sixty eight
justices named after

470
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,620
when he goes up it was basically takes
its cue cue services

471
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,679
because it was it does the same thing in
scientific in and also the reason that

472
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,920
it's very simple and that the nice thing
what it did was

473
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:29,570
also but after the local of chinese and

if they've also been sleeps indian
software using a student at me like a

00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,640
which implies sources that now

501
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,370
they have the color line around offers a
new high interest in our

502
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:46,350
and they decide to board antibodies a
and was awesome wonderful is out there

503
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,189
it does all the things that nothing
because it can to meet standards under

504
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,260
the stimulus on its own

505
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,700
uh... interest more because i know what
i get to come or upcoming then what is

506
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,110
actually going on

507
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,139
and uh...

508
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,120
delays one nine oh one more natural

509
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,500
real real lower

510
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,280
or it's more from accounts of the
natural

511
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,660
four problem but it's very interesting

512
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,850
uh... this is the s_ might've heard
about this one that was originally

513
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:15,530
called shalinder but do i think that
market fifteen sticks uncle norm

514
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:19,940
yes it is basically to ambassador for
granted permissions on your phone

515
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,970
uh... one is the sample wrap itself and
once the deliver it's a two part uh...

516
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,160
our

517
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,940
rock-solid over i think it requires this
enough to be able to

518
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:35,190
use a microphone and to three biggest
supporter control and deliver it easier

519
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:35,950
access

520
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,200
today continuing is committed to each
other on the list

521
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,810
for less rigid informations i think the
desire to be over this

522
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,730
pilot linking the references

523

new divers on koh

524
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:52,080
will be the first agreement

525
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,919
is essentially you will still be happen
and they really are going to say they're

526
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,500
so few permissions if you brought the
evite another opted to send one hotmail

527
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,500
is about four or five more permissions
harbor control a bunch more police in

528
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,490
these

529
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,460
and if you think this is a

websites that you are

552
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,320
decided how do we get a lot better

553
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,159
difficult is it called

554
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,860
but uh... in the same we did not that i
don't think we've got in the database a

555
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,659
identify what that is and how to how to
get in there

556
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:14,660
and say okay this is not where we're
user or or the customer would be calling

557
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,610
it would be dialing up and saying okay

558

i'm going to up standing sitting around
they know and his rough point out that

internet

612
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,940

something for me

614
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,220
and they're also going after other
avenues

615
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,980
competitive although they were doing on
job it's not just to produce offices

618
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,240
that they've done that way

619
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,410
and internet currently small

620
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,750

623
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,699
think that isn't paid linking money
doing already

624
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,890
they're not gonna go any further than
that restore them until they get their

existing areas

626
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:37,559
everybody from is happening to go any
further

627
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:42,210
the kind of security samples that were
present because that works

628
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,050
in a moment to try and sort of evidence
on millions of users you want to look

629
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,909
like it's formal and someone told me on

00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,429
uh... fewer bowman on

632
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:57,960
udeshi some good links to direction of
what's actually going on in mobile crime

633
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,980
most of what we see is the results not
so much for people to making money off

634
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,620
list

635
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,928
but just a lot of driven people like
this is not a billion and pom-pom

636
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:07,070
pom-pom

637
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,090
and human lives

638
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:11,080
digging into trying to get more they
were telling me that that it really is

639
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,530
dusty little from a lot

640
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,629
lot of people and that's really where
they're going they don't meet

641
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,240
they don't i don't want to get your
stuff

642
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,130
unity standing under a lot more too much
about

643
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,330
okay how are you still have for us

644
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,750
or whatever else

645
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:29,110
and i think it's more fun than what is
available for other people how do i

646
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:32,340
protect myself it was interesting that
people using d_e_s_

647
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,939
to protect their their their out

648
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,289
the sentences using crack

649
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:40,910
on on the windows of what we're seeing
douglas in the season to train on

650
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:44,610
advertising trafficker soldiers because
the truth about it at all

651
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,929
but on an ad for the shadow of the
premises almost a career bomb and i

652
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,769
think that was that uh...

653
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:53,149
position about i mean there was that at
the demonstration at wimbledon

654
00:29:53,149 --> 00:29:54,270
researcher

655
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:59,110
uh... shit ones were hard to stay strong
for our professor barnett and uh...

656
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:01,729
this is the force of presented and her
her up

657
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:02,830
colleagues up

658
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:05,580
took over about high-tech about that

659
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,590
denigration of

660
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,310
but i think they did ask you if if you
do if you're not too if you're really

661
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,050
competitive i would like to bring to the
chinese market is

662
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:16,280
you have these are the fetus first
because other people coming out

663
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,139
much like the uninstalling of the
antivirus

664
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,960
uh... that's the next step in the summer
initially instantly like

665
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,370
four years ago

666
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:27,018
getting that nobody give an actual

667
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:29,880
profit-making or doesn't know what you
wanted to let you know what was making a

668
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,990
list of actual through the content our

669
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:37,120
when something okay hey i've got all the
stuff here and i have a life

670
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,199
can lead to better as a whole eight
takeover

671
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,900
what's happening in the chinese market
right now it's actually the pbx it is a

672
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,740
large sector to a lot of people are uses

673
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,880
a lot of people involved and

674
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,720
that's right and we will see a lot more
reza

675
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,750
issues coming up in a lot more
intersection

676
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,539
it's no longer since the

677
00:30:55,539 --> 00:30:56,870
critical that we are looking up

678
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:57,949
real lower

679
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,800
along with him

680
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:06,800
school any more questions or please

681
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,950
web a lesson

682
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:14,100
truthfully obesity number once again
over security suggesting okay we've gone

683
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,969
up through what was that we'd like to
come to the its limits but it's a web of

684
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,840
recently dot com politics'

685
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,250
and their exploits like i think it was
uh... ecuador axis a very sexist

686
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,990
exploits uh...

687
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:27,289
decipher celebrities with so many

688
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:30,100
you've got an exhibit is much the same
elaborate

689
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,929
we can still attacked the about four
weeks ago a public missing anyone

690
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,400
whether she goes i think part of it is
because

691
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,159
they don't have as much of the market
musician original admitting that only

692
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:43,000
pipes are there

693
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,130
most of the woman she has been on the
larger distribution and or at least

694
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,970
benefit in that because they're pretty
much given what was given the with this

695
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:51,320
opportunity factors

696
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,460
almost everything should be it's totally
taking over a lot of things

697
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,300
housing and also lost because there are

698
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,760
symbolism of become

699
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,760
abandoned almost anything could have
known that he is moving over to the

700
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,690
largest

701
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,450
previous orders that use of standing
outside of a show was that nokia

702
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,159
and then we'll meet with his mobile

703
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,880
so you would like to see the same kind
of interests in the nokia

704
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,480
that we haven't seen any realtors in
nokia on out there

705
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,010
mandate nokia smart once in awhile
political an epidemic europe was going

706
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,430
on with my

707
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,950
sort of celebre picture back and watch
was that no one's actually looking in

708
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:31,970
those areas possibly because there's so
many ways to make money on the gymnast

709
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:36,780
fewer people looking salute the key is

710
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,920
well-spoken technip

711
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,529
to protect yourself

712
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:46,450
in one sense what do you want to be
thrown out of the home

713
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,890
seiler

714
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:52,440
andrea mazzola dennis and diane sawyer
and diane

715
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,830
that's also midnight is the reputation
and i think if it comes in the end of my

716
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,409
head

717
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:02,080
we've had very few from serbia and would
like to be standing out from our

718
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,699
livermore leaving town

719
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,960
often had to do anything

720
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,750
distributing maliciousness didn't
believe dat

721
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,000
on the and would like to has lasted
longer than i contain

722
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,960
i mean i mean

723
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,850
there to get some things out of the
books that and almost immediately

724
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:19,510
someone's is that i think the last one
was com

725
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:23,600
status online at the moment but it was
that pulls up read about uh...

726
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,939
admitted that it was actually driving
was was one of the ones i was on him but

727
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,810
market need for the whole bunch of us in
the if they are not region there was no

728
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:31,940
that's

729
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,100
uh... so she would you want to go after

730
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,260
ideal i don't have said to have good
reputations you've been around for

731
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:41,809
awhile it's like allowing someone else
to get it for you by saying okay

732
00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:43,830
that's not the first time

733
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,439
some people out there but first

734
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,269
in and see what happens

735
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:50,820
i know what you did to protect yourself
and i told him he would not say see ok

736
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,270
uh... also don't go to the three dollars
sites

737
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,750
for the update parasites actually

738
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,950
you avoid price offer opinions and
that's what we're doing it definitely

739
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:05,769
there's not a lot you can really do too

740
00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:09,409
it'll put you in danger of then going to
offhand remark

741
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:12,599
missing off our coverage in the

742
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:14,850
off resounds please

743
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:19,609
mechanical conditions that

744
00:34:19,609 --> 00:34:20,500
so

745
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,069
apples

746
00:34:22,069 --> 00:34:24,299

exasperated saluted message across it
wishes cynthia itself

749
00:34:35,728 --> 00:34:39,618
for disarmed

750
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:43,689
and also at least sometimes we go up
because there's a legal issue is still

751
00:34:43,688 --> 00:34:46,129
time we don't live in the c_e_o_ pay

752
00:34:46,129 --> 00:34:50,509
we ignore what they say what it says it
is as an operations in looks about right

753
00:34:50,509 --> 00:34:53,509
if there's a paper also downloaded when
i did

754

immunity comeback of educational thing
again

755
00:34:56,829 --> 00:35:01,669
if enough people have a different has
been a problem in that for everyone

756
00:35:01,669 --> 00:35:05,439
began in people are definitive relations
i think a few other

757
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:08,788
companies looking at all since you'll be
howard because she's not cancelled a

758
00:35:08,789 --> 00:35:11,380
dangerous would have to worry about

759
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,759
which is this a better way of doing

760
00:35:13,759 --> 00:35:17,719
acceptable former you have to yourself
too little

761
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:21,519
little too much to work for for most
people because there's so many words

762
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:25,238
turning an entity with all the time and
i think i start

763
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:27,539
mopping it is a revision to do

764
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:31,459
but then again if i catch something i
that's my job to look at

765
00:35:31,459 --> 00:35:34,808
suddenly personal

766
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:36,759
when written for everyone

767
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:43,759
uh... similarly more questions
