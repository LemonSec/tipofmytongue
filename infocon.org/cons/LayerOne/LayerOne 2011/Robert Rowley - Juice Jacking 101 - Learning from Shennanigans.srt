1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:03,300
right

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,080
I have a wireless network available hi
everybody I'm

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,250
welcome to their one post lunch this
talk will be much easier Xing

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,969
basic concepts and the up but the term
is due jacking

5
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:18,680
I my name is robert Raleigh my twitter
handles I am they

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:23,180
UN harassment winner do whatever you
want and I'll go and get right into it

7
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:23,769
is

8
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:27,570
well as you jacking I did anybody here
then we heard that term before

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,890
heidi was a yell out what it is come on

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,160
right you can use them way

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,459
some breeding attorneys night a
malicious charge cell phone charging

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,010
station

13
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,010
really to me it was one great drunk
Tiffany

14
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,809
the Epiphany I and some friends
Riverside

15
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:51,589
who is a local here is gonna be a leader
but he's not here right now

16
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,530
unfortunately

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,370
up we're all out drinking in easy at a
party and they said wait a second

18
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,449
why would anybody trust their cell phone
to charge into me as his laptop or

19
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:06,310
let alone for tomorrow's never available
can turn it off

20
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:10,030
no but it may seem like why would
somebody trust this

21
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:14,290
what's going on and why don't we make
one in the cell phone charging stations

22
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,780
do some nasty as shit

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,259
so it Liz the party was on July 4th

24
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:24,909
the plane was that for are the following
August which is just about a month away

25
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:28,030
during Daft Punk he would build a
malicious charging kiosk

26
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,189
and he would put it out at DEFCON in the
most malicious environment we could find

27
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:33,949
was paranoid individual will be fine

28
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,479
and all through the building he was a
you know the push to try to make a

29
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,630
secure system that was gonna get hacked
self

30
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,720
and then be able to put out in buy me
something nasty its gonna teach people

31
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,600
not for his liking their phones to rent
stuff

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,579
log into that so the bill the simple
that no

33
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:53,899
our plans to be taking the easy when the
small laptops other be much cheaper in

34
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:58,189
you know whatever up it's ticking a box
and we'd have a lot CST him sticking out

35
00:01:58,189 --> 00:01:59,889
and people just plug into it

36
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,710
this operon it would run the next a live
CD

37
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:08,008
this is resume so that in case you're
the system got popped

38
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:11,319
we can just read it every set you back
original state I

39
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:16,170
run running the USB utils package and
some custom cellco that I wrote that BC

40
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:16,929
monitors were

41
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,379
what's going on what's happening and

42
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:25,069
as you can see in Miami next light here
identify that I am a hacker does that is

43
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:25,549
me

44
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,160
with a hacksaw any easy hacking into

45
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,280
I that was the first my first act saying
so

46
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,550
parties that anybody in a box and this
is the newly with the original use

47
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,440
decker look like

48
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,310
this is the EPC and I mentioned that is
hacked into and Spike

49
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,010
folded over so it had a strange facing
outward in the back is the idea

50
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,230
I am a girl a cd-rom drive to run
everything off oven easy power right

51
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:49,738
there

52
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,040
somewhere in there is a USB hub much
cable sticking at the bottom

53
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,650
William getting from this talk are from
this a

54
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,890
experience was was interesting but Mia

55
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,129
proposed ball was this box that base me
you know the blue box

56
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:07,659
it's called the fleet artists has more
on the inside and expect

57
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:12,470
and the Red red warning here that a blue
one he says basing this logo

58
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,780
a freeze on changing he asked and the
red warning here which

59
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,959
a change shortly but a basis as it would
detect when you plugged into it with

60
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:22,310
significant minutes which opened his
rents being seen here in

61
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,920
Etienne why would you do this pay but

62
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,319
during the building was interesting he
has been using it to play to Def Con

63
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,839
all places and I'm who hears not
familiar with that done

64
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,450
has been that way gay 7 this individual
right here this is not

65
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:44,920
never been to definitely be I took don't
have computer

66
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,179
in a so yeah de funny is

67
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,440
is massively large a hacker conference
in Vegas

68
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,150
we were seeking a computer in the middle
love this conference

69
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,099
that was intended to be sued or
malicious lie all it did was

70
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:02,429
display change the display on the screen
but is an interesting concept as we had

71
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,799
actually secure that machine

72
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:07,370
from being attacked as that would be the
last thing you want

73
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:12,180
I mentioned already light CE a changeup
but is anybody have any idea about

74
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,100
what the necessary like first real mold
problem for

75
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,090
having a computer with a USB port
sticking out of it is anybody have an

76
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:19,529
idea

77
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:23,159
shut as it is

78
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,990
as a it is kinda obvious what he
actually thought about it is that

79
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,160
somebody will plug into USB keyboard and
then just

80
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,360
taking and they can do whatever they
want the screen was on the

81
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,610
actual device or they can just be /c
hijacked machines are taking everything

82
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,120
up which was easy a BC fixed

83
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,130
but other than that to a little bit
Eliminator on

84
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:47,280
those main concern is that the kissimmee
target and during the election in things

85
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:47,599
like

86
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,229
idiot at times but apparently little
masters like their own

87
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:54,930
nobody's going to plug in it nobody's
gonna trust they say we're gonna

88
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,930
singing in the room this whole the wall
of sheep room

89
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,270
which had the giant poster board %uh
everybody's password you can compromise

90
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,030
either long into this assessors is on
over an insecure and connection

91
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,409
and motion and it was hundreds of people
still plugged in

92
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,199
over the course of three days I def dont
and this was superior just completely

93
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,199
amaze

94
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,910
I'll there's verification as a guy when
the first guys up again happily in

95
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,400
be sitting there with the kiosk in with
the red notice saying

96
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,429
don't don't look into this room that was
a dumb idea

97
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,789
up all throughout the competition in the
back even see the pic peace and it is at

98
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:30,719
the wall feat

99
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,720
wall so up during a fun night there was

100
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,570
18 real legitimate a cell phone charging
kiosk for five dollars in the charger

101
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,080
for over 15 minutes

102
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,650
I can to position myself near then they
kept talking to people who love plugin

103
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,049
get the credit cards out to give to this
random box its standing in the hallway

104
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,780
now make

105
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,489
you know there's a free one over there a

106
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,500
away and the guy would respond at all
where's it at my kids in the wall of

107
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:54,910
sheep

108
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,889
room you know what I want is our know
what's that was the room where body gets

109
00:05:57,889 --> 00:05:58,620
hacked

110
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,289
so she's going there done it happens
often and I go over there like 10

111
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:06,550
minutes a day to find the guy sitting
down with his out with its own plugin

112
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,819
TV is a lovely time doesn't like way was
a

113
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:15,069
amazingly aid always work it always
works to some degree

114
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:18,449
Anna easy this in the air this is the
original screen

115
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:22,050
which is the same as what's on this
board here that's what people would seem

116
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,389
before they walked up to it and using
USB two ladies I could detect when

117
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:27,660
somebody's plugged into the USB device

118
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,009
and when it detected a USB device to
plug into the system

119
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:34,680
show this this week which is yes gimme
dat

120
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,699
is usually not just public kiosk with
your smartphone

121
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:41,030
information can you cheat or downloaded
without your consent

122
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,090
lucky for you decisions taken at going
out you need a safe enjoy the pre-charge

123
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,880
so to this message the science at them
up the wall

124
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,690
so obsolete plugin get presumably
compromised

125
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:57,199
and do whatever the Mason go on the
thing

126
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,960
so after Def Con is interesting
immediate picked up by tapping time he

127
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,060
was very novel concept nearly done

128
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,210
something like that before and

129
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,239
so a lot of people but was about to
leave a bank France

130
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,180
and feel the buzz about Sony people knew
that existed

131
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,210
so a few months later others to have fun
she's in San Diego

132
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,370
and was a in Riverside night unique got
together said we should do it again

133
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,919
you know and that was a there is a plan
that we've put together in the actual

134
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:27,620
building new kiosk entirely new kiosk

135
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,430
indeed slightly different actually took
a limitless action

136
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,710
because what we do use it would be up

137
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:38,440
it would be easy identify your USB
devices he plugged it in in the record

138
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,479
your specific US EPA I D E which
includes a few manufacturer the type

139
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,280
the make and model of your phone and he
would log how long you're plugged into

140
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:46,948
it

141
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:50,569
up and this is only a malicious but if
something is novel in the

142
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:54,220
different meaning 18 build a row to up
living sup the people's home directory

143
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:54,740
or

144
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,370
SD cards yet 4.8 of the SD cards

145
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,830
up but the key thing is that at work on

146
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:05,109
it had already been published by
multiple articles by not only military

147
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,550
the turning point

148
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,990
just checking with you know to call it
before def gonna one other

149
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,060
weather reporter said it's just checking
electrical isms

150
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,840
edgy so even though the ID in order
they're published

151
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,378
people still flooded and he was
completely amazing to us that over

152
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:25,669
the one day that I had it out the kiosk
al it work on

153
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:31,500
he was still plugging in an won the guys
that had the best story react he said

154
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,690
my wife had called me during the talk
and make battery was dead and there's

155
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,560
something really bad going on

156
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,939
and he made I watched him exit the talk
and make a beeline for the

157
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,140
the charging kiosk and plug in his phone
I was just dumbfounded

158
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,069
because the guy just like seeded out
pinned Justin Kemp

159
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,740
again I just I want them in a talk to
the guy bit and his reasoning was that

160
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,700
his wife was

161
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,430
frantically tried calling any just
needed a charge two things I double

162
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,729
had been risen so high that he had to
stop the

163
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,820
must charge at that moment any didn't
care for the fashion scene

164
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,800
think about it in the individual
undocking

165
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,449
actually heard about geez checking is
very much aware that he said about three

166
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,680
seconds every plugin

167
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,810
you remember everything anything I shake
with my the new

168
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,229
you hit the wrong thing and is even more

169
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,380
crazy because this is the kiosk in

170
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,189
I get I apologize for just any picture
not the device but is the kiosk that was

171
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,709
just there was a at work on a little bit
different looking at in have the screen

172
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:33,989
but I have this nasty bad raster like

173
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,589
graphic which you can see in this
picture but like that it's all pixelated

174
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:40,720
like eight blown up his image and in
just look bad

175
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,380
all I did was taken sticker on the side
in a box it black boxes as free in the

176
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,580
USB cables

177
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,620
and this all it took for air this one
individual just popping over plugin

178
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,100
up throughout the week in there like
three or four people different people

179
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,420
all plug a

180
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,160
people there was one guy that was a what
are the people at the conference so he

181
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:57,410
was

182
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,660
you he knew about the charging station
he knew he should have remembered

183
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,660
everything he just

184
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:05,699
in thinking in you know again there is
another person's unknown

185
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,560
security researcher who plugged in
people have these excuses why they

186
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,459
plugged in

187
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:14,959
but you know to everybody their own I
don't see why anybody would trust her

188
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,430
million baht black women boxing testing
this is free on it

189
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,890
so after this after to work on a been
many months later

190
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,939
I kinda forgot about really working on
it

191
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,380
and I thought I was coming in Chicago

192
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,560
what happened in the time between

193
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,930
a truth I thought colin is an ABC a

194
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:39,949
a little device better tp-link router
it's about two inches

195
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:45,100
by display device you see it on the left
to ensure swayed by spent a quarter inch

196
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,610
are that reporters install to install
and then a battery backup anything

197
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:53,540
and I found I think quayle if I can
really wanna try this hard making shrink

198
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,730
it down to

199
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:59,620
this size you know this little box and
it is much more than the EPC so I

200
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,920
actually don't have to worry about
having a

201
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,329
somewhat large but small laptop that
quickly hide somewhere

202
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:08,800
and it worked out pretty well because
eGain

203
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,969
I just stuck in a box in a handle cables
running out of it

204
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,360
I did not displayed at five time because
it this idea had it like this is like a

205
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,640
week before the iPhone it happened I was
like oh crap I can use them manager

206
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,470
about it

207
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:24,100
that's running open WR TD's in st. stuff
I shared some people they liked it

208
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,209
because it was so compact and small
which

209
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:31,239
you can see here wasn't funny is what I
put some time into

210
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,260
this weaker in the last few weeks is
Vilnius

211
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,519
kiosk above swords for layer 1

212
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:41,709
Anna is looks nicer nice

213
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:46,000
nice graphic it's not raining in english
is not seen anything bad happening

214
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,570
but that little mini poster that the ALA
tp-link router which is actually was

215
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,959
always the many Boehner

216
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,469
up ways what's inside and that was
powering this device

217
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,910
other EC anybody

218
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,240
INS's anybody actually plugged into the
city to get a charge on the phone

219
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,370
just me I want to trust me I when he
passes

220
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,540
easy on the back there's little wood
compartment

221
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:14,389
that %uh inside this is the new phone
it's located right about here

222
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:17,570
and a USB hub which is what he saw in
the picture and

223
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,610
a lot of people like talking today BC
said again this is so small it

224
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,320
they don't think that the woody is part
of like a computer's

225
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,720
is able to be compacted back there this
is in a small as it gets

226
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,450
but it is certainly as small as I can
get utilizing

227
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:38,519
a router which I think sells for $25 to
$35 dollars online

228
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:43,709
yeah numbers are dangerous and its blue
and it's a nice picture in

229
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:46,800
who's gonna be you think anything nasty
is gonna happen here

230
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,180
but with this device is a little bit
different I'll let me see

231
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:58,180
I didn't do a demo it in practice this
demo but let me C bang do this

232
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:09,860

00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:34,990
by sticking to be placed on the stock
but a lieutenant

237
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:40,600

can fail in the middle for Tom

238
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,820

00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,200
i apologize. for back in nineteen
seventy years plugin for about two

309
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:09,750
minutes

310
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,060
lengthy other

311
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,450
devices using the Slingbox on high in
the air Apple

312
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:21,360
Apple iPhones are connecting and
disconnecting a

313
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:26,610
and there you go that's the end. those
few minutes there

314
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,110
things even easier this way i win

315
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,199
a polled I'll from a response is it just
me

316
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,740
miss mucking around it looks like nobody
else really plugin for long enough today

317
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:41,260
where it had pulled anything or fail to
work maybe wasn't running

318
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,030
there's a very good chance that I wasn't
running my USB script

319
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,190
now wallows Rainier but in any case the
end

320
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,020
failures were for demonstrations so back
to the doc

321
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,510
alright so that mister by some

322
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,830
no reason really just a I think I saw
people looking into it

323
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:03,490
I with presumably security devices I
know I begin to adjust it

324
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,670
but people like a make them think that
is safe and now the end

325
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:12,770
key on this though isn't really the idea
is a Texas opposite its

326
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:18,040
learning from shenanigans the ideal for
this started at a party where we're just

327
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,590
out having fun doing our own thing an
intern

328
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:25,179
II China is investing or like me this
kiosk something came

329
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,840
army where you know week turn from just
having fun

330
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,370
to you something that created in and
Sony the media was involved

331
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,270
it's a median was involved it became as
much bigger thing actually came

332
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:41,220
a term you know that was being searched
on Google keeper utilizing it on you

333
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,650
know their own research blog their
security logs

334
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,730
up some people that back onto it grabs

335
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:50,620
a bank and First Aid caught on to it it
was one of his top posts in the last

336
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,760
quarter last year

337
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,340
up Eunos beware G shackleton's when they
release this concept

338
00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:00,310
%uh be a the media route so we may see
did the right about what happened at Def

339
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:00,770
Con

340
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:05,000
after that was TG Daily which is Tom's
guide:

341
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,520
how to avoid smartphone just checking
this thing is a good thing

342
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,820
brinkley kidnapping will finally
learning something that you publish in a

343
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,909
plug in your phone to rain msgstr you
should do something

344
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,910
think about before reading it after that
was seen it

345
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:21,380
the 404 which is our podcasts any news

346
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,820
technolog on MSNBC watch a train
stations could be stealing your data

347
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,070
it like this idea beginning the scare
factor in their

348
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:34,439
up at that though is there a transition
maybe jus checkin portable unit

349
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,810
utilizing the new term

350
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:40,389
data from your cell phone and then a you
noticed various Twitter Facebook social

351
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,040
networking feeds where everybody was

352
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,470
collaborations back and forth new to
find each other talking about it

353
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:50,680
digging up their own militias ideas you
know like put into a marketing campaign

354
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,980
pushing off 280 billion public airport
like how did you get into an airport

355
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,490
%uh so so I'm all this brew

356
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:03,170
on what was yes me having fun with
friends be creating actual thing in

357
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:06,540
Jimmy the it its I highly recommend at
least

358
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,980
if you have any ideas friends and were
even an 80 on your own you see how many

359
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,360
wanna try it see it just go out and do
it because it's not too terribly

360
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:14,870
difficult

361
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:18,699
any its in the end you're gonna you
might have something that became much

362
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,130
more that much bigger vanadium much more
public

363
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:25,260
publicity about it anyone ever expected
maybe a few giving a talk next year they

364
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:25,750
are one

365
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:29,020
so up to this point I'm like

366
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,060
it's made in an ideal subjects up

367
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,710
internet question for everybody in every
shape for these answers by now and these

368
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,700
have their own ideas

369
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:41,460
let me about not me know the plan in 20
States stations are being public

370
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,540
with your cell phone what would you do
to not get he's jacked

371
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:50,389
area

372
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:54,570
yes that is the number one thing that
everybody says this is why ain't

373
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:57,909
identified here's always in demand
things it's called USB cable neutering

374
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,550
is what most people call it be

375
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:03,770
the okay could open the cable any cut
out the bed they transfer

376
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:07,830
you know transfer me C payne's so it's
just the two power and power in Grampian

377
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,169
and this I think I just don't like that
idea cutting

378
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,390
sticking things so

379
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:18,340
yeah you make an adapter is well up but
there's a

380
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,270
concept in a Japanese it's very common
to people to go I'll just bring it after

381
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,690
they can plug into bad that I can plug
my phone into

382
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:27,760
but if you remember team member
remembering to bring an adapter why

383
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,650
don't you remember to bring into the
battery

384
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:33,960
or a like you know a plug into the wall
%uh

385
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,750
banging from

386
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:41,060
yes she and other she thought the same
battery type: or just bring an extra

387
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,220
battery for your phone

388
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,280
if you have an Android phone you can
just take a battery on swapping any

389
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,520
other ideas

390
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,120
you have a burner phone they just don't
care if they at the date of over the

391
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,570
it but date on it you have a smartphone
that's not very smart me just

392
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:57,730
disable only all the functionality I

393
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,870
is another new a new novel ideas
powering off the device for staking

394
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,350
claim to power off the device

395
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:05,560
in what run the operating system so you
can't connect to it in the malicious

396
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,220
activity

397
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:10,000
%uh some bones what is still allow you
to mount the SD card that's

398
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,490
located inside the phone even if the
power of it is actually use the bridge

399
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,490
any ideas

400
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,600
people nobody at the obvious one which
is most

401
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,270
a most Android devices I will now
shipping brahms that include

402
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:28,350
a question basic question you plug in SD
card to do you want to mount the SD card

403
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:28,909
and

404
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:32,510
on this is probably the best idea on a
design

405
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:36,260
and bad for the users are thinking about
it by default it should be

406
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,629
not mounting device and you have to
explicitly going and confirm with the

407
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,670
device and you want it to be able to be
multiple

408
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:45,200
day before anybody can access the SD
card this is a the

409
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,930
yes of earlier block but it works it
doesn't prevent them

410
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:53,680
potentially malicious kiosk from
actually identifying your device was

411
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,280
plugin for a certain period of time

412
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,620
however it does help with you know
preventing the end you know so many

413
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,949
like putting in some cases laptop and
the laptop just you know in knowing the

414
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,750
phone employing unit I feel up to

415
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:08,460
be a laptop um

416
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,270
is going on just being a battery backup
new little battery back up the cost of

417
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,760
$10 to $15 bucks

418
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,230
eroticized they're really cheap and easy
I

419
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,920
missiles at three thousand million power
a battery backup

420
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,790
and so in like busy get cheap and he's
applying to any phone you don't have to

421
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,730
change a battery

422
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:30,700
or unplug your phone or just plug into
the USB BC charge the battery

423
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,380
yet has a USB port on it and you plug
your phone but when you use the

424
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,290
directed at arranged sucks the date of
it for basic so does

425
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:41,879
ya yeah and then this can also run the
kiosk

426
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,970
I have a a small battery shaking
remember where it is

427
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:48,820
but that could take a good one a small
battery could buy missed ya so do need

428
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,189
to be plugged into a wall at me

429
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:53,950
floating around somewhere in the world
and you never know that it's a rental

430
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:57,470
28 %uh and

431
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:00,960
again that but thats comes back down to
remembering to bring something and bring

432
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,040
your charger plugged in

433
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,659
looking directly into a wall socket
mercies the kiosk or some sorta public

434
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,010
thing

435
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:09,290
I was flying to elsewhere worthless

436
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,899
I didn't stop to take his picture in an
up-to-date again I saw this guy ames

437
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,620
nephews

438
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,639
standing right next to charging kiosk
which is the pay charging kiosk

439
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,960
about five dollars give like 15 minutes
ish is kinda expensive

440
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,200
but I found it hilarious that they look
behind him

441
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,330
the tragic yes was plugged directly into
the wall the wall had open socket might

442
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:30,820
need to turn it yes I get some game was
plugged into the socket

443
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,990
in the wall any changes yes and I found
that just money because

444
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:37,590
that was perfect you know that's exactly
right like just remember that is

445
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,320
powering

446
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,600
you know don't worry about the data just
ignored eighty only one is power

447
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,899
anyone you're a your phone charge

448
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:49,050
and beating hear the news is that for my
opinion

449
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:52,230
to ninety jack there there too valid

450
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:56,570
answers here and they both the author
circle around remembering something

451
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:59,730
she forget to being a battery but he
forget to bring your charger

452
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,390
those the OPP there's the awful ones but
those are the ones that are gonna be

453
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,190
able to save you

454
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:06,860
%uh in the most option investment you
know security

455
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:10,419
basie bear fight at your phone requires
confirmation before eighty

456
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,140
power data is being able to be like this
the cars being able to be mounted

457
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:18,180
the rendering devices: before ATV
entering debugging mode

458
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:23,480
is turned off for the record a skaters
who here has a CNN's bob installed on

459
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,010
the phone

460
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,080
and did you guys do turn of debugging

461
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,409
he is aware though that the engine my by
devar Heidi Vogt mo turned on

462
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:35,110
so I found this out when after I really
made when my phones

463
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:38,889
and I plugged into the kiosk those kinda
curious to see if I could detect if it's

464
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,010
in debug mode or not

465
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:43,540
and I thought I'd thought the long as my
phone in turn on debug mode but I found

466
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,080
out immediately when I plugged in

467
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,580
when Iran Ellis USB use kinda funny the
%uh particular speed USB told me that

468
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,280
the phone was a Motorola phone that was

469
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,530
in debug mode so I can immediately and
run ETV

470
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:58,580
norris ABC with the phone in so many
naps are you guys vote for them

471
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:02,210
malicious purposes I still don't like
the idea how if the device is not

472
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:02,930
certain

473
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:06,850
and the USB cable they're going a
committee for I just don't like the idea

474
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:10,270
view thinking about me doing anything

475
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:13,889
dub Ryan I those

476
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:16,910
personal and this business into this %uh

477
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:20,750
if you put in a corporate environment
%ah thats actually matter policy you

478
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,480
wanna make sure you state

479
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,100
day a policy that everybody remembers
our bodies aware of

480
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,469
you should not be going traveling
internationally or traveling three

481
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,190
airports in for getting your

482
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:35,670
extra battery backup for your phone case
frankly you're CEOs in your

483
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:39,060
itto losing you see if those in all
these chief

484
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,110
level guys are the 10 basic those the
targets are the ones that have the

485
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,929
phones are probably has the data

486
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,020
that probably an hour or have access to
all the networks a systems

487
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,310
they're gonna be doing the most damage
potentially if the phone is infected

488
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:53,889
and then brought in to secure network or
any of the phones affecting

489
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,990
its the attacker uses just read your
email take their

490
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:00,800
take the photos to get pictures in the
%uh blackmail against the CT love

491
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,930
something company

492
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:06,640
any nasty bad up but the idea is that
it's a matter of policy energy state you

493
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,780
notify people you let people know what
to do do remember not to plug in your

494
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,379
phone because it's more than just

495
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,980
a phone it's more than just a
potentially more than just charging

496
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,000
kiosk

497
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,600
and for personal users it's really
matter not getting up you know

498
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,899
or not getting stressed out when your
phone runs out data

499
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,700
you know don't freak out don't think
you're you know you gotta call you white

500
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,990
back immediately just

501
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:29,870
have a bf remembering it was only twenty
years ago or so that

502
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:33,260
meet cell phones don't exist so maybe
you can just way

503
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:36,290
a few hours for you to go back to the
hotel room to charge your phone big a

504
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:36,629
bit

505
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:40,310
taken away like somebody call back was
use

506
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:44,659
Campbell yes in fact the if thank you
for reminding you cuz I almost forgot

507
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,920
and there is a woman upset they did

508
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,620
I don't have the information about this
and slides I did get a call website is

509
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,870
for Louis those be normal you know its
good guy

510
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:58,500
he helps run the ball sheep up he hoped
that a lot of this is just

511
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,970
train the unfortunate ideal d to be here
yet he's actually rebuilding

512
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:06,510
ag's Jack a as about approximately the
size

513
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,820
another among its a lie about this it's
all built

514
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:13,679
into I direct wallboard and one

515
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,530
he he called me this funny story earlier
today in like half an hour two hours

516
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,600
here

517
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,480
is aiight yeah you know I should be
there this crazy thing I've been working

518
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,220
on that

519
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,610
the %uh the plug you know the G-seven
fun like awesome I can has made ahead

520
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:29,709
yet again is a messed up and

521
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:33,870
I you wire the 110 on accident across
the USB line

522
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:37,040
so when he gave it was accidentally hit

523
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:41,550
plug his a USB into DC 110 volt USB and
plug that into a phone the phone

524
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,220
probably died

525
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:48,060
like probably is done took theoretically
as well you could fit into a size abate

526
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,820
about a while workers in Walmart which
is

527
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:54,370
the devising hears about that right size
ok thanks to the case of it would fit

528
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,800
perfectly fine

529
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,050
%uh and you can also be really malicious

530
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:03,060
and just have to get people wall words
that just charge went into people's

531
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,139
phones UK game

532
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:09,140
and on that note ISMI giveaways

533
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:14,650
I really don't know Lake who here has
the best novel idea for malicious or non

534
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:15,620
malicious purpose

535
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:19,600
now you can do a few the right behind a
wall what size computer

536
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,860
the plug into the wall on somebody's
going into the USB he's got something

537
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,820
you can win a prize

538
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:27,050
so %uh near good idea get one in the
back

539
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:34,050
mocked nomadic on something better

540
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:39,220
something better and nom

541
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:43,550
yet hunny bunny yea you can be even
skate the funny pug issued runs very

542
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,139
similar to their little TV Guide

543
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:48,940
going to be it. I a total force me to
full power computer

544
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,980
here's the militia activity yeah it is

545
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:58,270
in you broham

546
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:01,810
access unique and different AA said he
is a power line network

547
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:05,370
you see all the data and then push it to
system our site technically

548
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:09,739
as well I kid I could do the same thing
here cuz I'm wifi on my router

549
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,850
so this writer could be connecting to
device it's kinda just have seen at:

550
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,330
and just pulling all adults data and I
don't even need ever touched a

551
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:20,210
is Becky oskin and so he met their

552
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:24,630
no as I T in here

553
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:27,980
doubts over matter to lower your power
bill

554
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:32,040
gnome

555
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:36,270
that there was such a weird ideas like
that good she here fell off

556
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:40,050
and what's happening alright than
anybody else have any good ideas

557
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:43,780
any crazy ideas on novel new different

558
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:48,340
im as I say it when it's complete the
game about a

559
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:52,760
always old serenading shared I think I
like your ideas yet you I don't get new

560
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,060
clothes wanna catch a

561
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:57,419
about a pound and a half under

562
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:01,740
a surreal scene who said that Tony like
I come on here

563
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:06,220
bother you can I like your power over
and are you here you

564
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:12,310
power lines age those aren't the judge
2011 hour battery backups

565
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:16,550
HIV as I can't use worm otherwise I just
gave you like it

566
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:19,590
in the ladies room Bochum

567
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:24,790
it trust me no I really thought he is
later

568
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:28,230
but all those images but

569
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,640
yes a meeting is a member you charge
your battery I

570
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:35,270
again so I mention a little bit for
Android devices

571
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,920
I have the majority their own ship with
ASCII format thing but

572
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,030
you probably should check because I
found a lot of manufactures a wide

573
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:45,310
devices still don't ask the right off
the bat for the bronze

574
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:49,220
opto it differs from brown month Ron is
going to benefit

575
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:53,080
for most Android devices that you can
take the power from a big battery out

576
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,220
the and swap it out with a different
battery

577
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,310
anytime you want that same access to it
as opposed to

578
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:02,790
the iPhone device which is you can never
take the battery out on this device

579
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,280
without ripping the case but

580
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:09,500
I mean that again up but I just a little
bit on iPhones but reality is then

581
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,159
drains

582
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,909
have unique risks their complete even in
the iPhone and

583
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:17,639
what are the main ones as the Andrae
debug mode which allows you may see

584
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,879
get into the phones like you know you
can do anything you want Naxos logging

585
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,860
directly to taxi

586
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:25,669
to vote you know install the app's
background things muck around with

587
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:26,370
things

588
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:29,839
up meet the phone as well read it read
it reinstall

589
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,660
the operating system albeit and a
debugger I think

590
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:36,859
guess neuter is a unique it was busier a

591
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,930
tool I read and write phones using a

592
00:34:39,929 --> 00:34:43,379
in explaining forget what service or was
I was running on the phone but basically

593
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,370
through the phone in about 30 seconds

594
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:48,790
saying everything anyways inch charge
their phones unit and plugin for more

595
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,100
than 30 seconds

596
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,230
and you can basically anybody's phone
who has spoken to you

597
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:57,090
your gonna go charging station

598
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:00,610
the iPhone is another main concern is
the main tumhain continues iPhone

599
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:01,600
Android

600
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,240
its design for usability for yours is
the main thing which unfortunates

601
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,250
things like you can't take the battery
out but they don't think that they want

602
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:09,000
the person

603
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,820
long the iPhone from swapping batteries
doing all this stuff and third-party

604
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:18,050
systems eiffel also has any a unique
situation where doesn't auto sync where

605
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:18,670
able

606
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:22,660
people get your iPhone in tears demonic
amazing you know that you know it all

607
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:27,149
connect your iTunes and probably check
for updates to various other things

608
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:31,450
and liddy a valid Meezy validate itself
it doesn't do confirmation from Mount

609
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:34,799
any you know it doesn't have an injury
bug

610
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,210
but aid up at-will me lied about the bus
system

611
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:42,350
they've been changes in it in fact
allies he year so enjoy a Apple

612
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:46,569
change their Medicaid for mounting an
actually fired you have a shipper

613
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:50,300
sheesh PA think it's publicly your shaky

614
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,320
base in between your iTunes installation
and your phone

615
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,240
to your phone knows what your computer
is which is a great benefits hugest

616
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,700
its it's much better than what it was
previously which is that version the

617
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,290
iPhone the original generation I don't
even care

618
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:06,890
if you plug any would allow any machine
to mount its SD card

619
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:10,160
and and pull the data off the phone but
stayed on to the phone

620
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,170
delicious activity a I guess it does
it's been fixed

621
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:18,720
it's good however it's still relying on
a key so if you prefer sexyy on an

622
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,310
iPhone

623
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,450
you then had access to an iPhone

624
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:25,669
there's also stirred up to my control
news %uh

625
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,770
which is basing control so you can't you

626
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:32,140
your own power you know they say the USB
power adapter 28 is this minute

627
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,799
controlled angle so he by

628
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,820
get wanna the site backup battery
sources yet make sure they don't get one

629
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,370
that's going to be mini USB

630
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:42,569
because I will be able to plug into your
iPhone it's just silly

631
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:45,960
stupid things that seem to be circling
around Apple's

632
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,720
decisions make the iPhone perfect denies
it in their own method

633
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,680
so send any questions so far me pretty
good

634
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,770
unlikely any going to sleep then stop it
here

635
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:01,990
there's a little more to this laying
here then just a kiosk

636
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:06,049
up however that's what like the focus
this talk is putting a kiosk in plugging

637
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:07,450
the phone

638
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,730
holding off on the thinking is all gonna
be %uh

639
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:14,020
ill made to ambush in Bonita it's neat
novel

640
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:17,220
up the Aussie member though that you can
do for traffic monitoring

641
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,500
was on a mission for the reply to phone
get special USB ID

642
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,920
from that phone s you need your phone so
huggles this kiosk hearing in with

643
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,050
somewhere else

644
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:29,240
and I have a commission at work break in
identifying can watch where you're going

645
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,080
as you plug into different devices

646
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,460
not to mention night each year device
need me to tracking that its

647
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,330
separate things is relying on plugging
in that topic use going into them

648
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:41,410
up so this not only for traffic
monitoring weren't watching the people

649
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,140
go

650
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:46,080
on this would work for multiple airports
CDC somebody's traveling through States

651
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,660
if the always popular phone in TN into a
kiosk

652
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:52,710
up its effectively the same as people
tracking

653
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:55,710
BK's be your phone is your phone

654
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:59,100
rarely do people share phones with each
other or swap their fancy knowing

655
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,160
someone's phone usb eighties the same is
knowing

656
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,710
where they are

657
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,740
and even consequences unique from the
position that a hand where I was

658
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,229
building the kiosk

659
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:12,470
I'm putting out a deft and I was
concerned that somebody might

660
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:15,899
compromise the computer that I had their
up

661
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,630
and this bring up the idea well I could
probably also attack the existing he

662
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,760
asks people have it airports and others

663
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,640
any other locations I research allottees
cell phone kiosk companies in the really

664
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,830
novel what they do

665
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:31,569
some of them have complicated like video
screens that display at commercial when

666
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,160
you plug in your phone

667
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,430
n in doing that I knew at the East that
there's a computer there

668
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:40,509
rate is gonna computer system like bc
plane is Mieko

669
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:45,190
detecting things in plugin they have
also pin system where

670
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:49,200
you stick your phone in a box and it
closes in any display let you choose

671
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,980
your pain

672
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,520
and then I'll choosing from there though
is that units and again that

673
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,770
it there's something in that box it's
more than just power

674
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:01,970
a I'm able to compact the downturn is
very small sized and soon they really

675
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:04,740
compact they've got a large Kia think
that whatever power they need in order

676
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,229
to complete her

677
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,740
complete their task for what they think
is marking but you can also attacked a

678
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,419
kiosk

679
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:14,150
and get after the machine that exist
inside it n

680
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:17,650
you need to make your own kiosk
theoretically it is a malicious activity

681
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:21,130
you need to make NTSB you just company's
existing kiosk

682
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,600
and they want to know his who where work
what is their patch updates

683
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:27,140
main weather there perhaps it's like
they did that doesn't exist they never

684
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:27,810
thought that

685
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:31,009
it is never thought would think that
somebody will try to attack a kiosk is

686
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:35,120
well with you get you don't really get
people talking in the devices

687
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,220
%uh you can also then again there

688
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:41,450
I'm a plan of attack they would be the
USB interface that exist on that

689
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:45,359
on thing as you nearly eight years being
human interface device the keyword

690
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:49,070
where the activity in push directly onto
the computer that made you may not exist

691
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,440
behind a kiosk

692
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,980
%uh you can also if they depending how
they wired up you can use your phone

693
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,020
as USB host device plug it into a kiosk

694
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:02,320
and it the wiring was not correctly done
you the Act is the

695
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,640
busy USB host in you why your in your
phone is the attack

696
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,839
I'm vector e-tec me tagging device

697
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,230
so when somebody else bugs in their
phones in the same kiosk in nature is

698
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,070
over the USB interfaces

699
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:17,180
and Deer AB you be able to mount their
phone from your phone

700
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:21,270
and indeed most activity anyway no this
is just using a phone with the phone at

701
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,030
kiosk which

702
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,230
makes very much sense because you had a
phone kiosk

703
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:28,680
up all these require detailed knowledge
at the kiosk

704
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,790
the he also verified to be anybody
anywhere

705
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:35,090
I don't think that there's a lot of
securing your highness gas companies

706
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:38,940
had not heard a single one can reach out
to mir talk about you jacking

707
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,800
effect on the kiosk forums when I saw
after this was when East

708
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,430
they had a mention it and every first
every person from a company that

709
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,770
designed the kiosk system

710
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:52,020
railing on the idea but nobody would do
this but we are running a good business

711
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:52,830
was like whoa

712
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:56,540
the problem isn't bad the problem is
somebody militias could do it

713
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:00,490
like nobody's thinking that you're being
bad but nobody's making you hot only

714
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,029
millie is says this how do we make

715
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:05,150
potentially RTS never be identified as
malicious

716
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:08,560
with our music and doing a certification
think is a certified

717
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,790
clear in OE nobody's there's no
discussion about and

718
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:15,150
in their kiosk forms because it's not
worth the money

719
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:19,470
potential and then be on the chaos is a
lady at

720
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:22,589
just forget everything about the kiosk
don't worry about this

721
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:27,109
the way about that %uh its just transfer
the attack to a laptop or PC

722
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:30,170
if anybody is on a corporate network
and/or

723
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:33,640
let's think unlike the college I network
India

724
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,400
and college network while the computer
lab let's say where those computers as

725
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,960
an hour installed

726
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,750
and you just waiting for somebody who
needs charge the phone go to the

727
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,580
computer lab

728
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:45,890
a plug the phone in nonchalantly not
thinking about it because well they're

729
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,180
just charging the phone

730
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:50,509
and then our can be distributed from
that computer lab computer

731
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:54,170
work over the Miami compere at any
infected with you into the phone

732
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:58,040
arm theoretically you could push lower
back and forth between phones and

733
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,870
computers

734
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:01,980
am just sprayed on its own naturally as
people

735
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,340
physically are the transfer nothing
between for you

736
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:09,290
malicious content between phones
computers it spread faster than herpes

737
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:10,440
at college

738
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:14,850
fun and then a remember too that
everybody brings their phones work

739
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:18,250
so the phone is actually Mary up

740
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:22,020
powerful device and nobody thinks that
they're bringing your phone from

741
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:25,680
the wild from malicious love potentially
malicious networks

742
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,799
into a cig what should be a secure
network in this comes down to

743
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,020
unit caso getting getting from that it
like policies yet it

744
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:36,540
have a policy where people though other
phones into

745
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,890
you know their computer at work or you
know if your phone is

746
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,879
you know yet to bet that the phone is
secure before it's just me plug into

747
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:46,830
work and it's crazy it's being talked to
a lot of people that reality is that

748
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:50,580
news potential there up not to mention
the fact that all phones have wifi

749
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,700
devices on them now so ATM WiFi network
at your

750
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:57,460
and your work or any work environment
again the phone can connect

751
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,600
from you know love up my son

752
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,940
could connect your works WiFi network
and then out within a secure network

753
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:08,560
so I can change in the idea that what's
this what to secure

754
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,350
in your work environment pretty much
everything including Ops is then up to

755
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:15,370
mission enough exited militias ever to
mention the many polling

756
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:18,660
so to summarize yeah the

757
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,750
core threat isn't the kiosk up its

758
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:24,810
the eight design the Jazz usability over
security

759
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:28,080
and then this is a very being see
radical idea you know it's it's

760
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,290
me choose usability over security you're
gonna be compromising perhaps he won't

761
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:32,840
think about the compromise the

762
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,230
potential ramifications in the future
and this was data transferred

763
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:39,620
happens on the same port that you charge
your phone

764
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:43,480
in its that's a simple like boil down to
the set was point

765
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,520
now it now everybody uses a designer
phone designers meeting

766
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,650
cleaning patches and systems that
prevent people from

767
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:54,359
basically nato the airport when the
intention is to charge only

768
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:58,400
so they is a to resist the entire design
complexity goes beyond

769
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,440
yes it is isn't about that it its

770
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:07,560
you can in fact PCs laptops you can
affect bone from infected PCs laptops pp

771
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:12,160
rinse go on the fourth and anything just
about the phone our

772
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,950
because thats as a nice who happen to
think about some you can get your phone

773
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:19,680
realities to use the USB AT&T phone is
your specific identify a

774
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,990
if you have enough but same I infected
hosts you

775
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:26,850
aiding in corporate networks you can
track USB eighties on the devices

776
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:32,560
and no when I I was not miss waiting
stock it is but too many of

777
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,400
but you know and so is plugged into the
corporate environment and you can

778
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,620
identify where the person is

779
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:39,740
is at that exact point I'm sitting on a
track somebody let's say you got

780
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:42,859
a couple I system in their office
network you can see where they are when

781
00:44:42,859 --> 00:44:43,509
they're in the office

782
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:47,130
when they're not in the office I ending
in you know it goes if the obvious

783
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:48,530
stolen personal information

784
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:51,600
seal somebody's a gallery folder from
their phone in

785
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,600
are you guys thinking about yourself by
so many have you got a folder you can

786
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,690
think about how much like where

787
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:59,340
blackmail they may or may not have
against you so

788
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:03,370
now be it and I think everybody with a
while she they won for having me

789
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:07,480
he as their design a real but together
all these things on a short notice is

790
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,090
