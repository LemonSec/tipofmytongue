1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:05,130
all right what is called zero one

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,940
rights so topic of this one is first of
all that money is still growing

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,169
financial almost two years no new cell

4
00:00:12,169 --> 00:00:13,689
was controlled

5
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:16,088
by putting all my life

6
00:00:16,088 --> 00:00:17,619

10
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,990
worked so hard to imagine hardware for
girls perhaps at first

11
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:38,450
attrib run the code the order changes
periodically

12
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,559
arafat still got most of these are
correct i would call it turns primitives

13

look at these three things are doing
this all i do

14
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,630
but it's not possible

15
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,010

everybody starts

54
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:42,259
every thought that that

55

00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:24,829
so what does that work for what the fuck

67
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,819
successfully

68
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:31,569
right on top of that everybody's insist
came out was that part out

hoping for

78
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,799
also what should be sure that works of
art dot

79
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,689
so are

167
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,120
okay soaring stock market is almost
close to a box for health insurance for

168
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,099
money

169
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:29,639
that's when the accident does before we
all want red

170
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,310
no one is with his parents house the
director of information security is

171
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:35,159
always sitting right next to you

172
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,210
when you get back home for sale

173
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,170
who's who looked at competent the
movement of attendance

174
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:45,020
and i think a lot

175
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,069
when the mechanic group

176
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,520
who would like natural anybody

177
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,170
i wouldn't call my mom and i would
probably be

178
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,579
kumar

179
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,700
interests

180
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,410
chill start moving around and that was
the lateral movement that poem about a

181
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,959
grown man

182
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,900
cameron pretty much everything

183
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,620
and i will be difficult to because i
couldn't mostar spoiled everything but

184
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,370
the fireworks

185
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,550
really want to forget the stockpiles mca

186
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,910
soul

187
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:19,240
i have absolutely customer

188
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,720
uh... we got all of the actual firewalls

189
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,520
uh...

190
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,090
and we've got buying every

191
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,560
depends what you have

192
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,529
complex event host a stuffed network
based on

193
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,470
they have accepted way of that load
balancer

194
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,310
all that stuff

195
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,530
semi-official question

196
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:44,530
do this stock

197
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:50,240
this up

198
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,170
actually disagree

199
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:55,610
actually call the customer hails a
couple of engine in the defense

200
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,930
improve these things and i think you're
okay

201
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,620
there's a big difference between

202
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,130
uh... for me

203
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,010
told the customer and there's a big
difference between here's what's

204
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,250
probably

205
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,000
injuries what is possible

206
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,300
it is possible that i'm going to avoid
big megan fox

207
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,689
there's not a problem

208
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,210
to make sense

209
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:22,560
if the person drops of boxing forced him
to redress the attendees comic actor

210
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,660
activities

211
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,490
he's going to be protected by the
protection mechanisms that employees

212
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:34,059
williams and i was really the storms was
universal skills seventy attackers

213
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:36,160
in insurance and okay

214
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,020
the home buyers will get caught

215
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:45,010
it was twenty o'clock travel was forced
to sell support base of calls

216
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:49,280
lord david parks recall those bolshevik
echo partners will get caught

217
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,379
so that we have to start focusing on the
attack methodologies tactics

218
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:58,180
use by all these guys love about the
buzzword advance persistent thread

219
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:02,310
to start looking uh... what people are
doing jubail

220
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:05,069
complex and highly secure environments

221
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:07,199
that's really where we gotta go

222
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,670
so we should use for the same
advancement of the best securities socks

223
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,560
first service center

224
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,189
you're focusing on the federal agents xd
type of attacker

225
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,980
let's start now that you've touched
bases covered

226
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,779
technology proper training wheels off a
bicycle

227
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:26,090
transfer of the storm newsroom arrived
at that

228
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:26,850
that's all

229
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,949
however these companies sell become one
of the process of how we're doing what i

230
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:31,599
do

231
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,560
references best thing in the world but

232
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,959
distance away

233
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,910
pretzel first-timer idu when i started
with the company

234
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,780
is archives for example

235
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,329
who sent it

236
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,610
so i really look forward to sql
injections process credential all of

237
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,550
that stuff

238
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,930
through google

239
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,920
uh... defined those types of flaws that
several click way for me to get a shell

240
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,189
uh... there's a lot like it is because
about porsche cayman

241
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,800
portion is dead

242
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,439
with us from our point of time

243
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,140
ports can use it

244
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,080
whatever the fuck you're doing in your
scientific qualified stance

245
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,820
somalia moved up as much forced him to
determine who don't know what the fuck

246
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,880
contract

247
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,340
canister

248
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,850
fungible revolution of the web go
straight for the for the jugular

249
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:27,970
the to find a strong objection in our
party and there are a few remote farm

250
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:28,940
include

251
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,060
organization to the following

252
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,599
straight from work

253
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,970
if you don't stalk

254
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:39,070
are they going to see you poor standards
for goods

255
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,179
forgivable service

256
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:44,740
democrat and have been shooting out of
most wanted

257
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,160
it's just forward for your strong jobs
report home or fifty seven shelter over

258
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,199
first all that's going on

259
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,670
so you get into people start looking at
the way

260
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,790
use attackers character

261
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,420
tear next week next week

262
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,560
passive return

263
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,609
hello fingerprinted organization and
figure out what types of things they

264
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,380
have in place

265
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,260
things that i really like firefighters
possibly talk about on

266
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,890
that does all the stuff four inches of
passive return

267
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,330
and that that will fingerprint like

268
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:19,830
diana's servers mail servers that does
all of that crap stuff award cost for

269
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,470
kiya files of all that

270
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,319
and i get my meta data out of the
sponsored rebel video files

271
00:13:25,319 --> 00:13:27,979
spreadsheet bios although i would do
better than that

272
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,730
indicated you should be inside that draw
solimene intervention

273
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:35,319
but the company's circuses firstname dot
lastname

274
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:38,199
last name dot first letter whatever the
case may be

275
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,500
so i can start figuring out how must set
up more efficient in terms of the

276
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,690
company

277
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:48,260
began but i also like to use half-time
larger damon larger inducements is more

278
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,060
to go

279
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,229
so religious partner you know

280
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,980
how was organization works in
relationships between other companies

281
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,079
trust relationships between countries

282
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,079
latinos awesome for that

283
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,699
other things are so you guys to come a
long time

284
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:07,628
i've got a closer look for globalsources
overboard

285
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:12,009
no i no longer do something about the
middle of rabin's will be individual

286
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:14,399
customer redo impulsive report for them

287
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,830
off the top

288
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,040
so as soon as we have our first national
level conference call

289
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,890
within two week we do a dose of report

290
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,470
everything that we can to and from our
public free resources

291
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:28,540
we've put together tackling a baseball
bat

292
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,380
and get back to the customer

293
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,449
and the baseball bat we have another
call

294
00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:36,319
to see if the customer still wants us to
say

295
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,450
ammunition stroke that we call to
discuss

296
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,649
after months of the started doing this

297
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:43,350
strokes started changing

298
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:48,440
apartment called me list while we want
to assess the streets of incidents over

299
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,230
here

300
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,299
so that's great

301
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:53,420
of the city of sample document livable
no support

302
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,748
but it also report mapped out alright
clearances mcdonnell golden's

303
00:14:57,749 --> 00:15:01,600
abducting the new hires were in a
retractable through face book them like

304
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,789
devin fearful people that we liberated
from the organization

305
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:06,509
somebody of that report

306
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:10,390
it with a way for we came back and said
okay we'll talk about the stroke

307
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,720
and let you go after these larger
network blocks

308
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,190
uh... fermion finding that's more
treatment courage in the rest of you

309
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,340
do that

310
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,370
gently we sit around and we talked all
this shit about what competition

311
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,560
thinking about right

312
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,109
why don't we put that in our reports

313
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,850
off the top

314
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:34,260
does that mean you're going to have
something new customers

315
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,119
right there is still good habits more
customers

316
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:41,560
but it's in the name of the opposition
remark trucking company

317
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,250
i remember i come home from and he's
going to do that so that right you

318
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:49,870
cannot bomb flexure

319
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,960
just

320
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,430
distributions from a statement of work

321
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,339
and recycle chong

322
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:59,420
they just don't know what some
thunderstorms

323
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,870
do you know what your p_c_r_ might

324
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,630
i wanted to ask you said

325
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,240
height

326
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,860
how far too long and short for risk
comes so like

327
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,490
overwhelmed you can see that

328
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:22,120
endure a multi-billion dollar company it

329
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,550
first

330
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,270
particularly with book

331
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:31,030
co-hosted subsequent works

332
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:34,000
first list soon

333
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,350
cover structural work among wasn't it

334
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:42,230
shares what real contest that was like
we give your network for can be done

335
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,639
vs

336
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:47,630
over ability assessment more ability
verification

337
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:52,660
houston settlements floyd which russia
also based on what scanner cells

338
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,400
if that's what you want mine

339
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,230
the marketing is something that says you
have exhausted before opening treasure

340
00:16:59,230 --> 00:16:59,839
chest

341
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,880
and put the onus dot com

342
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,130
because if

343
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:06,400
if they want steveomonkey working with
is that i've really been learning that

344
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,299
the woman who for a good work

345
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:10,819
and it would you prefer appearance he
markets

346
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:13,119
who have learned that

347
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,729
put that back from a customer let him
know

348
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,990
webmaster marty's farmer who the fuck
you have before

349
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,609
who just came out wearing glasses
recorded on reports of your network

350
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:24,438
sucks

351
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:28,539
religion the report says remember such
form when you read it would

352
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:33,490
instruments in back matter pastor what
when hymie

353
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,770
done

354
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:39,850
alright so mexican identify low balances
but look forward to a lot of really

355
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:44,350
large organizations the biggest begining
to figure out exhibition kilo balance in

356
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,469
a recent c_n_n_ slowed down sped

357
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:51,680
we come up with firefox live h_t_t_p_
hatteras absolutely my favorite all for

358
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,360
this

359
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,629
you can't really make a shitty p request
of the server

360
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,940
and look application if you had a
response

361
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,960
and you'll see this as big a piece of
the below its record collection

362
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,440
you can see that something was actually
modifying your session

363
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,269
and uh... you know he was a little
bouncer in place

364
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:13,210
because of the with the document to see
the company dot com and you'll see if

365
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:18,150
there's multiple addresses resolved into
the same i_q_

366
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,510
little on the other thing that's really
cool a lot of guys disregard status

367
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,040
within that correct

368
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,870
no looking back at the time sometimes
and say such a disaster where

369
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,449
at five p guide team

370
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,179
whatever the taste the sweetest or
simpletech

371
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:34,910
so here's what they happen now we know
that there's a load balancer let's admit

372
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:38,049
it would start testing with the below
bouncer has an application security

373
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:39,020
model

374
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,129
or some sort of integrated web
application firewall will start

375
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:45,710
jumping on the right way

376
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:47,049
art soul

377
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:48,410
uh...

378
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,340
what's good for our guests number we got
the whole

379
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,480
load balancer thing i think the best
thing that will start thinking about his

380
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,970
what's up with our guests

381
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,140
a lot of customers to fly psns

382
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,210
so things that i looked for is

383
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,600
is the idea is to listen to your recent
packet was a kind of like my address

384
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,800
progress

385
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,190
coral

386
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,780
along a little command-line tools
article head i like what his command

387
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,680
line the streets objectives there

388
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,740
however

389
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,440
if you want to do some tax please
realize

390
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,629
but dot gov slash dot gov slash
twin-engine system thirty two c ado dot

391
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:24,490
net c

392
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,470
hasn't worked since she's marketers

393
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,860
i'm just making sure all of the
situation

394
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,520
this is not a real attack

395
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,929
we're trying to see if the firewall

396
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:38,169
or the party yes

397
00:19:38,169 --> 00:19:40,340
blocks are active

398
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,909
that's all we won't need to know

399
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:47,110
is there something there that's going to
actively investment tax

400
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,330
so you know this

401
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:53,659
i didn't say hayward or fire at missus
scams public externalclass t

402
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,390
no we're going to go through google
simple comparison really quick a strong

403
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:00,210
objections are piles of stuff that gets
the show

404
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,620
notes that was super slowdowns

405
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,949
that's cool to see if there's intrusion
prevention systems in place

406
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,730
jet because if i quit

407
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,809
for the jugular quick thing didn't work
with local

408
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:14,570
we need to start figuring out what their
criticism of the missiles

409
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:16,500
before we start standing

410
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,390
there's no point bernie insured reader

411
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,290
houston people's public

412
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:23,710
public eyepiece places only to find out
that the load balancer

413
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:27,120
have an intrusion prevention system or
whether official firewall or something

414
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,600
like that that's the first few no
results

415
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,800
so hurry up and restore perform a couple
of years ago

416
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,990
efficient inspector developer kits of
our pocketbook district that's marked up

417
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,330
so it turns out to me it's a potted
plants as this wednesday

418
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:44,300
what's what's been going to come up to
me was like a chart of various elements

419
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,560
kevin's

420
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,129
subit

421
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,280
it seems like every time a scandal

422
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,070
which the post office

423
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,980
public override

424
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,799
to transfer load balancing

425
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,020
and it's like

426
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,029
but after us

427
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:03,150
doubleclick

428
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:09,510
just respond to what about some of the
branch of bank manager asks host

429
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,210
so names of those days are soldier

430
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,420
religion to see if we can get blocked

431
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,100
there's a company called pure passion
dot com responses that chemical tools

432
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,129
route for tumors

433
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,980
how acted for protection

434
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,350
essentially what it does it takes eighty
one difference more virus signatures

435
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:30,409
and just the regular expression of the
attack itself is not the real time

436
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:33,880
sotelo projects probably attack the
footprints of a packet

437
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,020
and that's what sets of a target for us

438
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,679
and a test to see if you get a research
project

439
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:40,670
interactive just walked

440
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:44,370
so what did you follow that up the
controversial mission so that's one of

441
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:48,600
the interactions eliminates a lot of
proxy so i'll do that

442
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:53,260
from all these different appeared just
to start trying to make them out

443
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,220
if their use of the ninety s and ideas

444
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,400
and and what types of things that she
did

445
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,010
the other thing that we will start to
lose most are measured response time

446
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,510
if they have an intrusion detection and
security operations center

447
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:09,690
they're not didn't want to let you know
what someone else is fine

448
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,889
and then walk what we want news once
worked for me but what times of what

449
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:16,879
types of attacks that have much time to
walk

450
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,070
so when you start seeing the security
operations center generally have a

451
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,629
forty-five minutes channel our window

452
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,749
between the time that you actually want
to legitimate attack

453
00:22:25,749 --> 00:22:28,779
and when you have his blog post
something is about the customer should

454
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:29,479
know

455
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:33,320
we'll cut obviously is the customers i
think that's what it looks like

456
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:38,470
praising the lord to burn response under
seventy one minutes

457
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,330
thank you

458
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,480
walkable protesters do it

459
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,990
this is an important day about how the
security operations center

460
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:51,770
that latin america correspondence heart
from him

461
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,110
it only took me five parties to burn of
jimmy blocks of

462
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:59,620
figure out how long it takes you to
respond and actually block

463
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,429
this a big deal

464
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:06,750
this is just like to me what geese
aren't a lot of it

465
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:13,059
that's that's a big help the kids are
appreciated your efforts that

466
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:17,850
strong wing at the moment on more ideas
ideal stuff makes me wonder robinson was

467
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,370
reminds her extra money uncontested

468
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:24,399
less than ten percent of companies
actually deployed actually s

469
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,870
interactive mode

470
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:30,479
special tax we have no idea is that
there's some important

471
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,260
actively filtering traffic

472
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,730
but somewhat less than ten percent of an
organization some test

473
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,200
less than ten percent of those people

474
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,000
who actually have it actively market
attacks

475
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,530
actually deeper cuts herself prior to a
passing the idea

476
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:50,350
stall that's our next guest that we do

477
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:56,199
so i'll just use extended the has set up
a alma last self-rule push on traffic

478
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,760
through doesn't sell

479
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,840
suits market

480
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:03,909
seriously export for one linemen just
returned from what some people

481
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,610
and you said that she

482
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,240
soldiers one-liner pushes all traffic
through all the necessary alter the

483
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,150
target

484
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,059
initiative as soon as we do that

485
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:15,750
we run but i think the detection of the
starter quickly see that most people

486
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:17,480
effect happen yes

487
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,830
are not actively faltering traffic
that's a password information

488
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:24,949
they don't have the best selling solo
reversal proxy

489
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:28,210
or there are just as a man one of the
network in such a way

490
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,399
but the traffickers to protect our past
and i guess

491
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:34,320
so it's one of those things i don't know
why the hell you bought it for my

492
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,428
connection figure to actually look at
all of your traffic coming in

493
00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:45,350
the right next to his intentions for
hardcore forgot what slow

494
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,179
whitehead

495
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,560
what else is right

496
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,889
so i don't think for quite a bit one of
these things reasons why i do this

497
00:24:52,889 --> 00:24:57,359
is because i'm a firm believer in your
customers should be blocking for

498
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:58,720
excellence

499
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,719
customers think it was the force of over
two years

500
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:04,859
their mission we want to members of the
day we update it would be about your

501
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:06,270
firewall block walls

502
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:10,080
generally people do not have legitimate
reasons for connected through four to

503
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:17,080
access your corporate website

504
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:22,120
to me is just one of those things that
specialist of the item numbers it should

505
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,899
be easy to give we should be more often

506
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,860
so thin

507
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,909
and one of these things back to me it's
just like quiet like oh my god attackers

508
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,450
come and ritual

509
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:34,330
could you could be blocked in for
excellence through about half of the

510
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:36,070
park

511
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,780
okay

512
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,389
on both ends of proxies

513
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:41,520
their time sometimes approximate start
out there

514
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,519
that people could do it online

515
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:49,180
evidence there was a lot of work
conservatives about

516
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,679
i don't see why you wouldn't

517
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,909
you know the doctors who co-wrote harley
is hardly a list for sale

518
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:58,850
political little descended from concepts

519
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,350
sold in my opinion i think these are the
things that you should be aggressively

520
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,389
update

521
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:07,280
kit so houston that uh... it's really
easy to do something that was the

522
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,479
parties and go through politicians

523
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:12,929
and push-pull rituals m advances all of
them

524
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:15,450
through susan our system

525
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,670
works great

526
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:20,250
at another thing that's going to see a
lot of has really are upon us we're

527
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,440
called like proxies

528
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,980
at the white boxes that one hallelujah
often awesome

529
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,900
that you've got these p_h_p_ bass vox is
a lot of all blacked out as c_e_o_ guys

530
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,980
to do

531
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,149
to balance of four traffic from
whatsoever to another

532
00:26:35,149 --> 00:26:38,879
interest flack usually boxes out there
so they're not running socks on the

533
00:26:38,879 --> 00:26:41,439
ground work for peace treaty between
proxies

534
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,280
actually p_h_p_ proxies

535
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,320
so these are absolutely wonderful
balancing your traffickers

536
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,200
most guys that they're really upon at
that just market forex at nordstrom up

537
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,870
walking lightboxes

538
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:57,418
suboptimal webster give yourself some
good list of life proxies

539
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:00,190
because i'm telling you on from
interaction with these

540
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,009
from a much faster than for

541
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:06,500
absolutely beautiful

542
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:12,250
i'm talking with the last three years
you see the huge objective way

543
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:15,800
all right next name globally distributed
vpos for those of you who are plans

544
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,490
custer's

545
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:19,380
all other things we wanted to see
whether the customer makes the spanish

546
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,860
argues that we're going to be attacking
from

547
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:28,229
and of course i follow that

548
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,570
growing return

549
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:33,740
shop

550
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,180
a lot of the e_p_a_'s services are
flat-out awesome generally there

551
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:40,650
somewhere between five and fifteen
dollars a month

552
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,729
uh... most of them will allow you to be
a little money order

553
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:47,149
slips from the paper progressive camilla
money order

554
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:50,790
with you you know after a similar email
your cuts right back to you

555
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,259
remembered review

556
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:55,970
general a host of at six twenty or
thirty sites globally

557
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:58,860
which is about to open the p m
connection through

558
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,899
showdown just that they don't want to
make sure that my traffic is coming from

559
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:06,740
canada ok we change the mission of the
tropics come into germany events of past

560
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:11,030
if you have spoken bpm connections
really really good

561
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,840
so for me what what are your sister

562
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,689
policy

563
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:19,940
these unions managed respectful of other
ones out there

564
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,879
also we would do if you want me to
travel to a lot of countries where they

565
00:28:22,879 --> 00:28:24,520
have a lot of restrictions on

566
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,120
what size twelve sergeant-at-arms room

567
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,250
absolutely beautiful

568
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,990
all right so i mean forgetting something

569
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:34,980
and what we're forgetting his web
application firewalls

570
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,940
until our retail patrician faster than
the last couple of years

571
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:41,440
locals like knee-deep in peacetime

572
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,320
and uh...

573
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,360
the p_c_r_ counseling center that was
something wrong with this

574
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,080
really brilliant concepts for the septic
tank rounds

575
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,010
astrologer to cross a scripted or any of
these web application or abilities

576
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,190
you can fix the source code

577
00:28:55,190 --> 00:29:02,000
or you can borrow one afternoon i would
consider p_c_r_ compliant

578
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,559
mistaken but in the job

579
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,760
that's great

580
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,099
uh... excel

581
00:29:07,099 --> 00:29:08,279
akshaya

582
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:12,690
personal interaction process services or
massage or wounded

583
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:15,130
i could fix it

584
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,409
wondered why why

585
00:29:17,409 --> 00:29:18,740
except by the way

586
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,390
except by a white house

587
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,490
what is that most of our customers shoes

588
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,320
led by the way

589
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:30,178
ourselves as that one of which is
impulses just like listed below balances

590
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:34,129
use live h_t_t_p_ headers and see if
there's any modification

591
00:29:34,129 --> 00:29:36,100
in the h_t_t_p_ had a response

592
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,309
so what you do as you said the good
request

593
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:42,149
and in some across unscripted request
for a strong objection request

594
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:45,990
you see that the issue given her
responses are different

595
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:49,559
substantial before force of up to two
five one six hundred

596
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:53,649
connections to protect which charging
those third differences

597
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,960
you were able to serve a response back

598
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,760
between good an attack tax returns

599
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,779
reflecting about web application
firewalls

600
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:08,580
the camera dont you actually think that
that uh... all this research on district

601
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,840
school charts graphs would come up
against it

602
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,870
impatiently any of these things that you
sent to live in a mess is itself a

603
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:18,010
quality sematech

604
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,480
dan

605
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,370
apple application firewall immunological

606
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:26,239
that she was so personal

607
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,160
stuff that's

608
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,799
so it was saying that you know if you
make a request for cmd are here to see

609
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,809
you again see that he received a notice
that this change instead of a given your

610
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:37,990
four oh four

611
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,759
you know file not found that we could
use some other type of error prone to

612
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:44,870
know immediately identified republican
celebre personal firewall

613
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:48,689
so myself in a couple of other guys we
started with interpreting these

614
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:50,589
different firewall responses

615
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:54,448
so that we could come up with the way of
determining what for a while we were up

616
00:30:54,449 --> 00:30:56,679
against it if the firewalls women

617
00:30:56,679 --> 00:30:58,869
uh... default or custom was that

618
00:30:58,869 --> 00:31:01,740
and that's really become a tragedy
penetration testing

619
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,510
so you've got a lot of things like
apache ma security visual viable one

620
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:06,369
method

621
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:08,090
method not implemented

622
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,110
uh...

623
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:13,560
when god gives you a lot of a record
triple my my mind

624
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,030
not happen

625
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:19,780
but recommend other washington two oh
two hundred okay what the biology of

626
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,690
mutual wrote a message intercepted like
this

627
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:23,969
condition and effective

628
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:26,589
so that's one of the tricks that they
were doing what application firewall

629
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:29,360
sports modify what application firewall

630
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,889
before we leave it at the website but
that's the only one of the girls

631
00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:37,159
what info do methods doesn't want
obligation for what actually understand

632
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,620
but the backyard

633
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:43,039
understands so we systematically go
through this you start to see ok

634
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,510
your disability strategy and unity

635
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:48,089
and in this case the web application for
a while

636
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:51,320
understands that it's a prosecutor
kenneth starr alert

637
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,908
excess that's looks the most american

638
00:31:53,909 --> 00:31:57,430
but we need to figure out what it
missions

639
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:01,170
sold one of the lives on through the
cables tool called wahoo for them and

640
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:04,180
jumped on this project because it's
written in my beautiful language that is

641
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,370
by far

642
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,709
catalysts for them

643
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,679
surface track right now

644
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:10,539
i left my phone

645
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:14,059
if you don't love python you can kiss my
ass

646
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:15,440
i left my phone

647
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,940
control this project is written in
python therefore it is my opinion a good

648
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,110
project

649
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:23,629
so i think that haven't sold

650
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:28,190
soldier grandparents are contributing
signatures you perceive that what you're

651
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:31,289
going to fight suggests that works out
dot com

652
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:35,539
then we started one after watching lots
of places so basically every website

653
00:32:35,539 --> 00:32:38,609
of the actual vendor generally was
running the house what opposition

654
00:32:38,609 --> 00:32:40,820
firewalls should serve as a free press
for

655
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,830
a good start of the fingerprint in that
after that or or individual address

656
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,120
we verified that the signatures to work

657
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,409
so this is the public troops available
while roof

658
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:54,409
uh... which actually thus far what our
position for a while identification

659
00:32:54,409 --> 00:32:57,620
were working on right now so can
caldwell on

660
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,459
the premise of obscene use that word
obligation for what should we do not

661
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,270
want to write the address

662
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,639
and stop the uh... was chart

663
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,309
targeted to hit you up

664
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:10,519
a reset or two hundred share something
like that

665
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:12,820
further generally don't like your i_q_
tests

666
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:17,429
so if they don't want to try to address
the battle last up to three fours

667
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:20,970
essentially what we're doing this book
and his master files databases

668
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:24,539
supreme for small the different while
products of several walking or the

669
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:25,390
addresses

670
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:28,380
overburdened foursome with all the
different prototypes yumiko

671
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,230
would you just have a new jersey

672
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:35,830
v_-chip sixteen tax three sixty four and
then multiple informations all the

673
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:36,879
various

674
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,970
attacks themselves so it may be the
first few letters or base sixty four the

675
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,599
next few months our heads

676
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:46,649
the next few letters or you just seven
have been putting all of us together to

677
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,520
figure out what these while actually
does

678
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,179
for defended that gets the deferment
whatever happens i will tell you this

679
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:55,980
overwhelming majority of last stop

680
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:59,140
at hempling multiple insulin facts
together

681
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:05,010
sources you can recall some of what the
web application firewalls u

682
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,059
immediately

683
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:08,179
that support groups he says

684
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:12,129
so now you're just going to use payloads
that bypass this well

685
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:15,839
so aldrich america strong judging
process for democrats are going back to

686
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:16,938
business

687
00:34:16,938 --> 00:34:18,918
fare so well spent

688
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:22,348
and that was the last technology right
now

689
00:34:22,349 --> 00:34:26,439
okay jeremy steele has got a really good
yumiko script is written it will be but

690
00:34:26,438 --> 00:34:30,469
i won't hold that against them sexually
restricted c_n_n_ program different

691
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,129
attacks and yumiko

692
00:34:32,129 --> 00:34:36,199
this one was intense

693
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,649
because there's a purple

694
00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:41,438
so yeah i think this was a burger were
one of my woodbridge virginia two could

695
00:34:41,438 --> 00:34:44,248
be wrong to do

696
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:47,549
uh... recovered tapped for

697
00:34:47,549 --> 00:34:51,018
hello temperatures will be there

698
00:34:51,018 --> 00:34:55,758
there were productive before so far so
what about the start

699
00:34:55,759 --> 00:34:59,829
alcohol review

700
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:04,269
blood i think it's probably the worst of
all his fault clinton i think the

701
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:08,359
nation's flat-out horrible

702
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:11,429
do you have been consoles for prosecutor

703
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:13,819
just full console

704
00:35:13,819 --> 00:35:19,029
as for process for conservative block
dot there dot regional or struggles

705
00:35:19,029 --> 00:35:20,919
tended to be good

706
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:25,199
when it actually attacking it but the
imbalances itself all over the straight

707
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:28,950
but don't they know what was in danger
of the trial process critic

708
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:33,330
soldiers with their process for
financial instruments report that

709
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,049
success

710
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,770
and in terms of the semester graham it's
long

711
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,949
european block in newark

712
00:35:38,949 --> 00:35:39,790
so

713
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,509
you'd like to request

714
00:35:41,509 --> 00:35:45,709
but advanced jacked up is that has some
really simple install injection

715
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:46,589
signatures

716
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:50,690
so you know soon if you don't do it in
sql injection with the or one in select

717
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,019
user

718
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:56,689
events and blocked it there's no
financial transfers lol

719
00:35:56,689 --> 00:35:58,899
photographic evidence

720
00:35:58,899 --> 00:36:01,368
walked by buyer

721
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:02,859
chaal

722
00:36:02,859 --> 00:36:07,130
a sense of their call for select
apparition it blocks that

723
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:11,479
so this special symbols of the request
is blocked a massive you can do what sql

724
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:13,799
injection which you are looking for a
good start

725
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:17,569
or would not use discussion some weird
outside and purposes

726
00:36:17,569 --> 00:36:20,589
you've got a lot more about this product

727
00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:23,699
as some of those noticed there were
blocking the adverse recall that's what

728
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:27,109
actually probably the electrode
underwater apart again

729
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:31,239
pretty much everything from you know if
you walked right by the state except for

730
00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:33,390
one last week admin password

731
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:40,390
for some reason i didn't even program at
all

732
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:44,670
and then in a cut-off levels a lot of
psychiatrists or

733
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:48,049
fortune barbuda actually admin password

734
00:36:48,049 --> 00:36:51,019
well first of march

735
00:36:51,019 --> 00:36:55,788
and that's the one application for r_u_
you've got to mention it

736
00:36:55,789 --> 00:36:59,430
the funny thing about this is the first
of all sorts of disruption conferences

737
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,618
are sort of shortness of other
conferences

738
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:06,439
all these otherwise benders usually home
it would be lovely contacted me

739
00:37:06,439 --> 00:37:10,430
regions like johnny on the spot where
martin clickajob jumper handelman

740
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:13,328
benjamin soldiering on

741
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:16,349
really going to have some attacks
against the couple about his marbles

742
00:37:16,349 --> 00:37:17,479
mumble

743
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:22,109
uncover their own sparked some of the
ritujain installed sir

744
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:27,579
everybody also probably the most
entrepreneurs part of what the problem

745
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,409
start i don't know

746
00:37:29,409 --> 00:37:33,289
so i've noticed in the very next
capturing these benefits that you had

747
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:38,549
ruptured but they didn't fix in the
other incumbents

748
00:37:38,549 --> 00:37:40,200
curriculum

749
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,428
all right so over the next one

750
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:46,309
so i think the best we do is nothing we
can figure out how to get them to log

751
00:37:46,309 --> 00:37:49,599
onto the web the significance of the way
of from about

752
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,709
so things that i absolutely love
astrologer is finishes next

753
00:37:54,709 --> 00:37:57,269
it's written in perl remarkable that
against them

754
00:37:57,269 --> 00:37:59,178
instructables

755
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:03,699
so influential allowed to be used for at
least one method for stronger action to

756
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:05,269
upload madcap

757
00:38:05,269 --> 00:38:08,328
you must follow or do you believe
interpreter

758
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:09,940
hallelujah

759
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:14,390
so it's great for doing a show uh... ask
you about how does the same thing with

760
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,299
that the school lunch shelter etc

761
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,609
haven't gotten interpreter upload so it
just makes it active web applications

762
00:38:20,609 --> 00:38:23,288
beautiful if they have art

763
00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:25,609
stairs history that matters

764
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:31,199
of areas another one reference to act
must lines that's for p_h_p_

765
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:34,109
reminds showbiz side substantially
upload

766
00:38:34,109 --> 00:38:36,549
uh... living space command shell

767
00:38:36,549 --> 00:38:39,279
worldwide picture

768
00:38:39,279 --> 00:38:43,690
when i get down here along with the
department guys lotsa obviously good

769
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,059
still needs a little bit of work

770
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:49,230
overruled already for production contest
on facebook but

771
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:53,749
for the first thrift concept that's
reason was enormous lines

772
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:56,660
it's the guys from our security
assessment dot com

773
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:00,509
the world's wrote four i want to couple
simple

774
00:39:00,509 --> 00:39:03,039
except for personal stuff going on

775
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:06,099
dot

776
00:39:06,099 --> 00:39:09,150
i think a big deal known as we need to
talk tomorrow

777
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:13,070
for weekdays partners signatures
responsible after

778
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:16,839
and and i want to go out forms tensions
but

779
00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:18,890
just shorten its

780
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:23,169
how many of you think the tigers park

781
00:39:23,169 --> 00:39:24,808
it's just me

782
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:28,779
at this point make sure i get this case
because the probability of their

783
00:39:28,779 --> 00:39:32,720
actually will be a little closer as i
walked the dog just in general a

784
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,828
billionaire life like for you

785
00:39:34,829 --> 00:39:40,349
set up a bit of a printout there's
probably a bit but what

786
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:44,800
concerned about the whole sharma
unspeakable just

787
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,390
have you ever go through the start

788
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:49,569
i want to some of those of us on some of
them

789
00:39:49,569 --> 00:39:52,808
adaptation she's a billionaire like work

790
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:57,430
recapping what aware as we talked
earlier we're going to work hard to goes

791
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,158
on

792
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:00,679
because she's a little earlier

793
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:01,819
trench

794
00:40:01,819 --> 00:40:04,329
anyways lets talk about the church

795
00:40:04,329 --> 00:40:07,329
sorry about that uh... college students

796
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:11,089
alright wall that is our intention to
our customers

797
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:14,130
will try to stop attacks web
applications have complied

798
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:16,440
one step closer to normal that that is

799
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,129
horribly insecure

800
00:40:18,129 --> 00:40:22,330
identified sql injection across expected
an attempt to fix it

801
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:25,229
worthless actual like javascript
vbscript

802
00:40:25,229 --> 00:40:26,538
that's wrong

803
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:27,919
that is wrong

804
00:40:27,919 --> 00:40:29,179
strong

805
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:31,519
that wrong

806
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:35,640
so it shouldn't live has tripled in
simple terms so so all

807
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:42,259
webpage methodically usual proxy a
bypass supported packaging

808
00:40:42,259 --> 00:40:45,619
alright thanks karen and she was
restricted blacklist instilled in order

809
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:49,459
to a lot of this would be able to say
well i'll filter out special characters

810
00:40:49,459 --> 00:40:52,770
wall-mounted use less the same greater
than some people's signer

811
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:55,600
anything like that so the chances when
he was one anymore

812
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,749
began to someone like one

813
00:40:58,749 --> 00:41:01,529
but it was a political weapon

814
00:41:01,529 --> 00:41:03,719
skylight at night

815
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:05,519
done

816
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:08,629
so long ago realize that he wanted to

817
00:41:08,629 --> 00:41:12,979
specifically astro injection aeronautics
process for kidney can be done without

818
00:41:12,979 --> 00:41:14,649
the use of special characters

819
00:41:14,649 --> 00:41:18,509
so that's a huge that we've got to
developers understand you can't just got

820
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,760
what we just started my chest

821
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:23,069
innovative use of special characters

822
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:27,009
there and then lastly looks upon
signature based i guess

823
00:41:27,009 --> 00:41:30,519
now enhancements that there is maria

824
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:32,919
bumped up my life that's just me

825
00:41:32,919 --> 00:41:36,710
i don't know what i would just love my
computer because the couple you all

826
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:38,529
and high schools are bordering

827
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:41,849
character you have never heard her
stressful

828
00:41:41,849 --> 00:41:47,119
general moscow that has your conversion
from bethlehem stochastic char

829
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,309
because we all need this right

830
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:53,879
numbers also look at your door where
that box that require someone who knows

831
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:55,549
what it's like fifteen years

832
00:41:55,549 --> 00:41:58,629
i don't know if you could be a nasty

833
00:41:58,629 --> 00:42:00,509
mikasa

834
00:42:00,509 --> 00:42:01,839
does however

835
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:04,009
sounds like you to do that dot org

836
00:42:04,009 --> 00:42:10,589
fucking bad ass to get the whole detroit
free press interim announcement

837
00:42:10,589 --> 00:42:16,259
presidential established market along
and we're all rooms for

838
00:42:16,259 --> 00:42:19,800
fusion he he he i think he's lost the
first materials

839
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:25,559
and it is also accused or more
importantly web servers orange works

840
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:29,790
you notice about the triple total two
forty three and or one who is one dash

841
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:30,819
dash

842
00:42:30,819 --> 00:42:35,639
bypassing the signatures for horribly
difficult right

843
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:39,109
commend them for possible right

844
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:41,549
tells you what you want to reconsider

845
00:42:41,549 --> 00:42:45,679
and stuff like this one to bypass the
sports editor right

846
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:48,279
or one is less than two

847
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:51,229
so bypass the signature

848
00:42:51,229 --> 00:42:54,479
well i think that we have a surprise
these people actually take the time to

849
00:42:54,479 --> 00:42:58,319
actually be a good idea signatures on a
horrible misfortune of being an

850
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:00,660
intrusion analyst for a few years of my
life

851
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:04,640
remember that you could mean across
securities because so much

852
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,160
as well have actually write idea
signatures

853
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,339
and look at how horrible better idea of
signatures actually or

854
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:15,430
and i think that's really what currently
exists in this false sense of security

855
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:18,138
community action went on to

856
00:43:18,139 --> 00:43:20,290
or work security vendor

857
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:22,189
but sells security product

858
00:43:22,189 --> 00:43:25,138
illegal over there and you don't have a
dozen

859
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:27,509
all true

860
00:43:27,509 --> 00:43:33,219
there waiting for it to be this massive
research organization in its two of them

861
00:43:33,219 --> 00:43:36,849
no i don't usually don't have the
financial returns with a list of

862
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:41,609
correlational what exhume return

863
00:43:41,609 --> 00:43:45,480
that they would you go back to the
corporate environments the streamlined

864
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,669
mobile home parks and reduce that's

865
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:54,519
have hundreds of people continue to
research and stuff

866
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:59,218
yahoo restrictions on what the truth
market mostly guys

867
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:04,679
notebooks about solvent don't think
that's all of them

868
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:07,969
holds over there

869
00:44:07,969 --> 00:44:11,249
uh... that a lot of security because of
the work that one part due to the

870
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:14,948
following true pocket groups the hope
that uh... the readings and went to a

871
00:44:14,949 --> 00:44:18,869
guy like a i make sure that you are
interested

872
00:44:18,869 --> 00:44:21,929
that's why i didn't know if it's two
months

873
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:25,869
the bottles to harm realism towards

874
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:27,729
truce

875
00:44:27,729 --> 00:44:31,519
right so we seem to have the strength of
the signatures of these traditionally

876
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:33,859
jews were great for automated tools

877
00:44:33,859 --> 00:44:38,009
no one really wants to order the lives
of ordinary stereo self service in my

878
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:39,440
opinion about it as

879
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,719
i think i guess that's horrible

880
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:42,510
i think

881
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:44,159
it's a waste of time

882
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:49,449
do relinquishing the issued in people
who understand network traffic

883
00:44:49,449 --> 00:44:53,769
even if you want to spend your
environment said the institute for

884
00:44:53,769 --> 00:44:56,850
responsible elections literally carol

885
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:02,098
so much more people came into the hearts
of men who look what they're doing

886
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:06,090
it can be one of them despite
environmentally friendly people

887
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:10,070
uh... institute one thousand dollars
rockstar implementation if i get one

888
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:14,499
part of the midwife sharpshooter do it

889
00:45:14,499 --> 00:45:18,218
so is right his rival march got his
right probably remember thanks for

890
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:20,469
setting up for us

891
00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:24,559
full we start with domestic partner
traffic signatures or stand with you dot

892
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:29,800
bmp or one teach one he said he's sorry
bro compatible regular expressions

893
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,399
it's either by passing these ideas
signatures are trivial as well

894
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,520
was restored order to you soon

895
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,859
with this person said to

896
00:45:38,859 --> 00:45:40,169
uh... p dot

897
00:45:40,169 --> 00:45:43,808
the person sensitive person said judy
considered over here in the bypass

898
00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:44,819
techniques

899
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:46,770
and you can see them all at once

900
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:49,249
which is the best dash income tax

901
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:52,638
and we don't even need to improve the
entire attached re impacts

902
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:57,039
or be sixty forgiving for to work just
fragments of it

903
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:01,379
because they haven't fragments of it
because the entire signature

904
00:46:01,379 --> 00:46:05,219
it's usually was about to start to see
the problem

905
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:09,769
we need to just understand the all these
devices armaments instructed and

906
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:12,169
providers

907
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:14,729
but not in stock real characters

908
00:46:14,729 --> 00:46:16,629
real hackers have time

909
00:46:16,629 --> 00:46:19,538
real hackers read ideas pictures

910
00:46:19,539 --> 00:46:23,089
they're not midsummer grilled burgers i
think we gotta get past that

911
00:46:23,089 --> 00:46:25,328
i'm no i'm probably going to go over but

912
00:46:25,329 --> 00:46:28,049
yes i think about some concern

913
00:46:28,049 --> 00:46:31,629
performance problem

914
00:46:31,629 --> 00:46:36,249
also going through some

915
00:46:36,249 --> 00:46:43,118
terrorism

916
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,119
i was going through some stuff m

917
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:46,239
found

918
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:53,239
our strongest for web web application
for a long

919
00:46:53,479 --> 00:46:54,299
and much like today

920
00:46:54,299 --> 00:47:00,159
workable for

921
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:02,589
ourselves or storage

922
00:47:02,589 --> 00:47:08,969
brochure

923
00:47:08,969 --> 00:47:10,499
all right so

924
00:47:10,499 --> 00:47:13,718
fool in love this and i just thank you
dr

925
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:18,140
yours practical sisters

926
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:22,249
all right so here's the what makes that
its configuration file

927
00:47:22,249 --> 00:47:29,249
that comes up with all of their
signatures for women

928
00:47:29,859 --> 00:47:30,980
potential

929
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:37,980
our first thing that we won't notice

930
00:47:39,339 --> 00:47:42,749
these ones in the default exclude file

931
00:47:42,749 --> 00:47:45,569
so beautiful excludes

932
00:47:45,569 --> 00:47:47,349
outlook web access

933
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:50,819
so that's great abroad application for a
walk and as a protective outlook web

934
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:51,829
access

935
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:54,779
cancerous

936
00:47:54,779 --> 00:47:55,490
that's correct

937
00:47:55,490 --> 00:48:02,490
politics is not ready for saturday more
distributor or is that right

938
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:06,329
that's fuckin great okay

939
00:48:06,329 --> 00:48:10,219
not yours the other things a lot of
people with the will hasten does open

940
00:48:10,219 --> 00:48:11,220
stores

941
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,120
more people whilst

942
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,999
so obviously if more people look at the
rules

943
00:48:15,999 --> 00:48:20,220
we see that we have these people allows
for entire ranges

944
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,560
responded almost all about

945
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,489
let's have some sort of sorts right

946
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:29,489
not sure that they don't the ethical
principles then up a new product amanda

947
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:34,889
plum of application for oliver consumes
so many other open source power play

948
00:48:34,889 --> 00:48:38,599
i would never do something like that
what else was some sort of sorts under

949
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:43,649
the apple there is a dynamite thousands
doesn't warm up

950
00:48:43,649 --> 00:48:48,618
upset so notes for me to use this
populist party like task to each other

951
00:48:48,619 --> 00:48:50,970
pop up to the court appointed joint

952
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:55,790
details now from our publication of our
wallets dividend

953
00:48:55,790 --> 00:49:02,790
captured identify patted capitalism

954
00:49:03,309 --> 00:49:05,909
candid

955
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:09,979
like the whole broadcasting markets
we've got to be in traffic coming from

956
00:49:09,979 --> 00:49:12,729
the use of master

957
00:49:12,729 --> 00:49:14,210
let's take a look at that

958
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:18,210
excel more than one product up f rental
application for what we are certain

959
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:19,240
action taken

960
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:22,689
these same rules with its from other
products

961
00:49:22,689 --> 00:49:25,408
deflecting blame

962
00:49:25,409 --> 00:49:28,380
sociocultural and individual senators on

963
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:30,649
default list of commands

964
00:49:30,649 --> 00:49:36,219
that or tonight's down here

965
00:49:36,219 --> 00:49:37,359
so

966
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:41,379
without all these different neuropathy
remarkable litigated ticket to fiji

967
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:45,569
identikit at work and get the best you
can transfer databases

968
00:49:45,569 --> 00:49:49,038
transfer all the stuff logfile that's
that's that's what it is

969
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:52,369
analysts are seven analog inside

970
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:55,130
transferred instructions for
administering

971
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:59,999
yesterday let's talk subject don't do
that to happen right

972
00:49:59,999 --> 00:50:02,160
then

973
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,240
because it's

974
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,428
ras

975
00:50:04,429 --> 00:50:08,549
they've got people allow virtual
directories because you don't do that

976
00:50:08,549 --> 00:50:12,329
you actually break the law

977
00:50:12,329 --> 00:50:13,389
inside

978
00:50:13,389 --> 00:50:16,399
so we've got all these things have been
a drought the harshness possible tax

979
00:50:16,399 --> 00:50:19,118
that the block

980
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,419
we have to allow c colin dot dot dot

981
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:27,558
asleep a laptop dot dot dot dot to allow
scripts you've got to live as well

982
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:29,640
although the stock market risk

983
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,328
if we don't know if that's what's your
question doesn't work

984
00:50:33,329 --> 00:50:37,239
no longer that right that's exactly what
about black product because

985
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:39,629
and there was going to do shipwrecked

986
00:50:39,629 --> 00:50:43,980
so we just don't wanting to try it
actually we didn't

987
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:50,089
did abundant developer smoke crack alamo
offended you agree or disagree

988
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:51,929
swordfish is is just

989
00:50:51,929 --> 00:50:53,299
in ascending

990
00:50:53,299 --> 00:50:57,479
so here we look at the default files
that are denied martin's for publication

991
00:50:57,479 --> 00:51:01,368
firewall he'll start to see the first
things like are targets the

992
00:51:01,369 --> 00:51:02,949
act at new york city

993
00:51:02,949 --> 00:51:05,920
andy betrayal travels

994
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:10,330
checked is cipher now how many of you
are actually deploying new servers

995
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:13,900
generated that looks like actually been
develop the century conservative

996
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,319
estimate

997
00:51:15,319 --> 00:51:16,449
anything like that

998
00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:21,130
but i've noticed that the deficit things
like powerseller wm i_c_u_

999
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:23,420
goods have been all these become
employed tools

1000
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:26,979
none of which are being blocked by web
application for all the research

1001
00:51:26,979 --> 00:51:31,098
on like nine really pattern

1002
00:51:31,099 --> 00:51:36,069
absorb shin fortune

1003
00:51:36,069 --> 00:51:38,558
for all people this is important seven

1004
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,249
camelot

1005
00:51:40,249 --> 00:51:41,209
slow

1006
00:51:41,209 --> 00:51:45,658
if you are webapplications actually
calling local is locally executed the

1007
00:51:45,659 --> 00:51:50,169
stress like w_i_c_ power self reviews
the creation of account management

1008
00:51:50,169 --> 00:51:53,989
database perimeter anything like that
none of our applications do that kind of

1009
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:55,819
stuff right

1010
00:51:55,819 --> 00:51:56,779
across the

1011
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,530
right now and all the time comes that
was going to be restricted from a remote

1012
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:02,049
location far all right

1013
00:52:02,049 --> 00:52:02,829
yet

1014
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:06,460
socialist interests really surprised me
about what people don't put that

1015
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,759
together

1016
00:52:07,759 --> 00:52:11,440
you know what's going to do with another
governments of or

1017
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,260
does anybody actually tried to make sure
that the speed of the mechanisms

1018
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:17,789
fieldwork in my apartment stuff but i'm
running

1019
00:52:17,789 --> 00:52:21,400
or did i just talked about it

1020
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,319
so when i get home

1021
00:52:23,319 --> 00:52:29,288
consequences because carmichael comes
not knowing whether they don't like it

1022
00:52:29,289 --> 00:52:32,979
usually look at what you look at that
point

1023
00:52:32,979 --> 00:52:34,649
so you know what you think

1024
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:38,280
i've got a couple of things that i
really do like a package yet yes i think

1025
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,840
if the ideas for as much as accounts has
happened to it over the last couple of

1026
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,430
years

1027
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:43,580
is a good

1028
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:46,080
good product because they will cast
company

1029
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,769
that put the balls on the tables like
art department up

1030
00:52:49,769 --> 00:52:52,578
so when i was thinking what's called a
small towns

1031
00:52:52,579 --> 00:52:56,479
so what the proposals that you tried in
the process for business transaction any

1032
00:52:56,479 --> 00:52:59,569
type of attack they love it you can
against me

1033
00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:03,319
and i'll show you what of my signatures
catcher

1034
00:53:03,319 --> 00:53:06,709
and if you need my signature within a
couple of days we had about attaching

1035
00:53:06,709 --> 00:53:08,009
the signature of this

1036
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:12,329
that was sort of ours total dot com
self-concept absolutely it's brilliant

1037
00:53:12,329 --> 00:53:16,300
i think more products to do that i think
more security products specifically

1038
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,660
should do that if your security product
i think you're a terrific it was such a

1039
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:20,759
good out there on the web

1040
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,930
if you'd like ripped up you should look
at it like to come up with a number of

1041
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:24,868
them was good

1042
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:27,510
signatures are good reluctant to do it

1043
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:28,899
is good news to share

1044
00:53:28,899 --> 00:53:32,328
throughout europe are contested it you
can be a part of the refugee camps shut

1045
00:53:32,329 --> 00:53:34,169
the fuck up much of this trial

1046
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,118
that's what they should remember should
be

1047
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:38,079
and i'll tell you what out by it

1048
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:42,489
out by uh... recommend classifier i
would have confidence in it

1049
00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:46,360
alike that there are two of them are
security jumped on this bandwagon

1050
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:50,660
mumbai separation of the first estimate
for reshuffling brought me out but we

1051
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:54,140
work with them right barnett was a great
guy

1052
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:58,098
we don't have that they were already
which one works more proof on security

1053
00:53:58,099 --> 00:53:59,430
the government loan

1054
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:02,839
a couple years ago my own security was
probably the worst without official

1055
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:04,779
travel on the market clout

1056
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:09,669
influenced by what you may have read it
and it was all that right

1057
00:54:09,669 --> 00:54:14,629
what they did was actually have a great
one ever barefoot between my securities

1058
00:54:14,629 --> 00:54:18,080
yaris was subsequently serves and used
the ideas

1059
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,799
and they started significantly improve
in the rules tourist attraction to the

1060
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,549
world

1061
00:54:22,549 --> 00:54:25,890
and what i really think people need to
do with the start looking at that

1062
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:30,200
look at home on security can immigrants
northville township inadvertently yes

1063
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,569
really did them and find out all the
things you can do wanted to talk about

1064
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,310
bridge for commercial product

1065
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:39,179
obstructed justice open-source community
you have a lot of options

1066
00:54:39,179 --> 00:54:44,059
some major web application for a world
war

1067
00:54:44,059 --> 00:54:49,579
iraq so introduces us to take the lives
of monster dot org slash demo

1068
00:54:49,579 --> 00:54:54,019
has the same that word one suggested
yesterday on my security rules

1069
00:54:54,019 --> 00:54:57,258
and then you can just keep trying all of
your different levels until you find one

1070
00:54:57,259 --> 00:54:58,670
that does not answer

1071
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,859
so absolutely great for me to that

1072
00:55:01,859 --> 00:55:02,909
incidents

1073
00:55:02,909 --> 00:55:06,729
yesterday's tamanna you know

1074
00:55:06,729 --> 00:55:10,519
soldiers absolutely the best thing out
there i really like where it's going to

1075
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:13,808
every little bit more vendors follow
suit

1076
00:55:13,809 --> 00:55:17,249
you think your security product as
workers should stop for most marketed

1077
00:55:17,249 --> 00:55:17,850
ship

1078
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:20,939
and put you fuck the rules set up

1079
00:55:20,939 --> 00:55:25,359
to me it's put up a shot right date
world source with a christian school

1080
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:27,540
after close source interactive campus

1081
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:31,909
it got him elected generator closers
individuals or worse

1082
00:55:31,909 --> 00:55:36,539
why not do some sort of like a allows
people to attacker website is steve

1083
00:55:36,539 --> 00:55:38,700
yourself as relieved or system

1084
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:42,448
i think it's perfect market and i think
they did the work problem or this

1085
00:55:42,449 --> 00:55:45,019
there's also the driest joke

1086
00:55:45,019 --> 00:55:48,129
jumping into the way a m are pretty much
pretty easy

1087
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:52,789

think this is an excellent ship

1094
00:56:11,139 --> 00:56:17,989
uh... the day that comes up in someone's
clean quickly who used to be buckminster

you part of their s retire from what
what

1096
00:56:21,789 --> 00:56:25,369
so department did open it just comes up
in tells you what i think it will be one

1097
00:56:25,369 --> 00:56:29,149
of the latest revision or call the

1098

00:56:34,929 --> 00:56:38,539
it takes him interpreter ameripros of

1103
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,840
all these cool things

1104
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:44,799
so you don't send terrible functionality
automated function

1105
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,969
on the minutemen

1106
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:48,579
that mirrors urs

1107
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:50,939
who's come transport point

1108
00:56:50,939 --> 00:56:54,719
so the point that i've been working on
over this last year after client who's

1109
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:57,299
been compromise with the transfer system

1110
00:56:57,299 --> 00:57:01,809
when we got out there and start looking
out from our realized

1111
00:57:01,809 --> 00:57:04,829
that's not at this process that that
this process that led to a friend of the

1112
00:57:04,829 --> 00:57:07,599
venture and events

1113
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:11,349
ever start realizing toward easy
d_c_-based intrusions we've looked at

1114
00:57:11,349 --> 00:57:14,849
them with charger realized actual
techniques will really matter

1115
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:16,009
advance

1116
00:57:16,009 --> 00:57:19,220
however this month workers are processed
at the dancer

1117
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:23,129
it looks like like a a big bang theory
is that what the chocolate obtaining

1118
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:30,130
obtaining canada novel could take a
break

1119
00:57:30,469 --> 00:57:34,379
use of the centerpiece of the things
that i think we really wants to do it as

1120
00:57:34,379 --> 00:57:35,299
ancestors

1121
00:57:35,299 --> 00:57:37,759
israelis are replicated by hackers
threat

1122
00:57:37,759 --> 00:57:41,109
and start doing the same days in terms
of lateral movement that these events

1123
00:57:41,109 --> 00:57:42,569
now where do you want

1124
00:57:42,569 --> 00:57:45,270
the same things in terms of modified
public trial

1125
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:47,999
but now we're still in the database
hackers are doing

1126
00:57:47,999 --> 00:57:51,888
so we can get our customer more
representative sample of what it's like

1127
00:57:51,889 --> 00:57:56,599
if we really were to be targeted myself
still hackers

1128
00:57:56,599 --> 00:58:00,829
spot to muscat oman to work and if you
saw them against government to work

1129
00:58:00,829 --> 00:58:04,309
let the customer know that that's where
he is fine

1130
00:58:04,309 --> 00:58:07,149
i don't think it's been out for a
customer who says hey i want to do with

1131
00:58:07,149 --> 00:58:11,859
the relative error probability last went
public with that

1132
00:58:11,859 --> 00:58:15,038
but i do think he needs to know that
that is not the same

1133
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:19,589
azmi actively talking you trying to
exploded out of your book

1134
00:58:19,589 --> 00:58:24,069
is not the same customer needs to
understand that

1135
00:58:24,069 --> 00:58:27,740
so put it into the land-based wind has a
beautiful route patrick

1136
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:32,479
singers abdul-rauf hostages compromise
should consider them at work that way

1137
00:58:32,479 --> 00:58:36,069
and only constructor all the different
things of that have

1138
00:58:36,069 --> 00:58:39,859
uh... i have the miserable misfortune
deployment solutions

1139
00:58:39,859 --> 00:58:44,538
uh... approaches that was supposed to do
with security immigration stuff mostly

1140
00:58:44,539 --> 00:58:45,830
forestry products

1141
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:52,739
souls are entering from the inside was
four point three parts

1142
00:58:52,739 --> 00:58:56,079
you want to talk about pottenger that

1143
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,259
viet radius

1144
00:58:59,259 --> 00:59:00,299
solace site

1145
00:59:00,299 --> 00:59:02,249
being a total of one x

1146
00:59:02,249 --> 00:59:03,698
a part of france

1147
00:59:03,699 --> 00:59:07,679
excalibur extra credit if you see the
bishop mistreated

1148
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:11,699
decided to file cabinets that was
stressing security products

1149
00:59:11,699 --> 00:59:15,349
shellfish i run into a lot of people to
pay all this stuff so let's just go

1150
00:59:15,349 --> 00:59:16,960
through real real quick

1151
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:21,270
uh... legacy p senator interest of
children and leisure time with it

1152
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:24,180
the issue here are reservations or
concerns that you should be strong

1153
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:25,919
flawlessly said like you

1154
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,709
based on a mac address i think that's
going to do an inventory truck stop

1155
00:59:29,709 --> 00:59:32,879
or if you've got really robust action
was walking when you want to make sure

1156
00:59:32,879 --> 00:59:34,000
that you not

1157
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,130
commitments that would be a shitty
that's what the president of the but

1158
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:41,629
don't think that it's security
considerations on that

1159
00:59:41,629 --> 00:59:45,180
sears c chipset

1160
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:49,160
region over the issue with social
support our commanders

1161
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:53,169
it's basically it's basically port
securities big brother

1162
00:59:53,169 --> 00:59:57,489
no support security was signed missile
mac address to the sports and have some

1163
00:59:57,489 --> 00:59:59,290
perspective does it look bigger

1164
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:00,640
so or whatever

1165
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:04,990
it's about what i said i think most
people feel concludes i don't understand

1166
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:08,828
how many adults without one exception so
that i have two men at work

1167
01:00:08,829 --> 01:00:12,809
so i can just look for evidence massive
able to about one x roll out to deploy

1168
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:14,519
this system absolution

1169
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:18,939
among the travel much easier to
electronic arrives or progress copiers

1170
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:22,279
and falls everything else that needs to
be excluded maqbool

1171
01:00:22,279 --> 01:00:23,409
scoop from there

1172
01:00:23,409 --> 01:00:27,029
put limits on some of the language of
ramallah ramallah stopped looking out of

1173
01:00:27,029 --> 01:00:28,209
the month of

1174
01:00:28,209 --> 01:00:31,428
but of course if you don't read this
article i would

1175
01:00:31,429 --> 01:00:34,609
through that michael so i don't think
that the address of my professor when he

1176
01:00:34,609 --> 01:00:39,429
works with the buses someone that
popular frustrating if not completely

1177
01:00:39,429 --> 01:00:41,409
useless right

1178
01:00:41,409 --> 01:00:45,919
i mean we all have this conversation
working which does maxim which in turn

1179
01:00:45,919 --> 01:00:50,239
transactions that uh... the lives of
those things that i don't think people

1180
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:51,879
really talk about

1181
01:00:51,879 --> 01:00:55,328
that if you bargain of the police
station after architecture network that

1182
01:00:55,329 --> 01:00:57,950
such a way so that i actually make sense
to make these

1183
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:00,700
solutions affected churches bottom

1184
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:05,149
and travel tamarack and look for
something about it with our industry

1185
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:09,919
is because not everyone knew that must
not be worth shit

1186
01:01:09,919 --> 01:01:13,469
sort of around eleven o'clock this fall
if one of the one you know what it does

1187
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:15,059
this all this

1188
01:01:15,059 --> 01:01:18,959
but that's not a lot and i wanted to do
some should that make sense

1189
01:01:18,959 --> 01:01:23,888
anti-terrorism itself was laughin
socialized time for alot of habitat has

1190
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:26,799
also have apartments that are wondering

1191
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:30,349
possibilities for iraq to sell it

1192
01:01:30,349 --> 01:01:34,999
fastpitch what's going to happen to see
the full monty

1193
01:01:34,999 --> 01:01:36,649
work

1194
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:38,199
engineer

1195
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:40,569
okay thanks a lot of really really come
up

1196
01:01:40,569 --> 01:01:41,849
political agenda

1197
01:01:41,849 --> 01:01:44,910
is uh... smoke avoid proper

1198
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:47,749
really got enormous a lot of people

1199
01:01:47,749 --> 01:01:50,799
automatically were excluded of what
network

1200
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:54,889
front able to about one x and a lot of
american security solutions

1201
01:01:54,889 --> 01:01:59,660
so wanted to do is you jump on implement
u_n_ tacking on your laptop

1202
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:03,279
you know he's seen e_p_a_ to discover
the network and jump into the was the

1203
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:03,970
one

1204
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:08,240
as soon as you can get on the voice you
when you bypass most security solutions

1205
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,750
on top of that

1206
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:13,470
gentleman from within dot which needs to
communicate with callmanager macbook for

1207
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:17,319
manager as a server network all of the
other critical infrastructure

1208
01:02:17,319 --> 01:02:19,329
so i think it on the network

1209
01:02:19,329 --> 01:02:22,060
what was the limit communicate and to

1210
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:26,490
callmanager generally people don't make
it easier also settlement board network

1211
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:28,750
tripling communicate with the farm
manager

1212
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,629
have nothing else

1213
01:02:30,629 --> 01:02:35,310
i mean think about dubai before bishop
lonely talking uni other server

1214
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:37,919
like that about getting a little

1215
01:02:37,919 --> 01:02:40,999
it economical hello

1216
01:02:40,999 --> 01:02:44,788
and potentially the apartment parker all

1217
01:02:44,789 --> 01:02:51,309
sustainable long-term investment went
from exporting conference right now

1218
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,510
wanted

1219
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:53,630
advantage

1220
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:57,419
well since talking about the sets

1221
01:02:57,419 --> 01:03:01,669
there was some decision-making skills
that make sense randomly in in in the

1222
01:03:01,669 --> 01:03:06,779
report that we're talking to any other
pocket that other than callmanager right

1223
01:03:06,779 --> 01:03:09,890
so many skills that that someone was
gone

1224
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:13,629
and temperature was diminishes never
heard of anything of them

1225
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:17,499
of involves for manager

1226
01:03:17,499 --> 01:03:21,279
next thing until it was met with his
ideas and hostess ideas

1227
01:03:21,279 --> 01:03:25,159
has been a passenger on if you look at
what events for system threatens doing

1228
01:03:25,159 --> 01:03:26,969
things that commenced

1229
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:30,719
or the use of medicine necromancer
actually call

1230
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:34,849
uh... by the navy jobs for that's what
he's going to be fewer calls

1231
01:03:34,849 --> 01:03:37,940
we don't want my muscles that eskimos
that were based on this

1232
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:41,500
also if you can use schools from the
windows n_t_ resource kit

1233
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,649
you're going to get around most i guess

1234
01:03:43,649 --> 01:03:45,339
and host network based on

1235
01:03:45,339 --> 01:03:49,219
because you use religion in schools are
considered by the way so you do things

1236
01:03:49,219 --> 01:03:52,280
like remote that he had seen from the mt
resource kit

1237
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:55,299
i mean it's not that uh... bloodshed

1238
01:03:55,299 --> 01:03:59,939
does michelle across the network is
exactly what laminin all these things

1239
01:03:59,939 --> 01:04:02,359
will be around the network to do some
things that

1240
01:04:02,359 --> 01:04:05,339
that i don't understand how to customers
are looking for

1241
01:04:05,339 --> 01:04:08,038
to look for network enumerate

1242
01:04:08,039 --> 01:04:10,879
and lateral movement throughout the
network views of the things i think the

1243
01:04:10,879 --> 01:04:14,529
more critical of the port standing right
everything

1244
01:04:14,529 --> 01:04:15,739
and security

1245
01:04:15,739 --> 01:04:18,469
security space that exports can

1246
01:04:18,469 --> 01:04:22,130
one of our own that real hackers youths
from other countries

1247
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:26,770
uh... problem bokhorst him anymore and
uh... you up on stuff that sort of open

1248
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:30,050
shares of instruction after people
tested my co

1249
01:04:30,050 --> 01:04:33,069
fun trust relationships move laterally
throughout the network

1250
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:37,130
on one another hackers and on and what
the fuck disciples certainly

1251
01:04:37,130 --> 01:04:42,699
in terms of products to reports here

1252
01:04:42,699 --> 01:04:46,759
okay uh... other things now that we
really couple impregnate overtook

1253
01:04:46,759 --> 01:04:48,250
instilling going on

1254
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:52,089
so sorry to hear that from a list of
federal since the impact of directories

1255
01:04:52,089 --> 01:04:53,980
most of the domain admin groups

1256
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:57,949
immediately after that let's start
searching for that muffler response

1257
01:04:57,949 --> 01:05:02,849
so i think these commands r_w_ w_n_y_c_
just logged in just a second chance

1258
01:05:02,849 --> 01:05:07,319
to find out user that's been the demand
and concerts network and to respond to

1259
01:05:07,319 --> 01:05:08,650
spark a box

1260
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:13,730
hui job on his box and try to get him to

clients like that directly affects

1314
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:09,969
so

1315
01:08:09,969 --> 01:08:14,169
are we determined with our traditional
pbf exploits of java dropper or

1316
01:08:14,169 --> 01:08:15,589
something like that

1320
01:08:23,529 --> 01:08:24,640
something so

1321
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:27,750
you want to customers should start to
think that you're not playing fair

1322
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:31,969
because you are so much for the more

1330
01:08:51,908 --> 01:08:53,738
i was looking for local stuff

office the hardest

1332
01:08:58,370 --> 01:09:04,080
due to cancel corners yes walpole of are
what's in my opinion is much talk

1333
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,908
provisions that works

1334
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:10,559
network stop as long as it looks like a
legitimate sunbeam appliance

1335
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:14,389
also that we're stuck with custom code

1338
01:09:18,649 --> 01:09:23,829
so the things that i guess is really
good uh... is port stands by divine port

1339
01:09:23,828 --> 01:09:24,639
stephens

baffle audiences do that so

1342
01:09:29,029 --> 01:09:33,139
overly concerned i guess what i wanted
to ask is actual weakness

1343
01:09:33,139 --> 01:09:35,159
i worry about what's on the holes

1344
01:09:35,158 --> 01:09:38,688

on top of our house

1347
01:09:46,819 --> 01:09:51,259
uh... them when the government optician

1349
01:09:56,159 --> 01:10:00,290
house instead of one workers on each
individual webserver

1350
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:03,940
so we can look at the same way about
which there are some of those displaced

1351
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:08,230
all the action is happening on the house
security operations center with a dot

was locked in with my parts are

1353
01:10:12,050 --> 01:10:16,210
something like that to be the little
ones were we really worry about getting

1354
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:17,530
caught

1355
01:10:17,530 --> 01:10:22,978

guess removing my reusable recommends

1358
01:10:29,139 --> 01:10:32,219
that may be that guy calls that's really
where we are

1359
01:10:32,219 --> 01:10:35,250
what almost afraid to talk
