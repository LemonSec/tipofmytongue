1
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,009
alright

2
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:08,990
welcome everyone to wear wanna know he
has a public man doctor

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,769
lunchtime food comas but some my name is
not John or a lot you know me as our

4
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:14,360
plate

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,050
I know I decide to be old news my real
name here you know this presentation

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:23,420
said kinda scandalous she thing to do so
hot today we're going to talk about

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,680
access control systems and by access
controls

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,759
I mean physical security controls that

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,630
like these of ID cards were relevant
issue in dorm rooms

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,540
possibly a poor choice in the merits
part Donald

11
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,430
so I what we're gonna do you desire to
go through this

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,950
a we had the surname we do this exercise
ever appeared about

13
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,739
18 months we're on the 23 be shop
Packers Basit surah

14
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:54,489
while y'all are gonna come down there
tomorrow maybe for a party but we got

15
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:56,410
tired of dealing with metal keys

16
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,699
in which are looking into you're
researching

17
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,219
an electronic access system and realize
that they were

18
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:06,260
have a lot of things wrong with that
from hackers purple perspective

19
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,909
sell for starters you know why are we
doing this so

20
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:13,450
security now access control systems the
mostly closed-door us

21
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,409
and very proprietary I we really had a
hard time getting much useful

22
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:19,130
information for me the vendors

23
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:22,490
very little information about the inner
workings is published

24
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,070
a some unpublished little bit about
their actual protocols

25
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,059
there are so many men as my Tripoli
standards in a alarm manufacturers

26
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,560
standard for

27
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,210
a woman in false alarms the few things
Nancy stuff

28
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:39,189
but that's really about at noon some
even other chip number: scrubbed off and

29
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:39,908
you know they're

30
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:43,009
ones with the fuse is blown you can't
really think album

31
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:47,100
on when you can access control system we
basically got tired of dealing with he

32
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,369
is and how it doesn't look like I'm
learnin

33
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:53,420
you not be over vote he's a big enough
for somebody so

34
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,270
you we decide we won like drug after its
controls we want something that we own

35
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:57,810
the

36
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,200
you we could prove how secure in secure
was and

37
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,950
we would be able to modify it so in
order to

38
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,160
to really get there I think it helps to
start by defining what we mean by

39
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,568
security in this case

40
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:14,339
so this is the classic I personally or
or Ross Anderson security engineering

41
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,200
triangle mean security defined in terms
thereof

42
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,160
assets in our case we're not talking
necessarily tronic assets

43
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,010
data but we're talking about people were
talking about our facility our stuff

44
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,179
maybe our information inside there maybe
our server room we'll talk about threats

45
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,030
those assets threat actors

46
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,800
actual people who intentionally want to
get you harm their stuff

47
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,480
I vandalism fee and all those sorts of
things

48
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,170
and recycle countermeasures you things
we can wrap around those assets to

49
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,670
provide some sorta

50
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,910
mitigation the stress and important
differentiation

51
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,980
I safety and security are related

52
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,738
but they're not the same thing security
is typically a counter measures you

53
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:01,480
install to mitigate intentionally

54
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,569
and harmful threats were safety

55
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:08,089
that more incomes is things like a Eunos

56
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,400
human error and and natural disasters
but they effect each other and sometimes

57
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,230
and doing things like getting safety
systems increased security

58
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,390
and vice versa one other thing to
consider

59
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:25,129
on all these things have trade-offs I
worked we talk cost convenience

60
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:29,048
and we have things like creation new
vulnerabilities well from where thought

61
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:32,330
maybe from doing your web security and
network security

62
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:36,319
but when you're talking about things
like a making sure you can

63
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,220
X your building in case of a fire it
kinda acquires new dimension

64
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,659
so we have to you know we have to look
at that

65
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:47,269
things that are open the doors it's an
emergency you know shouldn't be able to

66
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:47,700
be

67
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,920
easily subverted to open it for a Unit
actor

68
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,950
so this man kinda interesting

69
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,518
a been Ross Anderson security
engineering to great book

70
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,120
he has a a good section about physical
security and he really

71
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,840
kinda formless it there's a come before

72
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,230
cited square for seven-figure

73
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,738
other four things you can basically do
with physical security

74
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:17,380
devices and and countermeasures you
can't stop anyone from getting into your

75
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,478
stuff for your facility that's just not
going to happen

76
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:23,620
before things you can do that or deter
them you can delay your attacker

77
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,229
you can detect an attack and after is
already in progress sir

78
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:32,210
been attempted and you can mount some
sort of response to it

79
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,310
and that response could be anything from
communicating with your chapter is an

80
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,150
intercom

81
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,008
setting off a siren calling the police
page in the guard desk anything like

82
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:42,419
that

83
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:46,479
so fundamentally these are all there

84
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,630
to enforce a security policy

85
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,550
in and that security policy is something
that you have to decide for yourself

86
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,970
whether it's your partner hackerspace
your corporate high-rise

87
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:01,250
are you know what are the priorities in
water you really trying to get out at us

88
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,060
just like an enterprise IT security
policy is necessary before we start by

89
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,380
firewalls

90
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,320
are you need to figure out what
procedures you want to be enforced by

91
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:10,860
your

92
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,759
your access controls and %uh some pretty
easy for little ones

93
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,650
may come up over and over security and
see if you the personnel

94
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,620
any kinda have security measure you put
and if it does not protect the people

95
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,580
who actually work in the building

96
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,109
you give them something they're not
going to follow their to prop the door

97
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,270
opener there are gonna care

98
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,870
because you know it it's apparent that
their safety isn't

99
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,889
first and foremost mine prevention if
after damage your assets

100
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:41,620
that's a big one and auditing about
access and security events

101
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,400
that's our stuff falls back into
deterrence as well as response it lets

102
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,219
you mount

103
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,220
response after the fact maybe prosecute
someone

104
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,100
maybe find a vulnerability that you
would have some logs

105
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,199
and you know we talk about threats

106
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,870
something that's kind of interesting a
there is a model developed at San

107
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:06,750
some security text books it came from an
army officer they don't cite the name

108
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,240
but the basic up with four model
attackers

109
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,870
and this is something I haven't seen a I
mean obviously

110
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,490
we have models actors in the room but
you know they all fit same old black

111
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:18,669
shirts

112
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,870
and she looking this is the more formal

113
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,250
what they did is a cup this for
arbitrary guys and

114
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,340
I see guys but so that's what they did

115
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,369
we have Derek Charlie Bruno and
abdurahman

116
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,690
and these guys sorta represents a
spectrum love

117
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,850
have different threats your physical
threats to

118
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,930
facility or some assets and %uh the
first one

119
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,190
this is probably the biggest one we had
in mind with our

120
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,780
you know hackerspace security system der

121
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,780
at Derek is a nineteen year old adage
he's looking for low risk opportunity to

122
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,400
steal something he can sell for his next
fix

123
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,609
rather fitting because we're also one
walkway from methadone clinic him

124
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,710
akers be israel's day is noise most
prime

125
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,190
hey so next one we have Charlie

126
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,280
charlie is a forty-year-old inadequate
with seven convictions for burglary

127
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,349
he spent seventeen at last 25 years in
prison

128
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:18,130
is like a classic career con although
not very intelligent

129
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:21,639
he's coming experienced he's picked up a
lot of war

130
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,740
during his balls inside he steals in
small shops in suburban houses

131
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,449
taking what he can to solve a local
fences and this is a guy who

132
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:34,620
new made you a smashing grab or maybe
someone who has access is more

133
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,590
sophisticated things and tools

134
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,810
maybe he can use lock picking a lock
bumping

135
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:43,569
you know aid some other things that we
might see in a residential or commercial

136
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:44,759
burglary

137
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,550
you repeated over and over and we have
this one at this is kind of interesting

138
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:53,080
a bruno a bruno is a gentleman criminal

139
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,909
his business is mostly stealing our as a
cover

140
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,240
he runs a small art gallery he has a
Ford university degree in art history

141
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,190
and one conviction for robbery eighteen
years ago after two years in jail

142
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,990
she changes name and move to a different
part of the country his own occasional

143
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,389
black bag jobs for intelligence agencies
who knows past

144
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:17,129
he like to get into cyber crime but most
he's done so far stripping $200k worth a

145
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,360
memory chips from the university's PCs
in the mid nineties when there's mary

146
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,539
Fallin

147
00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:27,360
and then our last one this is something
you know the kinda

148
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,699
you lose some threat that's always in
the news but never seem to see

149
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:34,200
a berman in a German had to sell

150
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,479
overdoes Norton's most military training

151
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:41,890
they have infantry weapons explosives
with PhD grade technicals were paraded

152
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,189
by disrupt your country

153
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,750
a German himself came out to third in a
class a 280 at the Monterey County that

154
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,810
country was not promoted because he's
from the wrong ethnic group

155
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,449
he thinks himself as a good manner that
bad man in his mission is this your

156
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,190
plutonium

157
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,339
so clearly we have different kinds and
Fred actors

158
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,800
we don't really worry about the last one
that's the military's problem

159
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,390
I really it's sophisticated controls
wrapped around

160
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:11,750
lots of mass you know things like
concrete barriers that stop trucks in

161
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:17,430
explosives and you know the tapas greens
with guns you come and kill those people

162
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,729
and the first one a in a second one
those are the problems love

163
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:25,709
criminologist and sociologists and so
forth so we really

164
00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:29,640
you're kinda worried about Sabrina he
sort of it's in the air

165
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,880
at and the upper and love off-the-shelf
criminals

166
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,300
that's what we design things like data
centers and higher security

167
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,029
installations around

168
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:41,310
but we probably not design every
business round that so

169
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:45,300
I'm I traveled a lot of businesses and
you know we talked enterprise security

170
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,810
and things like that

171
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,899
and come its monster visions your
typical

172
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:54,260
business promoter is protected by our
standard 5 to 7 p.m. and mortise lock

173
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,120
from

174
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,700
chalet Gill sergeant Center at tempered
glass windows

175
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,589
an alarm system civil kinda stuff we see

176
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:06,260
a larger sites have electronic burner
access controls often

177
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,069
and their many cases tied into building
systems like

178
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:14,940
each back in lighting and and maybe an
on-site security does the monitors all

179
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,089
and the physical or account lots they
have

180
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:22,579
are usually higher grade like passed in
you medico and some others Browns

181
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:26,140
and we'll see for key control and in the
village master key a little bit

182
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:31,360
were safely this kind of thing it
represents good basic protection from

183
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,360
burglary meet insurance requirements

184
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,250
and Derek and Charlie threat models are
probably covered fairly well here

185
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,730
data centers a high-value I've

186
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,010
merchandise is handling facilities those
are geared more towards the bruno

187
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:47,610
attacker

188
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,440
where you have things like defense in
depth in a layered security not just a

189
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,390
promoter

190
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,959
a more robust detection response maybe
with the

191
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:59,459
no armed security from a security
company that

192
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:03,268
you has very rigid protocols for you're
not taking no for

193
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:06,700
an answer for a call back in things like
that

194
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,450
us in a typical features these me look
into these we

195
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:14,740
I took apart alarm systems and access
controls and media

196
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,839
you looked at existing installations
where people gives permission

197
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,670
and we simply have a modules control
under four doors

198
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:27,519
a little black boxes mall here and there
we have a centralized usually Windows

199
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,980
platform computer

200
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,760
up stories the access token information
and keep logs

201
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,200
they typically push up all sees the
usually you can access the the doors and

202
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,209
so forth without that system being on

203
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:42,699
you know its stores locally case
something goes down

204
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,320
I usually have some sort of access
device

205
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,540
a you're talking you know where the
rubber meets the road

206
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,769
a electrical signal between five and 40
balls

207
00:11:53,769 --> 00:11:58,110
is what's going to open your door it's
typically electromechanical Tobias

208
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,550
in by things like electric mortise lock
which we have one here all show you

209
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,219
door magnets will have some pictures
those say you've probably seen those lot

210
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,329
of places there

211
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:10,469
big heavy-duty electromagnet the whole
the door shut

212
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,440
electric strikes your get byes into a
pawn shop or something like that on your

213
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,680
horrible sound that season easy operated
electric strike

214
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,069
all the stuff is me we're doing is
basically

215
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,420
in being in closing some kinda relay

216
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,089
and energizing a a device that wasn't
mad about 1910

217
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:33,320
gotta love it up the access and so can
readers

218
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,380
utterly systems use things like plant in
pads in the used a

219
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,980
in physical keys the trying to switch

220
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,430
and you now we're looking at more things
like a cards say could be mag stripe

221
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,609
contact cards smart cards

222
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,100
a contactless RFID cards that sort of
thing

223
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,720
I am 4100 those are cheap open standards
are pretty cards are used in

224
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,029
less expensive systems I the hit systems
are basically a

225
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,170
a slightly extended protocol with a few
more bits

226
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:06,199
released on the lower end my fair and
Allah

227
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,329
some others Browns are able to do things
like read and write

228
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:13,519
data and you know do a little bit more
stuff

229
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,010
up some important things almost every
facility

230
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:20,500
has some sort device that gives anyone a
free exit

231
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,269
there might be a press to exit in the
appropriate local language

232
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:29,620
me and maybe it's lit up the often have
motion detectors actually usually both

233
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,810
I in fact is that the Bush tax it
physically applies under its power

234
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:37,459
so that if all that electrons is not
working you're still able to get out

235
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:40,510
are sometimes they have a button that
you push it and

236
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:44,760
a leg timer goes off for you know counts
down thirty seconds and lets you out to

237
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,130
make it

238
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:51,260
in communion so that you don't use that
as a your main means opinion now

239
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,939
they may have integration with some
centralized console application where

240
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,230
security cameras can follow up the
events you know

241
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,320
the camera comes up immediately in
loading dock if

242
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,440
motion detector goes off saying that
there's a truck there or someone pushed

243
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,310
a button

244
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:09,638
to the intercom a most facilities have
the capability of doing a remote

245
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:11,029
lock/unlock

246
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:15,550
it could be something dumb like go to my
PC imagine a Windows PC

247
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,680
that's kinda scary but that does control
physical access

248
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,859
sometimes you have things like

249
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,839
a I could guard console that you know
they can verify that you're at the right

250
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:26,399
door

251
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,850
with the camera and then let you into
the loading dock without having to know

252
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,600
leavin

253
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,019
you go track the guy down and open the
door

254
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:37,480
and then integration the alarms anything
from I just

255
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,300
you know triggering a a contact you no
fall

256
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,680
it. level integration isolate

257
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,939
I went ahead and made a little diagram
kinda shows how those work

258
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,250
and a bigger facility its ok we have the
access servers

259
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,350
in some sort of database Sun in the
server room

260
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,920
and that's they're basically just
answering your sequel requested some

261
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,050
kinda a friend and software

262
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:03,479
I could be clustered or not but simply
management PC

263
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,209
and smaller systems and Andrew PC is
also the database in the policy pusher

264
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:12,000
we have things like a each back alarm
systems

265
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,500
a lot of the the newer ones have
Ethernet built and the ability to

266
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,459
communicate with these things

267
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:22,160
sometimes there are integration saw for
companies that title together at the PC

268
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,399
application I N we look at the lower

269
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,449
left hand corner others all panels
sometimes it comes bare boards the

270
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:30,709
cheaper ones do

271
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:34,619
lot times their little sheet metal box
the village church in screws the wall in

272
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,199
a closet somewhere

273
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:39,599
flew in the locks they have a UPS

274
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,190
because you don't want to get denied
access your space if the powers out

275
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,870
basically have a a simple
microcontroller could be a

276
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:51,519
no doubt man all or a pic or you know
the summer travel Cebu

277
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,550
and some kinda network capability the
older ones are RS 422

278
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,250
basie fancy serial port that goes over
long ranges

279
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,019
a newer ones are altering to be
internet-based

280
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:06,839
and those doors they have a few almonds
I'm

281
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,089
they have things like access reader you
could be a pimp out a scramble pad wear

282
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:14,350
pants a fancy pen how that's harder to
shoulder surf

283
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,800
I you know some type of talking reader
something you have

284
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,979
could be a biometric which is basically
taking your fingerprint and

285
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:25,459
something that it thinks is your
fingerprint and give you some numbers

286
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:27,649
that compares into database

287
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:30,860
possibly local copy about cash there and
then you know

288
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,329
requests to further can go back the
actual server

289
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:39,008
and then they have up with the car
wrecks answer its request to exit

290
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:43,170
basically a a button worsens or both to
let you out

291
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,860
regardless 'em you know what state the
doors and so forth

292
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,649
on the meantime we have a sensor need
side to see if someone's actually there

293
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:54,220
and sometimes out those decisions are
have a locally and sometimes they go

294
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,699
back the panel

295
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:59,319
been any case is almost always
mechanical writer some sort of way of

296
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,579
getting people

297
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:04,418
a accessed through the door least in the
exit direction

298
00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:09,780
up the systems that do you block your
physical power after accident don't have

299
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,869
an easy mechanical wave opening

300
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:16,409
I usually have to have something like a
a and integration with the alarm system

301
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,280
fire controls things like that so that
they can

302
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,439
get a signal to release all the exterior
doors that say in the event of an

303
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:24,939
emergency

304
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:28,940
I'm something that you need for safety
codes enough PA has ended the call

305
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:30,070
depart 101

306
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:34,010
that governs out but also something that
he supported by an attacker

307
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,450
I can or near systems they're gonna have
your network

308
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,809
preferably a good secure one but if it's
installed by a

309
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:44,840
in electrical lender may just be you
know some some done that your hubs and

310
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,678
and that sort of thing so

311
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:52,090
we can talk with a truck model love it
when we talk about some attackers

312
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,850
I you know what ur advantage in this
match is électronique locks

313
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:59,360
up the first and foremost one the
business problem they release all

314
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,049
it's easy to revoke the keys the keys
are cheap

315
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:06,918
the are disposable usually and you can
given

316
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,080
you know give them and you can
electronically revoke them

317
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,260
without any real financial penalty
obviously argued metal keys

318
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,970
but you can have very flexible security
policies

319
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,370
I you can make a your your front door

320
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,678
any Dorner facility ernie space
accessible

321
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,830
only in the context of a certain time a
day or week a month

322
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,080
your physical location in the facility
security level

323
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,189
that he was assigned to you security
policy

324
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:40,870
you can have public and private areas
with different

325
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,439
policies wrapped around them are you can
have princess alarm sensors everywhere

326
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,900
but you can

327
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,590
shoes to not alarm but only log if it's
a a a lobby during business hours

328
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:54,250
you can maybe that have to make a
decision just like you to analyze logs

329
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:54,880
and you

330
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,880
intrusion detection a system for for IT
security

331
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,640
you kids determine if someone's there
and a certain hours that they are

332
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,000
supposed to be there are you can you
know

333
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,270
raised alarm do things like that up

334
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:11,129
public spaces often become private
spaces you know on the weekends are

335
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,630
after-hours that sort of thing one nice
thing

336
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,809
it'd Cana can be a good hedge against
carelessness

337
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:22,139
so we can do things like up you know

338
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,020
allow over the the front door is always
be locked I even if

339
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,668
Munim people are there and so forth
because you can make it very convenient

340
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:32,140
to swipe in and out and unlock it

341
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,510
whereas in the system he might have had
before the cat with mechanical locks in

342
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:40,750
in middle keys those are going to be. do
something that always gets left propped

343
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,460
open

344
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:47,049
you know left unlocked and you can also
use a alarms and things discourage that

345
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:50,360
and the blasting it's really important
that you don't have with mechanical

346
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,159
devices

347
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,030
are you can audit you can know none is
really who released

348
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,539
know what token was presented or what
alleged user

349
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:02,390
access what and where and what path they
took through it if you come through the

350
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,250
logs

351
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:08,539
and finally I love your stuff you
anything from lighting to

352
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:12,309
alarms to air conditioners they can all
be tied into this

353
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:16,240
you should add and dry contacts readers
have an on/off every layer

354
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,250
you know sensor you can do things like
turn your commission on or

355
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,000
trim that lights on have someone come
into the facility so that

356
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,580
go there securities actually improved by
having the other path lead in

357
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,168
you know through the parking lot or
through the space and you're also saving

358
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:32,970
energy in

359
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,770
im making things more convenient

360
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:41,230
in so let's talk about the disadvantages
what Ron o'clock sir

361
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:44,960
you know we're kind of here too to think
about you know security measures in

362
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,549
terms of

363
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:50,309
you know how can I break this rate for
all hackers

364
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:54,168
so our fight he right that's been the
you know big in the news and take

365
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,039
everywhere

366
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,510
I love you people have seen the audience
probable the pox mark

367
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:04,840
it's like a Swiss Army knife that can
decode even emulate these cards

368
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,030
you know what what are these cards the
right if we you know

369
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:12,139
fun when we look at it it's a little
radio antenna with a chip on it

370
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,539
and when you put up to reader you can be
interrogated

371
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:20,710
without having to necessarily touch it
and it can spit back an idea or can make

372
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,179
sense or transaction where data stored

373
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:28,230
and and rewritten or challenge response
is down or something like that

374
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,409
and they're designed to be basically
used like a credit card it

375
00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:35,440
contact distances and it's assumed also
that

376
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,270
you know they are can be readily cloned
well turns out we know that's not

377
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,870
exactly case right

378
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:44,059
physical key can be cloned you know if
you get

379
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:48,200
physical access to it you're able to get
a key machine her access to a locksmith

380
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,210
I can even be done with a high res photo

381
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,780
but I was proven a paper in 2008 but
these are for any cards

382
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,740
you know they have some problems a.m.
you know up the technology is really

383
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,159
only meant to be read from a few
centimeters away

384
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,740
but depending on the system you can
build larger quayle's im

385
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,830
apartment but more power and you can the

386
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,970
do something like herein are for the
card from

387
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,980
a foot away or even five feet away
possibly

388
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,549
fever walk to shopping center that has
the on a shoplifting tax

389
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:22,480
that big plastic a stanchion in the
middle of the aisle

390
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,890
is a box for big coils

391
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,059
there may be 15 centimeters across the
might be 30 a.m.

392
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:33,020
and they will pick up and those low
frequency tags that are on your goods

393
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,389
and alarm if you bring one out all that
sort of thing can be adapted

394
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,929
to read are pretty cards and
unauthorized way

395
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:47,360
so we look to see if it can be red you
should just assume we can be cloned

396
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,559
%uh if we you accept the premise that
these are just chips

397
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,700
a they can be emulated with software

398
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,049
and we have some very fast
microprocessors and microcontrollers

399
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:56,929
that

400
00:22:56,929 --> 00:23:01,640
can basically bit bang out meet up a
signal you want

401
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,690
here another disadvantage they require
electricity

402
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:09,650
and required electricity I you know we
we have some interesting problems the

403
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:10,789
command

404
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:14,110
for one thing Park me interrupted or can
be manipulated

405
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:18,080
like we can do things such as that
analyze the power

406
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,210
going to a device and maybe deduce
whether it's sending zeros and ones are

407
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,630
processing something here

408
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:27,549
possibly get to spit out its key we
might be able to you

409
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:31,970
shorted out and interrupt its power and
deny you so that reader and outdoor

410
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:36,250
we might be able to if this is poorly
designed get the door open

411
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,980
by a plan to high-voltage or a dry
normal low to make a brownout

412
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,000
different things like that unlike a
physical lock where

413
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,080
basically those time where is in and
metal bits moving around

414
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,658
are governed by physics this is
something that

415
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:55,070
if you can control the power going to it
you may be able to do an intentional

416
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,480
things that

417
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,150
and finally they might feel comfortable
way

418
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:03,799
your door lock is probably is going to
break but man lies reviews too hard

419
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:07,610
but you don't exactly know an electronic
device with a few thousand lines of code

420
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:08,399
you didn't write

421
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,880
is going to do when you possibly push it
to fail

422
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,850
and another thing if you want to try out
let's see every medical cuter is

423
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:22,219
it might take you a year sitting there a
tryout he's even if the tolerance is

424
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,080
little sloppy

425
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,918
but in a poorly designed system you
might be able to hook up a device for

426
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:27,779
widget

427
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:31,750
that can basically let you trial doesn't

428
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:36,230
you know seconds or minutes now strength
is also in that because its offer based

429
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,299
stuff

430
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:40,470
you can you have countermeasures

431
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:44,659
not shut up but it certainly Real Talk
that's possible

432
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:47,630
and finally you are depending on
security over everything in there from

433
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,860
the physical layer

434
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,729
through the network in order to get that
signal safely to

435
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,080
wherever the its authorized to you're
talking to me authorized

436
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,809
and back and out authorization signal
same way

437
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:04,960
can we get about so with all that in
mind

438
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,450
we had good set about designing at

439
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:12,080
and access system that we could use to
research these issues

440
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,668
and we could use for space so we can see
criteria

441
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:20,289
first without the relevance the Derek
and Charlie attackers made sense

442
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:25,090
and really our main goal was keeping the
junkies rally at a shop

443
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,168
a the original door control

444
00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:31,289
was age like double with five kids

445
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:34,320
so we figure if we can beat that sizes
security target

446
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,080
for at least better of me started

447
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,939
a resistance to more service gets actor
was plus start

448
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:49,049
so we need to control two doors on
myspace is serving a smaller places have

449
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:49,840
a couple

450
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,668
%uh spaces may be a you know from back
door we thought that was a good starting

451
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:54,549
point

452
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:58,110
I'll only gets you something with lots
of doors and so forth

453
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:01,539
we're probably looking at some things
can be multi-tiered have possessed

454
00:26:01,539 --> 00:26:03,980
remodels anyway

455
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,039
we like the idea of being compatible
with off-the-shelf readers

456
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:13,190
so we've seen a few are ready projects
the the adults labor space in

457
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:16,220
Germany believe budget some very
interesting

458
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:19,549
homemade readers and support a crypto
code in

459
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:23,510
you know hamlet on the quayles made some
really need devices

460
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,840
about the problem is though we thought
that would be a little too hard to

461
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,789
replicate

462
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:29,820
we prefer to get something with low-cost
off-the-shelf so that other people

463
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,250
kidney to pick us up and pack on it

464
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:36,789
and the other thing that kept coming up
other people we got some really fancy

465
00:26:36,789 --> 00:26:38,710
interesting which it like a

466
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,809
her scramble pat or some type of retinal
scanner other biometric that was for

467
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:43,850
plus they got

468
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:47,299
and discarded from a renovation of some
high-security facility

469
00:26:47,299 --> 00:26:50,690
and if you're how to make it work that's
great but if someone else were to try

470
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,570
and pick that up

471
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,620
maybe five thousand dollars each new you
know just for that

472
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,699
the system with no manual so before but
was it really is relevant

473
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,789
we presume he get either use on eBay as
commodity

474
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:04,270
or new firm you know pick your not
offender

475
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,929
we like it you have been able to run
independent of a PC or other

476
00:27:07,929 --> 00:27:12,270
you know server anything with a real OS
has more ways to attack it

477
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:15,460
it has no ins lines of code you didn't
write and

478
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,270
if we divide it into what we call hard
and soft ass

479
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:22,500
hard task in things like opening closing
the doors

480
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,820
and soft ass mean things like connecting
to the internet which require a lot more

481
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,070
sophistication

482
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:30,418
a we'd rather the soft ass be allowed to
fail

483
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:34,090
and not affect the heart just like
leaving the front door open

484
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:37,860
kinda basic embedded systems a floss be
them

485
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,139
the dumb device is the master and the
smart devices

486
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:45,250
a peripheral and of course we want to do

487
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:49,240
logging auditing we know that was to be
able whether it could be internal or the

488
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,299
flash card or

489
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:53,350
pc-based turns out we can do both

490
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:56,439
I we want to have alarmed since our
capability you'll be able to detect

491
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,820
occupancies we know someone's there I
have

492
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:05,129
you may be four your alarm zones for
your alarm in occupancy detection and

493
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:05,919
request access

494
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,370
things like that and we also likely to
be able to integrate with

495
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:13,279
existing alarm system you know the
contacts 04 so we have some redundancy

496
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,580
in defense and up

497
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,789
so we can offer methodology apparent

498
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:22,370
we we had decided just her to start the
Arduino

499
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:26,090
microcontroller let me know kinda lost
common denominator

500
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:29,110
ground floor for embedded systems

501
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:32,939
and you appear to have enough I O ports
and

502
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:36,340
and processing power and storage do this
we want to have

503
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,360
a time and date security policies

504
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,779
possible to implement mobile security
levels

505
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:45,870
need to be very physically robust
battery backup

506
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:49,549
protection against reversed polarity and
high voltage is not all those sorts

507
00:28:49,549 --> 00:28:51,658
nasty things that happen in the wild

508
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:55,370
as posting a breadboard we ought to be
low-cost

509
00:28:55,370 --> 00:29:00,070
so open standards tokens leaders
adaptable to new stuff

510
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,899
something we can build for maybe a
hundred dollars or less a

511
00:29:03,899 --> 00:29:07,750
commercial systems there are few you
know China knockoffs but

512
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:11,140
Muslim you're looking at a thousand
three thousand dollars per door to

513
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:11,750
electrify

514
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:16,409
so you know that's going out other the
budget have you're starving hacker

515
00:29:16,409 --> 00:29:20,429
and watching that was our people I only
commodity components you can get through

516
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:24,830
digi-key Roman 14 in a row served god
forbid Radio Shack

517
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,918
itself in check yeah

518
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,809
so but no we we took all those those
constraints in mind

519
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:34,928
and missed our design something on we

520
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:39,460
put on a breadboard we started testing
some you know free code we found for

521
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,640
interfacing some other readers and and
that stuff

522
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,480
we had to do love debugging other
something called the wagon protocol

523
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,830
which is a we enter why can't I don't
know a sack frank and actually did a a

524
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,710
talk here in 2007 about how to intercept
boughton

525
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:57,539
replay that the tokens and so forth
other between not

526
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:01,020
manufacture date issues we figured out
how you know how that works in

527
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,450
we got some good together we built a 1.0
version

528
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,279
the circuit board we put some discomfort
in but protection and

529
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:11,620
UPS power supply on their we found

530
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,239
a smart ID cards that her used very a

531
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,200
successfully industry for you know
things like cattle tracking and

532
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,390
goods and you know things like that they
are available and keychain and

533
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:29,659
swipe card format called in 4100 summary
writeable summary domain

534
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:33,710
as we got some our hands most readers in
no tokens were less than a dollar so

535
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:37,640
affordable to play with him come up and
so forth and we estimate alt is a

536
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,190
plywood

537
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:41,570
called a version 1.0 so this is it

538
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:46,770
a there's a power supply that's not very
efficient on top with the UPS

539
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:50,809
big honkin battery there's a couple
pieces the door hardware there is a

540
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:54,399
adore magma bottom others are bored in
the middle

541
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,469
or just up from it and there's a couple
reader is a a million reader

542
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:01,820
which is bases I'm to go on a a busy the

543
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,980
the door jam edged extra front door and
then there's a a and

544
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,090
interior reared as a pin pat's we can
you know

545
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:13,620
use two factor authentication entered
arsons in command that sort of thing

546
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,250
and so we sorted treated this like it
was the front door several times or come

547
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,230
in here with swype in an hour

548
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,769
intestine try to break it find it all
its flaws

549
00:31:22,769 --> 00:31:26,870
and we had use that with a homemade PCB
twins much money on

550
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,428
and Connor find it we found out some
things like that we know

551
00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:34,549
u-turn at Marshall had takes a lot of
power can burn up the regulator on board

552
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:35,360
some of them

553
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,870
so I made a nice 1 I'm switching power
supply and put out on board

554
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:43,570
we decide to make it carry no 5 answer
continuous current for some other

555
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,408
heavy-duty

556
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:48,260
I security door hardware you can get put
in more protection the inputs made it

557
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,149
harder to reset brown Outen

558
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:53,949
holes for two things and we set of air
PECVD created

559
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:59,309
and I we went ahead and built-in
capability work in store 200 local users

560
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:02,668
I 255 security levels

561
00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:06,980
I had a console you control the Ethernet
and a rather

562
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:10,210
via serial but can also be serial over
Ethernet

563
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:14,399
and win a great alarm access functions
and tested this not I'm

564
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,570
and of course insult us your jeans and
this is the result

565
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:21,950
so this is our first to create a
commercially produced

566
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:25,169
it said kinda bickford we know shields
about six certainly knows

567
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:30,269
worth and it's got some big relay is in
a switching power supply in the middle

568
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:35,240
that's not input protection with a surge
protectors and movies

569
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,450
it's got big screw terminals I it's got
some

570
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:42,120
Darlington transistor arrays love the
stuff we copied from a

571
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,219
1980s alarm panels we figure that

572
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,559
you know that's something that's been
use and abuse for twenty years

573
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,110
so there probably were doing something
right then we put a real time clock

574
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,299
important

575
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:56,679
something are doing doesn't have and we
up to isolate everything

576
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:00,149
so there's no direct connection to that
micro so it's a world is

577
00:33:00,149 --> 00:33:03,418
you know hopefully sandwich the way
where

578
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:06,750
you know bad people can get to it is
easily

579
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:11,330
and you know we had we just without and
we are now at our

580
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:14,370
I guess we call our 2.11 and we have a

581
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:18,010
basic is a hardware that supports to
readers

582
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:21,720
supports a navy compatible or do we know
so we test the freedom you know on this

583
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,990
evening a lot of those

584
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:27,149
often are driven very responsive under
the reeds

585
00:33:27,149 --> 00:33:30,260
Putin it does have

586
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,870
up no modern capability we're using just

587
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:38,428
cereal to a small NXP see you know we
look into using the are due to return it

588
00:33:38,429 --> 00:33:39,850
has a lot of issues

589
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:43,500
single-threaded it doesn't respond very
well planned

590
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,649
what's your host hangs up in you need
the full 30 seconds time out

591
00:33:47,649 --> 00:33:50,678
and during that time your front door is
open not so good

592
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:54,330
so the hard and soft ask if you're that
shit is be offloaded to you all were

593
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:57,799
you know when it's BC you're an embedded
devices some kind

594
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:01,970
and you know we had come to fine-tune
the a remote administration

595
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:06,630
happen any a consul password and here
three strikes you're out for an hour and

596
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:07,929
things like that

597
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:11,310
and we publish the evil cat files and
there'd be no coding

598
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:14,540
package show up and then we decided to
your own dog food

599
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,649
we have put in production and we
security

600
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:20,848
Joe a commercial door hardware which is
pretty expensive

601
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:25,679
turns out a few have a storefront type
building anywhere in the US

602
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,940
probably quit within Adams right
mortgage about

603
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,960
aluminum a mortise lock and they're the
only game in town

604
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,260
and they want three hundred dollars not
for their stuff

605
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,440
presidential towers are some some sheets
for that

606
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,530
you can act as a Walsh leg I keep adding
stuff to

607
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:47,010
just be a dumb solo it for the door

608
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:51,359
but we programmed it up and install it
in an old alarming closure regarded

609
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,199
and put a big honkin battery you know
the big talk about her from a foreigner

610
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,710
and will UPS circuit and ice five and
power supply that's

611
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:04,329
camel's back and we start putting in
hearing from me up all the stuff

612
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:07,420
and it's it's worked out pretty well we
found

613
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,700
a about a dozen major bugs the first
week we had it

614
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,828
in production clean one would let you

615
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:18,260
inner in the archery compound after a
successful swipe

616
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,760
even if you or not the right person
stuff like that you don't really find so

617
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,410
you live with it

618
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:27,149
and with all the size hardware put a
little bit higher security locked

619
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,250
a than that said much leg

620
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:33,760
you know 510 wasn't there before and

621
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,920
you know we have a a couple options are
some or doors this is

622
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,510
at another site this is a a magnet lock
with with two magnets in EverQuest X

623
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,460
reader

624
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:46,710
%uh this is what we installed another
door it says your door magnets that

625
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,990
but a twelve hundred-pound Paul magnet

626
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:53,270
only takes about two hundred million
skip shut

627
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:56,520
and then there is a posh exit reader you
see this thing over and over

628
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,230
of you do see rosa while by the way you
can pull that cover of you do things

629
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,320
like change the pattern that it's that

630
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,619
to picks up from making more permissive
you can set this is Jimmy to be higher

631
00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:07,339
so that

632
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:10,369
things like we've issued a paper through
the door cracked let you in

633
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:14,800
thing to think about yeah so in doing
all this

634
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,550
mister find smaller villages really were
here at offers for the wiring

635
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:24,109
wiring is absolutely vulnerable in any
resistance a few them do you have full

636
00:36:24,109 --> 00:36:25,369
challenge response

637
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:28,510
capability in encryption between the

638
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:34,109
you know they all the devices and and
the the brainer that inhibition occasion

639
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:34,730
panel

640
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:37,890
early access server the most window

641
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,089
so you can do things like man in the
middle that we can protocol you can have

642
00:36:41,089 --> 00:36:45,040
a device that stores in replays
successful swipes

643
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,320
you can short out the low voltage wiring
it controls the soloists

644
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,119
I in some cases if it's not designed
well you might be able to blow a fuse

645
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,089
and have a feels us now to feel secure
bus feel safe door open

646
00:36:58,089 --> 00:37:02,828
that's device right there the door
magnet when you enter a power to it it

647
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:04,170
opens no matter what

648
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:08,170
so if you can attack the wiring you can
you blow a fuse or you can cut a wire

649
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:08,970
somewhere

650
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:12,339
your N West found something else
interesting

651
00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:15,828
I somebody's devices have a

652
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:19,770
a little one or two wires that are
grounded

653
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:23,810
to indicate a green LED is successful
Swire for little chirp the year you got

654
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:24,828
in

655
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:29,320
well some others are tied into the same
relays that control the doors

656
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,119
and if you can back she died you can
supply run 12 volts or you can

657
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,910
shorted to the power to the reader they
might actually that door hardware let

658
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,000
you in

659
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,020
so something interesting and we'll see
if you doubt that the alarm sensors

660
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,300
a if they'd most powerful alarm systems

661
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,920
a pretty good they have a usually a
resistor in there somewhere

662
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,070
you for it either short out the wires
were cut from both those will trigger an

663
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:53,910
alarm

664
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:57,480
but some cheaper system that uses
digital pens are you might be able to

665
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,560
short out the

666
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,570
alarm wiring and have improperly read
that the doors close was really open

667
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:08,250
that sort of thing and wheels appeared
out another nasty attack that's probably

668
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,940
feel on any these

669
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:13,859
is a plan hai bol said something like a
stunning underplaying and 110

670
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:19,779
probably will just blow up a you know
component and just disable that reader

671
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:23,599
but you don't know if they don't have
good surge protection like fast UPS

672
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,070
transient suppression diodes in movies
and stuff

673
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:30,240
affecting get on the power bus into the
microcontroller

674
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,560
you might build a cost something in
particular happen like that you know

675
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:37,529
a register to get so high that opens the
door it's not predictable

676
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:42,030
but it could happen now the talking
themselves

677
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:45,200
the readers we discovered that

678
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,710
I your course anything that you contact
physically

679
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:53,750
its moral to vandalism to being you know
inscription wall and manipulated

680
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,990
I you can obviously you know vandalized
or cut wire isn't

681
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:00,680
juvenile service course you can clone

682
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,879
RFID and other tokens amy biehl's do
replay attacks

683
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,730
and skimmers are are valid threat that's
something that actually could be totally

684
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,820
passive you could have a lil overlay

685
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:16,109
that's powered by the feel the power
Zafar Freddie cards from the president

686
00:39:16,109 --> 00:39:19,549
and you can use that to you maybe powers
Cameron

687
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:24,170
and store this first organs and
community can use the reader's own feel

688
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:28,510
we also discovered that was his readers
have no collision protection

689
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:33,890
so mean if you have two or more tokens
physically within range

690
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:37,400
it can't read either them or me read the
first one

691
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,940
and then going to like a a lock state
where won't accept the second read

692
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,220
so you could glue down to also
conceivably and

693
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:49,270
to access a reader interesting things
like that

694
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:52,780
also you know we've live this before but
very skew systems have any kinda

695
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,140
protocol security

696
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:58,069
its clock and air weekend or serial data

697
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:02,930
you're really not anything that cannot
be trivially spoof replayed intercepted

698
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:07,700
you know passively or actively this is
is that you have this are usually is for

699
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,879
things like a

700
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,839
transit tokens security having a secure
payment systems

701
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:16,029
even one like the mobile speed past that
have encrypted in

702
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:19,680
have had papers published where their
alleged been broken so

703
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,828
I don't thing it relies on a master key
something like that should really be

704
00:40:23,829 --> 00:40:27,420
you know concert secure awesome is
access tokens

705
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,530
they all come in different formats you
know they have key fobs they have

706
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:34,210
implantable ship's side of the lower
left hand corner

707
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:38,010
I wallet cards are typically the larger
that device

708
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:42,310
the longer arrangement or something out
so the small devices have actually some

709
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:43,509
additional security

710
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:46,770
in that the don't work very well long
distances harder to

711
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:50,030
to power them up and get them to read up

712
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,670
that the prosecutor government has this
is actually very similar to these

713
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,410
knock-off

714
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,848
are fighting ships are used for
industrial applications

715
00:40:57,849 --> 00:41:01,500
but it has a and Sep 26 bits maybe
thirty four bits

716
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,200
in the key but they're very similar I'm

717
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,020
interceptions technique so the physical
hardware

718
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,230
we also found there's some things you
can do like the store magnets

719
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:15,650
typically they're stronger than door
frames themselves but

720
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:19,180
a turns out that putting a piece a paper
piece of tape

721
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,819
over thats a magnet produces a string to
radically

722
00:41:22,819 --> 00:41:26,410
certain inverse square thing it's
actually possible to put like some heavy

723
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:29,290
clear packing tape for contact paper
over at the looks

724
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:32,819
your clear same texture as the the
magnet

725
00:41:32,819 --> 00:41:36,329
and it reduces the door strength their
holdings think about 90 percent

726
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:40,730
so it looks like it's close we can kick
it over kinda interesting

727
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:44,440
there are some horse tracks maybe I'm
not very well made

728
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,800
non-ferrous materials in those are you
know possible to attack physically

729
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,829
destroyed

730
00:41:49,829 --> 00:41:53,030
but some others may have the possibility
via

731
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:56,470
you put in a strong magnetic hard drive
backed up to it and subverted

732
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:59,740
I might also be possible that will
shielded

733
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,890
to induce a current in its magnetic

734
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:06,410
on solo it strong up to open

735
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:10,328
and then this is the classic one the US
me refuses to go into a data center

736
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:12,490
somewhere in the los turkey or whatever

737
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:16,660
but the exit readers are almost always
installed in securely

738
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:20,450
I there are some guidelines like keeping
that the push tax a button six feet away

739
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,368
from the

740
00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:24,750
the door from the me a jam and things
like that they're never followed

741
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,250
most places BB they can be is a narrow
hallway whatever

742
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:32,270
but motion detectors me for a number of
ways into opening you can throw

743
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,349
something through the door

744
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:36,770
you can inflate a miler balloon under
the door cracked I heat up with a

745
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,140
hairdryer

746
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:43,560
I you can you access the buttons with a
special tool been outta some heavy wire

747
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,799
all those are possibilities and almost
always

748
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,109
security policies are implement such a
way

749
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:55,009
as you watch for and false alarms and
not sized

750
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:58,520
you know worry about absolute prevention
love someone getting through the exit

751
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,720
sensor

752
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,990
and so I thought it might be interesting
to bring some hardware

753
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:10,990
relax play show-and-tell and I and maybe
demo the system

754
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,880
good okay good okay

755
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,060
alright so what we have here

756
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,910
we have our person to allow domestic
partners in the access control

757
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:27,080
and this guy has a couple times

758
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,110
fashion here's a forest right

759
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:33,490
and we can do things like taken of race
car

760
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:37,839
you can swipe at he's gonna be we can
make unauthorized

761
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,000
car you can swipe arms

762
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,230
following trashed opens tells open

763
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:49,530
so there is a commercial Henry we can
you up slowly

764
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:52,600
good with singles tennis team

765
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:56,580
we have flown in here and we can clone
these shits this is a

766
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:00,170
fifty dollar a day fine you clearly have
oil wire

767
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:04,440
a couple passers me three ships on
workers believe you're hyper

768
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,190
and 32 card here with his mom was not
well

769
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:11,400
you put up to quell we redid

770
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:15,480
anonymity is rewriting attack this whole
issue 2

771
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,860
put that on there his longer than of
clone

772
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:23,550
okay you know doesn't listen

773
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:28,020
as one that uses knowledge you wish
because you don't listen

774
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,610
we can read up

775
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:35,970
takes just seconds included

776
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:40,740
an hour

777
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:44,020
though attackers really know

778
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:47,240
reasons can be in fall know it's an
apostate insurer

779
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:51,819
you know a day traders the you know like
to hang out or whatever

780
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:54,880
so you know if you can be really if we
read

781
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,980
II week-long you know we should offer is
not something

782
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:02,210
news wiring he's long way this is very
small

783
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:05,990
issue 22 gauge wires in like that is our
most popular current

784
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:10,990
it doesn't take a lot to yep you heard a
lot about protecting oneself

785
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:15,080
many up

786
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:19,200
we don't have all the alarm hopelessly
hooked up this but you can easily put

787
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:19,839
for

788
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,510
different zone alarm %uh sensors and and

789
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:26,580
you can experiment more with just
register as a resistor

790
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:30,660
ready for another way to do it we got
your own hands for you that were

791
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:34,109
for additional you know sensors to so

792
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:37,760
to live up to up

793
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,350
oilmen do not we also the log in this

794
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:44,480
so this is our server logging it's
really simple

795
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,210
you know it's just the 57 kill a bit a

796
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:53,490
serial over USB and we can turn into a
Linux Lagos that tales logs we have some

797
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:56,979
scripts the written up that are
published I'll let you do things like

798
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,010
pipe that's your learning system

799
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:02,400
our email or SMS you when someone comes
or goes

800
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,460
an alarm happens that really basic but

801
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:09,770
it's a gives you the capability irv
directly internet margarine ur

802
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:14,470
your cell phone or modem where you have
and we have those four relays

803
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:17,990
only to which are used for the door so
what others can easily go into our alarm

804
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:18,870
system as well

805
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:23,670
trigger the alarm monitoring company so

806
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:27,540
just the the last thing a.m. again we
have

807
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:31,779
are physical exploits we have the
capability have

808
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:35,400
you know initially met you in the wiring
doing horrible things with the data in

809
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,230
transit

810
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:40,600
I you intercepting every plane it we can
do and I'll service in a number of ways

811
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,890
these things up the contactless readers
in some ways

812
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:47,730
are better because we can put all her
reading behind the glass sir

813
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:51,420
insider perimeter but we have you know
obviously new

814
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:55,310
problems with me know what intercepted
out people's pockets lunch boxes

815
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:58,390
I so if you were

816
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:02,290
are curious about you know the the
engineering behind out and you know how

817
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:02,860
you can

818
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:06,550
projects how much range you can get how
much power way I actually was able to

819
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:07,320
find one

820
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:12,160
engineering textbook an RFID that's on
here knots or third entry down those are

821
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,060
pretty hamburgers translate from German

822
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:17,799
school but weird but I guess you are
interesting info

823
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,160
and I highly recommend this book
security engineering by Ross Anderson

824
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,569
this really has everything from physical
security to building secure embedded

825
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:27,620
systems

826
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:30,990
to secure networking pretty neat stuff

827
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:34,180
and last book in the bottom

828
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:37,359
I there's an interesting projects in
there that

829
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:42,190
you can implement as just a hobby hacker
type our fight each weighs

830
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:47,240
this guy I'm all graphs tra actually
implanted in the AM 1400 ship

831
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:51,410
in his hand and wired up everything from
his car to his house to open from that

832
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:56,350
so there soon as the Libyan it pretty
interesting and that we have a few good

833
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:59,279
links to their protocols for some stuff
for published

834
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,610
up the man the middle attack but I
mentioned

835
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:06,860
that sack franken Def Con 15 player 1
2007

836
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:10,010
we have %uh some these documents from

837
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:13,360
the CSEA and that's basically Nancy
working group

838
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,160
and since other stuff about smart card
the your water bill is

839
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,350
and some other interesting stuff about
just

840
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:23,520
president general on last thing

841
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,870
you can download the code everything
evil files

842
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:30,330
the design there'd be no source code Sol
right there

843
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:35,200
up the Google could link and doesn't
have any questions

844
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,910
yes sir he s lockheed access

845
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:42,259
so that's not a problem at the best you
can do you

846
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,520
is logged out the door opened a certain
time some

847
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,870
the door hardware house a specific
sensor inside

848
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:52,330
that is tripped in the event of a key
physically turn it in

849
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:55,350
but that's not so that's something that
felt the mechanicals

850
00:48:55,350 --> 00:49:00,380
a you know the really the only reliable
thing is determine the state at the door

851
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:04,530
for the state a motion detector outside
a bit we call that a request to exit if

852
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:05,770
it's on the inside

853
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:09,930
and that generally is logged in most
alarm systems where they

854
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:13,629
are are actually correlating is someone
tributes answer

855
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:17,510
with us a request to exit but the let
you out regardless of whether you trip

856
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:21,600
sensor

857
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,160
a anything else yessir

858
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,410
integrating with the you know the alarm
system have you found any lets in

859
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:29,950
residential commercial any

860
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:33,029
legal issues with that our insurance
issues are things with integrating with

861
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:33,690
680

862
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:37,950
here something I got his or her dream
Kate will be integrated with easily

863
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:42,879
to other yeah he's wage make that happen
is to basically asked for a dry contact

864
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,770
loop

865
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:46,890
most of the arm vendors are okay with

866
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:50,790
giving you an on/off contact that you
know trying out on our break in that

867
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:51,790
connection

868
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:56,130
will tripped the alarm people use out
for things like I let see

869
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:59,120
monitoring their freezer if you have a
grocery store you know you want the

870
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:02,330
alarm to go off if the freezer quit
working so they don't lose

871
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:06,140
ten thousand dollars worth of seafood on
you can get it for you like the

872
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:10,379
a sensor that you to text her basement
is flooded so generally they're friendly

873
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,130
without

874
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:13,730
I don't think they care so much what's
on the other end as long as it doesn't

875
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:16,140
put hibels a gender scripture system

876
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:19,600
that that's why I found common thing
yeah it's pretty columns

877
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:23,380
unusual request smaller cities may not
have enough zones are

878
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:26,880
you know the system that you for free I
wouldn't count on it but any

879
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,360
quality systems fall by pro should be
have able to do that

880
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:34,110
most them have a panic button control
alaska point you could you have to

881
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:38,640
stupidest kinda controlling time for
that

882
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,830
and I'm one more question yeah you talk
about you know how can somebody like

883
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,150
this

884
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:48,270
the keep them losses and I got its on
how how successful is up in second

885
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:52,280
you know had mister been repeated a few
times and

886
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,520
also the one working currently is the
Herschel électronique scramble powered

887
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,460
those are available all over EVA and
they're cheap because the only operate

888
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,250
with guess what

889
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:04,500
first electronic space station's so we
have to find a rebuilt

890
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:08,290
up their circuit board that's really the
only time you can have success

891
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:11,450
I think according to those that
particular I had a

892
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:16,790
up a one-time programmable Intel 8051
CPU that with all the fee to the fuse is

893
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:17,130
blown

894
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:21,150
you count them thrown out a bit and it's
dead silent until you hook up to this

895
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:22,330
device that

896
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:26,470
arsons 300 heard supple seeing square
wave along with some

897
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:29,500
white forces here and there for about
five seconds and will bring light comes

898
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,950
on telling you it's working

899
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:34,490
so not secure protocol but an obscure
protocol

900
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:38,839
and something like a logic analyzer like
the analogic project knows baseball

901
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:43,290
can help you to cut that that one also a
little bit unfortunate city code because

902
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:46,640
it's a 24 volt plus 12 months full
signal

903
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,299
so we'll see it's a build some notables
divider

904
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:53,570
or some protection so the to block logic
analyzer

905
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:57,730
but that one we think is doable a some
the other ones that have a real

906
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:00,800
you know security challenge response for
a call those may not be

907
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:07,260
so so easy but I think they're all
within range happily

908
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:11,540
the 11 put a you hit system in there and
their apart near the garage now I mean

909
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:16,720
Stoli tools is within range

910
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:21,430
INR toll

911
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:24,750
units LV or the min

912
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:28,790
good question yeah we actually up
ordered about a dozen boards

913
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:32,490
and we have a spares & kits available so

914
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:36,060
we've been signed those that the 23 be
shop I am will be there

915
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:39,710
you know Sunday a we will have some

916
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:43,780
so it's all over 100 bucks shipped and
will the

917
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:50,780
also was really busting on who attended
player on

918
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:56,340
anybody else and more I got it but no
that's the

919
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,520
working all at once the readers to you
know I love you

920
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:03,680
were altman's to use of the word on or
do we know

921
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:07,910
no I readers other readers are available
all over

922
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:11,839
YouTube a from water China vendors Hong
Kong Taiwan

923
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:15,590
they're gonna sell for between $20 and
$50 dollars each

924
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:20,020
there's a actually nice lawn I was in
the version 1.0

925
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:23,410
that one will will get you both the PIN
pad

926
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:26,649
and an indoor reader and it's like 16
bucks for shipping its

927
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:30,410
mister cheap

928
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:34,960
yes we do so there there's a wiki at the
Google Code link

929
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,510
and that will show you at every to rate
their it's like 16 bucks if you see it

930
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:43,190
is still a good for but the that the
wiki has a lot of stuff on wiring and

931
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:45,090
debugging and building a thing

932
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:48,460
and you we didn't find some other you
know

933
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:53,510
information was interesting I'll all the
import is your readers work fine in our

934
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:56,700
your voice heard deploying these couple
others pay some

935
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,220
but sum up the expensive commercial
brands like kid

936
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:04,220
didn't work reliably we discovered the
Sen faster pulses and

937
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:07,339
might be a little bit under spec for
what you know we had a

938
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:10,680
we thought we'd have that the standard
is in

939
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,509
is always published so if you doubt
there's more grounds you can put a

940
00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:16,630
couple bounces on there and pretty much
any reader works is fine

941
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:20,360
really anything that speaks why can't 26
if you just you

942
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:24,350
you may search for white and or W 26
you'll find loads have compatible

943
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:27,520
readers intercoms

944
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,009
yes he demonstrated his %uh across one

945
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:34,640
from result that is not approx mark this
is a must dahmer

946
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,190
single-purpose devices and what this
does

947
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:41,390
is it lets you simply I

948
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:45,359
clone EM 4140 10 to tags:

949
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:49,140
they're one of the the cheaper
industrial tax that's available

950
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:52,480
me open standards in and cheap

951
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,550
but there's no reason that can be done
what other phone Peace Research

952
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:59,880
and affinities Hockaday I know 12 people
read

953
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,580
on if you saw the duct tape RFID tag but
the

954
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:06,590
someone sick a just small aid

955
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:09,800
pin at Mill CPU think it's the

956
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:14,230
AVR 85 and the attach a couple
capacitors a live wire

957
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:18,090
and made the busy and are ready to give
you later

958
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:22,110
we actually but when his last minute a
up the shop last night and will confront

959
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,280
or a bit every

960
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,390
clone another tag under so that one

961
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:31,549
will do both should cards and the in
1402 they're very similar this is all

962
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:32,710
the different coding

963
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:36,910
so there's no reason I think that can be
extended to other types the cards

964
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:41,480
that opinion as well exactly yeah can as
well as not about it it's a second

965
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,380
factor

966
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:46,010
authentication with Laura integration
alarm system it has nothing to do with

967
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:47,770
it is another option

968
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:51,820
I about sort of thing %uh surveillance
your cameras the lot of sight

969
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:57,160
all those you know represent defense in
depth

970
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,370
yes word your system every into

971
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:04,370
I know some a security camera DVR stuff
alarm

972
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:08,509
porcelain as well so could be integrated
into something like that so that

973
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:12,290
it would do the motion to table as well
so if it has

974
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:15,540
like a port for motion detector that
would be a dry eye contact and that

975
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,580
would be easy to generate

976
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:24,490
if it doesn't on it there might be other
residents for software

977
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:31,490
think which is about as I'm for anything
else its

978
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,430
and %uh decide should be available
online

979
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:43,430
up you know probably right after the
conference

980
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:50,750
with that

981
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,790
no reason you can't

982
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:53,400
I'm just lazy
