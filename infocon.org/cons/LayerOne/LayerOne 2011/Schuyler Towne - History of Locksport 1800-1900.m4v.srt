who is this gentleman in his moshe poem

72
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,720

what time period where to deliver what

73
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,780
you doing work I am primarily
Pennsylvania little New York some new

74
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,530
england staff

75
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,610
I'm and I'm I think like thirteenth
generation

76
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,299
just in Vermont where I grew up like an
old farming family

77
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:15,060
and my father business and yeah he's one
of Ireland's you know a branch but

78
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,070
is definitely one of ours which was
really interesting so I started learning

79
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,139
a lot more about Kenny Robinson town in
his father's in

80
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,820
so on and so forth and a lot more about
wanna see all junior the person that he

81
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,790
was in business web

82
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,110
now when I first found out about them um

83
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,790
I didn't wait understand the time when I
thought leader in business together for

84
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,500
a long time and developed all sorts of
interesting things

85
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,610
they knew each other for like three
months unwanted children had died

86
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,229
I he died Christmas Day 1868

87
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:50,539
and they had only establish the business

88
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,720
them I think late summer early fall

89
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,090
1868 good news so a lot of the things
that

90
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,190
I find most interesting about the lock
development actually came as a result of

91
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,070
my

92
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:09,710
a investor who didn't always make the
best decisions I've been somewhere locks

93
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,900
would not be the prevailing locks in
america

94
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,250
were it not for the fact that this guy
died I'm despite him being the

95
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:15,860
progenitor

96
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,370
the modern contemporary lockheed
genuinely believe that any lock

97
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,680
but took a key could not be perfectly
secure I

98
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,979
and had begun work on many other things
when he passed away

99
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:29,900
and then having robbins and tail
downtown 7 businessman said I have

100
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,239
picked up a large for everyone

101
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,460
I and that's what we had for the next
150 years

102
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,440
okay so I a lot of what I'm gonna talk
about today has to do with this man

103
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,850
Alfred Charles Hobbs I am

104
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,850
I'm from beard I'm jealous I

105
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:53,740
he was a lock designer a lock picker
would go on to do all sorts of other

106
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,539
things

107
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:58,430
I am go to quite a bit about him and his
history but first

108
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,580
I want to set the stage for the period
of time

109
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,310
II that I'm talking about in general
everything was going on at the Great

110
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,240
exhibition

111
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,479
1851 this is the Crystal Palace which

112
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,099
at the time ham was but one of the most
remarkable

113
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,930
architectural achievements ever carried
out is kinda modern wonder the world at

114
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:18,690
the time

115
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:23,130
I all glass and enormous and kept around
for a very long time

116
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:27,690
I found the records about a decade about
a decade later oven English club team

117
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:32,110
the soccer who were FC Crystal Palace
who is made up

118
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,370
above the groundskeepers and the Crystal
Palace a decade after the exhibition had

119
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,780
happened so they kept around for

120
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,979
incredibly long time I am and I dunno I
mean

121
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:44,159
my friends and I often joke that foreign
countries might not even exist we get on

122
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,120
the plane we get off everybody's talking
funny I've never been to england is

123
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,060
probably still there I know nothing
about that

124
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,830
my actual knowledge on the subject is
incredibly narrow some gonna talk about

125
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,039
agricultural implements and yachts I
know nothing about any of them

126
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,210
I'm just here to tell you some stories
so

127
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:05,780
I am when the exhibition first kicked
off

128
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,960
the I the papers is ripped us

129
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,969
apart could quote this is from the times
of london

130
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,479
if the Americans view x8 a smile it is
by their pretensions

131
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,080
when they do come out of their province
in rugged utility in entering the

132
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,219
competition with European elegance

133
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,979
they do certainly make themselves
ridiculous their furniture is great task

134
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:33,150
their carriages in harness our
gingerbread their carpets are tawdry

135
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:37,000
their patchwork quilt surpass even the
invariable

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,759
ugliness love this fabric their cut
glass is clumsy their piano sounds like

137
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,090
the sound of nothing but

138
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,489
Ironwood their book binding is that a
journeyman working on his own account in

139
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:49,289
English market town

140
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:53,210
their dick gay wrote aids are the
sternest in gloomiest

141
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,448
evolved Aguero tapes

142
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:59,289
they're printed gallagher's are such as
our housemates would not think it

143
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:00,530
respectable to wear

144
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:04,318
even their ingenuity great as it is
becomes ridiculous when it ends

145
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,669
competition with europe

146
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:08,919
double pianos a combination of a piano
and violin

147
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:13,240
a chair with a cigar case on its back
and other mongrel constructions

148
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,470
belong to a people the would be sent
orders and Merman if they could

149
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,440
and are always rebelling against the
Trammell the VAT

150
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,069
to which I say: yeah

151
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:30,770
I would be a center in a heartbeat if I
could I

152
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,179
so we really were ripped up hard in the

153
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,708
in the weeks leading up to the gate
exhibition I have many many many more a

154
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,958
long long ridiculous quotes about how
much they hate us

155
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,849
I am the the idea though was I'm gonna
go back to

156
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,459
that arena pic I the idea there really
was that

157
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:52,439
we were not really yet long separated
from the mother country

158
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,029
a.m. they'd had no idea

159
00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:00,779
if we were any good at anything idea
seems to be bumpkins we had an enormous

160
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:04,390
space at the Great Exhibition where ADM
where

161
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,750
America on Lake almost every other
nation there

162
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,730
the state the government of America had
nothing to do with the presentation of

163
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,200
the exhibits

164
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,570
everything there was presented purely on
the

165
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,010
I'm bid you knew them the money et
cetera et cetera

166
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:25,890
presentation skills ABI individual
engineers and artists and presenters

167
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,480
however somehow we got an enormous
amount of space an enormous amount of

168
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,040
space

169
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,699
and we barely filled it there is very
little actually a merit to the point

170
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,660
that France

171
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,760
just started like taking over a section
in our area

172
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,399
and presenting a much a French stuff in
the American section I am

173
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,570
it was a high I wish that

174
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,830
I wish they were images above the time
you know I wish they were

175
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,430
the nominal photographers because this
is great description of this

176
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:55,060
enormous gilded Eagle

177
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:00,010
that was over our exhibition looking
glaring at other nations and talk about

178
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,560
how aggressive and angry it is

179
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,089
I am but America man yeah okay

180
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:10,550
so they basically said you know you guys
don't know what the hell you doing

181
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,660
welcome to the party idiots from

182
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,839
result thanks for having us your party
let's show you some of the stuff that we

183
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,160
brought

184
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,410
so in agriculture this I think may be
reaping machine and I have no idea

185
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,290
what's going on a missed some

186
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,439
illustration I am you

187
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,440
I I but the

188
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,829
the first big test American engineering
where the agricultural tests

189
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:40,949
I and so we had a great play out in a
couple of interesting reaping machines

190
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,070
so the first test took place at the

191
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,500
some farmers the state whose name I
can't remember I am

192
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,800
they came up there with the plows and
people that had been

193
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,479
members and and newspapermen been coming
around looking at the american pie was

194
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,399
the next mission

195
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,329
and saying that sure is one tiny player
yet gotten there

196
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:04,329
and you know ed even if it could cut the
ground which we doubt as soon as it hits

197
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:05,779
the Rockets gonna shattered

198
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:09,240
good luck so we go up there

199
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,360
everybody's plowing the British are
plowing we get out there to plow

200
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,730
my of phenomenal one-horse toes are
plowed to some guys staying on the back

201
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,750
to plow

202
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,810
the one horse thing i think is actually
really important but again I don't know

203
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,010
how any of this works

204
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:28,630
I but in the big improvement from what
the British were showing an hour and we

205
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,300
cut

206
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,050
these beautiful rough-hewn burrows to
enter the judges say I your furrows are

207
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,170
too rough they could be much cleaner
like I lovely british blouse

208
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:41,890
jewish the British Burma say middle know
if there to clean we have to really

209
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:42,519
break them

210
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:46,870
as we're planting we will buy all your
classmates American ma'am

211
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,260
and they bought up a time to play out as
the british farmers are now using

212
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,399
American plows and there's this

213
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,490
slain tone shifted Minister Singh top

214
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,779
would like those idiots know how to do
one thing good for them

215
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:04,630
I am had clear paraphrasing Victorians
were both turbo sim

216
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:08,800
incredibly eloquent reading Victoria
research records is just

217
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,959
that inspiring except the same horrible
things went with them

218
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:16,029
I'm so then the reaping machine sleeping
machines realism

219
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:19,829
really big turning point we visited the
corn

220
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:23,989
which I was recently told actually just
means the most common green a particular

221
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,529
place i think is actually we'd

222
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:28,850
I and we didn't dream the

223
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:34,940
hmm skies are pouring down rain is the
worst conditions for reaping

224
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,050
during the test then and there owner of
the farm in the judges they're there to

225
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,019
judge everything say well you know

226
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:44,470
one we hold the reaping off until
another day there's a buncha British

227
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,889
Reapers and and two Americans

228
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:50,209
anti-american say oh hell no worry been
today

229
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:54,859
come hell or high water so the first
review machine goes out and promptly

230
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,230
breaks and doesn't have anything
whatsoever

231
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,420
and so now even the British guys who
were kinda excited to read say IRA we'll

232
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,120
do this another day

233
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,250
remaining American with his reading
machine says

234
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,899
have no no I came here to repent I am
going to reap

235
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:14,880
everything but

236
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,939
by much work lately and he does though
he believes

237
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:22,360
is reaping machine is truly everywhere
early career it's supposed to go

238
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,519
one or the other and I've no idea how
this works but its everything

239
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,490
wake mad nobody can believe it's the
worst conditions

240
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,959
in this thing is amazing the British are
buying are reaping machines

241
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,779
we win medals from the jurors and now
there's there's a significant tone

242
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:40,420
changed the papers saying you know what

243
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:45,240
maybe their art sucks maybe the Indians
in the sciences

244
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,120
but they have an entire continent they
need to plow and read

245
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,649
so it would be good if us to pay
attention to what they have achieved in

246
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:54,930
agriculture

247
00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:00,290
very nice of them but then the yachts

248
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:04,349
now the yachts so Big Creek press

249
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,209
people were actually paying attention to
this yacht this is the actually at this

250
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:09,209
time I haven't

251
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:13,449
someone's idea what's going on here I am
you were paying attention to this as was

252
00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:16,930
being built because they're exploiting
new ideas and not making them

253
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,209
and the the British got culture we're
interested to see what the Americans

254
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:22,849
were gonna bring over here

255
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:27,079
guy brings his yacht over aptly called
the america

256
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:30,920
and immediately started challenging
people the racist earn a little money

257
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,969
I'm literally destroying like bet with
other yachtsman I'm he has won a race

258
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:39,410
killed the guy gets you know gets a
little scrilla

259
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:43,870
I am and and nobody will race with him
again

260
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,260
so the there's a big race held now a

261
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,350
I think it was 41 British ships

262
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:54,250
and to be america and this is the first
year and is a regular is that every year

263
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,519
this is the first year they decided to
make an international event

264
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,790
I but again it was just the bishops and
the American no other nation under

265
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:05,469
I between came out the Queen's barge
came out I was a big lakes elementary

266
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,839
atmosphere

267
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,990
is a 53 mile race around a couple
violins

268
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:13,820
a and and there'll be people set up
having parties at the different islands

269
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,199
and

270
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:17,839
a lot of people in smaller vessels that
would try to tag along side the ships as

271
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:18,430
they

272
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,930
as they sailed out to keep track at the
races parties everywhere

273
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,519
Greek really excited atmosphere

274
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,269
be america started off with a fouled
anchor

275
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:32,920
so immediately things are going for
refusing to back to back finally got

276
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,709
going

277
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:36,739
but by the time they're coming around
the first time and she's already in the

278
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,360
middle of the pack

279
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,380
any notes from the people there say no
look at the American she's doing okay

280
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,589
she's she's in the middle a packet for a
very good for her

281
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:49,459
come back around some you know another
another batch island in boats

282
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:53,029
know somewhere in the top like three or
four ships

283
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:57,949
nerd tackle on tackle on going great I
am 34 ships he was a wealthy Americans

284
00:15:57,949 --> 00:15:59,849
keeping up with our best

285
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,910
boats this is amazing this great great
for her she's keeping up she's keeping

286
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,410
up

287
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:08,829
and then we won by seven miles

288
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:12,779
he was a 53 mile race and we won it by
seven

289
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:16,180
models it will I it was crazy

290
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:20,399
as we're pulling in to cross the finish
line the race is still going on

291
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,899
we search across the Queen's barge been
lowered the colors

292
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:29,009
everybody comes out onto the deck of the
ship and takes their hats off about

293
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:30,300
their head to the Queen's

294
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,019
well the race is still happening the
next day in the newspapers this and that

295
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,290
this was akin to a jockey and horse race

296
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:40,849
stopping before the finish line to waive
the audience but they looked at the

297
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:41,990
British love it

298
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:45,100
there's a guy with his own private
militia apparently all see the finish

299
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,180
line who witnessed this

300
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,709
and he has his militia like firing up
shot the celebration

301
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:55,189
I'm is a huge event and again we won by
seven mile so when people would be

302
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,120
coming in we cross the finish line

303
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,680
there's this shelf that goes out ok hun
me america

304
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,688
Louis CK no no I'm

305
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:09,150
up I'm confident is where we got the
idea from

306
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:13,189
a but the American Crew for cultured

307
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:16,770
so this race is now called the America's
Cup so many here wonder why I got that

308
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:17,910
name amen

309
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:22,929
I am there's no a very serious changing
the tone of the newspapers

310
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:25,839
I'm and they've also been taking notice
many people there are some amazing

311
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,639
people there

312
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,140
good year was there showcasing his india
rubber Globes and who knows what these

313
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,080
will become

314
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,178
I Morse was there all sorts and

315
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,280
huge things were happening in this one
can have watershed

316
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,309
year but when we won the yacht race

317
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:46,570
and that significantly agricultural
implements goddess

318
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,850
a lotta respect from a lot of workmen
yachts were beloved

319
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:55,129
as both the sciences are by an entirely
different class of people in England

320
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:59,919
and all the sudden the newspapers were
saying okay America

321
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,980
you guys really bright you guys read
some interesting step in the start huh

322
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,530
the high waiting summer other
contributions

323
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:09,700
some people even going so far as to say
know we're contributing

324
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:14,530
more to the well being a big one more to
English industry than any other nation

325
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,850
that was there

326
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,129
these great exhibitions World Fairs
things like that they're not held the

327
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,549
show off what you can do

328
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:27,549
they're held to draw all the best things
from every other country to you

329
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,390
so enter EC Hobbs

330
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:37,919
I'm a little background on Hobbs he was

331
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,679
a phenomenal lock picker he works for
the third annual companies showing their

332
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,370
parent optic lock which

333
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:46,989
I have read here last year's the ferret
out the clock I'm not going to go into

334
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,870
much in the way of Engineering during
the stock as I really just trying to

335
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,149
tell these people stories

336
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,260
I you can possibly do that for a little
bit we can talk about it more like to

337
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,770
kill it later if you like

338
00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:00,690
I but ACM's working for day in new law
he had established himself as the

339
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,530
a excellent engineer but also a
phenomenal lock picker

340
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:08,049
I even as obituary they allude more to
his walk picking than any other

341
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:09,120
achievement he

342
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,530
he carried out his life in particular
they highly

343
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:17,450
before the Great Exhibition of 1851 his
biggest accomplishment in america

344
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,679
now he made a name for himself by going
around to different banks in saying to

345
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:21,640
the bank director

346
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,720
if I can pick the lock in your vault you
have to buy my lock

347
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,220
and a bigger example show or whatever
and he sold

348
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,960
a lot a lot now

349
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,410
it's also important to note before we
before explain how he tested against

350
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,250
these long to what the nature testing
was

351
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:45,450
he talked very briefly about Joseph
Brahma jurors a bromo

352
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,429
the whose born in the 1700 Russa
mid-fifties

353
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:52,660
and by 1784 he patented his

354
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,380
safety lock now the safety lock was a
really important change in physical

355
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,799
security was not the first

356
00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:01,270
leather-based lock but was be first
leather-based lock

357
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:05,440
should be mass-produced was the first
walk in general have mass production

358
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,330
techniques applied to it

359
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,408
and now for the first time well

360
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,950
for the first time you could buy a walk
because once before this were

361
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,900
bespoke pieces they weren't you know
individually wrought by a locksmith

362
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,890
what Smith's used to sniff walks
actually made locks

363
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,970
so if you want to get a lock made a
decent locka locka might offer you some

364
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,200
someone some protection

365
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,840
and even then not much you'd be shelling
out

366
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,570
new modern equivalent to Blake two to
four thousand pounds

367
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:41,649
well was selling his safety lock for the
monochrome about 25 pounds

368
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:44,700
now all the sudden everybody could have
a lock locks are being put on

369
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,020
everything I'm you know your little Foot
Locker at the end of the bed centered

370
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,429
centered

371
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:52,049
even then the idea of putting a walk on
the door

372
00:20:52,049 --> 00:20:55,408
like a lower or middle class home that

373
00:20:55,409 --> 00:20:58,210
even took a little while before that
really happened was on portable devices

374
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,059
in particular that I'm

375
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,000
initially got locked supply them
additionally this was the first time in

376
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,460
history

377
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:09,020
where a locksmith could make a lock for
you hand it to you and say

378
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:15,158
though I made this I cannot break it

379
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:18,580
security by obscurity was the only game
in town for the first

380
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,750
thirty-five hundred years a block
development

381
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,730
if you made the lock you had to open it
and the person who made the lock or just

382
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,440
had to trust that you were going to

383
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,330
nor that you're going to share the
secret that few this sorry

384
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,178
is his safety lock this vault version a
bit with many many many many time

385
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:36,700
where's

386
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:41,640
I'm the at home version ended up being
dramatically less

387
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,970
nobody knew security made security was
88 the

388
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:49,049
potentially life-threatening quagmire as
much as we the 16th

389
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:54,049
so Louis was an avid locksmith himself
he was trained by the master locksmith

390
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:55,150
good name

391
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,770
arm give me a made for him the

392
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:02,520
ir be I'm what the fair

393
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,650
their ego thats louise had to marry the
skeleton attached to his body

394
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:10,990
I am so gimme made him this beautiful
walk to where

395
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:14,880
Louis kept a lot I'm state secrets and
personal papers

396
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,000
and things that be a you know

397
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,460
not very kind courts the French
Revolution deemed to be treasonous

398
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,320
now the reason they were able to get
access to that is because as it turns

399
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,658
out good name

400
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:29,909
totally went revolutionary when the
revolution came I

401
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:33,020
and shared with them the secret of the
operation and the lock

402
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,840
remained not over matlock for themself
he just explain to them how to walk

403
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,080
function

404
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,330
and knowing back was more than enough or

405
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:44,730
well exactly know if not more than half
its what you need I'm knowing that is

406
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,020
enough to open a walk

407
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:51,980
so when Brahma terrified this next like
to play at a rate

408
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:56,230
him yes um this is difficult to read or
heard from the screen

409
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:59,950
when Brahma made to the safety lock

410
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,990
he created the idea that a lot could be
impenetrable

411
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:08,200
that the only thing you needed to
obscure was the actual building up your

412
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,169
key

413
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:13,299
the by studying your own so wonder you
would not be able to understand how to

414
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:14,570
open somebody else's

415
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:19,889
this is the birth the bad idea and it's
a huge idea

416
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:24,960
so in their store in Piccadilly they had
a directly relatively small padlock

417
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,309
with him I am I think pleaded on it not
described on it

418
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:32,559
this the artist who can make an
instrument that will pick

419
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,070
or openness walk shall receive $200 give
me the moment it is produced

420
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:40,580
applications in writing only Brahmas
patton locks

421
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,309
caution the public is respectfully
informed

422
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:48,730
that every walk made by Brahma is
stamped with their address

423
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:52,100
124 pick it up I'm the important part of
course being

424
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:57,350
the top this was in their Piccadilly
store front from

425
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,149
return A+B eighteen hundreds to

426
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:05,140
to 1851 and even then a new one was put
in the window not long after

427
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,720
pubs manages to pick the spoiler alert
I'll tell the story about

428
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,289
I am in the 1820 is there is an
incredibly serious attack on this lock

429
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:15,770
by a British engineer

430
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:20,139
that British engineer was given 30 days
to work on this lock

431
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,620
if you think about the way in which we
test walks now

432
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,049
first of all they really tested for
surreptitious entry anyway I'm and even

433
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:30,129
then we talk about destructive ensure
whatever else we're

434
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:33,980
you know asking for five minutes
resistance maybe 10 minutes resistance

435
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,529
15 whatever the case may be

436
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:40,260
in fact even in places where they do
test researchers entry such as Japan

437
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:45,750
the top level testing the top level and
resistance max that fifteen minutes

438
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,000
so to get 30 days with the lock

439
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,710
is entirely about the idea that a lot
can be impenetrable

440
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:57,960
so the British engineer returns lock
holy unmolested completely on open

441
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,809
completely unable to pick a um

442
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:06,100
so reenter

443
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:12,149
pops so in america to there's a lot of
testing going on the blocks

444
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:16,909
and wall brahmana had one very serious
test in the eighteen twenties in america

445
00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:20,750
we were testing walks wake 30 and we'll
talk a little more about that with a

446
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,529
quote from the times one again

447
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:26,200
I'm in a bit but in particular Hobbs

448
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,600
BB highlight of his career in America
before he went over to England

449
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,299
was that he went to the merchants
Exchange in New York to test against

450
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,379
their bolt lock

451
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:38,740
made offered five hundred dollars to any
man who given 30 days

452
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:45,679
could open their fault hubs rolled in
and did in an hour

453
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,700
he was changing the game

454
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,070
so he goes over to England I am

455
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:56,240
when it s the next light here nope I
okay he goes over to England

456
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,049
and you have thought I was getting this
in the lockpick village is a lot worse

457
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:02,870
I'm trying to be better for you people

458
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:06,899
I am he goes over there and immediately

459
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,779
gets to play with beach %uh block no
chip made a phenomenal detector lock

460
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:16,029
I am that is actually ed fairly secure
lock very difficult to pick

461
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:19,620
but he'd get his hands on want to be
exhibitionism is as I mister how absurd

462
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,809
what you can do can you pick the strut
luck

463
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:25,460
and he picks it for them right there the
exhibition is a big to do

464
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,770
and there's a more formal test against
the Chubb walk it'll happen later on

465
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:31,940
needless to say he once again opens it
and this was a

466
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,630
a a man's private vault I'm ready to
jump detector lock installed on it

467
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:41,029
and once again hubs opens in an hour
jump freaks out takes to ads in

468
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:43,950
newspapers for the next decade saying he
didn't do it

469
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:48,400
I am which was great for before Hobbs
cuz he stayed over there

470
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,909
picking up blocks in selling is out in
fact slate engine but has more to do

471
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:54,169
with Walkman yachts do

472
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:57,570
sobil enjoy it I am he had at

473
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:01,379
he got a third call from somebody who
said it you know I we lost our key the

474
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,590
shower block was a bank

475
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:06,799
I we desperately need to get inside the
vault 32 we went over to job

476
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,549
and they said they could not make a new
key for us or possibly get into the

477
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:14,549
vault can you help us so he sent out

478
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:17,639
a one of his boys to go and make
measurements

479
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,230
above the over the ball came back gave
him all the measurements he shows up

480
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,020
with his tools

481
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,289
opens in under an hour take sides sells
them

482
00:27:25,289 --> 00:27:28,760
you know how block which is now what
he's calling the pair top the clock

483
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,929
today a new roommate he

484
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:33,230
the moving going to just started selling
the pair topic locked calling at the hob

485
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,830
block and made his fortune over the next
15 years

486
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:40,710
I've been a new company over folded over
here in America

487
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:44,330
so but the real test is against the
Brahma

488
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:47,779
and brown also handles this a lot better
I am

489
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:52,020
where chubb flips out taking out ads in
newspapers showing up to mechanics

490
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,029
institutes in

491
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:56,320
saying that it never happened and trying
to get another test going up Saturday

492
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,418
Federer Brahm upon being defeated

493
00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:03,039
paid up that too and getting so

494
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,169
hubs goes over says I would like to test

495
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:11,919
on the brown a lock the Piccadilly 1

496
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,450
he has the eight absolute ideal
conditions for working there

497
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,600
absolutely ideal be mountain a

498
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,570
wooden block for him so that it's a
movable and he has

499
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:26,020
access to his tools again he gets 30
days

500
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:30,139
to test against this lock on those
thirty days he worked about 14% above

501
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,779
those 14 days

502
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:36,620
he had about 51 hours I actually working
with the lock

503
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,739
after 51 hours

504
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,500
especially when we look at the other
things that he managed to accomplish

505
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,279
before this

506
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:47,950
if you can 51 hours to finally defeat
this lock

507
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:52,669
but he did and once defeated he'd been
able to design a tool that would allow

508
00:28:52,669 --> 00:28:55,039
him to rapidly reproduce the attack

509
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,379
so the jurors notice there is open he
walked in for them a couple days later

510
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,630
the reconvened and he picked it

511
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,640
right in front of them and closed it
again to the 51 hours was basically

512
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,640
research time to build a tool

513
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,809
the Hobbs pic is actually now it is more
often referred to as the two in one pic

514
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:12,830
in a still a people used to pick lever
locks today

515
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:16,830
not much has changed much 150 years

516
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,510
Brahma to their credit not only pay up

517
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,840
but additionally update a walk

518
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,408
and put a new one at Piccadilly window
within the month

519
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:31,000
with the same inscription on

520
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,730
there'd the handle it famously so

521
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:39,299
this moment was a phenomenal change

522
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:43,309
in both be British and American Sentinel
self-esteem

523
00:29:43,309 --> 00:29:46,889
know it was kinda a you know like that

524
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:53,409
I'm in particular

525
00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:58,710
from a newspaper in america camera one
america still webster laurels in England

526
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,899
in addition to making the fastest yachts
the best plan house

527
00:30:01,899 --> 00:30:05,459
the most serviceable reaping machine
that centered cetera

528
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,799
she can now boast about doing the world
in picking locks

529
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,039
the distinction is a somewhat
questionable character generally the

530
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:13,279
persons who have been most

531
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,049
expert at this business have not enjoyed
the highest degree of respect and

532
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:19,850
confidence society at large

533
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:23,908
nationally however the prejudice does
not seem to obtain

534
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:27,970
England seems to think just as much a
bus and even a little more

535
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:31,360
although we have beaten her in
everything and picked

536
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,500
her locks besides up

537
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,649
cash I all of that

538
00:30:37,649 --> 00:30:41,559
that sentence for me make you may ever
write a book about pride being picked

539
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:43,370
her locks besides

540
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:47,928
in England and this is actually only
about a week after the Upper East

541
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:52,340
finished but we're dove what hobson done
started reaching the press

542
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:58,220
so we're already finally fairly
well-respected

543
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,850
nope that one is a long one

544
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:05,230
I'm gonna interrupt that Trenton treated
for head

545
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:09,860
we believe before the exhibition opened
but we had the best locks in the world

546
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:13,820
and among us Brahma and shove were
reckoned quite is impregnable as Gerber

547
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,399
alter

548
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,739
more so indeed for the Kiev the
Mediterranean was taken by us

549
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,090
but none among us could penetrate into
the locks and shoot the ball to these

550
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:23,830
makers

551
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:28,059
in this faith we quietly established
ourselves for years

552
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:32,129
and it seems cruel at this time of day
when men have been taught to look at

553
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,820
their bunches of keys and at their
drawers and saves

554
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:40,590
would something like confidence to
scatter that feeling to the wins

555
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:44,980
X this next section though

556
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,620
illustrates what was great about what
was happening in America at the time

557
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,518
and what would go on to be adopted by
the British for the next

558
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:56,500
generation or so

559
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,470
the mechanical spirit however is never
addressed and if it is lured into a

560
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:04,710
false stated listlessness in one branch
of industry and in one part of the world

561
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:08,789
elsewhere in springs up suddenly to
admonish and repro just with our soup I

562
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:09,340
miss

563
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:13,158
are descendants on the other side of the
water are every now and then

564
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:16,409
administering to the mother country a
wholesome filial lesson

565
00:32:16,409 --> 00:32:20,610
upon this very text and recently they
have been driving us up

566
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:24,219
with the severity which we perhaps
merited

567
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,809
for sneering at their shortcomings in
the exhibition

568
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:31,678
well we've been relying implicitly upon
the artful arrangement tumblers and such

569
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:32,990
like the bases

570
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:37,029
they have been carefully developing
their ingenuity in picking and opening

571
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:38,380
walks

572
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:42,669
a man makes a law and he brings it to
Mechanics Institute in New York

573
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:46,419
with a certain sum of money secured by
it which some becomes the property the

574
00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:47,649
successful operator

575
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:51,518
who can shoot back the ball to the new
contrivance instantly

576
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,019
astute the heads and clever expert hands
are engaged in solving the mechanical

577
00:32:56,019 --> 00:32:56,480
riddle

578
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,600
thus propounded to them and so far have
these dextrous manipulators carried

579
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,279
their art

580
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,740
but they're Open Sesame sweet sweet
springs tumblers falls not his letter

581
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:09,000
devices and everything else before it

582
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,750
you have to have both sides when your
engineering security

583
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:17,559
you have to have both sides and this is
exactly what was being said

584
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:22,000
in 1851

585
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,450
this was the moment but security by
obscurity should have died

586
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:34,450
it did I again for about a generation

587
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:40,139
the slightest should have been showing
off their so

588
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,820
to refund that it should have died

589
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,309
it should have died for ever but during
that generation

590
00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:51,220
England in particular there is a ton of
study there were people

591
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:56,220
at the Royal Society would hold month
after month is amazing convocation

592
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,730
love walk-ins mir's and people who are
in other engineering fields all together

593
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,870
all these ludicrous poly maps

594
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:05,629
the guy the cast the bell for big band
love which he didn't know anything about

595
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,549
filmmaking but made his own alloy

596
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:10,879
metal the cast for Big Ben which cracked
like three times so he prolly was in the

597
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,440
guy that had been doing it but still

598
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,879
I like he got very involved in lock
engineering in this big debate about

599
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:17,578
which lock was better and

600
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:21,560
and people were now just like the
American tradition bringing locks at the

601
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,690
design and testing against them

602
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:27,550
putting money up if people could open
them the people picking against them

603
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:30,280
would put money up in case they
destroyed the block in the course of

604
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,570
attacking it

605
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:36,260
but if that happened they got to keep
the destroyed lock to study and to learn

606
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,700
from it

607
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:42,710
the think about how to attack it even
appear atop the clock

608
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:46,659
the one that would go and completely on
opened

609
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:51,220
at in England in 1851 the newspapers ago
that I didn't bother putting into that

610
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:53,129
even longer than the long ones are
already

611
00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:57,670
said you know what are bigger is better
go back and start making better locks

612
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,960
or the better march over to the opposite
in that exhibition hall and open those

613
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,820
american locks

614
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:06,250
we tried and we couldn't paired up the
clock

615
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:10,400
held against all other known as able to
open it

616
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,130
from the paired up to block would not
have have held

617
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:17,380
except there is a guy by the last may
move on

618
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:21,290
pedis an engineer by the last minute
pedis and these damn victorians heat

619
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:24,680
using first names is infuriating trying
to trick people than later but mister

620
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,730
pedis

621
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,240
and unknown engineer wrote a letter to
the day annual company saying hey

622
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,759
I know you just made a bunch of
improvement steer lock and I've just

623
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,910
been playing around the new one

624
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:33,609
and

625
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:37,700
and I can pick it and here's how i
picking here some ideas for how he might

626
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,379
improve that

627
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:42,289
it was what you wanted these beautiful
early examples are responsible

628
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:43,069
disclosure

629
00:35:43,069 --> 00:35:46,989
and they did improve and that became the
parrot optic lock

630
00:35:46,989 --> 00:35:50,579
and that is what went to England and had
pet is not paid up and said he had been

631
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:52,069
playing with you or can I picked it

632
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:56,769
and sent them a letter and had they not
taken him seriously and implemented

633
00:35:56,769 --> 00:35:58,890
those changes and thank him for his help

634
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:04,390
if my tone is not clear this is not the
situation that we enjoy with like

635
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,410
manufactures today

636
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:09,390
better locks may have been opened

637
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:13,499
then this may not have been the
watershed moment in physical security

638
00:36:13,499 --> 00:36:14,450
that it became

639
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:20,078
so right now I'm working on a theory

640
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:24,890
manam you know poking holes in it and
testing and see where it stands up and

641
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:25,650
wearing doesn't

642
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:30,230
but my theory is that the public were
only able to tolerate

643
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,989
the public exploration a physical
security for about twenty years

644
00:36:33,989 --> 00:36:39,150
as that newspaper makes clear

645
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:42,420
as they said it seems cruel at this time
day

646
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:48,359
to scatter that security to the women's
for a seventy years for three

647
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:49,630
generations

648
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:54,380
and for the first time in their history
blocks everyday people

649
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:58,609
were buying walks and we're believing
that they were impenetrable

650
00:36:58,609 --> 00:37:02,799
they had secured their entire lives by
walks

651
00:37:02,799 --> 00:37:06,950
so when you then say to them

652
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:11,359
cool our bad turns out that entire
eight-year

653
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,920
is faulty turns out we're gonna keep
exploring it publicly publishing

654
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,059
newspapers and and agricultural
magazines and and anybody that will

655
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:22,200
print the details on how we're attacking

656
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,359
exploiting and developing new locks
we're gonna talk about all a bit

657
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:26,109
publicly

658
00:37:26,109 --> 00:37:29,410
and you're going to remain terrified

659
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:33,098
because you're still trying to secure
your lives

660
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:36,259
there's a backlash

661
00:37:36,259 --> 00:37:41,049
I am there is a chief are the probably
too often quoted

662
00:37:41,049 --> 00:37:46,900
I am wine a Hobbs talking about how you
know of course we're going to continue

663
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,450
studying publicly because the thieves in
robes you always have this information

664
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,618
before us

665
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:55,309
this debate was going on even as soon as
you open that walk even as soon as he

666
00:37:55,309 --> 00:37:56,109
began

667
00:37:56,109 --> 00:38:00,869
picking in publishing in America as well
but the tide turned

668
00:38:00,869 --> 00:38:04,989
but I'd turn with the public willingness
to tolerate the exploration blocks

669
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:08,529
newspaper stopped knowing anything about
walks anymore there's this crazy

670
00:38:08,529 --> 00:38:09,410
transition

671
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:12,499
1851 through Lake 1870

672
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:16,839
newspapers were raiding occasionally not
wholly accurate but really interesting

673
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:18,150
and sable details

674
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,859
about locks that were being developed
about

675
00:38:21,859 --> 00:38:26,700
%uh attacks are being carried out on
that one but by 1900

676
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,149
you're now seeing everything out of how
you must got now that with a skeleton

677
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,950
key

678
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:36,529
while war deadlocks in skeleton keys
continued to exist at that point those

679
00:38:36,529 --> 00:38:36,980
were the

680
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,430
attacks that were valid anymore not
against genuinely secure spaces

681
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:43,558
this was in reference to a deaf mute
thirteen-year-old escape from his

682
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:48,579
federal jail cell I'm which is an entire
the whole other talking to her breaking

683
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:50,119
you went to jail for the first time its

684
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,499
at 11 age 11 to a federal prison I'm

685
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:56,549
and he had a diff you little brother to
anyway look that's

686
00:38:56,549 --> 00:38:59,970
beautiful story but now over time in
today I am

687
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:05,189
so additionally we have the rise the
locksmith as a technician

688
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:09,130
instead of the locksmith as a Smith as
somebody creating

689
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:15,109
ABG metal and brass and and and so on in
secret knowledge

690
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:20,640
is cash secret knowledge translates into
a livelihood

691
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,538
cell with that knowledge already
beginning to become taboo

692
00:39:24,539 --> 00:39:29,309
circling the wagons getting laws passed
creating guild structures

693
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:34,749
disallowing the public from exploring
the security devices in their own homes

694
00:39:34,749 --> 00:39:37,839
becomes business in the guy is

695
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:42,799
securing the public because this happen

696
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:46,660
the American residential security market

697
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:51,808
as a very clear example did not change

698
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:55,630
for a hundred and fifty years and I
don't mean that we had incremental

699
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:59,609
changes here and there and things are
very similar to how they were back then

700
00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:03,109
I mean that there was literally no
change to the law X

701
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,640
the people bought and put on their
middle-class homes

702
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,230
for a hundred and fifty years

703
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:16,119
biggest to explore them and to develop
them into improving was taboo

704
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:19,299
and this brings the Royal Ascot and I
think I'll have them

705
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:26,109
little bit to take questions maybe
excellent

706
00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:30,019
taboo have three things

707
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:34,339
that actually draw the line between
private and public space

708
00:40:34,339 --> 00:40:39,299
or the threat of violence the threat of
violence then leads to taboo because it

709
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:42,038
each other people you may get killed if
you go into the air

710
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:45,700
and taboo always becomes law

711
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,328
and those three things the threat of
violence taboo

712
00:40:49,329 --> 00:40:53,469
and the law are the real dividing line
between private and public property from

713
00:40:53,469 --> 00:40:56,489
time immemorial

714
00:40:56,489 --> 00:41:01,710
the lock particularly in the context of
the American residential security market

715
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:05,960
is simply a symbol love those three
things

716
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,829
if you think to yourself how you feel
coming upon

717
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:13,469
and open door coming up on a door

718
00:41:13,469 --> 00:41:16,529
that is close but has no lock on it

719
00:41:16,529 --> 00:41:20,160
coming up on a door that has a walk but
is unlocked

720
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,598
and coming up on a door that is locked

721
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:28,739
there's this fantastic spectrum a
promotional response to those situations

722
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:31,969
the most people never actually take a
moment to think about

723
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:35,749
and open door with no lock on it is a
public space

724
00:41:35,749 --> 00:41:38,839
enjoy yourself walk around maybe the
space you don't know

725
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:43,480
you walk through and you're looking for
somebody to make sure everything's cool

726
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,710
a closed door with no lock on it you
have to physically interact with your

727
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:50,009
walking through and now you're very
seriously looking for another human

728
00:41:50,009 --> 00:41:50,719
being but

729
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:54,799
you're probably going to continue to
explore that space

730
00:41:54,799 --> 00:41:58,249
even with the lock being unlocked

731
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:01,819
the moment you see a lock on the door
and make the decision to test that door

732
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:04,190
anyway

733
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:07,239
there's something in you that knows the
or crossing over into what is

734
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:09,749
potentially a private space

735
00:42:09,749 --> 00:42:13,468
and the decision to break a lock to open
a walk

736
00:42:13,469 --> 00:42:16,549
that is locked to enter private space is

737
00:42:16,549 --> 00:42:20,230
visceral we have a lot of people when
they open their first lock

738
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:23,730
have very interesting reactions to it
summer thrilled

739
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:28,739
but some are on the opposite side of the
spectrum where discovery

740
00:42:28,739 --> 00:42:32,690
but it's so easy to do particularly for
most to the locks the American

741
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:35,130
residential security market

742
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:39,640
that the nearly shut down in the idea of
continuing that exploration security

743
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,690
and you see this modern equivalent to
what was happening

744
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:46,200
in 1870 where people finally just said

745
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,009
just stop talking about it we just wanna
locks

746
00:42:50,009 --> 00:42:53,210
we just want to continue living in a
secure world please

747
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:59,329
stop talking about it and you can see
that reaction even the people today

748
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:04,029
so the big change 150 years in 2007 the
ISM security market actually changed for

749
00:43:04,029 --> 00:43:04,900
the better

750
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,460
there a lot of problems with the lock
but guy named wall streeter

751
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:12,180
looked at the pin tumbler lock that his
company was producing that was horrible

752
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,819
it was the laughing stock of the
industry is that he had to make another

753
00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:16,630
lock

754
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,859
really happens inverted security market

755
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:23,410
medico have never changed the basic
concept they're locked with added things

756
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,950
they've changed things here there for
the basic idea is a mean the same

757
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:26,879
forever

758
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,900
multi lock in a rate faster than almost
anybody in the industry but even them

759
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,450
their primary walking concept has
remained the same since they made their

760
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:34,848
first walk

761
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:38,559
Walt making the decision to make a new
lockers huge and

762
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:42,829
thank goodness somebody ripped personal
problems unlocking going to that but

763
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:46,089
those are the ideas we had this amazing
moment in time

764
00:43:46,089 --> 00:43:50,549
where we were not only allowed but
encouraged and celebrated to explore the

765
00:43:50,549 --> 00:43:54,450
security of the world around us in the
public and open way

766
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:58,218
and it slid right through our fingers I
think we're at a turning point now where

767
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:02,109
we have that chance again and I want to
pay good attention to the past that we

768
00:44:02,109 --> 00:44:04,719
don't lose in a generation

769
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:11,070
thank you

770
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:14,859
any questions yessir

771
00:44:14,859 --> 00:44:20,970
good

772
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:24,790
and work curious is is to the best lock

773
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:28,960
is a medical or is that the best

774
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,020
UTM not really answer depends on your
security situation

775
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:36,330
um you have to keep in mind the idea of
total security

776
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:39,590
so the cylinder on your door on

777
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:44,460
mass there is an attack in as Russia and
the really creepy video of a woman

778
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,240
teaching middle school children do this

779
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,939
I where their doors are such thin sheet
metal you can literally take a can

780
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:51,720
opener and just cut the lock away

781
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:56,770
I am so honestly in general especially
if its residential situation I would

782
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:58,390
very seriously think about

783
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:03,150
the level of security one that cylinder
compared to the level security that

784
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:06,240
you know consumes the rest in your home
I

785
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,310
medico do make a fine product they've
had some problems

786
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:13,660
the you'd be the far end of this answer
is

787
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:17,500
ABLOY protec with a drum Germany shield
over it

788
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:21,300
and you can ask us more about that later
on but that would be a badass solution

789
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,060
for your home

790
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:27,020
am going up

791
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:32,580
yet yeah definitely come over particular
to the

792
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,730

793
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:38,540

794
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:38,970

795
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:42,169

798
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:00,390

have any reference there were several

799
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,150

800

far

805
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:22,119
I'm putting as much time into this as I
can right now but it's going to be a

806
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:25,010
little while before I can devote myself
full-time to it I'm

807
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:28,220

even doubt that I am

00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:32,118
brought so brahmin fortunately was dead
by the time this happened but his son's

809
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:37,270

this with such grace and and

810
