1
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,070
they'll be talking about some
interesting things I found

2
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,240
on showed on own john is a for people
people at a hundred there with it

3
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,380
basically search engine

4
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,560
that aggregates on banners from

5
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,809
every IP on the Internet given something
to the effective

6
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:38,849
eight ports does become a port scanner
that scans a porch

7
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,940
the entire internet over over over over
again and just

8
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,170
databases everything on so this is not
your average

9
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,220
showed on talk I'm not gonna be telling
you hey look I can find switches and

10
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,129
servers and routers on the internet will
let us

11
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:55,299
we already know that that's thats kinda
boring own

12
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:58,790
today I'm I'm gonna try n articulate how
concerned should on it

13
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,299
into kind of a gateway drug so what do
people normally put on the Internet well

14
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:06,619
we know we put routers and switches
servers and cameras and other stuff

15
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:10,869
me that's boring we've seen it what else
where else interesting what's what's the

16
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:12,790
long tail what's the cool stuff that

17
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,909
that people are putting on the internet
that people don't talk about

18
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,020
that businesses don't like to admit that
they put on the Internet a

19
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,570
is anybody actually even looking like
art it is there anybody that's

20
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,229
for trying to quantify what is plugged
into the internet and how scary that

21
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:25,810
could be

22
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,189
um I don't think anybody done this and
if they have

23
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,589
they're not sharing the notes are
telling anybody else about it so

24
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,600
basically I spent

25
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,850
several days up till ridiculous hours

26
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,130
in the morning um looking at random
stuff on short on

27
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,399
and today we're going to examine the
long tail love the Internet

28
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:46,420
serviced I'll have a little editorial on
policy

29
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,670
on anybody work at a company that

30
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:54,689
you basically would get strong up a few
ports k and/or ran and map

31
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:57,829
or anything like that without written
permission from several different

32
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:00,219
management types are directors anything
like that no

33
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:03,999
one yeah one so I worked in the time
environments

34
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:07,539
um you're you're sitting in an
environment a where

35
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:11,420
you're responsible for tens of thousands
of machines and there's this massive

36
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,109
massive wide attack surface

37
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,370
but you can't enumerate that attack
surface because you're not allowed to

38
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,190
scan it the bad guys can scan it sure

39
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,290
their issues which parties in China and
that's fine but US the employees working

40
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,220
this care department you're allowed to
do that and i think thats personally

41
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,800
kinda silly

42
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,060
on but how do you know if your marketing
department has set up a dozen Amazon ec2

43
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,130
instances

44
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,470
with the common I T E shared password

45
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,890
%uh out on the cloud the into
environments where your normal security

46
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,019
and IT

47
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,360
the divisions can see that

48
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,680
at all like how do you know that your
part on your IP if you have a piano

49
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,310
company

50
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,850
or credentials or configs or security
certificate or anything like that are

51
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:55,489
being put

52
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,890
in somebody else's cloud without
permission a

53
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,549
just because all the marketing
department didn't feel like dealing with

54
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,460
it. that day

55
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,880
so interesting stuff to consider so
before we begin I have to say

56
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,290
everything here that i'm gonna show you
is public everything is open there was

57
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,870
no credentials required

58
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,800
there was no brute forcing there was no
cracking there was no nothing like I was

59
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,870
literally you point your browser at
something and go oh my god why is this

60
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,540
online

61
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,209
um seriously like YouTube you get my
pupils

62
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:28,340
also no systems are altered no
configuration settings change no radio

63
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,710
buttons were checked nothing this is
entirely a read-only exercise

64
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,650
so now that that's out of the way when
care

65
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,550
they're fun um this is a really fancy
fan system made by March networks that

66
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,120
allows you to see that's that list on
the left there

67
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,760
you can drag and drop those cameras into
the right side and then you can choose

68
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,530
like he does

69
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,350
blue squares the top left you can choose
the layout

70
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:55,040
format you want and you can drag and
drop cameras from left into this thing

71
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,630
um and you can sit and watch with this
was

72
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:03,620
um base base alert this is somewhere in
France I guess and I'm based on the

73
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,100
names

74
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,670
we think it's a gold mine not a hundred
percent sure though I

75
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,070
but you know that the first thing that I
know says hey there's a dude walking the

76
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,940
same cameras

77
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,079
I'm watching hey that's cool hun

78
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,620
who watches the watchers right now hit
me

79
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,690
good so you know there's more like
they're all over the place is thousands

80
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,780
these things so you know this is some
pharmacy

81
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,299
our own pharmacy same thing you can
cruiser look at stuff

82
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,509
here's some bridge the municipality I'm
guessing I don't know why it

83
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:38,650
private organization or or RR

84
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,429
a business would want to point a bridge
are pointed camera system like this at a

85
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,379
bridge there's like

86
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:46,479
five or six different views of the same
bridge in with the

87
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,109
either the like ritual files are they
there on the bridge on

88
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,300
so then you know a freeway in China okay

89
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,069
sure from some dude literally just so
new

90
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:00,780
yes oh okay in January I A

91
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,289
if if you are unlucky enough to follow
me on twitter in January I I found a

92
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:09,259
a blog post on council consul Cowboys
suck on the guy to reverse engineer the

93
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:10,999
firmware do with webcam

94
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:14,960
I he basically found out that trend that
had put a hardcoded backdoor

95
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,530
into every camera so I'm if they
essentially

96
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,948
you know the cameras IP addresses and
you you give it like

97
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:25,509
slash Unani like an on-line slash MJ
pegged at CGI

98
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:29,590
its direct object access to the video
feed so if you know that the cameras IP

99
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,400
address you give this URL you're looking
at that

100
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,409
so I wrote a Python script that I'll be
releasing at the end of my talk

101
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:39,969
on that you plug in a search

102
00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:43,479
it goes to show Don it finds several
hundred these

103
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:47,340
um and wraps them in image source: tags:

104
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,609
and then splits them up into pieces so
you have

105
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:54,389
six or seven pages worth a hundred
campers debug live video from

106
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:58,330
everywhere in the world this was an
interesting thing I initially when I

107
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,550
first discovered the second thought that
about an hour

108
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,460
II initially released year the HTML
output

109
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,198
which I think may have been a bad idea
in retrospect

110
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,069
um when I get to that I talk about the
later so another layer safe private

111
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:14,379
corporate web cams like people are
putting

112
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:16,889
well security cameras ago in your
business are going to your private

113
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:19,150
residences or every other while

114
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,388
view buying a twenty dollar camera
you're probably getting that equivalent

115
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:24,129
amount of security

116
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:27,370
banks this is really funny this is I
think Malaysia or something to that

117
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,559
effect or Thailand

118
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:31,960
I don't know where but their money is
bright red that the money counter there

119
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,888
in the top right

120
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:36,120
and if you watch this long enough you'll
see somebody point money into latin

121
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,169
account and I love the currency exchange
later banker what does no contacts

122
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:44,099
you just looking at literally a Jay pag
and there's no there's no

123
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:47,498
way to really tell on your datacenter
there's a bunch of these like

124
00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:51,159
there's even on net net but brand
cameras that will tell you

125
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:55,110
unlike the temperature of the data
center and the date and some come some

126
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,770
cases you've just been as these guys

127
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,330
you can start you know really really
simple OS and other stuff you can look

128
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,008
at this as a while im you like Dell and
Cisco

129
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:06,490
like all this stuff up appear in the top
left is all Cisco switching equipment I

130
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,289
think one of those

131
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:10,659
NASA you know they really liked the
Dells um

132
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:14,759
shantytown I no idea and I'm what
interesting a little

133
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,589
piece of information is a little project
for you a sealer purple in the brain

134
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:21,749
up that is an indicator that this camera
is using

135
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:25,439
night vision mode a a few cameras using
night-vision night vision mode

136
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,529
certain materials and certain colors
will turn purple like that

137
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:32,990
'em so I hear appointed a remote control

138
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,259
microphone or the webcam or anything
else it emits I R

139
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:39,990
you get that kind of purple color that's
it's the same thing so just all services

140
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,089
are getting more reflective

141
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:45,990
I R um this is this is a fun one polygon
systems at the big fancy pants Polycom

142
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,059
7,000 systems

143
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:51,409
with auto answer turned on you call it
when you download X meeting for free

144
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:54,808
you pointed at the IP address the think
picks up and you're looking at a

145
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:56,610
conference room and you can hear it

146
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,370
your I mean a pulsating order to talk on
this and add another conference several

147
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,529
months ago

148
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:04,469
which inspired me to go to green but
yeah there's want to leave as well too

149
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:06,080
so

150
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,609
completely open auto answer no consigue
given IP go year you dropping on a

151
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,339
on collagen and then you can mix and
match W like

152
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:18,479
social media mashup style stuff now have
ski gear which everybody's worried about

153
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,339
on camera so okay I'm gonna have access
to the State Controller

154
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:27,589
um but but I can watch it yet so I mean
a lot of this stuff is gonna pertain to

155
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:28,460
John stock

156
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,729
arc lights are great for for mines all
this is something he was talking about

157
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:32,439
where

158
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,270
you can open-and-shut relays you can
turn alarms on often you can like mess

159
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,140
with doors

160
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,150
people are putting web servers on these
devices and putting them on the internet

161
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,218
and not putting any credentials and the
reason code for like this

162
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:47,529
you're a tease I mean like it's the
really really old technology that they

163
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:50,520
decided let's put a web server on this
but on the internet and they did and

164
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,880
then I found

165
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,500
um like more stuff a webcam this is some
German

166
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,470
some German webcam from somewhere that
doing I'm guessing it's pumping

167
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,639
sometime gas Anna is another one the

168
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:05,940
the power meter where is it I have no
idea I can probably narrow down to the

169
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,250
city but that's about it

170
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,449
um places where people know they're
being watched and by whom so things are

171
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:10,930
getting

172
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:15,300
a little interesting a form yes some of
its okay

173
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,540
um but something I'm not 100 percent
sure this is but last night I when I

174
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,719
figured out what the car car means I
don't know the kanji is but it's like

175
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,279
to write 0-20 one liked what I thought
oh I have no idea

176
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,360
my buddy convicted on me know

177
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,880
more Val buttons okay

178
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,930
we're now it's hard to get a little
bored again okay got a cold read-only

179
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,638
we're looking at it we really do
anything

180
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:42,949
then I found this what on earth is this

181
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:46,829
rely on TV 2000

182
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:49,880
were white I don't understand

183
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:55,089
let me do the ghouls ok it's a hydrogen
fuel cell

184
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:58,750
it's a happy cracked all hydrogen fuel
cell that spits out somewhere like to

185
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,089
kill a lot to use this to power

186
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:05,180
um cell site backups so like when in San
Diego when the power goes down

187
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,519
um per presumably you could have some
these things certain

188
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,839
on mountaintops however the cell sites
are making sure the cell phones can

189
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,980
still work

190
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,050
winners up he looks kinda industrial
there's a lot of documentation on this

191
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,370
and maybe just google for rely on t2000
doctor everywhere

192
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,690
um this is kinda cool I didn't know you
could tell it into hydrogen fuel cell

193
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,639
holy crap

194
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,009
um its use a lot and dot new places they
were get cut kind enough to put up

195
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:33,550
a agree a dove where their use so

196
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,029
own public you can google for this why
would they do that

197
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:41,209
'em this is how you use it this is how
you look it up

198
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:44,609
probably see art like this um so

199
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,839
where do you find these things we
besides .mil places like how how do you

200
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,220
recognize when these things

201
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,170
up they they tell you um good

202
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,199
smoke if you can the docs are very very
handy

203
00:10:57,199 --> 00:11:00,399
a.m. think things are going well for the
casual google it

204
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,420
um so security predominantly in a lot he
sings it is a ridiculous joke

205
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,300
on this is about as far as I can go in
terms of reversing

206
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,389
I'm still learning things like ida and
registers and what not but

207
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:17,240
this was easy enough so I there was a
web interface to one of these things

208
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,310
would halt I'll try and point out later
wanna come across

209
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,388
um these websites web

210
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:27,440
web interface with some sort of custom
thingy the you view the source code and

211
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,870
the source code linked to

212
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,930
were included 3.2 EQ files this is one
at the Tiki files

213
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:36,008
you can just W get of the thing there's
no protection

214
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:39,050
for for the file you W got it

215
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:42,189
and then you literally this is me
opening in the eye that's about have

216
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:47,310
as far as I can go with reversing at the
moment so I cracked it open in the eye

217
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,839
the password there its I'll give you hit
the dollar lower case but

218
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,000
like in the heart hardcoded password in
in a binary file

219
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,040
available for download only unit like
what's the point

220
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,290
it's it's like it's like the keypads are
you wondering what's the code to the

221
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,189
keypad and there's a sticky for the
pizza guy it's the same thing

222
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,750
but you know in a browser to this was
actually really cool

223
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,870
I've never it's a wind farm done

224
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,750
turbine and develop kinda big one
because it looks like it's but now 37

225
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,350
amps

226
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,639
at 1.7 kilowatts so it's a fairly large
one and this is one unit generating that

227
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,810
much power from the wind

228
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:25,969
so I when I look these guys up in there
good deployed at like large farms and

229
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,029
places like that we want one or two
maybe three at the most

230
00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:32,639
but there you know forty feet all it's
been around make power

231
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,190
you can get them in the browser um so
these controllers

232
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,470
%uh on leggy and looked on as much in
his last Oct

233
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,629
they control a lot of stuff in this case
this was some huge church this

234
00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:48,449
cathedral things somewhere this is a
screenshot above

235
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:51,819
a view from the actual controller from
the website on

236
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:55,319
you can for this particular building you
can control age back in lighting that

237
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:55,769
means

238
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:59,310
you're sitting behind a computer
somewhere else in the world

239
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,899
and you can mess with the lights you can
mess with the power you can mess with

240
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:06,230
on the heating and cooling other

241
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:10,459
the billing in some cases you can mess
with the alarm systems you can mess with

242
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:12,310
doors and you name it like

243
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:17,310
a.m. another one a in the UK you like
conveniently for plans like almoner shut

244
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:17,930
off

245
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:22,758
the power to the staircase Romana mess
with the temperature over there

246
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:26,209
it makes it pretty look good because
people are wrapping these things and Web

247
00:13:26,209 --> 00:13:28,810
servers and putting them on the internet
and there's no credentials you just

248
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,529
point your browser

249
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:34,040
the stuff in it goes own power meters
and interestingly enough like this is

250
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,790
this is I don't think it's the one that
was like that poorly mobile but

251
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:41,969
a.m. this one gives him a trend graph
and tells you how much power consumption

252
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,360
own wherever that is is using I'm in
someone is an aggregate like

253
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,319
somebody's units will actually aggregate
all the power for like an entire

254
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:51,000
apartment building

255
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,579
can I do i mean very social engineering
attacks and i cant I can't

256
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:58,638
think that much to do with it um then I
started fighting controllers

257
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,300
a.m. their systems like in Niagara style
system is like a

258
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,000
brand yes but day a.m.

259
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,459
there there little depictions are
getting a little bit more colorful

260
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,420
little bit more intricate you can tell

261
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,259
%uh how much air flow is going through
this and that you can start manipulating

262
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:16,899
different events and things like that
okay we're starting a little more

263
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,879
interesting is to get a little more
crafty

264
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,550
on the systems are you know you getting
bigger and more interesting like this

265
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,359
one has

266
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,819
a.m. a heat pump three water heaters and
that you can see on the left side with a

267
00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:29,620
cold water goes in and there's

268
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,910
pressures and flows low rates and stuff
in on the right like there's a heat pump

269
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,469
in

270
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:37,319
then stuff happens like okay that's
kinda cool on I'm starting to get the

271
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:38,500
impression that this is like

272
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,879
potentially I high pressure system you
can mess with and that's when things are

273
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:43,529
getting even more interesting

274
00:14:43,529 --> 00:14:46,850
rich people apparently use this thing
this is somebody house

275
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,980
om and it's the same sure system you can
like its I

276
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,910
the hull the front end is those
Honeywell thermostats

277
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:58,500
um and in this system you can this was
alarms

278
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,810
lighting and age back which means I can
mess with their

279
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,279
water heater I can mess with the alarm
the house I can mess with the lighting

280
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,500
so if I want to really freak somebody
out a you know they have a website for

281
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,879
I am so I get really crappy because a at
you you know the technology on the back

282
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,329
end been around for something like
thirty years nobody's ever considered

283
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:18,638
the security I just bought outside of
people here

284
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,069
I never considered the security
implications and shove stuff like this

285
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:21,660
really

286
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,420
and the what dads are starting to get
better grab something so

287
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,969
they're they're putting trending data in
these things are like this is that

288
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,879
private private private private
residence you can see

289
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,069
the training data for the water heater
and you can see that

290
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:37,128
and giving me the dates in the bottom
you can tell that the

291
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:40,259
the weather has been getting warmer so
they don't need to run the water heater

292
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:41,240
so much anymore

293
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,730
and you can see the graph is the trend
goes down I get another one

294
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:49,000
a solar water set up for you have sort
of two takes one of them is dealing just

295
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,019
really hot water and the other ones
dealing with water that needs to go to

296
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,749
the panel in back down

297
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:57,100
okay that's gonna cool again pressures
flows sweet

298
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,079
notta lotta really interesting stuff to
do with this just at the moment but you

299
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,069
know

300
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:04,680
uninteresting negative information is
interesting right so here's another one

301
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,599
this was this was absolutely hilarious
but this is where it starts getting with

302
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:07,959
it

303
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:11,300
really funny on that there is that
there's a Honeywell thermostat

304
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,099
own you've probably seen that before
buildings like in schools and

305
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,480
offices hotels name it you can interact
with that

306
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,499
being from the website like you can
virtually gone hit the

307
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:27,709
the buttons to make it hotter and colder
which is really funny because I was into

308
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:30,550
a traffic school class summer months
about a hundred leases on the wall we

309
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,870
couldn't for the life must get the

310
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,449
room to stop being ice-cold and now I'm
thinking that there was like some kid

311
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:40,709
down the hall I got a hot chick lick
lick I'm not a good I

312
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:44,810
it 0 yes I I'll act like I don't like
ovitz

313
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,079
that awesome on %uh so here's the here's
the

314
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,508
for an end to that system the TQ file

315
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:55,589
that allows you that hand you the
password unfortunately this one didn't

316
00:16:55,589 --> 00:16:57,040
even ask for the password

317
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,248
but this one day and I think it's like
I'm not an electrician

318
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:04,290
I'm a little bit information disclosure
here you can see

319
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,750
the the make and model number and a
local IP address like on the inside so

320
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,980
obviously this thing

321
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,980
it let somebody poked a hole in their
firewall for this

322
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,230
because this is sitting on a 1216 a
subnet

323
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:18,360
so somebody had the the bright idea and
say hey there's a school thing the

324
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,599
controls my power

325
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,740
let's let the internet touch it um

326
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,709
so there's larger industrial systems
this is an example of one of the units

327
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:26,959
at

328
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:30,770
that used and basically what this is is
at the centre relays

329
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:34,240
that you can control the web server and
you can get some some logic

330
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,000
for this one in particular its you were
getting back to the whole

331
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,380
sorta I'm getting the feeling their high
high low pressure systems and if I

332
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,200
really mess with it like maybe I can

333
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,299
do some damage or maybe make a water
heater exploded

334
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:50,600
um so you have three water heater for
water heaters are exchanger

335
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,590
a bunch o pumps and valves and you have
cold water going in one place and hot

336
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,279
water coming out another

337
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,210
ABC the Mythbusters episode that blew up
the water here that some

338
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:05,250
EP I don't think you could actually do
that maybe cuz water heater generally

339
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,380
have their own built-in likes or doesn't
feel safe but

340
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,450
the ball through for water heaters I'll
make the news um so I found a whole

341
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,700
bunch of stuff right

342
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,150
but assorted been rambling break what a
what up

343
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,779
0 everything I found it even remotely
action okay cool so

344
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:24,900
we're weed killer roundup showdown we
found some hilarious stuff and we can

345
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,830
laugh about it but like

346
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:31,129
what implications does that have or send
us fashionable these days what's flex

347
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,850
that muscle and see what we can do

348
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,870
the little one very very simple recount
silvery

349
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:39,039
there's a a thing that I really like to
use because in mind evers in this

350
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,230
this little adventure this is coming
monumentally useful this is a thing

351
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,000
called chrome

352
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,059
both with flag chrome the flag is an
extension for Chrome

353
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,600
that will tell you just a little bit a
basic information about the website

354
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,399
you're visiting

355
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,950
like what city its in that's all I
really care about

356
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:58,100
because when you're looking at say on a
webcam and its

357
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,840
sunny in San Diego and dark wherever
they are they're obviously not in the

358
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,330
same time zone where are they are they
in the US are they not in the US and

359
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,350
when you get to the stuff it's really
not a national thing it's there

360
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,408
literally these things are all over the
globe

361
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:13,669
so in a lot of cases you won't know what
it is you're looking at

362
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:17,500
unless you actually check so what can we
first what can we see right

363
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,990
simple simple osan just basic
observation stuff

364
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,789
it's daytime you know when I saw this
was also a daytime so the problem the US

365
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:25,419
the Karzai

366
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:29,740
United States I complex on there's a
reception educated the lighting is

367
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,510
you it's a little break here but you on
the right hand side in the top right

368
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,070
frame

369
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,299
there's reception is playing on a
computer and you can see you can visibly

370
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:38,610
see the display

371
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:44,408
and that camera the top right is pan
tilt zoom and you can control it

372
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:47,890
so what can we do with this just as an
exercise just

373
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:52,220
know nothing scary malicious what can we
do just to have playtime unlearn

374
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,419
well we can pan the camera over to the
front door

375
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:58,650
the has the company logo on it and
underneath it says

376
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:01,799
security integrators

377
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:04,799
they left their camera really these

378
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,260
okay so this was a little this is as
tricky as

379
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,840
horizontally flooding in the midwest
this was reversed I don't want anyone

380
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,289
like

381
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:15,629
call these people out or get them in
trouble so I've I've obfuscated the name

382
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,529
the company

383
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:19,710
um but based on the name the company and
the fact that I could tell what city

384
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,529
they were in

385
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:24,049
I could google maps where they are so
now I know what the environment around

386
00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:27,330
the place looks like now I know what the
inside the building looks like I know

387
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,350
the hair colors after this I know what
operating system I run

388
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,299
I know what cars they drive like
suddenly we're just playing on the

389
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:36,110
Internet have gone from playing on the
Internet to like a cool have a pilot

390
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:36,699
info

391
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,309
drawer what would but actually a very
successful social engineering campaign

392
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:44,860
mmm level 2 interactions

393
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,320
and another disclaimer I had no idea any
this happen this is a result in me

394
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,399
having published over the web cams

395
00:20:50,399 --> 00:20:54,418
in January own nobody they certainly
they would like a mother to the misery

396
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,760
the screen capture said you're gonna
laugh you can only go

397
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,200
year ago own so so if you have enough
information

398
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,909
about a place you can call them and tell
them you're a radio show

399
00:21:04,909 --> 00:21:08,850
and start getting him to do stuff on
camera

400
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,730
so we're there some people on the
internet found this

401
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,899
pizza place and started calling them in
interacting with them and they basically

402
00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:20,899
I have no idea how the conversation went
lingering hello mister pizza place

403
00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:26,580
hi I'm hasher dude and we're watching
you on your cameras look up and wave

404
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,990
I don't know how the conversation went
but I can only imagine needless to say

405
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,830
it went well enough that they had enough
report with these people

406
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,559
it to get into like waving like they had
like drawings on pizza boxes there

407
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,520
holding up an aids

408
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,418
whose so now we're getting to the
interesting stuff so now okay now our

409
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:46,940
now they were getting is he getting
entertaining again so level 3

410
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,850
missus or get a little creepy so
remember live free or die hard in ratio

411
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,469
movie

412
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,130
yeah maybe okay it's kinda like that so

413
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:57,179
suddenly after season with those
pictures that screen in the background

414
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,070
starting to look a little familiar

415
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:03,350
mmm bright except you know there's no
like pretty assassin lady wherever

416
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:06,639
as I do they all fight did this with a
fall

417
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,169
truck love gear a black ops team what
are the black ops team guys is the

418
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:14,720
a French dude is one of the top five
parkour practitioners in the world

419
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,299
who can actually jump on a helicopter
and be fine um

420
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:23,240
explosives custom 00 days malware giant
displays in a truck magical technology

421
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,110
your typical Hollywood moro right

422
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,979
I eat your heart of Hollywood I did it
was shot on several gallons espresso and

423
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,799
more curiosity than my cable modem to
deal with

424
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:35,770
so in the end though this depiction from
the movie is basically just a really

425
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,440
insane the successful social engineering
campaign is if you remember the film

426
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,990
I was basically him doing a whole bunch
of to look over here misdirection look

427
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,399
over here misdirection we still have
much money from the government kinda

428
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:45,760
thing

429
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,010
so in tonight but I'm not shooting down

430
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:52,350
I helicopters with cars however you let
me know when there's a system that can

431
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,289
do that an open test it for free

432
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:58,100
a good there you let me shoot down
helicopters using cars

433
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,590
I love oneself up stuff up just as much
as everyone else it seems more awesome

434
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,080
if you can do it with telnet

435
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,350
so sorry worry um massive coolers like

436
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:11,129
a.m. and this guy was really funny cuz I
got called out on it so I am

437
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,309
pro tip for anybody that wants to go and
do this at home um

438
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:17,580
if you run their job %uh sometimes our
Java will do things like report

439
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,970
was name of your Laptop to controller
and if you're

440
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,809
using fully qualified names it doesn't
matter if your proxy cuz

441
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:28,510
you know my laptop got my domain dot com
is in there logs and couple days later

442
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:31,270
get the email from what is the
interloper lines connecting to my

443
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,370
controller my goal

444
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,379
own I would say a game ahead

445
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,440
boilerplate this labor you should
probably put a password on your system

446
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,820
so people can just get into it

447
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,080
no work like you own so a massive

448
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,039
like big cooler stuff like this I guess
to the best of my ability that make it

449
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,919
figures as a some huge refrigeration
warehouse I don't know if it was a

450
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,559
meat-packing plant for

451
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:56,980
a giant I've no idea just as it's a
gigantic refrigerator inside the

452
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,720
building

453
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,929
that has chillers and and this many

454
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:04,380
evaporating in a fourteen evaporative
coolers so big

455
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,200
so here logs and none of those are my

456
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,590
machine but those other another
hilarious information disclosure

457
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,500
vulnerability

458
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,659
um you have people's admin level gas to
admin

459
00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:19,789
own and the name on their computer so

460
00:24:19,789 --> 00:24:23,590
a Dennis apparently runs a Mac

461
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:27,350
incidentally he's got the email Alonso
whose relievers

462
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,519
it or leave it is big ridiculous UPS's

463
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:34,809
yeah well you can talk to those with
SNMP v2 v3 3 and shut them off or put

464
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:36,190
them in test mode

465
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:39,679
over the internet with no credentials so
anybody wanna traffic data center

466
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,669
as you can like you think you've got a
building like this for firewalls but one

467
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:46,360
for this cheese

468
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,750
right own VNC like touch panels that
control

469
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:54,600
up on some relays and valves and
turbines and stuff

470
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,959
on a lot of these RR touch screen
interface touch panels

471
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,970
you can VNC into them and click
interactive stuff

472
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:07,700
again I have little to no reference to
what the stuff is

473
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,880
there was some company information the
top but I slice of but

474
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,590
this has something to do with fluid and
its measurements are in the thousands

475
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:20,370
no looks interesting I don't have any
buttons cuz I don't like

476
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:24,229
ppppp Nuzzo a

477
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:28,210
okay so its is a little freaky you know
there's okay there's some sensitivity

478
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,090
potentially

479
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,240
but it's not a fire sale like in the
movie right

480
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,320
no meet I line so I learned there's a
company called echelon a good thing

481
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,750
called a nylon

482
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:41,580
it's for managing LonWorks networks
large networks I'll are a call out to

483
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,710
the things that john was describing the
last talk or you have this

484
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,690
intricate system move relays in
electrical components at work in a very

485
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,350
low level that open doors and

486
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:54,610
hit relays and stuff like that sometimes
they need to talk to each other

487
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:58,010
%uh so people built I lawn well-marked

488
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:01,779
then against what he had a genius idea
of putting web server on it and putting

489
00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:02,750
it on the internet

490
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,019
and in not putting any credentials or
anything for not even a CBS nothing its

491
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:07,529
covert

492
00:26:07,529 --> 00:26:11,559
they're also stackable like Depot hats
this controller

493
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:15,090
controls 36 or so businesses

494
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:18,269
in a town downtown in Europe somewhere

495
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:22,250
no credits you point your browser this
thing and you are literally looking at

496
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:26,130
the alarm system panel for one of the
top level controllers right

497
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,480
think this is the mall but um

498
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,409
this was all in Danish I think I'd
Swedish I don't know I started looking

499
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:34,110
up

500
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:38,459
the company's on on the left right
securities obfuscated some IP addresses

501
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,510
does again and I want to get anyone in
trouble

502
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:45,690
but un that little white box there were
two IP is obfuscated there was like

503
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:49,700
twelve or thirteen of those each one of
those had this huge drop down to

504
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,340
business as I found one that was

505
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,428
but that was interesting I started doing
stuff like old you get the

506
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:58,809
what it what is that bow it's kinda like
the San Diego Convention Center it's a

507
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:02,970
big place with an ice skating rink in
some alarms and two lights

508
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:06,549
and garage doors and a track and

509
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:10,168
and this controller touches all a bit um

510
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:13,929
like all I can defrost the ice skating
rink a

511
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:17,490
it okay good what are we gonna do it

512
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:22,110
I don't know how to save a lane home
here's a schematic over the place they

513
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:22,830
have a

514
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:26,220
but a gracious Lee give you this picture
right on their website here's our

515
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,289
facility you can rent it

516
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:32,679
that's okay it um so hold a thousand
people in that main areas like

517
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:36,070
there that the okay not bad pretty big

518
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:40,129
what's ahead to boast rain camping oh
there's a.m.

519
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:44,639
a lot of solar panels up to the left on
the bottom frame their hands

520
00:27:44,639 --> 00:27:47,668
water slides okay well but it's like
some sort of

521
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:53,399
own in getaway resort place that you can
go and camp by the beach in a water park

522
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:54,110
it as a family

523
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:57,820
get vacation and place and I have no
idea what this Katie controller here

524
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,379
controlled but their pages and pages and
pages a convict

525
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,630
so I'm guessing it's probably like the
facilities lighting and maybe they have

526
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,399
like a

527
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,989
a good driveway a has a gator something
I don't know about you

528
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:13,510
you can mess that too on here's another
one that seems ideal some sort of like

529
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:17,090
get away whole one this Act spectacular
mechanical I

530
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:21,908
I go there but it's a on also into
injured people a really not my dyslexia

531
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,320
got me know how to set scholar

532
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,309
kilt it doesn't say scholar killed on

533
00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:31,899
a okay something you know skate control
something

534
00:28:31,899 --> 00:28:34,768
here I'm not sure why I didn't really
take the time to find out that because

535
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:35,799
it's like you know

536
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:39,269
a a plethora a farm cottages

537
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:42,529
a.m. I'm suspecting that this game
controllers doctoral the individual

538
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:46,230
cottages that can control the industrial
stuff around cottages lighting alarm

539
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,919
system

540
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:51,299
whatever on okay cool so I can control
power lights h-back

541
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:54,379
ice skating rinks garage doors water
pressure in boilers or something like

542
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,490
thirty six cities

543
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,279
36 places in one town

544
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,549
they were getting a little closer now
right okay ok

545
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:06,100
so in the fire sale right they
manipulated stoplights

546
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,250
and other like signs and stuff too like
they be directed traffic Ryan

547
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,760
in New Yorker something I fact okay
would lead to he kinda like

548
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,470
controls so flights in it listens on
helmet you can just tell it into it be

549
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,419
like dude stoplights

550
00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:22,929
I'll plate autoplay are red light
cameras the ones that give you tickets

551
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,010
this is the system

552
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:28,220
that recognizes your license plate OC
are your license plate ships out of the

553
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:31,110
law enforcement to tell them to send a
dick to

554
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,899
you make may not be able to see it but
let me see well I number is

555
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:40,510
um it says here

556
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,919
im planing I it's like right in the
middle basically he asked with no

557
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,100
security

558
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,668
the utility and boom menu no credit
didn't ask does and that you're at the

559
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:52,120
way by default prejudice let let you in

560
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,449
okay what about those signs on the
freeway that you can change

561
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:59,269
you can to talk to people on the roads
Nasdaq Tronix

562
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:03,179
a Tektronix makes these things and
they're used for

563
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:07,500
both freeway signs and like scoreboards
for like sporting events

564
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,490
on this particular screenshot is the one
that got my attention what

565
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:15,179
0 okay that's cool so did not write that
woulda own

566
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:18,580
the props to these guys because all love
everything I found

567
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,850
with Tektronix was was pass a protected

568
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:26,309
um nothing I nothing they did not give
anything away and I was unable to find

569
00:30:26,309 --> 00:30:30,049
manual I was unable to easily find
manuals online

570
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:34,230
describing a the password reset
processor default credentials right like

571
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,269
that so these

572
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:38,519
would actually provide these would try
to challenge

573
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:42,720
to get into on so red light cameras Reds
I'm stoplights

574
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,350
check how about some current events
rights over members reddit.com

575
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:49,709
everywhere even following the whole rug
rug rug income tobacco's them the latest

576
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:52,970
skating thing that controls industrial
equipment that was a

577
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:56,100
but after the internet like like a month
ago people were doing back flips over

578
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,279
rugged com

579
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,679
so record come same thing right this is
a you you log in again

580
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:04,750
no credentials on because the system was
set to allow

581
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,750
either gaster admin login like if you
show up and

582
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:12,260
it basically its toll the system's told
visitors arrive at this page

583
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:16,240
don't need to authenticate there will be
automatically log in as block user

584
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,610
okay well let's look at those passwords
um

585
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:24,918
they're gonna I'm gonna guess that you
can probably guess what they are

586
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:28,860
um just based on the link because the
kinda match

587
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:33,449
um but in case you really wanna know and
I can spell it out for you all just

588
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:36,470
software because 'em

589
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:40,529
a would set the

590
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:45,059
yeah there's an extension that will you
know right click obfuscate passwords

591
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:48,710
great so not only you know are they
letting you in

592
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:52,399
but they're not they're not just showing
asterisks there

593
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,768
actually publishing the password and
then hiding it

594
00:31:56,769 --> 00:32:00,059
thanks guys also home this is

595
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:02,918
what are the more interesting ones does
this look like now or to anybody like I

596
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:05,909
saw this in a browser one I'm not
running that Java

597
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:10,130
does that mean AM I crazy like be honest
throw stuff whatever like

598
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:13,659
would you rather I mean is anybody like
you think what is this

599
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:17,970
I don't know run Java run Java run Java
run driver

600
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:22,750
a I saw this took the screenshot and
moved along I put a message on Twitter

601
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:26,230
something akin to you although I found
some skate a controller somewhere that

602
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:26,940
has a

603
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,590
some some kid or something like that
came in and defaced it

604
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:34,250
and this is probably some silly hacker
where's group for whatever that was like

605
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,250
all about my

606
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:39,070
all geraldo impact but in French or
something and I'm like no

607
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:42,639
no thanks next and i ended up talking

608
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:46,820
to a guy on Twitter about it a somehow I
got somebody's attention

609
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:51,070
lot on I saw this and dismiss it as a
debasement

610
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:54,029
I made a comment on Twitter about seeing
what potentially could have been

611
00:32:54,029 --> 00:32:54,600
replaced

612
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,908
Java and a I got pinged by guy on
Twitter

613
00:32:58,909 --> 00:33:02,789
only had a long discussion he basically
said a you know show you're looking at

614
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:04,539
so I took this speech on the short term
leases

615
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:08,440
I'll just run the job like you bad
social engineers bad

616
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,590
No %uh is no no seriously its

617
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:15,189
it's not that scary it's by design you
can run the job it'll be safe

618
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:18,610
so over the VM I ran the Java and I saw
this

619
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:22,229
I'll ok so it was actually the jet was
actually malware the flipping out was a

620
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,630
false alarm

621
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:28,039
but now looking at the numbers and these
numbers are in megawatts

622
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:31,600
I am so I short in the screenshot

623
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,889
and the conversation changed a little to
a

624
00:33:34,889 --> 00:33:39,229
yeah expect a call tomorrow for some
from some interesting people

625
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,419
so 845 the next morning DHS calls me

626
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:46,190
I they're like K were with I

627
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:51,090
I see certain um not calling regarding
your tweet like

628
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:56,199
I'm %uh what did I do I mean like my
troubled like you to know I'm we want to

629
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,940
get ahold of these people because we
think that people putting the stuff on

630
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,870
the internet is for ethically evil and
bad and it should be

631
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:05,489
online and we basically found out that
this was

632
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:10,149
a dam in a few million region of France
in this particular damn has already had

633
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:12,230
issues with the flooding people

634
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:16,469
good to know so by the second day

635
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:19,879
on ICIC a certain guy that called me

636
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,490
called ICS I guess they have a certain
division in France

637
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:26,899
and got a hold of them and France is now
scrambling to pull this thing off line

638
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:29,259
I'm pretty sure they've actually pull
the plug on its a should be able to get

639
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,360
online

640
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,839
but okay so we've gone from like you
know

641
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:37,799
people's houses in water you know
heaters to a5 megawatt hydroelectric

642
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,929
plant that flooding people

643
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:46,270
okay um so thinking a little bit longer
term right I mentioned trending before

644
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:49,649
right I mention like if you have brass
you can take measurements and look at

645
00:34:49,649 --> 00:34:51,040
numbers and stuff

646
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,270
let's go back to that system that had
you know 36 businesses and some city in

647
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:58,819
Europe you can't really see it on the
projector but there's three or four

648
00:34:58,819 --> 00:34:59,849
lines

649
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:03,210
that are horizontal in this graph
they're all flat because nothing has

650
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:03,990
changed

651
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:07,060
this system allows for user to basically
select

652
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:10,480
any number of data points outta what
this system can be

653
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,829
and graph them that doesn't sound that
interesting

654
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:19,010
when I say it like that but when I say
you can see when the people turn the

655
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:19,619
lights on

656
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:23,200
you can see when the people turn the
alarms on of you can see when they open

657
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,439
the garage door as you can see when the
water slides are turned on

658
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,079
you can you can probably watch the rage
do the cameras should they be there if

659
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:30,480
you

660
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,760
defrost the ice skating rink the but

661
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,119
suddenly you going to create remote
because now you can watch the building

662
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,950
you can watch it was a I know when they
come in I know when the alarm is going

663
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:41,470
on

664
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:44,669
I know when they travel arms aloft I
have a schedule love

665
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:48,240
ove when they go on vacation I know when
there's people in the building I know

666
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,560
when there's not people in the building
I know what temperatures they favored

667
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:56,250
like suddenly you have all this data
we're gonna do with all this stuff

668
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,210
well said scanning the internet is
getting a lot easier we can actually

669
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,670
start taking measurements

670
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:03,510
on this stuff and when you can start
taking measurements then you start

671
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,859
getting a lot of

672
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:08,150
more because met up but you you sort of
go up a level

673
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:12,300
right on but we can actually have
measurable results now

674
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,460
so if anybody remembers a webcam stuff
that I did back in january

675
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,119
right on time the public trend that
cameras that were just open everywhere

676
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,280
I thought that it would be wise to go
back and look at the numbers so here are

677
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,230
the numbers

678
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:28,839
but my original blog post in January I
was able to find 560 publicly available

679
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:31,109
Cameron your only TRENDnet

680
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:34,700
I have all my place for next time to do

681
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,200
something like a dozen other brands have
camera to see what else I can find

682
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,430
because this is just a systemic problem

683
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:43,500
because these guys share code I'm

684
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:48,300
so my first blog post it was in January
I found 560 gamers

685
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:53,430
in on February 7th a friend of mine
linked me to an article hilariously

686
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:57,410
while I was watching a spy movie %uh
that the BBC

687
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:00,460
had picked up the story at the strain
that cameras

688
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:05,310
and was going berserk over over 4chan
types in people in peace been

689
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:08,200
looking for boobies yeah

690
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,939
there weren't any believe mostly these
cameras are home rhythmically boring

691
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,830
there are a couple the people that
flipped out me like literally

692
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:20,259
they did back lips because somebody's
cameras use the same code base as baby

693
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:20,920
monitors

694
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,980
and maybe a fifth of them are literally

695
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:29,120
a camera pointed down into a crib which
for some people it's free for me is

696
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,299
boring I don't care

697
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,430
on so I get a retest to see what the
numbers look like

698
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:38,440
after all the hubbub in after words like
kind of I will be thrown around

699
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,720
on the surgery just like a third able
third

700
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,310
464 cameras cool measurable wharton

701
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:48,390
it works to scare the crap outta the
public on the go look at the camera on

702
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,049
the point out so

703
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:53,570
20 percent worked right so torn what the
BBC

704
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:57,640
publication had it big measurable
results that

705
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,609
awesome I like that stuff the US media
picked it up

706
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:05,310
sometime the middle in April and it
didn't do anything

707
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:08,990
they got one more camber so but

708
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:13,149
this this sort of stuff it scales right
so for the moment you know forget

709
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:17,160
switches routers computers printers
whatever we can scan the whole

710
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,410
internet in record the findings based on
what's available

711
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:25,279
and if we do that a couple a dozen times
a year we can just make a simple graph

712
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,270
think about this why scan the entire
internet look for telnet how many

713
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:30,420
devices are there

714
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,090
that are listening on telnet right that
number down pretty in a graph

715
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:37,500
do the same thing again in two weeks
then record that number to protect them

716
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,170
on the graph

717
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:41,400
do that for two years and then suddenly
you can see if any of our security

718
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,670
campaigns are working

719
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:46,020
are we as security people actually
making influence

720
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:50,450
on the Internet now we have a way to
measure if we're doing on

721
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:53,879
if you're doing it right right so I'm
working on it

722
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,050
I'm still I still need to get this
portion done on

723
00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:01,780
I have some code that on my blog that
hilarious I was able to fully refined

724
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:05,940
before the talk but its own weblog 31
want to grab it's a simple python script

725
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:06,610
you can't we get

726
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,820
a but the idea is I plan on going in

727
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,780
and getting these metrics I plan on
scanning the internet whole lot more and

728
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,060
doing some more interesting stuff

729
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,400
Medtronic's extrapolate transit
hopefully have a lot more interesting

730
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,030
stuff before Vegas should I

731
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:22,100
sure they get elected to speak so on

732
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,259
if you want to stop me this is how you
can stop me otherwise

733
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:32,260
will be at the bar on

734
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:39,699
and apparently I am 20 minutes early 70
but he has questions comment a male

735
00:39:39,699 --> 00:39:46,699
Jer

736
00:39:54,339 --> 00:39:57,650
all that's not a terribly difficult if
your database if I your findings you

737
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,160
could do operate be basis

738
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,058
and the logic there is actually pretty
simple I mean for for a lot of intent

739
00:40:02,059 --> 00:40:03,470
and purposes you're looking at telnet

740
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:07,200
and a lot of Appeal seasons he controls
all is not tell eso

741
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,328
one easy way is have a Python script

742
00:40:10,329 --> 00:40:15,190
open a connection to the stain and and
see if it asks you for credentials

743
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,420
if it does ask you for credentials
assume that it's secure

744
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:22,549
whatever probably just defaults but do
that and if you go back to it later and

745
00:40:22,549 --> 00:40:24,599
it doesn't ask you for credentials you
can measure

746
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:29,240
buyers exhibit

747
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,319
down other

748
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:35,619
there the the camera the exit

749
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:38,930
I don't think they actually publish
exact data you

750
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:42,629
and its its NJ PAC now so it's like
video

751
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:45,880
all well I haven't gotten that far but
its

752
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:51,059
like I said I have so there's TRENDnet
right but that'll happen I i talked

753
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:52,950
about earlier the whole like Unani slash

754
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:57,558
MJ pegasi I shop early MJ pegged at CGI
is commonly use library that they're

755
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:58,339
passing around

756
00:40:58,339 --> 00:41:03,680
literally just but well with the the
path and you find an MJ pegged at CGI

757
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,879
for almost every cheapo camera its
direct object access to the video feed

758
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,140
so the next generation of my script will

759
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,339
going find and 8 maybe something like
that

760
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:17,660
camera vendors so I think my numbers
went to increase from

761
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:21,290
four hundred to several thousand I did
it for another brand of camera I think

762
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:22,279
it therefore I A

763
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,210
I D Link camera and I found just for
that brand alone something on the order

764
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:28,339
a 1500

765
00:41:28,339 --> 00:41:31,920
on and it worked on Alonso the
difference was the first

766
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,880
script that Iran search for TRENDnet
cameras at not all the TRENDnet cameras

767
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,619
were vulnerable

768
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:40,770
on so I found

769
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:45,809
11,200 cameras and added that number
only five hundred or so we're gonna

770
00:41:45,809 --> 00:41:49,280
right so not that great a return

771
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,650
but for the d-link stuff I only found
1500 gamers

772
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:57,230
but all fifteen hundred were vulnerable
so I'm up to something on the order

773
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:02,030
2000 publicly accessible live cameras
that if they do or don't have encryption

774
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:05,619
is relevant because it's a direct object
access you put your browser you're out

775
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:07,540
boom you're looking video on

776
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:10,970
I will I will say however I hope you
have a good downpipe because

777
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:15,890
um I have like a business cable modem
home when I get like 50 megabit down in

778
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:16,690
it exit

779
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:21,089
does your polling live video from every
single camera and is your standard

780
00:42:21,089 --> 00:42:24,460
in the bed emails

781
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:28,829
questions mucho bottom before from you

782
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:34,260
durable so far they've been actually
really good went went went when the ice

783
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,480
yessir guy call me

784
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,040
at first I was terrified I like they're
gonna pick me up after my talk in a fan

785
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,808
national bag me over the head coach them
out I am

786
00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:45,930
by %uh by the end up talking to him like

787
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:49,598
I was suggesting what sushi places you
go to in Vegas and he's calling me from

788
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,540
his personal phone and now we're going
drinking during Black Cat so

789
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,599
I think it went pretty well a.m.

790
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:02,599
now go

791
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,250
for um I'm pretty sure the BBC article

792
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:10,520
job that message pretty well um the
discussions I had with some in the

793
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,910
Investec people that talk to me about my
findings and

794
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:18,060
releasing 500 publicly accessible web
cams to the Internet a.m.

795
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,310
my first sorted liner defense is what
are the public like I didn't find

796
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:23,790
something or exploit something that was
already there

797
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:27,820
I just took six hundred campers put them
all in one HTML file on

798
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:31,110
but the the

799
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:34,430
that the questionnaire was arm you know

800
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:37,669
let's say you have 10,000 voter able

801
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:42,040
home end-users what do you do like as a
as one researcher guy

802
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:46,430
who like my company doesn't pay me to do
this I'm a consultant that does security

803
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,000
but like

804
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,470
this is this is Mike this is my hobby I
could do this is my funds

805
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:54,180
playtime on the side um like I don't
have

806
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:58,200
corporate resources to actually
remediate any of this I don't have

807
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,390
a giant network of people I think I'm
really awesome that I can tap to like

808
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:06,080
make phone calls to random strangers
hahahaha your camera in your living room

809
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,759
is watching our capital ball

810
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,180
and yeah there's read if you step up his
game

811
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:14,870
um but a you know what what do you do

812
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:18,240
um so actually had a discussion with the
ice yessir guy and he said like

813
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,859
really guys that you call to really I
didn't know that you guys could do it is

814
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,330
yeah I'd

815
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:25,790
its kinda more thing you're like an
emergency response teams you give us

816
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:30,630
10,000 IP addresses a home users and we
have a a call center we farmed out to

817
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:34,990
that's within our within our furtive see
your influence worries a

818
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:38,160
you know here's ten thousand IP
addresses that %um

819
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,560
the end user identified and these guys
need to get a call from somebody that

820
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,049
sounds like their official saying

821
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:47,450
your web camera in your in your living
room his broadcasting all your

822
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:51,560
discussed in craps the internet stop it
drugs I am

823
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,270

824
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:58,759
little emails

825
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:03,140
