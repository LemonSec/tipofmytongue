1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:04,880
hi

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,250
welcome to you I want to come home

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,879
hi how many uses your personally one wow
%oh

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,970
of amelia is a super security card ever
okay that's good

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,430
Louisiane so that when you gonna hang on
so

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,570
great use but welcome

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,480
I we hope you enjoy this weekend I'll a
lot of people who are working tonight

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,849
such as this fine man John Norman slash
are quite

9
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:35,410
dude I mean we talk to you about
resource physical security

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,989
%uh before we begin up because you
wondering are you partying now they did

11
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,160
you have a machine summer I ask
registration you actually buy your ATM

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,110
card and

13
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:50,430
was it and I answer that's covered

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,079
we have in the first room next to us
there's hardware hacking

15
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,940
roles number vendors that obviously
registration and

16
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,230
food and beverage and after that he is
never having yes

17
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,559
mafikeng for those who've you were
asking me

18
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,640
are there any spots left reverend after
this talk

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,240
on to be 1130 I if they're still boxes
left it open to whoever wants to pick

20
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:13,689
them up

21
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:16,779
so if you're still looking at be on them

22
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,580
Apple stock see me see we can do
anything

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,890
number you I would suggest 118 lot over
workers

24
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,740
many just about was

25
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,619
them

26
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:36,550
anyway John Norman when

27
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:40,340
so since you mentioned earlier findings
is my slow first fully legit

28
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,810
am

29
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,460
a speaking about I you might 16 operated
to you

30
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,720
do turn off the wifi and bluetooth on
all your devices for us the conversation

31
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,440
you know it's it's not strictly
necessary but gathers

32
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,429
X suppose to duck Congress leader in the
car

33
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,259
but the battery somewhere else so up
when it was hardly

34
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:09,030
how we're John and I'm I'm gonna talk to
say about

35
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,800
physical security and we're talking
about electronic devices

36
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,400
access control arms that sort of thing
and my background I'm not alarm or

37
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,270
security guy

38
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,709
I am I just got we wanted to have

39
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:28,030
a half unaudited electronic access
control system in our

40
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,870
hackerspace wish so we all the all wheel
will be out on Sunday

41
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,000
23 be shopping our after party there so

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,620
I guess we start off with their that how
many guys have been wracked by these

43
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,420
views to

44
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,570
you have a bad for your word all
everything in

45
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:47,180
ever wondered what how goes on behind
the scenes you know not people

46
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,150
mess with their he is in door locks in a
lot for sale so

47
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,510
we found us does rather light box so her

48
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,010
it was about physical security we're
talking people assets

49
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:04,519
equipment buildings electronic Cox locks
inaccessible systems intrusion detection

50
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,030
alarms equality what this is mostly not
about our mechanical locks

51
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,630
all these systems do you have that as a
excuse enabling technology

52
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,709
you do need to have a.m. you know

53
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,070
somewhat secure has a lock I am no
strong

54
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,310
or something like that view expect
resistance performed

55
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,459
a the network and information security

56
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,600
has also a foundation you almost all our

57
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,850
alarms an accidental stuff are
misleading me talking over networks a

58
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,700
server

59
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,980
notifying people are ever so that's
important but also a totally different

60
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,940
subject that

61
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,430
his sorry to bother talks video
surveillance

62
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,019
I wrestling with you looms large his
physical security commission

63
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,030
in least new s-class you last various
and

64
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:57,669
I find interesting was it was busy lol
Cameras Cameras Cameras more games

65
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:01,500
ever as you think about us a lot of
problems with us have everybody watching

66
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,950
a real sleep using cameras watching the
camera doesn't want me cameras

67
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:09,578
that police or security problems go away
play while it is an important

68
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:12,609
technology in the rate use case and

69
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:16,720
tied in with other things like access
control an audience is worth

70
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,299
is actually kinda for me to turn a
corner lot of studies as really

71
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:23,419
early souls load for the problem

72
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:27,359
and then security policy development all
tingly all the stuff is to support some

73
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,370
kinda Paul seem

74
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,270
you don't have the same alls you know
it's it doesn't really help here

75
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:39,570
okay so Wireless this technology

76
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,120
I am from what I A as they start doing
some research about two years ago trying

77
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,400
to install something

78
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,659
found out these are pretty much all
humorously closed doors

79
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,260
and we'll see proprietary technology

80
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,740
all the vendors basically will tell you
that their stuff is a moral

81
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,350
because nobody knows how to hack it
which me know from the computer security

82
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,900
world that works right

83
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,489
it made him adding you know is 1-1 final

84
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,639
what the matter is it safe and yeah okay

85
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:11,460
but you know the magical as the top
right up so early

86
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,388
it's kinda hard to find out what's going
on under the covers and I did

87
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:19,699
doing and have research and I've been an
discovered a few things like it's pretty

88
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:21,050
hard to make a real

89
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,090
risk-benefit analysis equalise decide
whether you want to buy a

90
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,760
you know better door locks harder to pay
or you know protects

91
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,990
grass is another way was covered so
because all these things how

92
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,590
wires and a lot losses and they may or
may not do anything

93
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,590
right inside so I'm gonna take it

94
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,900
a quick trip through sort of security
theory 11

95
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,099
you know so spinster of with them what
is security

96
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,140
in this context you know we're not
talking sequel injection

97
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,960
when I was like a regular credit card
database home we're talking about your

98
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,870
actual stuff

99
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,650
sorry we have assets not be everything
from

100
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,820
you know it can be hard Russell
intellectual property you could be

101
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:07,120
people the good beer facility INR cases
are hackerspace we want to keep the

102
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,840
junkies

103
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,380
that hang on the alley outside and as in
such a way on the other side burner

104
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,980
it whenever possible and those were
stuff like not a pawn shop

105
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,100
so up press those assets

106
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,120
may have different plans a threat
doctors or people that

107
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,990
no this case for saying intentionally
want to get your assets away as

108
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,900
unauthorized

109
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,310
and then it all the time countermeasures
you can bring out

110
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,820
so more time countermeasures retro

111
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,500
were those well we're talking about
things like the blocks the alarm system

112
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,570
the notification the auditing

113
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:43,900
all that stuff and all those things out

114
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,469
you know different aspects to them

115
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,710
you can increase if you're ready I

116
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,859
you mean very well with the coverage you
to play

117
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,100
I'll break something else you might
decrease security in some other area

118
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,900
where safety

119
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,120
know you can put a really awesome door
lock on your front door

120
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,810
but if thats if it takes a four step
process to exit might die in a fire

121
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,240
so there are regulations and things are
on this and you know

122
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,180
that many factors are these serve been
working on this for a long time so you

123
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,820
make thats

124
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,250
Elise the physical part work pretty well
but the electronic part it's kinda hard

125
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,020
to say

126
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,169
if I play this thing into the internet
to plugin there's actually a cloud

127
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:28,170
access controls our issue but is more
boxes under doors

128
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,330
and then you can actually go out I'm
liking it's out there

129
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,919
do they tell you anything about what the
you know what

130
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,930
additional vulnerabilities you open up
wall at a high school teachers that they

131
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,280
really don't rate so

132
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,609
you know what it comes down to I'm it's
always a trade-off

133
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:47,910
it cost rate the stuff can be very
expensive to

134
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,060
you know really expensive I'm
convenience

135
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,220
that's actually a good thing you know we
saw to we talk about security

136
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,340
working mean it's right having the air
you know how many people have a really

137
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,659
dreadful policy

138
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,020
their password all see their work you
know it has to be

139
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,210
complicated has been changed all the
time and so what people the right the

140
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,780
right down its on a positive note Obama
laptop or

141
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,849
something like that one thing I found
out with this type of technology

142
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,900
if it's done right its convenience

143
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,169
and security can actually go hand in
hand like if you make it

144
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,420
convenient to you walk out the door

145
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,680
that goes out to the sketchy you back
alley every time

146
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,950
newbie process open if it closes on Sony

147
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:36,630
eat some locks and people feel safer
because they know who their opponents

148
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,070
the default is that that's not happening
that they can easily

149
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:45,070
no walk in and out almost unimpeded the
actual follows security policy butter

150
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,360
mean I think that the biggest threat to
use a data center and

151
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,329
other times as always liked options
security smokers red

152
00:08:53,329 --> 00:08:56,560
everybody has you know almost every

153
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,849
Lowcountry some bad news look inside
policy so we reserve ago the end up

154
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,279
outside the back door problem was gonna
stuff getting

155
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,750
you know it biggest jobs in Saint Paul C
like a place to do that and not set

156
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,070
gritty that but it you can do things
like set up alarms and alerts have the

157
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:17,019
doors property long stuff like that

158
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:20,610
so this is kinda interesting thing I
actually found this a physical security

159
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,130
book

160
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:25,200
up all the electronic access control by
getting Thomas

161
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,660
I'll Norman and he's been in this for a
long time other three categories

162
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,100
both you know people here your site

163
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,480
up those who support the mission
inherently those be like the founders

164
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,220
be a homeowner someone who has a a
vested interest the partner business new

165
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,220
whatever may be relatively small group
they did

166
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,180
in maybe they are a hundred point zero
percent trustworthy

167
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,260
but there as close as you'll ever get do
it because

168
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,709
their interests are very much aligned
with

169
00:09:55,709 --> 00:10:00,660
the interest serve you know what's going
on the mission if your site

170
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,290
but you have it was straight up a poser
mission must be

171
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,509
competitor is people who are just

172
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:11,459
straight up thieves you want to steal
your computers are rehearsed offer

173
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:15,508
you know rob your employees are you have
to store or whatever may be

174
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:19,470
and then know they're fairly small group
of people

175
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,839
and then you have everybody else which
would be

176
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:25,699
those who sometimes support and
sometimes oppose the mission was to be

177
00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:27,809
like employees contractors guess

178
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:33,219
visitors and really all three of these
groups have different needs

179
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,769
in so core users supporters mission
right

180
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:40,379
%uh that the same CD in security goals

181
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:43,910
as everybody else that's authorized
bigger building know we want to protect

182
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,480
them from

183
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,649
perhaps outsider Press perhaps from

184
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:53,759
you know fire her and be all about and
things like that next weekend

185
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,220
%uh the people responsible is obviously
want to take care of their assets more

186
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,129
people

187
00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:01,430
Island they are going to want to be able
to manage this so

188
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:07,180
the old soul I you know who house keys
to what bill to a vote those or issue

189
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,790
those

190
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,930
and you know have an idea it someplace
also do things like this poor management

191
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:15,229
know who's in your building case was a
fire assay did ever get out safely

192
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,620
stuff like that are

193
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,819
criminals outsiders russ that's pretty
much what we always talk about

194
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:25,509
we're talking about IT security the
other be awesome

195
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:29,059
we have not slept pretty clearly defined
for murder in the case with building

196
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:32,319
a little different if your cloud
application provider know it's

197
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:36,469
was our printer but this is pretty
obvious right here on property or not

198
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,829
and there are people who is clearly
don't want their unwanted discourage

199
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:41,758
them we will increase the risk

200
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,180
associated with their you know bad actor
activities like stealing your stuff

201
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,050
refer any employees than everybody else
right so

202
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,670
you know that's mostly about managing
inside threats um

203
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:57,439
this year's contractors the pizza guy I
kinda like up

204
00:11:57,439 --> 00:12:01,599
every place that has a a a pen reader
out front apartment complex even

205
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,619
some pretty high security you puzzle is
them into seems like the pizza guy

206
00:12:05,619 --> 00:12:10,470
were even worse the I was reduced in a
while back that had

207
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:15,100
I adore her from the Thai restaurant guy
you need a hand very dirty in Laplace

208
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,529
those guys are dangers ahead I people
think that pizza delivery is

209
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:22,970
no critical not to the mission that guy
needs the code

210
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,930
to get in %uh in so you won't believe
you things like find out you know who

211
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,489
let me in

212
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,649
I have access logs maybe video be built
verify

213
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:37,600
what happened when its basic function
honoring has some deterrents but

214
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,670
it's basically about finding what
happened after the fact

215
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:45,410
and the really important thing is being
able to you issue in rookies

216
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:49,019
and makers use possibly have a finite
life cycle

217
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:53,220
I you issue a medal he and is basically
there forever

218
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,269
uncivil you change the locks are you

219
00:12:56,269 --> 00:13:00,149
trying to take you back and how many
people want to deal with getting he's

220
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:03,670
back from hackers who moved outta state
years ago right

221
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,589
it's not gonna happen and if you're
running a for-profit business that's

222
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:12,119
you know and tactful red

223
00:13:12,119 --> 00:13:15,220
so what we have here

224
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,769
we really perform for basic housewares
these

225
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:22,059
an electronic security systems up for
those outsider appeal

226
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:25,199
threats and it's a very angry the other

227
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:28,990
inside players we really wanted to to
her

228
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,939
detect the late response there's no such
thing as perfect security

229
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:37,089
I am the manufacturer's literature all
the stuff someone will talk about

230
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:41,149
everything in the air and the referees
copper as he has been playing pretty

231
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:45,399
or doesn't leave one talk about some of
the other things like

232
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:48,559
you know do they use the same he in
every device that they send out

233
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,360
but also they truly give you complete
picture the fact that you're gonna put

234
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,040
this

235
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,179
perhaps even provably audited

236
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:59,939
a security device that it passes some

237
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:03,449
government urges a perfect standard on
your

238
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:07,339
drywall partition data center

239
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:10,389
maybe it's wasted money maybe should do
spend some money hired a contractor

240
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:14,740
doubles all wallenberg a good or ill
before you spend all that money

241
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,730
so really any number of people can break
into stuff

242
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:22,399
or early in bills do his trying to take
them to lay them so you can get a

243
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,490
response from

244
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,490
you're stopped by police whatever may be

245
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:30,029
and we wanted for Security Policy into
the day a

246
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:33,350
buy it but you're not so

247
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,629
I mean to you through a this is Kevin
interesting

248
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:40,319
model this is an but me because red
cross anderson's

249
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:43,589
security engineering prison about up all
have a

250
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:47,439
weeks at the end this but I highly
recommend that it's the we talked about

251
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:48,868
a thousand pages

252
00:14:48,869 --> 00:14:52,089
the second edition is like your typical
expense a text book

253
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:55,980
but he did something really cool he is
professor that's the

254
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,249
these at Cambridge and he he put the
first edition online is a free PDF

255
00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:01,249
download

256
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:05,149
and it's very get it covers all kinds of
things like database network security

257
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:06,860
app security

258
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,189
and covers physical security and even
things like how

259
00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:13,429
nuclear weapons are secure so he has a
really interesting

260
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:16,839
up first all the stuff where they
trained you threat modeling

261
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:20,550
they want to make this a little bit
measure little bit more rigorous

262
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,139
and you're starting to do that using
mathematical models much more security

263
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:25,079
and

264
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:28,929
you know from trying to prove all the
test cases in you know does this does

265
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,300
not so what size the input data and so
forth

266
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,599
well here's all chapters trying to apply
that to physical security

267
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,819
and so he comes up with these for model
attackers

268
00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:41,429
which i think im from some army

269
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:44,899
program years ago for the to try to
figure this out

270
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:49,139
so the first one is Derek I derek is a
nineteen year old apt

271
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:52,379
he's looking for low risk opportunity to
steal something he can sell for as next

272
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:53,069
fix

273
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:56,540
that would be similar neighbors shop

274
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:01,079
%uh Charlie electronics is a 40-year-old
inadequate was some convictions for

275
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:01,849
burglary

276
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,860
he spent seventeen last 25 years in
prison

277
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,600
although not very intelligent he is
coming and experienced his picked up a

278
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,999
lot of lower during his balls inside

279
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:14,929
he steals from small shops in suburban
houses taking whatever he thinks he

280
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:18,050
consults local fences

281
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,910
Bruno is a gente not not the allergy
Bruno

282
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:25,230
a Bruno is this is a gentleman criminal

283
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,379
is businesses mostly stealing our as a
cover

284
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:32,139
he runs a small art gallery he has a
fortune first degree in art history in

285
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:32,790
the wall

286
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,290
and conviction for robbery two years ago
after two years in jail he changed his

287
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,509
name to move to a different part of the
country

288
00:16:38,509 --> 00:16:42,360
he is an occasional black paint jobs for
intelligence agencies who knows past

289
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,199
you like to get a computer crime but
mostly done so far is turning 100 K with

290
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:47,309
memory from

291
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:51,939
chips from universities PC back in the
nineties when there's a memory shortage

292
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:55,639
then we have are top shelf

293
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,839
Brett actor I abdurahman

294
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:03,759
up abdurahman had to sell a dozen
militants mostly with military training

295
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,689
they have infantry weapons explosives
with PhD great technical support

296
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:11,040
provided by disreputable countries
University

297
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,240
abdurahman himself came out there have a
class A June 18th Military Academy like

298
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,439
country was not promoted because he's
from the wrong ethnic Kurd

299
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:22,040
you think themselves a good matter that
bad man and unfortunately his mission is

300
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,438
still talking

301
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:28,100
so you know what do how do we deal is so
said goal

302
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:31,899
commercial business space which mind you
going through all the security council

303
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,440
logs

304
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,960
the talk about their good better best
products all the products pretty much

305
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,640
use in residential situations are all on
me

306
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,840
not good on just basic things like the

307
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,909
the Los the doors et cetera for all the
types are not recommended for commercial

308
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,630
applications

309
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:51,910
was because they're not abuse resistant
ands

310
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,740
they don't support some more secure
stuff like some the electrified hardware

311
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,830
putting the better high security locks
owners and I

312
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:02,980
you typically have 5 were some by six or
seven PM orders lock

313
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,720
up tempered glass windows and the bb
storm system

314
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,520
that people don't may or may not use
consistently

315
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,850
mean how many people how to a job where
they give you an alarm code

316
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,159
ready or not and you command and

317
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,679
you know the the scribbles instructions
at all so simple after serbs be paying

318
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,160
guest star pounced are stark town

319
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,710
command 7 your pants paul sr pound white
why do you keep spending of editors do

320
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,570
better at

321
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:32,439
so what would you do right after the
second time that happens you just don't

322
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,370
set anymore unless the bosses around

323
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:38,030
reason it's universally commander lhasa
believe that sucks

324
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:41,500
so these things are maybe deployed you
know

325
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,130
fifty percent of the time properly if
that's probably a good day

326
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:49,290
I larger sites may have their own onsite
security staff

327
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:54,480
wished you know very definitely in
graded I just like her attackers

328
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,580
you know we have everything from TSA to
get security

329
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,970
yeah burn

330
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:04,890
a better locks are if nothing else
commercial sites are usually forced

331
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:08,480
large institutions are forced to buy all
the hardware

332
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,720
because the number of people opening
closing the doors and banging on it

333
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,540
known eat too 12 to 24 hours a day is

334
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,200
just you can't buy a cheap doubles wear
out the better stuff tends to be more

335
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,450
secure in

336
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:24,560
they tend to do things like past the be
angry

337
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,600
man tasked where you can kick on and hit
your face

338
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,830
as long as you want and nothing more
really

339
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,000
happen no you ni lease need one or two
guys with

340
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,290
decent too little time to break into it
whereas if you take the angry man tasked

341
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,290
you know there's the shining guy outside
your apartment

342
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:45,050
mean how many residential doors was a
worthwhile to write about for more than

343
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:49,110
seconds or maybe a minute right verses
say the door to live where school

344
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:54,659
you refer your hambrecht so it's when we
think about that

345
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,720
in are truly is your typical commercial
space the

346
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,030
a the access control or you know which
is probs bribe I know he's

347
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:06,420
forms and so forth that started at your
Derek and Charlie

348
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,450
model attackers on places like over

349
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:14,630
properly run data center you know
high-value site to handle

350
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,770
our money valuables equipment

351
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:22,510
on they also attempt to delay more
sophisticated attacker like the bruno

352
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:27,100
guy and he can do things perhaps like
higher

353
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,149
a cleaner to get its into your staff or

354
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:34,180
reprogram your alarm by biogenic
alarming program it except every key

355
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,850
small I gotta be really want your stuff
would probably getting

356
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:42,179
were they would do something like no
writers and demolition tools and

357
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,970
in cuts for your wall them you know they
did a leading religious the lady that

358
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:49,420
person and make it harder

359
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,520
yet sigh from the with the result was
gonna talk all the stuff is rated by

360
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,510
you well and this man see standards for
Casey how long or is this someone

361
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:01,200
was no tools with tools to people with
different tools

362
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,630
so forth known these claim to have
actual protection

363
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,060
they are only a a delay measure

364
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,889
and win or loss attacker you really are
tops all threat are based in the

365
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:13,730
plutonium

366
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:17,840
israel's we a problem for the military
what you

367
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,679
what you use to stop people like that up
would-be mass

368
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,930
mass stop things like explosives and
small arms and

369
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,090
chainsaws with carbide blades in things
like not

370
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,720
ands infantry people with guns

371
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,680
you know you have really high security
facilities I think the best design on

372
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,200
the back for the ones that don't look
like there's anything going on with an

373
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,450
embassy

374
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:48,220
the second word you count the new
reassigning putting your 10 New York

375
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,540
up but really I these kind of people I
you're a look at something interesting I

376
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,659
the crown jewels in England they have a
slow building

377
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,010
and they put you on a conveyor belt and
just regular light light like library

378
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,629
cases with you know this class that
looks like a regular class a little

379
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:02,750
thicker

380
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:06,140
and it looks like nothing's going on
although if you were to happen adores

381
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:06,990
you notice

382
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,140
it's really well balanced but like you
tap it and it feels like it's may have

383
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,520
something very very solid

384
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,730
and he knows there's an infantry
garrison right next door and bigger

385
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:18,710
this beyond planners and things around
but there are SOL reinforced concrete

386
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,770
with roar

387
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:23,280
posting things on them you know little
subtle security features

388
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,980
the other big deployable barriers all
the entrances and exits and stuff but

389
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,120
are obvious I and they're trying to tell
you from

390
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,820
to delay hands an inconvenience 10

391
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,960
a top-shelf attacker and those other
Kansas I still have a punishing visible

392
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,520
and not as well measures

393
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,060
but really all there trying to use the
laid back kinda person till the

394
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:47,340
in their case the morning detachment is
here comes out all their weapons and

395
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,429
kills them

396
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:53,530
that's the idea we're just trying to
call the police probably

397
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:57,600
so typical features on the system's are
there's only a module

398
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,820
looks somewhere this missus my system
but there are

399
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,669
its kinda a a loose collection I love

400
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:09,370
no a bunch of different you know
commercial systems and white

401
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:13,389
what have you are typically control
between one and four doors

402
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:16,690
almost never more not %uh Keeling runs a

403
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:20,510
unlike networking or in a hundred meters
is no problem you're running actual

404
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,560
power to manipulate a physical device

405
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,570
so they can only go so far about having
a power supply nearby

406
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:30,070
arm they may be controlled locally with
US intelligence the firmware

407
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:33,360
I let me be like a small plants or they
may report back to her

408
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,649
a client-server up artistically
unfortunate Windows

409
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:42,430
only workstation that if you're lucky
maybe since is in some way about

410
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:47,190
offer magia I YouTube we have some type
of electric locks

411
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:51,030
on the perimeter and or sweet or stir
officers things like up

412
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:55,120
I'm going to those are you have some
kind of access token readers

413
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,330
see that okay guys up yeah things like
arts

414
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:03,800
are those econ top upon cyclists they
have their own different security issues

415
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:09,149
up in regions biometrics other kinds of
technologies

416
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:13,640
but one other key features is that you
have to have some kind have

417
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,220
exit device everywhere that is not pass
between you

418
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:22,090
and outside the building has to have an
easy way for

419
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:25,100
ever inside the building to get out in
case of emergency

420
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,709
and bouts fire are generally is the
first thing people think oh

421
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,130
but it can also be other things if
there's someone shooting at your place

422
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,490
what are the

423
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:36,080
stay a few the studies have shown that
where the best responses ni cases

424
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,350
is to put distance in can get away from
people the lockdown idea

425
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,840
isn't always a good thing so typically
except house

426
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,970
not necessarily coming back in but
exiting

427
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:50,870
is really something you don't want you
did for almost any reason

428
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:55,360
um they say that's a it simple test is

429
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,449
you can a person no special knowledge
and get our open the store get out

430
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:03,580
so that includes things like panic bars
handles doorknob stuff that people just

431
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,350
inherently

432
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:08,149
know how to use and almost every place
that house building's walls

433
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:12,810
are sometimes a perspective I S motions
actors will talk about those but that's

434
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,480
my favorite special a double glass doors
and

435
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,150
a motion sensor the locks on the way out

436
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:23,010
are 10 things these typically do which
maybe is an obvious if you haven't been

437
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:25,210
on the other side of the building on the
system's

438
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:28,870
the push to exit the bias the motion
detector that lets you out things like

439
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:29,620
that up

440
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:33,459
or sometimes the doorknob itself aren't
typically send signals about

441
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,250
access control panel to suppress the
alarm that the store got opened

442
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,430
so their base is saying this was a
legitimate

443
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:43,810
activity because somebody without it he
was coming from the inside out which we

444
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:44,540
allow

445
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,810
so don't alert security or worse off the
alarm

446
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:52,399
now about thats somewhat smaller really
right because it's

447
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,640
you can you trick it into doing hot you
know when you're coming when

448
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:01,050
maybe a

449
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:04,419
YouTube we also have

450
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,840
awesome integration if it's a larger
system working to things like trigger an

451
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,830
event in the event log for your video
system

452
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:14,580
of answers systems when someone comes or
goes it'll bring up on the screen let

453
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,610
see that the camera that shows the
hallway if you just walked in

454
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,740
workers a visitor at the gate that sort
of thing are to police

455
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,480
do things like suppress the alarm system
a lot I'm having aggression

456
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,980
I does not have to be even and logical
integration via

457
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:32,290
no coding the PRI's are they may just
have like a dry contacts from

458
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:36,389
are related maybe it goes to an employer
and the alarm systems were to say if you

459
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,440
see this input

460
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,470
do this or not do this off the alarm was
set off the alarm

461
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,960
a common one with fire alarms is that so

462
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,370
if it's exit door they want the their
local

463
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:52,310
inspectors you control this they caught
the HJ the agency having jurisdiction

464
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:56,500
you know wherever you happen to be in
the US they may ask that

465
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:01,490
your access control system are open all
the doors to inside and outside access

466
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,910
if there's a fire

467
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:06,600
so about definitely is security issue

468
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,699
it's also an issue safety that they
think that you know him

469
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,800
be a lot easier for the fire department
to get in I him so it's it's got rid of

470
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,310
it

471
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:17,850
that it seems make more sense if you
have somebody on site

472
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:21,980
who can wash the store all happens if
it's completely lights out

473
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:27,470
data center I don't know that may or may
not be what you desire

474
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,980
up when the other cool things the
fencers isn't going to you

475
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,880
is tie-in with foot building controls
like heating ventilation

476
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,890
I can't run the air conditioning in your
for your office

477
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,420
are perceived you can do simple things
like light up like a few badge in the

478
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,270
parking lot

479
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:46,720
you can turn on a powerful lights all
the way from your Cart your office

480
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,610
so little safer and you know kind of dig
dis for his bad behavior

481
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:55,919
so this is probably a little hard to see
but

482
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,460
a your typical system is gonna house
over on the left

483
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,450
are these distributed access panels a
door sensor

484
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,170
to take the position the door request
exit sensor known someone asked to be

485
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,200
let out were

486
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,140
pull the handle I and told the system's
insulated

487
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,610
that their leaving a some type of this
reader

488
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:20,770
are these may be in different floors all
over a building all out in a in a campus

489
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:24,930
are they will get back to some kind of
panel that surprises them

490
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:29,720
really typically will go to you tonight
at some point aren't they may be Rs 45

491
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,130
in a local network when it gets to a
large campus it's is almost certainly

492
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,510
can be for that science

493
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:41,370
police actor after the it's the wiring
closets like countless

494
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:44,840
so your few things vis-a-vis the

495
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,129
gonna run on a locking hardware know
what was the sub controlling you talk

496
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,720
about what the in the day

497
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,590
this is just a fancy device that
exception signals and opens or closes

498
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,709
relay

499
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:59,320
so the electronics are a little hard to
get right but they aren't anything

500
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,850
amazing that has been done for like 30
years

501
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:05,060
so you know they're controlling devices
like a

502
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:09,490
it went to Scott electrified Harbor not
electrify the census shocking people but

503
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:13,510
electrify the sensor for some kinda
electromagnetic device that

504
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:18,340
you know minute later pull the pin out
or unlocks a cam something like that

505
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:23,199
are so the first choice if you have this
if you have commercial doors are you but

506
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,080
when

507
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,179
mortise locks other embedded inside a
base coat pocket this machine or the

508
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:28,670
door

509
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:32,410
Werder a little the worse they have
what's called a deadlock she's not

510
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:34,060
exactly double like Ashley

511
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,120
double in your house it's the

512
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,409
keyser its absolves login metal a great
one

513
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:43,560
mortise lock has to be a police three
quarter inch double ouch

514
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,820
and you know so little piece on top well
when those things closing the door

515
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,450
pocket

516
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:51,580
there's a you know a strike that they
lodged against

517
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:55,270
that little thing clausen's and the good
ones you catch him not

518
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:59,150
about locks it completely so if you were
to put a cork in diverse thing and if

519
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,740
there was a gap you don't have a nice
template whatever

520
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,240
I you wouldn't really be able to to do
much

521
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,280
the other kinds it's pretty common to
you

522
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,570
has actually like you're from 12 to 5

523
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:16,370
I'll individual that lodges that close
in opposition to each other so you get

524
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,919
shit from either direction

525
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,860
and its just as strong as a double it
has little has at least as much massive

526
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,659
material

527
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,070
just over a a different generation and
these are built this way so that

528
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:30,530
when you hit the the solenoid you know
these things

529
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:33,629
either feel safer feel secure say
they're applying

530
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:37,530
power train organza we're releasing
partial opens at the case of iraq's it's

531
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,260
more common to be filled

532
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:43,680
safe in up these guys are basically
going to you

533
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,520
become a tropical either the active
coming happy that the doorknob to handle

534
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:53,540
drops those or and what a case is just
the after booking the door

535
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:57,310
collapses those little love deadlocks
the capsize into the

536
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:00,500
your pocket you can open the door and
they're made to

537
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,160
loss on their own when it closes with
very very little friction

538
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,170
when the key features also on the right
the

539
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:11,150
a one and one eighth I am commercials
older

540
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:15,430
he kinda block if you have a choice are
you have a lot of high security

541
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:18,540
la choices for the key bypass if you

542
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,960
if you choose something how's that
little threat its older is also called

543
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,290
SOIC small

544
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:26,920
former out i Norge angel coro think
small form factor

545
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,200
are those are great too when you get to
the you need to go like so under it Kia

546
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,020
knob residential locks

547
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:37,310
those are hard to electrify and its we
don't have a lot of good choices

548
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:40,610
for security locks inexpensive

549
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:44,780
awesome I gotta clock at home you guys
in Iraq before these on a daily basis

550
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:49,490
it these are like love and hate a
locksmith likens on them because they're

551
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:53,500
you can put one on garner anything you
can put it on a drug cabin the hospital

552
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,520
or you can put it on par in the front
door to lobby with glass doors the

553
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,910
controls are obviously or anything and

554
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:04,490
are they have some serious downsides the
arm that now looks but his work this

555
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:09,130
the small part on top bus maybe about an
inch thick and it's a big a pox imparted

556
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,170
device

557
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,320
phil was very fine magnet wire it's a
big electromagnetic

558
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:18,189
and a the park on the bottom but screw
the door that's called the armature

559
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:21,370
so when you close the door on apply
power

560
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:24,709
upping clamps down on a private there's
a good fit up

561
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,360
and anywhere from 600 pounds to you

562
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,409
r 1200 how models are available they
have 150 pummels frightful cabinets and

563
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,140
things

564
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:36,920
are they even have maybe 2004 models
they're very strong if there is I'll

565
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,120
probably

566
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,469
are they also are inherently fail all

567
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:45,780
saves so if you cut power to it will
open wish

568
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,410
is a good thing is really no mechanical
part to jam out because the door got

569
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:53,190
messed up and I was greater leverage is
going to work so those who use law for

570
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:53,760
life

571
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,220
safety things even though they may not
be as secure arm

572
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:00,809
come from them they require very precise
alignment if there's so much as two

573
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:01,850
sheets of paper

574
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:05,120
gap between the more like some clear
tape you can body check it

575
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,489
and the door was open but maybe fifty
pounds or 20 from the force not two

576
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,070
thousand

577
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:13,980
whatever's rated and they do the door as
you know where and sagging things they

578
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,650
have to be just from time to time

579
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:19,050
so but the other problem unlike a

580
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:23,370
but the mortars lock where there is a
separate keyhole that can bypass in a

581
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,000
separate doorknob you can turn to be
chemically open it

582
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,380
regardless of what the electronic said
are these don't have it you have to

583
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,480
install

584
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,559
a button a request exit sensor to in our
power to it sometimes

585
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:39,340
both you know maybe a motion detector
request exit and

586
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,770
in some kinda but you push also took in
a terse

587
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:46,150
so we have a few different examples
these are from my collection

588
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:50,930
on they typically how things like a PIN
pads

589
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:56,280
RFID readers onward won medals kinda
calls as a purse crumble pout

590
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,680
are that's just a bit later %uh but
every time you that start to bring a pen

591
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,720
it actually scrambles up a location
other numbers

592
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,070
and a house that's interesting little
lower thing with a bunch of sheets a

593
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,629
plastic lid on edge

594
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:11,659
make it difficult to shoulder surf yet
you look at straight on

595
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:16,260
won the things that talking to people
who no administers and so forth

596
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,020
they mention that people seem to be less
likely to give up

597
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,020
the the entry code the pizza guy

598
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,589
when one has a procedure you have to
explain to you the look at the like

599
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:29,960
from maybe they're trying to tell me
that I shouldn't give out to anyone

600
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,418
so up what these also uncommon

601
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:36,589
some systems do you have he threw out
directly going out with you know some

602
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:37,960
kind of secure

603
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,059
it ish protocol up but

604
00:34:41,059 --> 00:34:44,409
majority these though are using other
widan which is a two-wire serial

605
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:47,089
interface that's in the reading the
clear

606
00:34:47,089 --> 00:34:50,369
or Rs 45 which is a long range

607
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:54,619
serial port is lot industrial
applications to but 32 devices

608
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:58,599
on their but it's just its big brother
to you arse 232

609
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:02,720
serial cables where the summer typeof
right rhetorical I Peche

610
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,290
has bright red protocol a big angry
message from the boxing it's a crime to

611
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:07,829
reverse engineer this product

612
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:11,869
kinda funny a lot of other companies
feel that way probably bed

613
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:15,099
they don't that one other security
features is that

614
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:18,540
are protocols on publishing only works
with our stuff so we can so more

615
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,619
and drinks or secured that's out on a

616
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:26,650
that's all challenging because about
almost all these guys

617
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:31,240
are going to be in their lower security
mode whatever they have to interact with

618
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,430
another interest here

619
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,910
so if you buy all your from the same
ecosystem from the same vendor

620
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:39,440
did you have in fact an encryption
protocol maybe even a public use changer

621
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,680
three-way handshake

622
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,680
you can plug in a row reader device
perhaps but the second house in Iraq

623
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,480
without

624
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,260
fire alarm about other building control
system has been there for five years

625
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:54,570
it's also always going to want these
clear taxed less

626
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:58,380
fun mozart's going through a gate where
the talks in cryptids

627
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:03,760
ES and you on one side and dumb wagon
signals on the other side

628
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,150
so definitely follicles interception at
those points

629
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:11,200
up some the censors me about their I
ever owned it's probably seen the PR

630
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,118
motion detector right the couple couple
different flavors

631
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,119
are the good ones like the one on the
right have both

632
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:21,610
a sensor that detects its basic are

633
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:24,930
body heat me about so they work they
have two sensors

634
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:29,190
a little friend Owen sizes up in the
zones and where and pretty much one of

635
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,510
them

636
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:33,560
goes hotter than the others own

637
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,950
and their seismological pies lessons and
their scandal something like

638
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:41,540
kilohertz you have to be incredibly
slowly to not repeat this by

639
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:45,500
motion you have to not be hot basically
are but they will go off

640
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,730
we also go off occasionally for things
like that it's one Walgreen extra warm

641
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:51,320
because the

642
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,450
heating systems behind it were the Sun
shone through the curtains right onto it

643
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:55,850
and

644
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:59,580
you know quickly when it passes the tree
there's lotsa reasons again falls

645
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,950
micro sensors in falls for different
reasons like someone sending right

646
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:06,290
outside your window knocking the door
can sort of emails always was rejected

647
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,210
space

648
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:11,080
are these dolls answer actually

649
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,819
can have a possible worlds they won't go
often lost my grave

650
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:20,890
and the the infrared of and they will do
sir false alarm but quite a bit

651
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:24,839
August 6 answers won the right is a
really old school ultrasonic motion

652
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,570
detector those where he's much because
the anymore

653
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:31,290
about the false alarm a lot may have
limited range there BC

654
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:35,480
a distance finder so they're doing what
they call volume metre detection

655
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,369
is there something here closer than
there was before

656
00:37:39,369 --> 00:37:42,820
on accusing glass break sensors these
are you spot a bit

657
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,760
they were really have a microphone and a
little microcontroller DSP chip

658
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,680
that and some filtering circus that
listen for the sound

659
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,710
a broken glass so when glass breaks

660
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:57,190
they will I basically process the signal

661
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:01,100
and bills and our a alarmed because I'm
really

662
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:05,339
and those can actually in protecting
area of several windows are all room

663
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:09,020
I for install properly in these all have
directions know for

664
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:12,330
but they will want the captain know
whether you need to have them are

665
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,610
haitian where a mob

666
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:17,560
%uh but those Russia chemical sensor up

667
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,799
women alarm wiring a going through alarm
systems and so forth

668
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:26,180
wanting to discover is that's almost all
of the

669
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,649
it commercial sites aren't probably not
going to use wireless

670
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:33,580
sensors they don't want to have two sons
were unchanged batteries in

671
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,700
things get marked off the wall on
whatever

672
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:41,049
false supply Cup so that simply used to
call a three or four state or

673
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,680
incineration

674
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,368
and they basically have are a couple
relays and the

675
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:49,610
there are a couple love are resistors

676
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:52,619
and they form are normally closed loop
so

677
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:56,380
in what happens when your switch is
closed on those sensors

678
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:00,450
up for all flows for one resistor
through that sensor and then back to

679
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:01,279
grounder

680
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,380
back to to your Fievel simply like it

681
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:09,300
103 did fall bloopers common all the
sensors have a bright on toxic and three

682
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,000
bottles a joint through it

683
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,730
obviously they're able to detect a
couple different things if thats which

684
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:19,100
opens on a sensor like someone opens the
door results of motion detector

685
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,710
up that will change the current possible
heart beats for two resistors

686
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:26,050
a console that if someone were to shore
up the wires

687
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:29,710
resistance would decrease underpinning
where the shorted out

688
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:33,500
in-store pickup the wireless I'll it
would go open circuit

689
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,550
all those depending on how the curve can
be detected as unique States as a

690
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:42,540
a tapper a car of faults or alarm or

691
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:46,700
and everything is a-okay state so that's
why I had

692
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,600
what are the chances I will these things
you want something a house in analog

693
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,740
inputs in can differentiate these if you
can

694
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:56,069
makes a more secure so talking about
trouble

695
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:59,100
you know now you you know what kinda
pieces are

696
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,640
it waters may badges so it c0 keys

697
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,950
we can do things that are more difficult
with mechanical walks like we can allow

698
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:12,600
flexibility in our security policy you
can say hey I don't trust this person or

699
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,900
they don't have any doubt 24 access to
everything in here

700
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,700
butts I I would like them to have
business hours access or I'd like to

701
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,980
restrict it to you

702
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:25,900
no certain time a certain zone I only
want someone who has me at this

703
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,740
public meeting room you know once a
month i jus have it open and close them

704
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,189
once a month and not you know

705
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:34,940
two in the morning on Sunday I and i can
do things like

706
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:40,530
give my different accessible seized my
public areas maybe I can get my visitors

707
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:43,710
the ability to come in and out of the
outer perimeter in the lobby and thus

708
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,760
the break room

709
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,070
but maybe not why aren't you area

710
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:52,080
I it will encourage people props to
follow a better security policy

711
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,460
but be doors can be always locked if it
takes half a second open them

712
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,760
known in the bad is already running Mac
it's not as big a deal

713
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,400
we can learn things like human failures
are

714
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,070
or props are tailgating Karachi are
sensors

715
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:10,770
there for Lisa deploy the attack how
many people walk through the door

716
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:14,500
what direction they went through the
veterans other issues I R

717
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:19,740
beams and the you just have a place
counter that counsel me forces came in

718
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,819
and not to the first one home people's
hands me the second one

719
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:27,070
interesting stuff but persuading a lot
of things right we can see the law give

720
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:27,550
something

721
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:31,540
you know cuz Missy nor miss moran

722
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:34,990
how to earn an issue after the fact or
worse employee was terminated or

723
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,419
whatever it is

724
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:40,470
arm we can also integrate with other
systems

725
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:43,669
so somebody's magis I we can definitely
clone

726
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,560
the tokens almost anything like tronic
can be reverse-engineered

727
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,859
and copyright you can go with mechanical
key to

728
00:41:50,859 --> 00:41:53,670
one problem is that some these can be
done at a distance which is a little

729
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,530
different

730
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:58,290
security mall arista these all require
electricity

731
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:01,970
are someone can deliberately interrupt
or manipulate power

732
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:06,270
arm I had a customer it's the
construction company

733
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:10,830
and somebody up sabotage their
generators a one-star

734
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:15,990
in the cart before global feelin using
insulated tools cuz probably they

735
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:19,779
meanwhile their electrical contractors
not you know it happens and was on

736
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,990
payday so you know you've got

737
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:26,368
people who get Ann Arbor overtime for
reorder checks late well you did not

738
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:27,230
read

739
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:30,420
so power is definitely something that
you have to consider

740
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,930
almost all the shit housing for a UPS
and

741
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:37,700
power compare system fail maybe in
unpredictable ways

742
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,710
I mechanical stuff it's pretty obvious a
key there

743
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:44,230
failover and/or feel feel jammed up you
have to call a locksmith

744
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:47,260
you know will these do something weird
here the only

745
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:50,470
end up in a state where there's not
enough power to reliably keep the

746
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:52,350
microcontroller be read or

747
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:56,100
no the La Crosse much power as the
undersized the power supply and it

748
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:00,609
reviewed something those are all
possibilities need to be tested for

749
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:04,420
a brute force attacks raid you know it
as a run

750
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:08,609
operative I look closer to try out keys
is was used to be car dealers other

751
00:43:08,609 --> 00:43:11,080
Mikey like every possible Chevrolet

752
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,920
all know is probing into town from even
a modest law

753
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,520
you know their spouse the Commission's
but if you have a device you can double

754
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,030
sided sticky tape to you

755
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,820
the reader it'll do that over the
weekend while you're not there it you

756
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,030
might consider going up

757
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:28,290
you don't even have to be there and the
course the the network

758
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:31,500
other servers the wiring all those
things really need to be

759
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,570
you're behind the fence basically in the
secure

760
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:38,440
or more control area and probably not
running around outside not in

761
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,720
conduit with you know if possible
boxshot tamper switch is things like

762
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,618
that

763
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:48,010
also somebody access tokens we have are
we have contacted all she's

764
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:51,180
the b-meg makes for a car has a bank are
you all right

765
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:55,180
just like up there's a for Michael ABA
there are a bunch of a writer what weird

766
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,740
ones using hotels

767
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,839
that are harder to read NJ the bureau
does both those

768
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,680
are why concurrence those are
interesting those are a little

769
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,750
card that has piece is a magnet size
wire warranted or south

770
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:11,109
and since are swiping across a a reader

771
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:15,350
has a little basic tape as a readout
those are fairly hard to

772
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:19,330
to clone a mean they don't enormous data
and they're pretty old technology

773
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:24,140
but the interesting because ur they
don't have smaller bodies like modern

774
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:28,240
usually contact was our bodies isn't out
omg girlz me things

775
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,618
other smart no smart cards like the
Kinkos part

776
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:35,140
strong girls into a talk about the hot
not those

777
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:38,910
may or may not be this can be very
secure they can also be pretty poor

778
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:43,149
Los the local indigenous reads as the
car but I think this role in resolving

779
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,480
were such as

780
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,010
looks at a value that says is authorized
or not like nothing

781
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:51,030
better up better systems they can have
kilobytes

782
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:54,180
two megabytes a data storage and they
can do things like

783
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:58,359
run an application that does a a
three-phase child response system

784
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:01,650
here you wanna love my card slot on Rt
one other readers on slow start to you

785
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:03,040
in a negotiator

786
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,320
whatever handshake for the decent
challenge response and

787
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,730
never actually try anything secret
determine if there's was getting

788
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:13,880
those are better systems I'll the these
two dollars now it's

789
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:18,480
Maxim I button that's a little are
sealed milk and its use for

790
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,070
environmental sensors

791
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:23,780
love security guard systems use them
they have to clock in at buttons that

792
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,000
are party to all

793
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,840
they have to change and stuff as we can
meet because they're very easy to

794
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,940
hook up to your twitter or some kinda
bitterly you a

795
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:37,030
or truck device ever simple protocol and
then the contact list which

796
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:41,160
is probably ninety percent of the market
are people who run

797
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,890
buildings like these because there's
nothing to get dirty

798
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:48,080
you but the reader behind the glass even
so everybody wiring is protected

799
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:52,250
which is good I am thinking the possum
are freddie was your typical

800
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:56,109
thing you probably have your wallet or
your keychain they can be active like

801
00:45:56,109 --> 00:45:57,770
the mobile speed pass

802
00:45:57,770 --> 00:46:00,780
I haz attacking taxable how it's

803
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,910
I you never i use the toll roads in a
transponder you put on your

804
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:09,368
your dashboard well that's not too far I
detect others have long-range

805
00:46:09,369 --> 00:46:13,040
long-range often is not what you want
you may be what

806
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,029
not was working so you room for just
about touching it

807
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:19,990
but the other hand if your warehouse
maybe wire trucks to you have the gate

808
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:21,990
opened as the drive and you know they're

809
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:25,868
the feet of the ground in 10 feet from
the gate that's reasonable

810
00:46:25,869 --> 00:46:29,020
up and then they have things like car
alarm remotes the they like putting

811
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,740
these things like residential home you
know

812
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:34,839
alarm systems and stuff I'm not crazy
about that

813
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:39,170
irony buildings mostly projects so

814
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:42,210
possible over the tax these are pretty
short range

815
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:46,430
on the order like zero five centimeters
up the power forward as actually being

816
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:48,100
magnetically coupled

817
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,839
so they have to have be pretty close to
get dont think its the Byfield

818
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:55,520
that does a other primarily read-only on
with the head

819
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,619
in 2005 delivered staggering house
overall

820
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:02,590
on there is the important one hundred
which is kinda like a financier and I so

821
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:03,260
standard

822
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:07,510
it's similar to it but open other
rewrite was not what the queue to you

823
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:11,050
I have some that work with this cloner
you can read a tag-team

824
00:47:11,050 --> 00:47:15,430
right write a writeable version
positively out slow data transfer

825
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:19,440
and you're only employing a beef between
32 and 128 bits

826
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,910
update of them instead we just like a
six year old number

827
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:26,129
up and somehow security features like
the high-tech

828
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:29,170
all those are used a lot and automotive

829
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:34,130
publications a so here's some tokens I
have a bunch of unstable furniture goes

830
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:34,900
well

831
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,940
they can be hearing from employable
class counsel to the

832
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:41,380
your typical hid core bar key fob

833
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:44,470
your article a clamshell our car that's

834
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:47,569
as a ok well wired and they're usually
think you can solve their

835
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:51,240
over the tags are never people them up

836
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:56,250
the I for busy tags: are typically the
13 15 ignorance groundouts most common

837
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,000
one

838
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,280
a long read range to sleep centimeters
are

839
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,830
more advanced features possible somehow
global microprocessor symbol on them

840
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:08,190
and they can do a simple encryption

841
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:11,340
different as a handshake stuff like up
are they can

842
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:14,830
you know if it in three mutually
authenticate no like we try and do with

843
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:15,380
us I'll

844
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:19,330
early a most do not support something
like a full version

845
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:23,319
love as a seller tell us there some
kinda lightweight proprietary protocol

846
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,330
and often

847
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:28,580
proprietary tech for up and encryption
that was made up by the vendor

848
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:32,890
up the money I so a wonderful 438

849
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:36,589
I is one most common formats not to find
the local standards not

850
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:40,890
are most common vers not as the my fare
card about the Philips semiconductor

851
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:45,150
as I believe by their available company
for four outs

852
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:48,590
are these are used to the one on the
lower left is in LA transit system

853
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:51,980
car turns out that is my for card on the
lower right

854
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:55,660
our thoughts that okie from last year is
let me read uses

855
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:59,569
a 1k I my for classic I think it is

856
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:02,609
so not more secure the world I think
really does I love

857
00:49:02,609 --> 00:49:07,220
on your description you have obviously
small data blocks that

858
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:10,700
you require I think it's forty the key
to you

859
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,118
reading right them well turns out
through

860
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:18,150
talking and singing some all forms
respondo challenges and things

861
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:22,460
in about 15 minutes UK and Bri although
the sole security and you can rewrite

862
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,119
the code

863
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:27,040
so not terribly secure but you have to
understand these

864
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,119
or necessarily designed for high
security resign for low-cost

865
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:33,580
things like you know transit bus systems
and stuff like that

866
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:36,109
and they're being used more and more for
higher-value stuff that maybe they

867
00:49:36,109 --> 00:49:37,930
weren't engineer for

868
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:42,430
are some things you can use for auditing
other sprinkle device last

869
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:46,180
are it's a card class fire from a
company called are five years

870
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:49,390
and they have two models a high for
Peace Love Regency

871
00:49:49,390 --> 00:49:53,618
and you can plug it into your laptop and
it shows up as a keyboard wedge

872
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:57,440
Ibiza shows up with another input device
you leave a card on it for about 10

873
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,310
seconds

874
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:01,799
and it will tell you what kind of car
did is and depending it will try to

875
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,270
rebuild the serial number or whatever
date it supports reading from a

876
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:09,780
it's more sophisticated you know
protocol that has to have a conversation

877
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,020
with the car

878
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:15,880
it doesn't have support for top up but
they do have models that you can hook up

879
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,770
to PC and configured it to have those

880
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:22,640
those interactions about this Kenny is
you can take any random

881
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:27,650
RFID tag and no pretty quickly what it
is and get this wrong but a few things

882
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:30,830
this can be solved some really awesome
universal readers

883
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:34,630
they can basically I'll be programmed to
have

884
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:37,859
end up playing in 10 like I think to
someone or two simultaneous

885
00:50:37,859 --> 00:50:38,970
personalities

886
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:42,390
other choices like 70 different vendors
readers so they can is

887
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:46,240
emulation software I and stress on the
right have over your licence

888
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,410
I am card cloner even when he's on he's
a pretty cheap

889
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:54,000
missiles like I think 50 bucks these are
sold a lot because

890
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,480
many stacks for use in automotive
applications so there's a strong

891
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:03,300
market for aftermarket electronic key
tag loners for cars

892
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,960
you must pay five dollars at the
Mercedes dealer if they can buy a that

893
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,940
they can go to some

894
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,210
shop that will make them working here
for 50 bucks

895
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:14,930
so these are all over the place our
bottom line right

896
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:18,500
most the security features news cards
are close worse not well documented

897
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:21,790
YouTube we have to sign an NDA and you
have the

898
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:25,619
in there the program said to get any
kind of detail

899
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:30,030
information API's really doesn't have
the warm fuzzies in from security

900
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:34,030
I'll always have my concluding community
mostly because automotive users

901
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:37,410
and this is all for you low-cost almost
all the

902
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:40,480
the wily deployed systems like the My
Fair

903
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,450
are that have been on the wild long
often subjects in rigorous evaluation

904
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:47,240
have been found to be really locking
technically

905
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:50,279
so if it can be read you should if you
can be ready she just seemed to be

906
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,119
cloned

907
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,400
and you should employers offer on the
back and with your software security

908
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,660
policy

909
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:59,259
%uh rather than the car if you want to
do something like

910
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:02,599
in for an account on the card or do
something basic like you

911
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:06,570
swipe the card you read said it rewrites
it with a new key

912
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:11,359
before eight I releases a door you can
basically not have to

913
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:15,049
rely on a lot %uh security if you want a
better Marmon

914
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:18,869
a were also found out though is that was
gonna care about

915
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:23,300
really we're working about or working on
the dirt and Charlie level most the time

916
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,859
don't hear anything we can do is
probably better

917
00:52:26,859 --> 00:52:31,090
down the the 510 slaying walk we have
met or before

918
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:35,070
and/or owner tony is probably come from
people is placing a he's in propping the

919
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:37,119
door open or someone smashed the window

920
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,480
and not from someone breaking the
theoretical encryption strength

921
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,310
our wiring right

922
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:49,029
so we can offer some design criteria we
miss you want this to be affordable

923
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:52,099
are typical commercial systems are in
the order like

924
00:52:52,099 --> 00:52:55,250
two to three thousand dollars per door
install them we don't have that kinda

925
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:56,040
money

926
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,359
so we want something that would use
commodity stuff about the the widening

927
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:00,690
their faces the most

928
00:53:00,690 --> 00:53:05,130
common readers you buy new open certain
ones you can buy use

929
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:08,340
building take out %uh hidden other
readers on e-bay

930
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:12,790
are you can buy new ones work up on a
box they are or which can serve

931
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:16,259
we want to have a two-door combat
capability

932
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:20,240
we want to be I able to run independent
have a PC

933
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,720
police yet it could work in conjunction
but

934
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,529
it should work if our servers down and
we want to have logging

935
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:30,930
auditing and supervise alarm zones

936
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:34,230
no and the other thing

937
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:37,030
everybody seem to have a different idea
of what they want their workflow to be

938
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:37,530
so

939
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:40,980
other actors basis you have to play
these are guilty or come to different

940
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,560
things like a

941
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:47,090
you know time-based %uh have you know
sup open/close in response to you

942
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:50,730
when someone comes in the door maybe
they want a ride or timer

943
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:54,500
some stuff was available persons this in
some wasn't

944
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:58,720
and we see what's you up for that can be
leasable materials was under 100 dollars

945
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,830
a possible

946
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:03,340
anyone you something people can maintain
like ordinary or some other open source

947
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,760
micro

948
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:09,119
so now I we've had these out are we've
been summoned other hocker spaces as

949
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:09,630
well

950
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:13,359
and others like 15 actress I it's
probably three or four hundred users

951
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:14,700
romer

952
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:18,089
and we have I guess but for contributors

953
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:21,869
we've got some Davis %ah possums
developing last month already done a

954
00:54:21,869 --> 00:54:23,200
simple web is funding for

955
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,330
as your counsel now when excavating

956
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:31,250
sort of our 1.0 ugly version went to the
Virgin to you which shoes

957
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:34,710
to play most the sites and now we know
version 3 which

958
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:38,480
as much a fancy stuff like to work for
an LCD there who knows built and

959
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,400
or you can use your other you know what
her favorite out more programming for me

960
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,150
what

961
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:45,640
our house for alarms owns a house in but
protection really

962
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:49,279
these devices are mostly about
protecting the inputs and outputs from

963
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,170
footage by XM

964
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:55,470
you're turning big heavy magnetic things
on often you need to suppress all those

965
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:57,118
transient smaller stuff

966
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,690
so they'll try design partisans were
complex but it's going to be made we

967
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:02,090
serve us up a dozen

968
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:05,250
what the car it's about environment

969
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:08,250
and Smith you should we have no rs.25

970
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:11,369
were to read your support we have a
built-in

971
00:55:11,369 --> 00:55:14,740
may get a 3G and the USB chip

972
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:18,569
are what we are we found a nice little
120 kilobyte a

973
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:21,580
your face where to store all the tags on
board

974
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:24,700
the old one which he puts oblivious to
100 users on

975
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:28,549
this one and there you can be expanded
to 10,000 plus

976
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:33,220
up people also been one you season have
been point is for locking out like their

977
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,009
equipment

978
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:38,070
if they have a laser cutter a CNC
machine well you can wire Elise relays

979
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:39,849
into the emergency stop button

980
00:55:39,849 --> 00:55:43,800
and the people by Jan you know before
they were able to attack with the thing

981
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,890
after they saw the program up a river

982
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:51,299
and we put a a real time clock and the
word and a buncha montuori

983
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:55,470
I oh so people can can use them and we
also go up with a major version was

984
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:56,939
released on police and

985
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:01,470
and that as it relates and r15 alarm
zones

986
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:05,540
and also low voltage monitoring thing so
it if you have a UPS or some other

987
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:08,009
system hooked up to the console from
battery in

988
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:11,849
how healthy it is and we can account for
the overall architecture where

989
00:56:11,849 --> 00:56:15,089
you know we're just worrying the small
modules and they can be linked up with

990
00:56:15,089 --> 00:56:16,500
Rs 45

991
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:20,380
and then go into no master is not system

992
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:24,210
I will look at all so you we've been
using la Google+ PCs

993
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:27,530
it's a small let computer and I'm

994
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:31,400
look at them for the Raspberry Pi
couples or users just got them in or

995
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,589
going to rate him

996
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:36,520
so it cost you know thirty to fifty
bucks to add you do not see me the art

997
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,230
we own

998
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:40,430
your small microcontroller devices
drugging Bonnie

999
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:43,919
well now there are basie for one server
is available

1000
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,270
in the thirty dollar price range were
thinking maybe this skipping out on

1001
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:48,520
going straight to you

1002
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:52,589
you know will serve a device on board so
this is your Google install

1003
00:56:52,589 --> 00:56:56,320
of people and putting is an just like
all alarm system panels looking for

1004
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,080
building seems like not

1005
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:02,609
you've got %uh power supply a battery
backup and he just major are in there

1006
00:57:02,609 --> 00:57:06,910
up so really quickly other wiring you
have to protect it

1007
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:11,020
other man the middle toxic and if we
have a replay device that

1008
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:14,400
will issue a valid card reader and
replay if you

1009
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,390
swipe your card that's the road one
about sacked about its a

1010
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:24,220
2007 where wanna believe other wiring
can be shorted out you can possibly

1011
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:27,279
it wasn't fuses and if it's a

1012
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,400
I feel open or feels safe to work

1013
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,490
you may very well open the front door so
so things like not wiring their

1014
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:37,580
readership to see it was on the outside
the same

1015
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:41,619
power supply a or views as the inside

1016
00:57:41,619 --> 00:57:46,550
and you can do things as a bird alarm
sensors

1017
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:49,930
and readers themselves they have a

1018
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:53,560
outside wiring to be difficult for talks
you can new clones came to all kinds of

1019
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,009
stuff to them

1020
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:59,580
I you can dude I'll serves to talk a lot
of these cards have no anti-clinton

1021
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:00,390
capability

1022
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:04,420
so few words you just a park C one is
larvae beads to them

1023
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:07,589
are newbies wild-card whatever the red
so

1024
00:58:07,589 --> 00:58:11,470
kinda na vs a bit sick what would be
your truck with love

1025
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:16,060
see consumer goods moonwalk I am very
few the systems are doing

1026
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:20,720
you need tough love scripture child
response we have been looking out

1027
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,848
is doing things like maybe having
interactive conversational the phone out

1028
00:58:23,849 --> 00:58:27,810
some other New York my android phone
support NFC

1029
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:30,950
Near Field Communication that's
basically you can act like my fare card

1030
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:31,710
reader

1031
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:35,490
medical stuff I am all these are over

1032
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:38,729
my sis house florida leads you can yes
shame

1033
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:41,900
piece a paper since I got another door
magnets

1034
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:45,890
summer strikes you my beloved a strong
Magana this is my favorite I

1035
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:50,339
double door with motion detector and a
magnet

1036
00:58:50,339 --> 00:58:53,349
only have to do is wave a cheap paper
between these may open

1037
00:58:53,349 --> 00:58:56,170
was looking the variations like when
your balloon underneath and doing things

1038
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:57,040
like got

1039
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:01,029
the classic boss Rex answer is almost
always pointed down it's almost always

1040
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:04,160
seems like next something with a gap in

1041
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,240
arts anyway we're out of time but
looking to the future

1042
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,720
I'll we think about things like having
multiple unreliable sensors

1043
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,720
really want to reduce the the fall scene
as opposed to increasing the alarm just

1044
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:21,569
so coming out are different type
solution other detectors that

1045
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:25,060
are using some the algorithms people
being like a robotic sense of driving

1046
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:25,859
cars

1047
00:59:25,859 --> 00:59:30,160
a train at out house in for a stick so
that we runner-up the runaround

1048
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:34,299
within tree mood for a week and then we
talk a

1049
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,890
three different sensor's within 10
minutes after a trip to call the police

1050
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:38,080
or

1051
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,750
one or two of trip to tell that someone
is occupying it

1052
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:45,980
are me we can do some things with I open
CV machine vision

1053
