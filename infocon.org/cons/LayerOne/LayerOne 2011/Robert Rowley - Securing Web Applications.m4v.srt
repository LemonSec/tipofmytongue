1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,100
here everybody and

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,508
welcome to you later 1 2011 I

3
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:10,849
me I will be your first thought for the
day him

4
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:15,089
are right i guess im here add

5
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:18,890
I as a plug-and-play one lbs no hear me
sounds good

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,199
I I'm the first talking today so all

7
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,340
go ahead and get started I hope that
everybody's awake I'll talk I'm gonna be

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,519
giving Israel web application security

9
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:31,720
primarily from the standpoint of a
system administrator so when I can be

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,320
anything the code will likely be
changing things that

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,090
are the actual problems the beginning
with that you know the server side of

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:38,670
things in

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,190
doing the best we can without having to
mess with coaters actual work

14
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,750
home specifically this is where the
Linux Apache

15
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,300
MySQL PHP Python eccentric scenario so

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,640
no luck for you guys and your windows
administrators and such

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,829
so a little intro is I'm Robert Rowling

18
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:03,590
I work security and abuse for DreamHost
I dot com

19
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,770
probably I hope everybody's going for
them

20
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,229
anything nothing no interaction said

21
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,010
everybody is asleep I and you know so a
few web sites out there too primarily

22
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:15,920
shared hosting

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,330
which allows us to bob up to something
around a million plus web site that we

24
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,990
host or something like that so

25
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,070
as a it's a good number it is an
interesting experience because

26
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,320
I cannot any our customers go directly
even house debate it can be

27
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,449
we can't just go in and fix their you
know obviously bad the coded sites

28
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,799
we can upgrade diversions a word presser
peach but Baltimore without their

29
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,310
Lake confirmation so I have to be senior
Amanda

30
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,450
server administrator side of things and
protecting their sites that are

31
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,710
obviously vulnerable from getting
attacked in getting

32
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:52,139
compromise because it's obvious also our
fault apparently every time that

33
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,060
I get these emails your fault you have
to stop this nigga

34
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,979
so before I really get started into the
depths

35
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:05,070
all the talk and the details I anybody
this is because this is actually a bit

36
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:05,579
about a

37
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:09,169
bear stock be rich media airy talk hmmm

38
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:12,319
the first thing to do if you're not
doing this is a

39
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,790
get a good backup system in place I
don't

40
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,929
start worrying about security if you're
not doing backups cuz you're

41
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,819
two steps ahead and you're gonna screw
yourself in the end job

42
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:25,920
there absolutely first priority if
you're in a work environment they will

43
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,958
cover your ass

44
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,430
i think is she goes bad I being able to
back up and say oh yeah everything just

45
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,840
did the server exploded

46
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,840
I've got backups though so otherwise you

47
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,769
you get fired and then that's done no
matter how much he say was somebody

48
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:40,530
else's fault

49
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,970
and if somebody else's responsibility
for backups you never seems to me is it

50
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:44,620
doing them

51
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,220
I either get a confirmation you can see
the back up to working in functional

52
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,099
or you do them yourself and make sure
that they're working in their functional

53
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:55,829
again otherwise you will probably not be
getting a job very much longer

54
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,000
of there and excellent asset in regards
to post

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,640
a first attack forensics as you can do
PC ko comparison

56
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,200
you see what has been changed to what
has been edited are you can

57
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,109
you not only fix things you can see
exactly what the attackers were doing

58
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,250
and why they were doing this seems you
need information about motives in

59
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,310
be more prepared against exactly what
they're doing

60
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,269
that certainly have a model backups

61
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:24,360
don't trust a backup directory on your
server

62
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,349
as I said you know what service can
explode so that would lose everything

63
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:29,420
all once what else will

64
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,839
through basic on it's also good to
restore your backup to read all the

65
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,470
media

66
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,400
legacy Dr CTR things like that that way
the attackers can

67
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,959
mess with your backups as well a and

68
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:45,970
you how there are many different ways

69
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,000
to our backup your data and there's a
lot of options out there that's

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,209
its own talks its own reasoning Alba and
managing like data owners things like

71
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:55,049
that its

72
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:58,620
own thing I don't worry about it too
much she can use these are stinky meat

73
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,620
are you can just

74
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,310
back up data on to a different server I
just using SEP

75
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,549
crap like that it's really easy but I
highly recommend using bait

76
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:10,180
and he's getting at version control
systems in place on your

77
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,269
environment especially p.m. multiple
developers or people working in teams

78
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:18,560
up mostly because you can review to see
who's changing white

79
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,870
and you can identify at the code that
was change was due to

80
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,699
attackers actions or do you do malicious
employee's actions

81
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:29,610
up or if it was just you know somebody
doing something really dumb in getting

82
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,910
things out about 3

83
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,320
that repository I'll the

84
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,130
as well as last Lapointe there's a heavy
code repository doesn't mean you don't

85
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,219
have to keep backups

86
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,120
the air not mission I'll be considered
your backup system they should just be

87
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,240
considered a repository its own system

88
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,470
and you should also keep your backups up
your repository somewhere else in the

89
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,000
same way

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,630
same passion same idea for backups I
just you know

91
00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:00,330
even of surveyor people plays
communication anything like that

92
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,889
are right so now actually getting into
the talk

93
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:07,430
K 3 haha so the

94
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,180
this taco over six basic concepts really
easy

95
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,430
there are three different types of
attacks all web based

96
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:19,460
the cross-site scripting SQL injection
its secure code

97
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,948
as well as the defense presented your
sysadmin I

98
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:27,639
a you'll be able to do application-level
defense methods using mud security

99
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:32,070
scratchy popular Apache model as well as
a network level defense

100
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,430
using snort as an intrusion detection
system and

101
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,310
filed tampering detection I used
utilizing I notifies what

102
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,330
this toxin to cover as talk a little bit
about tripwire

103
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,340
by I redid the talk for open source
conference I edit

104
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,630
she's all free stuff any questions so
far

105
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:55,139
before I get into the nitty-gritty and
at all

106
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:58,370
I gotta go faster

107
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,870
i right first at first attack cross-site
scripting

108
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,050
there are three basic types cross-site
scripting attacks reflected

109
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,710
stored Andy Lim tax reflected taxer

110
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,388
pretty much there are variables that are
passed along in the URL they exist only

111
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:14,470
in the browser the for the view at the
time

112
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,900
and it's real simple idea base key
information that's in the GET request to

113
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,299
oppose request that's being

114
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,650
that's for the person is being tricked
to click on is going to modify something

115
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,530
on that page is going to do something
really

116
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:28,219
unexpected indifferent I yes probably
have seen something like this on

117
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,199
Facebook recently with your friends who
are now messaging you about like

118
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:36,110
their new favorite like you know man
walks in on like daughter or some

119
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,039
weirdness

120
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:41,960
store tax are slightly different mostly
because the attack and

121
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,270
injection is stored in the database
somewhere

122
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,830
that we every subsequent view up that
page is going to

123
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,609
basie identify had this attack code in
it let's go do something malicious or

124
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,889
say do something unexpected things can
change that will air the page

125
00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:00,160
make the Browse work against for
whatever the attackers purposes

126
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,310
and a third type is DOMA tax which a
little bit tricky because basically a

127
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:11,490
their be changing the job Dom and
attributes in the browser

128
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,289
and is actually really truly I forgot me
exactly how to initiate those attacks

129
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:15,990
but

130
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:20,090
you may know Firebug is yet

131
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,359
but it may seem like you lies in jobs
going to change things things like that

132
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,599
so it's a little tricky it's not really
well seen I thoroughly

133
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:30,690
like widespread things like that on so
it's not too much worry

134
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,849
in regards to this aspect by just it's a
third type

135
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:39,069
art it just Pacific to the Dhamma
actually it's in a browser

136
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:42,289
as as it says on the bottom of her you
when you visit the page

137
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:45,960
with link will allow the Admissions Code
injected be in the browser

138
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,120
and a delicious things change
information on the page

139
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,039
XD JavaScript are you can get the
browser you do actions that your

140
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,159
in new and unexpected in completely
different mostly because

141
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,180
once you have access to see the visitors
browser

142
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,060
you can get them to do also it's a crazy
shit with utilizing flash

143
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,080
iframes JavaScript and this all-new

144
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,599
html5 stuff which is is coming out so

145
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,750
doesn't become a powerful tools in
attacks

146
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,190
quick and dirty examples is the is a
comment

147
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,789
on leave this a wordpress blog this is
like WordPress version 2.0 eight or 2.9

148
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:24,530
just like you put a script alert right
there in the comments and every time

149
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:26,948
somebody would visit the page would

150
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:30,639
pop up some things as you know you know
your cross site scripting injected X

151
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,729
their warble I was pretty much the
typical one whenever any cross site

152
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:35,709
scripting is our

153
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:39,338
is identified verified in the in the
wild so he says oh look you know this is

154
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:40,019
horrible

155
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,149
even a little script and everybody this
is the page he quickly and easily sees

156
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:44,190
that yes

157
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:49,510
is plainly vulnerable up get a little
more tricky on things you can utilize

158
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:53,130
like I mentioned a iframes anything the
in each team although the browser

159
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:53,950
understands

160
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,010
or scripting language like jobs get the
browser understand you can get XQ the

161
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:57,880
code

162
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,600
and you mentioned previously if you
really good with JavaScript

163
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,170
we really good with meeting with by what
browsers are doing unit is busted you

164
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:11,069
interesting new and different things and
unexpected things

165
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,940
I'll like here's a good example here I
utilize their jobs good

166
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:20,800
a document i'd get only by a bee and
change the settings for one the objects

167
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,189
in

168
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:25,610
of on the page which actually change the
post when its content was

169
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,279
and I play a a place to buy to whatever
I please

170
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,070
and being the entire post content on
this Web must log

171
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,170
turned into whatever I wanted I V do
this on that a new site

172
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,380
you can edit just little small parts the
article

173
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,730
I and there's no in with their database
will look the same

174
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,630
because it is injected somewhere else in
the navy's and they're not going to be

175
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,510
not gonna understand why their page

176
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,089
even though it's a news report up is
popping up and talking about you know

177
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:53,430
it's like differences

178
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,739
new look and the back and it looks all
correctable on the four and

179
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:02,070
it's me yeah misinformation

180
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:07,010
so quick recap for prostate scripting is
it is I limited in its ability

181
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,950
however that his primary strength other
major developers for the last

182
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,450
fight to 10 years don't really think
that this is a threat noting that the

183
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,290
problem

184
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,649
arm unfortunate I can mention like
misinformation %ah

185
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:22,339
job descriptions Jobs rip things you can
go really crazy with this

186
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:25,890
an if you if I could focus of lower just
across a tripping

187
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,060
they can be some crazy ass that the you
really a poll of

188
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,420
are the best thing to do if you want to
get into cross site scripting is

189
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,819
familiarize yourself with

190
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,860
up this small differences between
persistent reflected in Dom prostate

191
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,940
scripting attacks

192
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,560
and study JavaScript intensely as well
as any other scripting language that

193
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,719
browsers will be able to

194
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,820
understand because thats where you gonna
be able to do crazy ass things that are

195
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,240
unexpected

196
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:55,160
difficult to track down and which
footprint and everything

197
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,899
so for air defenses on again says me to
talk about mob security

198
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:02,589
before getting any questions about
prostate scripting

199
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:06,029
you live there a right missing that
explains it

200
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:11,529
extraordinarily well with lotsa on who's
in who's

201
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:15,750
so no answer the defense month security
said patch model i Commission

202
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,880
it will quickly a lady quickly mitigate
and prevent a

203
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,490
as well as identify attacks

204
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,310
you will need to add be running Apache
annually to install much security as

205
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:27,989
module

206
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,240
in your configuration are it's a real
simple

207
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,620
I did a it supposed to be me

208
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,950
and my lazy does not work at that
distance

209
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:39,960
army so

210
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:44,080
i right here in little blue section it's
pretty much what looks like an eyepatch

211
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,589
configuration it's not complicated to
get loaded in

212
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:49,680
it's not hard on but you will have to
recompile affair

213
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,189
or reconfigure and beans been restart
your servers

214
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,460
on I need use get some rules it's a
basement fingerprint rule

215
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,560
rule-based a module and

216
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,569
intrusion detection prevention system
are here's a list of variables that you

217
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,550
get to that

218
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,729
review we in your fingerprint
identification

219
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,420
its long list unfortunately you know you
guys going taking notes and

220
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,099
I'll be here for like 20 minutes are you
keep writing this down we can get this

221
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,660
light

222
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,890
you can also download large list

223
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:23,279
predefined a pre-made rules from either
got red dot com

224
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,260
or lost that organism both good sources
for getting a basic

225
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,779
basically list fingerprints to identify
tax and prevent them

226
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:34,470
however when you're building I'm on
security and you're doing is an actual

227
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,360
infrastructure

228
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,560
dole just down though their stuff in CO
and done

229
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,150
it's not how that works you have to
constantly be reviewing your rules

230
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,150
identifying it new tax as well as
updating you will sets

231
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:49,500
I think got root updates are rules every
month so you can only see more stuff

232
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:49,750
than

233
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:53,839
review the attacks ob also yet to be
smart because my security will run on

234
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,100
Windows servers as well

235
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,850
because Apache is will run on Windows
servers if you're running a server or

236
00:12:58,850 --> 00:12:59,680
Windows Server

237
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,939
don't low the rules that are specific
for the other operating system just the

238
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,279
way severe memory on your server

239
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:08,730
her right here's a quick rule

240
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,050
to stop that and the cross site
scripting injection attack that I should

241
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,069
you just a minute ago

242
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:17,510
I the sectoral is our request file name
is available name

243
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,839
and they said they see if your question
where Press comments post

244
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:23,870
I've see that file look at the

245
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,880
the chain rule says look at the Net's
rule in this a

246
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,500
event on on the page and the number
denies as well I'm gonna tonight that's

247
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,730
your actions which gonna do

248
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,950
not second rule says art school in
comment

249
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,709
which is the comment argument it makes
pretty easy sense

250
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:41,529
it includes a script or an iframe or
something like that something as a

251
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,320
shemale

252
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,780
or something that just that should look
right up you know

253
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,990
you're gonna tonight is in its gonna
basie stop the attack

254
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,820
in its tracks I here's a second rule and
overzealous version says

255
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,900
any argument any variables are passed
along to be in a browser to the site

256
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,819
if they have scriptwriter and just
tonight its much simpler but

257
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,540
obviously with every fingerprint will
they settin every intrusion detection

258
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,540
system you're going to

259
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,849
very between are stopping attacks

260
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,030
and allowing users actually use the Site
so

261
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:15,550
you really tricky with these things in
in just a screw you guys be ever do any

262
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,319
open brackets or greater than signs a
lesson signs like you're just gonna be

263
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,950
denied

264
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,790
unfortunately you can also get a
constant flow of people emailing you

265
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,569
like why can't a post on the site

266
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:29,850
also uniquely in a the environment i
working because it's so many web sites

267
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,260
even though I'm doing it could do
something similar to this in a makes

268
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,589
perfect sense to me

269
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:37,750
like there's no reason anybody's ever
gonna be do this injection a descriptor

270
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,329
this and I frame in a comment form for
WordPress

271
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:43,839
their will still be people there email
using why can I comment

272
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,029
like with this script I'm just talking
about JavaScript in this page to make

273
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:47,890
more because

274
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:51,390
that's bad for security by yet find that
nice

275
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,220
middle grounds where you know uses khaki
still use our site

276
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,160
and needs up rapidly secured for your
needs so

277
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,709
back to the earlier roles as cross-site
scripting attacks the exact same attacks

278
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:08,449
on your browser yea when the go to the
page in a try to commit

279
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,900
comment that as a script and I for a
minute they just had forbidden page

280
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:16,430
are you may notice that the at it's
blatant what's happening here

281
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,050
and the attackers going to clearly
identify all crap they're blocking me

282
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,420
with intrusion detection system

283
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,860
I so that means they're going to modify
their style have attack

284
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,110
they're gonna do different things they
do think you

285
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:31,820
actually you for the stop before hand
you mentioned something that was marred

286
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,940
you do that might be /c including in
cinema using center like

287
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,420
you GF or ASCII you just change that to
the next type

288
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,430
and I'll get around the ED HTML coding
I'll get around it

289
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:45,949
miss the cat-and-mouse game that you're
always gonna play in security anybody

290
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:46,470
knows

291
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,540
you're gonna provided prevention method
and they're gonna provide a new

292
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,900
unique type attack me basically did the
same thing a little different Wayne gets

293
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,870
a ring finger prints

294
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,910
and thats that's why you say always
update your rules always review your

295
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,490
logs

296
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,690
see what's going on and always adapt so

297
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,940
that's the quickly lemond security recap
here I

298
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,020
pros are a be really good

299
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,270
at preventing attacks is application
level which is a key concept on this

300
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,630
that it will allow you to get into the
fire into the

301
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,660
attack and Prevention right at the
application level which

302
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,329
supersede anything like SSL decryption
ATL you get a lot of access to variables

303
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:26,329
that are right down

304
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:29,609
at the application level verses are
trying to decrease packets and figure

305
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:30,170
thing out

306
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,380
figure things out from there which I'll
get into its Norton seconds more

307
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,180
difficult

308
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:39,229
and it's very flexible rules at Seattle
Art Supply variables a

309
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,550
to work of old as well as which allows
you to make very dynamic rules

310
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:48,339
and fingerprints in things like such it
is also extendable with scripting

311
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:51,530
anybody here knows lula by any chance

312
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,610
is either don't have right arms or
nobody knows look

313
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,780
here lead

314
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,650
limited user alright %ah

315
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,220
and as a lawyer who is a basics on the
train skip to main if you know any other

316
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,159
object or any language

317
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:10,030
you're gonna understand the left pretty
quickly pretty easily you will pick it

318
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:10,339
up

319
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:13,899
I really like lower I it's actually
coming in pretty strongly in the

320
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,100
security community

321
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:19,668
I'll end up skipping I use Isla I
believe that I

322
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:24,010
Wireshark I believe you sizzler and on
the scene I'm on securities the lawn

323
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:24,459
every

324
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:28,030
it's really easy scripting language to
implement in your pre existing code like

325
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,320
C++ code things like that

326
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,800
so he's really powerful tools are
becoming more powerful because you can

327
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,950
use scripting

328
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:36,010
and you can start army notifications are
you can start on meeting a

329
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,020
a prevention messaging you also
secretion as well

330
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,790
now you have a script that as axis
everything at the application level all

331
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,540
those very able to do

332
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,550
I just mentioned I im on security and
you can start doing

333
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,158
a comprehensive changes did like if I
always set on the fly

334
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:54,310
things like that the con is it is only
as powerful than

335
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,908
as the rules using she's used so I can
mention it's just download stuff from

336
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:58,980
got root

337
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,610
or a wasp and its last year's will set
seen you won't be

338
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:07,350
commencing any new attacks so always
keep keep up to date with all the stuff

339
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:12,020
are and also as well as I mentioned a
bad rules will cause false positives

340
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,340
and it is detectable by attackers so
they can just change that we change our

341
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,379
attack methods

342
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,669
they're gonna get around you're all set
and it's going to be back in goal

343
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:23,730
any questions about maturity will

344
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:28,010
good I think I'm good on time me right

345
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:33,530
you would have the time and

346
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:40,190
NH alright so the next another attack is
SQL injection

347
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,510
yes by can seat up there but it's a nice
little picture I found on their internet

348
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,908
a while ago actually it's the

349
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:48,810
car notion to check the this stop by
cameras

350
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,440
and his license plate changed her
something like that they did something

351
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,260
like you know trop

352
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:58,150
database you know make easier you hear
anything like that

353
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,200
in a little hope they were hoping that
the whatever this the security cameras

354
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,870
were with a

355
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:05,399
try to store their value in
inadvertently dropped entire database in

356
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,360
you can save everybody a Fight Club
escape

357
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,530
start over with nothing so I any over
SQL injection with this

358
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,320
popular WordPress plugin called photo
racer session %uh popular is like one

359
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,120
version as

360
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,500
severely vulnerable and the guy just
gave up and ran away

361
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,340
her said the same basic WordPress site
likes it is an older version of Word

362
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:26,810
Press

363
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:30,210
a I don't think I magnin work press for
this is just me

364
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,190
my basic example for all made the tests
%ah

365
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:37,770
PID all yen is the plugin

366
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:41,639
up WordPress plugins are the same as
Word Press so some other plugins and

367
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,050
kinda

368
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:45,110
suck in the will be liable to really
nasty stuff like this

369
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:49,689
I buy it appears a simple request first
page A just kinda just play some

370
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,850
pictures in

371
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:54,899
terrible stuff and use it was actually
the plan was also an Italian so this is

372
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,820
fun

373
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,300
hun you basin for pension stuff to the

374
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,220
the slick clearing or sign up it's
likely the the GET request at the end

375
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,820
you throw in some SQL queries right
there you simply add the Union select

376
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,120
your 1234 user login

377
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,178
are those 10 23 fours are just buffers

378
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:17,649
again a secret hearing familiar with SQL
injection or this issue I'll

379
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:21,830
mean not this the subs been around for
five or more years so

380
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,720
I'm which can quickly going through it
if you're in but he has any specific

381
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,980
questions feel free to

382
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,659
at raise your hand is certainly begin to
talk so there are two Gators out there

383
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:33,500
raise your hand so you understand it at
least if there's anybody that expert out

384
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,720
there is you can so I can understand it
better

385
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,300
would all with a real simple I'll

386
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,310
something you simply add your SQL query
to the end

387
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:45,440
in the code which I'm gonna get into
shortly

388
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,530
right here yet I this is what Maisie
happens the variable

389
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:53,020
is direct the table for immediate direct
the

390
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,010
copied over from the request 80 which is
that long string in the ring get

391
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,000
requests

392
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,300
on in the actual SQL query right here
there's no escaping that

393
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,639
that I A that's added in there so
anything is just added onto the engines

394
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,658
like weary

395
00:21:06,659 --> 00:21:10,470
that's been being made right here that's
the problem

396
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:14,169
he didn't escape it in he's add more
things on sac WI

397
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:18,740
when its return back you get access to
anything else he chose to select

398
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,110
things like that the expected to add me
again there's a there's example

399
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,178
expect this will create looks like this
mid-eighties 10

400
00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:29,460
the when you do the attack it looks like
me JD's a good -1 also do a union to

401
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,409
select

402
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:33,710
some more variables from many kids bring
about now

403
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,800
on the page legacy here INS

404
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,290
example white the problem is you can
just pull the user password

405
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:44,600
any other hasher the password rather
risk simple and quick d80 trip there

406
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,850
or d'Azur things like that and you'll
then she get admin password

407
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,050
what you like the WordPress Admin
account they won't even is and how they

408
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:52,970
were attacked

409
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,060
because you know you have the password
know just when they're all crap why was

410
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,450
a

411
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,690
you know why was I logging in from it in
earlier why was I logging in from

412
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:05,870
Romania like this makes no sense on also
idly by default WordPress doesn't log

413
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:10,219
on doesn't keep track loggins to the
admin panel so there's no

414
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:14,000
there would be no recollection to as to
who or how the the people looking

415
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,340
long into the system %ah but there are
plugins to fix that and hopefully the

416
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:22,840
Vikings to make things worse

417
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,000
so as a quick recap on SQL injection it
does require

418
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,210
a basic understanding our help and
understanding SQL

419
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,340
I don't know SQL dole US coal injection

420
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,360
you don't know JavaScript don't you try
site scripting injection new

421
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,379
action don't do any tax if you don't
know these things go well shit

422
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,740
hey it's very noisy at the database
structure is not known

423
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,340
so while the attacker is trying to get
clicked information their logs are gonna

424
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,129
show a lot a weird get requests things
like that

425
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,560
%uh so it's gonna come up as there's
clearly somebody trying to do something

426
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,270
that they're not supposed to be doing

427
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,590
you know when everybody when you're
ready to requesting the site is always

428
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,800
get you know

429
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,800
page 81 get paid 80 25 in and get PJD
union select

430
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,030
and psycho that looks really bad I'll

431
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:10,770
it's also very time-consuming if you
choose to do by hand which is just

432
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:15,668
stupid fun but stupid as you'll have to
sit there manually typing in all these

433
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:20,350
queries up but there are actually tools
to automate SQL injection the graph

434
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,610
every very well on the page

435
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:26,199
just start dumping a get requests a very
sexual priestly

436
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,260
train escaped any more data back and
what they see something that's was a

437
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,740
catch on to something on the page still

438
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,700
report back to the penetration tester
are saying

439
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,030
here is a you know here's a summary of
what I found on the page these variables

440
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:38,700
are likely we

441
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,960
in initiate an attack up

442
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,060
the county more than select last gray
just they showed select is because the

443
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,928
changes nicest way to do in SQL
injection

444
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:53,310
you can do anything that you that had
the Davis user has access to an end

445
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:53,990
table

446
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:58,460
which includes dropping altering
creating these also spoke reason to see

447
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,470
me know them all

448
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,880
I but basically you can delete the
entire database or

449
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,080
add new users to did to the database I

450
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,340
this also key to remember a in ESCO
anything too many years a database

451
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,270
administrator

452
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:13,580
if you have a wordpress site or in
WordPress user for your database

453
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,939
just give them access they need not just
that simple concept at least privileged

454
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,000
just let them do what they need to do

455
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,380
don't give that you don't login to
WordPress with your databases group

456
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,169
user just done

457
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:29,320
so any questions on SQL injection

458
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,540
going to this really quickly guys any
questions

459
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:37,230
all but I'm gonna go ahead now continue
on to the defense which intrusion to

460
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:41,139
pension intrusion detection systems as
well as intrusion prevention systems

461
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:44,469
snort is an intrusion detection system
it will review

462
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:49,040
packets on the wire and logged them if
they identify something is

463
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:52,530
looks malicious and this allows you to
it will I am sick

464
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:56,149
all the data going across the wire
summarizing into what you just identify

465
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:57,520
is malicious attacks

466
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,120
and take the appropriate action
otherwise there are add-ons restore

467
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,678
their you get

468
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,990
just base in a review those logs that
are made and if they identify that a

469
00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:05,620
user

470
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,949
when IP address sorry is a presently
tacking your server you can quickly

471
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:09,940
blocked them

472
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:14,050
I which is reported to the the ISP in
Romania and they'll be

473
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:17,908
and certain happy did do whatever you
need

474
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:22,280
the next to nothing to monitor network
traffic um also if you are doing so with

475
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,960
an intrusion prevention system

476
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,159
don't forget your whitelist otherwise
your gonna person you're gonna do you

477
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,190
gonna test to rule

478
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,290
annual convention this was gonna block
you out and then you're going to be

479
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:34,510
calling the network operations center
saying in the need to me the crash cart

480
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:39,240
is just block your IP address where you
gonna get another AP

481
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,980
so Cirque very easy to install

482
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,320
in the early this is the page this is
copied from their website and it is

483
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,740
actually that easy just

484
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,139
there by either the requirements which
is in this case on its server that's

485
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:52,320
perfectly fine

486
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,439
download it install it and at 12 mixes

487
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,460
extraordinarily easy with apt-get all
these package managers

488
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,710
sport is probably in a package manager
already you just go installing be

489
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,340
airports

490
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,020
packages whenever are it's widely vary
widely used

491
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,540
also very lightweight so it's not gonna
bug on your server special a speedy

492
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,520
service today

493
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,370
it's not a slow things down too much at
all you probably know every minute

494
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:14,479
notice it unless you have an

495
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,510
absurdly large fingerprints file which
is trying to detect

496
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,030
everything in your mom store can detect

497
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:24,520
more than just when application top
attacks unlike mine security much

498
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,350
katie's application-level just with the
web application level

499
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:30,389
asserts can do anything on you know
which includes a brute force it

500
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:34,740
attacks move a.m. anything else in
Europe or any other service a catchy

501
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:39,510
stop prevent are these just detect yeah
as I mentioned yesterday self only

502
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,730
log the tax for review yet he's an
add-on like

503
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:47,100
sports a.m. or guardian appeal a will
turn in Jinja intrusion prevention

504
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:47,889
system by

505
00:26:47,889 --> 00:26:51,010
simply all they do is i'd use IP here

506
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:55,310
I V firewalls like IBF what are your
whenever you're happy tables are

507
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:58,950
and watching block Diana that attacker
from being able to access new

508
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:03,260
on the network stack anymore

509
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:07,990
alright so an example code in a store is
that looks something like this:

510
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:11,240
at an alert request for it. speeches
attacks

511
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,480
where TV screen against the external
network

512
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,220
as looks really bad but if he has a lake
was gonna give away with the end

513
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,950
near fingerprint file and how is all set
up in a very well then you get used to

514
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:22,280
it

515
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:26,110
makes really sentence really quick and
easy issue the servers nation forties

516
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:26,820
are all variables

517
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:31,070
little dollars in different I the blue
ones are the only ones are the matter

518
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,428
for the integrity that you can just
ignore the rest

519
00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:36,649
but like I said it makes sense once you
get familiarized with the

520
00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:40,389
with the fingerprints father with how
their setup the RA content

521
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:43,790
variables are your view image that PHP
without

522
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:47,260
case and your icons and I D unions like

523
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:51,310
is the all the things are busy London
together if you have something you are a

524
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:55,190
then there's a new engine it has an ID
equals and unions like then search

525
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,110
looking like SQL queries

526
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:01,300
in the Caesar looking bad this will
protect all SQL injection

527
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,379
as a default with a lot of people do

528
00:28:04,379 --> 00:28:08,040
which is much better way to set up this
will this just focuses primarily on that

529
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,340
one attacking is that one plugin

530
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,580
says a bad example for SQL injection
general but a good example for that one

531
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,280
specific attack

532
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,690
yeah and this is exactly what would
detect anything that kinda looks like

533
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,530
this

534
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:23,030
I'll and we will like emissions not
we'll just log it

535
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:27,500
and this about what love looks like aids
lot a generation by the bases SQL

536
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,450
injection attempt

537
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:31,510
which is that special message that
identified right there

538
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:34,540
ending go through these logs later
especially be doing a lodging is a large

539
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:38,168
network and a systems you just gonna go
through lots Adriana parse out just for

540
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:39,020
what you want

541
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,570
IncrediMail you can just be a secret
magic inc. grass did

542
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,270
like really nice management stuff and
just review later

543
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:49,720
nobody hope nobody hears actually
manually go through every log

544
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,000
by hand bakers they LTTE's

545
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,240
up but I get to be in pain really well
just do that

546
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,039
all day long 3d logs %uh saw them
guarding up he'll turn sort

547
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:05,890
into injury prevention system like a
mention just that maybe table

548
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:09,309
to our drop all connections from the
attackers IP address

549
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:12,559
I it's real simple it's a different
level than the a then store

550
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,340
and things like that but pretty much
worked out pretty well

551
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,879
yeah the

552
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,070
yet an old mission again for the TV
whiteness your IP address before you

553
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:27,399
actually initiate these rules cuz you
will probably block yourself

554
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,049
and then you'll be upset that you can
access your site again you can't work on

555
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:34,559
the service was working on

556
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,928
so yep as a quick recap the process or

557
00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:41,460
are that it's very electrolyte me went
independently and everything else

558
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,309
unilateral any system pretty much you
want he mailed out a firewall

559
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:49,620
you Leising at sort at base a transfer
firewall on your network utilizing store

560
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,639
just a long stuff

561
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,000
have dedicated machine just for that

562
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,820
runs in the family is powerful it's very
powerful as intrusion detection system

563
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,010
or intrusion prevention system don't get
the two confused don't think that we

564
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:03,309
have to do both just choose one or the
other

565
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:06,320
at you can implement in excellent weighs
in at work

566
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,030
his network level as I'm also as I
mentioned already it's got a large user

567
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,620
base which is really good

568
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,428
take a huge user base where basie all
those a fingerprint files you can find

569
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:19,159
lots of examples even get on their smart
forms and you can talk to people saying

570
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:21,120
he's will doesn't work for me this rule

571
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,120
did work for me in these interest in
different ways are so on and so forth to

572
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,309
and as an intrusion prevention system it
will stop the attack from happening

573
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:34,700
as I mentioned previously with my
security 60 will follow the same

574
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,260
problem is that the attackers will know
that you're stopping their attack from

575
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:38,960
happening

576
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,110
the key difference is that with that
sort is your actually just blocking on

577
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,439
the internet work they can't

578
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,299
continue their attacking interesting in
different ways they ran into each other

579
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:46,929
and watch

580
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:50,490
or they get a new IP address to continue
to attempt to hack your

581
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:53,720
go after your server your system

582
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,330
negative is again same as mine security
it to

583
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,590
only as good as the rules that you set a
fuse use last year's rules

584
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,668
they're going to use this for you for
any new tax job

585
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:07,210
it can cause false positives which does
upset people when they get block from

586
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:10,110
the server when they're just doing
something that thought was okay

587
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:13,809
on and can be very you can very daunting
and large to customize

588
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:18,020
you bitches a good and bad thing because
it has a large following a lot of

589
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,190
fingerprint files

590
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:22,900
I you have fun reading through five
thousand that fingerprints to verify

591
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,559
which was really are necessary for you

592
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,678
your implementation which ones are
useless but you know again if you're

593
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:29,650
getting paid well just

594
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:32,929
go through that spent all day doing that

595
00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:36,240
it also requires a third party strip you
have an intrusion prevention system

596
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,150
which is okay by had not really like
what you would presume is

597
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:43,750
is how things would be Henry expected to
be on one good package

598
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:47,860
but it works any questions on store

599
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:54,770
yes

600
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:59,299
just look that up in your Google phone
dude bird

601
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:02,600
no I have not I what is Terry Connor

602
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:09,600
the up

603
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:14,230
they say and he's there's no back doors

604
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:17,970
in that at all now trust just the DHS

605
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:24,970
up

606
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:32,060
%uh surgical

607
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,110
a Todd

608
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:41,179
that that's their logo zip

609
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:44,180
hit the get go pee in a push to connect

610
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:50,030
was it is actually the same developers

611
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:57,030
or no them not sub

612
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:00,300
so there are new additions to start now
and in the next year so

613
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,389
get on it now so you're in the basin me
like I know something better

614
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:07,700
and then all update may talk had

615
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,140
baikal I any other questions concerned

616
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,770
very good well thinking getting the
tying has

617
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:18,290
this is running short now we're going to
tax

618
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:21,770
against children abilities I I was gonna
do the lake

619
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:25,590
other ties attacks for this is actually
pretty funny has at how I came acrossed

620
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:30,040
that figure it out and put into the
stock hey your code can be tech directly

621
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:34,120
than one fault is gonna be trusting user
input surreal basic concept this way

622
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,070
cross-site scripting worked his way
still injection works and this yesterday

623
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:37,409
to

624
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:40,890
in your code you did something stupid
and now the now they're doing whatever

625
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:44,420
the hell they want on your site so

626
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,490
the attacks in the utilizes bandicoot
upload form

627
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:51,150
as whites funny because this was the
print this is this something and I see a

628
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:51,760
lot of

629
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,620
with the bada platform just last people
upload PHP files or whatever anything

630
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,340
excludable by the Apache server

631
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:01,320
this is me searching google for PHP
upload form

632
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,870
and this was the first result I got so
I'm gonna presume that a lot of people

633
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,659
are using this exact code

634
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:10,370
for the M it for the safety in Lake

635
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:13,710
sanctity of the people that actually
wrote this in Davis example online

636
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:17,050
a a it may have changed by now a Google
search results

637
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:21,149
be come back she states not security
using development environments

638
00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:24,918
unfortunately I don't think anybody it
was a new but in PHP programmer gives a

639
00:34:24,918 --> 00:34:26,379
crap about that so they're just using

640
00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:31,529
really bad insecure for on animation
allow you it will allow the users to

641
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:31,810
upload

642
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:35,889
anything in it with X ke will extensions
so the servers gonna happen XQ

643
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:39,870
the PHP code that you just uploaded to
the site the Pearl the CD Accenture

644
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:44,109
years the exact code

645
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:47,260
that was found on this how to page

646
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,980
and that's exactly how it works I just
pop in peace it

647
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:54,260
into a PHP file an amended on the mayor
Patti system

648
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:58,030
and happily uploaded php file I

649
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:01,410
you think you know it's gonna be hard to
write a PHP file to do exactly what I

650
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,149
want to gather

651
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:05,200
customize it and there's a huge list

652
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,620
a PHP ship back door shells from shells
.org

653
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:12,250
sh3 lolz an internet thing for them but

654
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,660
is really nice database I and you can
upload

655
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:19,240
a you there Chelsea download from their
site for free and they don't care

656
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,470
and even upload shows that look like
this and their nasty in terrible because

657
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:23,850
they

658
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:27,210
lighting to anything you want the
filesystem anyone on the server

659
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:31,400
I'll years there's the upload page and
there's the shell

660
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,960
expected some images ago happy then
troubling that image dot

661
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,090
PHP and then this back to back to show
which allow

662
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:45,090
complete access and control the system
that's available there any questions

663
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:45,900
about

664
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:49,290
that terrible s it down

665
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:52,610
good you're not even on the Internet

666
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,980
good

667
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:01,000
sht LZ I searched Google for back door
shell PHP shells

668
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,330
that saw it I found out that site just
get just the search Google

669
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:07,430
she changed and I can only one attempt
then site that has

670
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:12,350
by 10,000 backdoor shells directly a
good and bad thing all at once

671
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:15,930
babbitt's good thing because was a bad
thing because these are

672
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:19,029
obviously easy to use for everybody cuz
they did all the work in

673
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:22,940
may provide you one location it's that
good thing for security people because

674
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:27,220
now I can just download all those shells
in no I haven't identifiers so I can

675
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,700
change track them down five identify
them on our servers and hear them really

676
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,120
quick

677
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,850
file system monitoring I wouldn't act in
your

678
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:39,640
by monitoring and me last night I
notified you mention i changes talk a

679
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,500
little bit for a

680
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,510
security health care for scale jobs or
security are

681
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:46,720
open source so some company limits
exactly what it is

682
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,490
their focus all open source stuff so
Itau do about tripwire

683
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:53,410
which is actually really good utilities
well it's been around for a long time

684
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,879
but it does exactly what he needs to do
in my opinion

685
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,350
it takes an imager what you file systems
was ok like and compares your

686
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:03,029
files every day or every so often and
tell you when things are changing

687
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:06,470
on doing this is she unfortunately

688
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:10,560
doing this is also very
resource-intensive are it's hard to find

689
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,750
a way to be able to closely monitor all
your files without

690
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:18,330
have causing like a performance like
reduction I notified as a good job

691
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,420
%uh this because it's in the kernel I'll

692
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,609
and so they see it it'll create a hook
for any time any changes are made to the

693
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:26,370
filesystem me

694
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:29,460
he calls are made in the girls as a
minute and then all report this back

695
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,370
and how to using all these files are
being changed

696
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:37,630
on the way continue night at I notify
and you

697
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,630
I though well as well so I had not lost
that

698
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,690
I was kernel modules releasing 02/06/13
which is

699
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:48,650
a while ago it's been around for a while
are improved upon d notify

700
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:52,230
if anybody's really old in says although
there is another tool

701
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:55,700
are I notify is just the kernel module

702
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,919
you not utilize trips on top of the in
order to do what you need to do

703
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,109
such as reporting our files is a
monitoring so on and so forth

704
00:38:04,109 --> 00:38:07,150
%uh those tools are biting I know if I
toolset

705
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:10,550
which is by what you want to look at for
on Ubuntu a redhead or whatever

706
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,970
%ah is also mimic specific if you're on
a BSD box

707
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:18,310
your net user i think is sq but does
very similar action

708
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:21,710
but in slightly different ways cuz it
this is Carl specific

709
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:25,040
are the and vitals want two things like
I N kron

710
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,400
i watch and she white notify

711
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,800
those are script that utilize I know if
I to be able to do you think that

712
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,930
identifies

713
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:36,640
built to do so identify tools I

714
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,810
is a few identifiers despues group tools
that are available

715
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:44,160
and I forgot what they do

716
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,279
sorry actually coffee quality her I
believe that live I notify a tools just

717
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,660
like the library

718
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:54,250
that you will be able to utilize to
build things like your c:\program

719
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,790
existing C++ programs

720
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:59,060
some such like that I notify wat wall
what

721
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:03,410
wait to take an action a until they
identified change in the fasten seat

722
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:06,740
you for me to wait to watch a file will
file has been changed modified

723
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:10,000
or deleted or edited in whatever way
that you told to wait for

724
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,100
then we'll take a nap action and i know
if i watch will

725
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,930
I'll watch that file and continues the
update so i know if i way would you want

726
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:18,419
I'm action i know if i watch

727
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,640
you remember

728
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:25,319
I notify I am crime quick n Easy those
are two other

729
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,609
this is a I don't like crime I intron

730
00:39:28,609 --> 00:39:32,170
is add believes get that's going to
utilize the best cinema periodically

731
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,710
check files for changes

732
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:38,070
add so it's pretty quick and easy to
install just very playful as I know if I

733
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:39,420
enabled in setup

734
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:43,350
I he said a bank run tab it works just
like a regular on tab

735
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:46,770
it'll just simply look at that and said
but in cinema actions taken

736
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:50,590
on are dates and times in specific
intervals

737
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:53,920
it will just be watching directory or
file name: for changes

738
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,800
and then run the command every time this
a change is identified

739
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,020
and then he simply start hearing from
the demon here's an example

740
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,160
in-front am I it looks at a directory

741
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,279
on your website I looks were treated
files

742
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,420
and send an email to the admin to the
website or whatever email you one

743
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:14,960
stating if I was created you can also
include the name the file so

744
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,460
quick and easy here make proper changes
here's a

745
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,750
and I didn't fire listed those masks
like fingerprints

746
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,950
up usually basie thing that you can
watch work for

747
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,970
either changes leads access to files

748
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:32,740
its entrance of course

749
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:36,810
the variable in and I'm prime details
about an issue the variables

750
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:40,730
which job that first one is this worse
one but it's just a dollar sign

751
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:45,250
a the as I will did to me the watch file
system information

752
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:48,350
so is over that way yes you can use for
report not just only got something

753
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:51,450
change I don't know what it was

754
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:55,160
an example I in countries down at the
bottom with variables

755
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,319
it looks a little more women's
basketball in all

756
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,480
provided good clear report I

757
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,630
is also a different solution here I you
can actually compare lied it to the

758
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,820
backups like I mentioned

759
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:10,630
earlier in the TOC I if you just he's
def the diff command to be more than

760
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:13,250
just joking files E-cash compare
filesystems

761
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:17,170
she's really nice its cool the utility
the lot of people watching weren't

762
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,339
really aware of

763
00:41:18,339 --> 00:41:22,130
are say actively used if are against
allied directory in your backup

764
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:25,420
directory and all could get quickly
identify which files are different

765
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:29,370
I'm is that a visual representation by
it

766
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:32,759
its it's pretty much the past we gonna
verify if you have a good clean backup

767
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,680
to be able to stop or the Easter be able
to figure out what's changed in

768
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,890
take the appropriate action

769
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:45,440
so that's a lot like their defense gonna
go over the last little defense

770
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,480
up logs archie an important

771
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,600
I for system administrators field
understand what's going on how the

772
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,620
attack worked

773
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:56,670
what was broken and a how to fix it and
he's healthy

774
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:59,670
the developers excipient going to
develop in CKD

775
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:02,820
the database is broke into you think
guys not going to know what the fuck to

776
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,180
do

777
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,730
so you're not be able to provide useful
information for them

778
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:09,910
as they can do it themselves

779
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:13,500
of useful logs that you cannot know the
Apache logs

780
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,550
the of logs ft be logged excedrin sets
forth

781
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:19,660
%um intrusion detection system built up
hopefully you're gonna wanna look at

782
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,270
those logs as well strike in the first
place to go to

783
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:25,790
you get a really memorize tool shows
tools like crap

784
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:28,839
of said so on and so forth gonna be
really good

785
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:33,049
those things are you can get into it
just knowing Griffin r-ark

786
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,690
I use the man page to figure out how are
you work you don't know already but

787
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:40,760
your system and then you better know
this was already ob-gyn of Eli sprawled

788
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,440
automate this

789
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,810
standing in the logs you mentioned
earlier as well

790
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:47,700
but unless you're getting paid a lot of
money means and your boss doesn't caning

791
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,359
sit around reading logs to handle the

792
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:52,750
as awesome for you but you know you get
anything done to get the two millions

793
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:56,890
elisa logs everyday

794
00:42:56,890 --> 00:43:00,109
I key information on looking over the
logs a lot appearances

795
00:43:00,109 --> 00:43:02,859
I don't you know I'm gonna have to
manually look through everything fine

796
00:43:02,859 --> 00:43:04,450
correlation a time stamps

797
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:08,850
I thats the main part about looking at
the logs at least for me

798
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:12,200
I don't care that much about being able
to manually look at things

799
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,189
and say oh I think that's okay I think
that's bad I mean that's even if I more

800
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:16,170
information over there

801
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:19,720
screw it I'm Sams make sure you're
running it we're trying demon if you're

802
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,209
running

803
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:24,109
if you can log things what servers that
we can identify a correlated events

804
00:43:24,109 --> 00:43:27,330
I be a ten teams were also IP address
said

805
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:30,310
identify more about the attack create a
report about the TAC understand how the

806
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:31,080
attack worked

807
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,890
inane update your fingerprint files when
you change detection systems are your

808
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:40,180
the other parties and things like that
and stop this from happening

809
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,609
is a good example other defining logs
are at

810
00:43:43,609 --> 00:43:47,470
sending that in pain from the we'll send
you an email about a modified object

811
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:48,500
name:

812
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,660
are you gonna find out the I know number
modified time and change time

813
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:55,899
that I mention ski now you gonna be a
look at the website access logs

814
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:59,520
and then you look for that exact time
stamp

815
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,750
and you're gonna find out that yes I
made a post to the upload page

816
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:07,300
and now you know exactly how the tact
working in you you know what to do

817
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,589
you can tell a programmer that this page
is broken this page allow this to be

818
00:44:10,589 --> 00:44:15,589
uploaded

819
00:44:15,589 --> 00:44:19,570
so how my own time any questions

820
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:22,940
new questions alright so as a quick wrap
up

821
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,270
I writing secure code will prevent the
need for PM this

822
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:30,600
I writing secure people writing secure
code below probably happen anytime soon

823
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:34,640
so like everywhere they will always be
work for then the necessity for security

824
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,319
biases Minister

825
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,420
on attacks are also miss the automated
the majority attacks and I showed you

826
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,320
here

827
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,010
are being done by hand or be done by
people in in their basement area the

828
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:46,660
moms house anymore this is

829
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,750
mostly Botts I in there are a lot of
pots

830
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:53,320
they're happening to me tacking sites
all the time the second you identify

831
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,180
these are looking at the set up an
intrusion detection system

832
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:00,089
an Easter lugging stuff you can find out
old shit this was happening the entire

833
00:45:00,089 --> 00:45:02,210
time you see logs like 100000

834
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:05,850
attacks today things like that and

835
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:08,940
so from here on out

836
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:12,640
add continued its research on your own
like a mission is really a beginner talk

837
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,839
so this policy just like a sample other

838
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:18,660
there is a taxi prevention methods so
feel free to take some information in

839
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,240
this

840
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:24,100
know Google it go find out more are I
listen you're also the endless talk

841
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,690
for anybody who is interested in it I
have the most from work

842
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:31,310
by I can also be a copy the talk to and
I believe on the website

843
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:34,770
there will be a hit the presentation you
will be down on yourself

844
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:38,109
are others other talks in a min are
considering giving

845
00:45:38,109 --> 00:45:41,700
all but I haven't written are more about
writing secure took coded more about

846
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:42,930
penetration testing

847
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:46,740
I a good example to talk is a wire
firewalls racist

848
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,919
when you build automated at the check
out to make him prevention systems you

849
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,070
find out a lot of these attacks from
various

850
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:55,280
other countries and it's not the
country's faults not races Hall it's

851
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,910
just the fact that those countries have
the open proxies and nobody cared

852
00:45:57,910 --> 00:46:00,910
nobody cares to break down will bring
down so there

853
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:04,310
where they at least has your gonna come
from and also

854
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:07,740
this let NBA is not equal to a dbag

855
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:11,180
for that more work place and environment
issue where people seeing

856
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,000
think that they have access it that
there's more not have access into giving

857
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,730
such access and they're not

858
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:19,280
specially Michael NBA's people within
the A's traded

859
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,810
Manager database here's your list I'll
URL's

860
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:26,140
and if anybody has any further questions

861
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:33,140
new many good net will be ok

862
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:40,090
good nope

863
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:43,340
no you can email me at work abuse

864
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,600
at dreams Danica
