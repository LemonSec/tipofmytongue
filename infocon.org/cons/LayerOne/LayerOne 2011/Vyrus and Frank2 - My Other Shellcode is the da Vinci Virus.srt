00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:12,780
so on ask.com is my heart prime and

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,490
all my other job with the Stars he knows

knows topic very near and dear to my
heart human

6

yeah this is a buyers nice talk it's
basically just

10
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,960
0 before again arm if you don't like

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,840
up mir's order order to use

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,860
bring those days also in your bed in my
even saying those things you probably

13
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,489
shouldn't be here of yeah Cavs were
talking about cuz

14
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:01,589
talk about yeah so um his

15
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,439
is going to introduce you so how many
people are familiar with last measure

16
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,439
yes to show up home yeah

17
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,630
talking did yeah like this as my
residence and is talking tames

18
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,850
digs everywhere um so

19
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,669
home also call also cocks also cocks

20
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,140
so yavlinsky a started with this

21
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,540
I 0 virus you wanna dual

22
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,509
actually given I can remember the
observer's for so I'm

23
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:40,509
thank you very much any this her

24
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,100
semen um

25
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,720
sorry let's let's let's let's get
started signing what exactly is shoko

26
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,970
let me show voters ultimately does long
string of

27
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,920
instructions that you want something to
do like Moses have assembly

28
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,610
so it is only the most time assembly
shocking is ultimately a payload name

29
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,270
when you're

30
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,039
doing in explaining your swing home yes
please

31
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,590
do anything you can just be like
character stuff about it and things are

32
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,149
going to happen

33
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:13,160
no it's not usually how it works you
actually have to tell it what to do

34
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,040
so showed is basically how you actually
accomplish that

35
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,670
so a

36
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:27,049
so it's even even though people will
consider as you know computer wizards

37
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,420
because we can Rightmove instructions
and things like that it's not all

38
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,829
matching dragons is cause that would be
really

39
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,720
really like it was actually just wishing
to drag shit node really cool thats

40
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,129
unfortunately not what it is so some

41
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:47,099
a yeah every operating system basically
is different how you can actually

42
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:50,549
ratio code for it because they're all
their own little

43
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,580
like islands and close your box in
itself I mean latex is just no cancer

44
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,060
circle jerk doing all sorts of different
things

45
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,349
%uh OS X is just kinda you know the
hipsters in paradise

46
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:05,540
making their own operating system in
Windows is just you're gone like

47
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,109
spaghetti that doesn't really have sauce
on it but they disappear on a bunch

48
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,340
noodles on your plate you're pissed off
cuz

49
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,060
you know you want some sauce spaghetti
is well but

50
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,239
your its all new tools and it is you can
you get the new me

51
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,050
out is all new to me high together you
can read your

52
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:26,360
for in there you try to imagine cuts
open new release

53
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,310
and it's just it is actually that's
gonna Windows works

54
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,720
show from yes all all the different
operating system your

55
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,989
really different and how you can
actually had accomplished

56
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:41,700
rating show her for them so let's start
with a win X

57
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,569
%uh

58
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:49,480
so limits shoko day most

59
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,899
so the easiest way to toll

60
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,030
a payload on 1x or any unix-based
colonel

61
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,860
operating system to do anything is to
just call the directly because the way

62
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,459
that the old binaries a

63
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:05,720
is constructed the panel has all these
things in it that wall

64
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,090
that will do that for you when you call
stuff so um

65
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,230
you don't have in in Windows is frank
about um

66
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,500
later on other library looking at all
those computers totally useless unless I

67
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,358
can look at this library to do some
other stuff in

68
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,669
I got only have been like this for me
and they are only have you know the

69
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:26,698
sunglasses going to do so much of my
work some 1x yep colonel

70
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,060
and if you own something is going okay
well all if I want to download file /a I

71
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,560
wanna

72
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,000
drop interface the girl has the
functionality and its leaders writing

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,880
you're just running suppose so here's an
example is the

74
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,370
cellco I am I could go either a line by
line to line up when doing then cuz

75
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,600
the purpose of the talk is not to show
necessarily a hundred thousand words but

76
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,820
simply to say that's okay

77
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,960
used to be cool armed them into born
Chinese asshole

78
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,120
so they were just or credit card numbers
for ever and i got really boring so

79
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,300
problematic warship arm

80
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,570
got over you could be like that buyers
out there that home

81
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,599
its whole job is to display a tiny chat
box about you a big

82
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,600
and it's the made by a fan the boxer
Manny PAC al

83
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,729
and you get the virus that the we goes
off

84
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:14,080
I think at six o'clock every day for a
week after you get infected

85
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,880
and display the quote that says long
live the Filipino people with he

86
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,669
and many back it was awesome with virus
pureed

87
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:25,729
II credit card numbers because I've got
back in

88
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:29,210
from home up so

89
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,448
the the major things to take away from
the why

90
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:35,490
are basically so you pretty much
argument

91
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,169
arguments going to places and many
causes collins calls it a person

92
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:40,570
searching you're going to call so

93
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:44,699
area basic but it was a good example on
that would look like in C

94
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:47,880
so basically if you can

95
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,199
if you have opposable thumbs and you can
google

96
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,060
the Cisco list and you can look at those
the function button call back said

97
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,360
congratulations you try to go

98
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,850
not that hard

99
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:05,169
you can lead a guy a so there's more
stuff in there then

100
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:10,180
a X a but all its you know most of his
role documented in boring zone

101
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,389
yet Google and you would be awesome and
be it was nice

102
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:17,100
I'm because they work the same way
because the kernels are based on the

103
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,660
same topology so

104
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,699
for the most part if you have such calls
you have a bus

105
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:26,639
um being only review

106
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,210
a Lynch is that on PST this is called a
slightly different

107
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:34,080
on OSX big he engineering the kernel to
include

108
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,680
less and less is calls because they

109
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,190
for a lot more explanation build their
own cool inside the OS X 10

110
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:46,250
were only they can play and they like
keeping all the fancy functionality that

111
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:46,889
kernel-based

112
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:49,710
inside that water will have to give it
to the people that we can use it

113
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,210
actually machine

114
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:55,698
up there's a way around trying to use
their sys calls in that way around it is

115
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:59,830
using cocoa so the waco go works

116
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,349
is it's basically come a hipster dotnet

117
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:06,780
right so anybody with a lid on it right
it's not really a VM

118
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,179
it's going to be the OL you call it and
say I wouldn't call it done at

119
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,919
University Logan such as big

120
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,620
make universal respect functions be
called back but processor instructions

121
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,930
and then you tell it what you want to do
when all that thickness kinda personal

122
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,590
bubble

123
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:24,289
that's basically how Google works only
is easier to track in dotnet

124
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:29,110
which is cool unfortunately it also when
Apple uses to rate

125
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,080
their programs and its gonna like it
like that overlooks the

126
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,229
Oro a when living things go with the
windows and it was a little every angle

127
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:42,460
yeah I'm is easier to use basic data
always look for

128
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,599
obsolete puts it into poverty like a
column

129
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,599
you go along in the wrong order a recall
but not the security group

130
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:52,360
they won't necessarily get your message
it'll stop working in popular she

131
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,090
I'm gung-ho about good

132
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,090
so Apple it does go to the study is
going to bed

133
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,448
and this can be good because
everything's in one place you have one

134
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:06,330
hope to attack if you have that book
then you can call any Google function

135
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:11,330
up but it's bad because it all pond an
applicant is in your pool and we like to

136
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,780
drink piss

137
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,330
home so there's one interface

138
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,520
a to go go

139
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,729
and the interfaces call that send a
message that the objects and missus

140
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:25,560
point interface

141
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,280
in Co one function so everything that
you do an Cho can you call

142
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,260
you send it you send some some S&M call
a string

143
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,659
and then use ended a bunch of streams
two arguments

144
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,950
the bunch of string argument is all the
art major passing to a function

145
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,219
the first ring is the name of the
function so you have this one function

146
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:43,789
call

147
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,140
ask you explain software if you have a
link to the message that I am

148
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,839
you can call the function inside cocoa
in the congress the application period

149
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:54,600
which means you are so does all kinds of
awesome J as long as you call in Cocoa

150
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,190
first

151
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,800
which is well documented and design
people to rise of report the white did

152
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,290
around in Parkinson's call and

153
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,050
with you know assembly and Matt and her
down when you can just use the doc made

154
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:05,910
it on to the next

155
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,569
you can we will use Xcode racial gonna
crop

156
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,140
Matt Bellamy function so for some fun

157
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,680
yeah cuz this is how so

158
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,939
you know be reversing this and when
looking for a bug

159
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,110
so you see is the the does this push the
were down here

160
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,190
and location with the mouse months ago

161
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,519
I didn't there's to this okay

162
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:34,649
so this is it was in a string this train
is the name of the function

163
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:39,959
right this argument happen is all the
organs ago that function

164
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:43,579
and any of the message for the worse for
example

165
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,399
um so you can make things hard to
reverse at first

166
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,450
by the fall um but

167
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,320
since the stuff is always in the same
place once you have the first of the

168
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,589
program that you're typing you don't
have to do any more ships makes

169
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:03,690
someone or appearing in 2009 you own it
nothing moves around stack

170
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,810
them

171
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,979
home image of debug a lot

172
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,149
up so this is a commented version a

173
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:18,250
source in the same application arms you
can see all the arrows order to view the

174
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:18,910
comments 0

175
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,579
those were know that what the strings
are any of that so those are the

176
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,959
functions that are gonna call

177
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,180
and those the argument that are going
past in order so than 120 North it's

178
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,099
pretty easy to rivers

179
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,180
then later came out and they fought with
it

180
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:36,029
so with Yann what used to be this

181
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:40,300
one flight where to go

182
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,189
right but I miss like yeah I'm mystified

183
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,670
okay um so what used to be this out now

184
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,880
you don't get any of those comments
anymore you don't get any but I want you

185
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
just getting off that

186
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,470
and none of that is mutated by a key

187
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,950
and that he has to investors one of them
is a hard working D which is different

188
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,730
in every single person's device works on
IRS

189
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,250
and a and ended up system so with
hardware-based it pulls an idea that

190
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,570
shit I have that on which ones 0

191
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:13,519
good luck trying to get into economic um

192
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,790
and the second he is dynamically
instance they don't boot from the first

193
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,250
key

194
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,440
so unless you have both keys in context
with her out but the wrong with the

195
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,120
current user

196
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,610
you have no idea what the shit is which
means behalf that don't make sense

197
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,620
which means you can call anything
fucking

198
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,880
arm but it's still broken

199
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,329
too even though they moved the sandbox
arm everything has to be able to reach

200
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:40,430
send message that happens in context in
a report work

201
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,449
which means you have the difference
between them is that in the beginning if

202
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,110
your program

203
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:51,110
you have the of that you need which is
always the IP when you break the program

204
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:55,370
a so I well I did have a demo and was
gonna

205
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,430
show non-obvious get a job go that use
cocoa

206
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,269
to deny mutation mode but I wanted to
see it working lands light up in a

207
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:03,139
fishing line

208
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,660
and it broke and then I found out that
if you trace and missus than in real

209
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,319
time

210
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,720
the sandbox book goes away unfortunately
that means I brought much okay

211
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,130
so I don't have a demo but instead I
used the same trick to you :d obviously

212
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,380
a function in the closer's publication

213
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,589
I wouldn't put the slide cuz I was

214
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:24,649
trying to be polite to the company but
seeing as how public information I kinda

215
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:25,519
don't care

216
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,639
us as a company called so many that
makes a

217
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,529
SWF Decompiler I N this

218
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:35,550
is if you look at the message that M
call to

219
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:39,060
and strain this is where all the strings
are on the program that don't show up

220
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,579
and you debug it might fall

221
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:44,870
this blacklist email addresses that when
you are ready for the program if you

222
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:49,360
type in what did he know this is rixter
he'll don't know what you very much

223
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,980
so the funny thing about this black with
his the guy at the top

224
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,089
if you google that email address the
very first to link his website

225
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:01,310
and is what's a has resume on it

226
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,849
which has phone number on it and I was
in Seattle when I found this

227
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:10,079
white Holden I still haven't got an
answer back but what this person is that

228
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,219
there are six different functions

229
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,050
to move them are only for this person to
check the black list so I don't know

230
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,079
what they did to piss off hoping

231
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:22,239
but they really don't like that guy be
altered funny thing in this blacklist is

232
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,060
that the list at the bottom

233
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,920
start listening until the names with
masters whose

234
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,670
and almost all of them are there if you
try to restore the Masters name

235
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:37,370
except for one what happened

236
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:42,380
sugar I a

237
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,080
area

238
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,880
best Obama the whitelist apparently the
fed's like

239
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,600
wares and software no i do.

240
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,680
stereotype go bizarre who that person is
but apparently so pick up in trying to

241
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,719
steal their coordinates that that's
fucked up

242
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,610
a good

243
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,920
it my turn

244
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,010
sorry with Linux and OSX

245
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:12,740
I your usually limited poem

246
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,210
Lexus calls unless you wanna do

247
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:20,440
crazy things like I'm going below these
data so libraries but I don't know where

248
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,430
they are because every single sysadmin
does their own thing and they're really

249
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,609
grumpy about where they put their things
on does not work so that's why most

250
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:29,930
people use is called mostly because UNIX
beards are very aggressive

251
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:34,449
but from if you compare Linux and OS X
to windows

252
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,620
we didn't Cadillac just everything you
can do kisling

253
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,390
went late Michael indexes late now we're
just gonna provide the kernel

254
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:46,710
you can you guys can do you think so
that's why your video card stock

255
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:50,660
and are you are you stopping links socks
because everybody's fighting

256
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,020
to be that guy who does the audio stuff
and everything to be that guy is really

257
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,850
cool video printer

258
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,920
anyway that's and intelligent video

259
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,990
my dirty it's a good way of putting it
but any windows one is like

260
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:06,390
here you can have these texts PJP II you
can don't stop on the Internet

261
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:10,170
for Windows you can play threes you can
everything

262
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:13,910
399 dollars um so I mean

263
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,459
if you really want to use is called
Windows sure you can do that you can see

264
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,070
me like a

265
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:21,230
passes in Colorado whatever the hell
that function name is reduced

266
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,950
use the API in seriously seriously
Windows

267
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:29,720
awesome is ridiculous as the structure
is it having to deal with all this you

268
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,700
can point years ago

269
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,580
everywhere in like all the reserve
values and like documentation really

270
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,140
cool

271
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,340
don't get me wrong link the MSDN is
really awesome and there's

272
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:43,310
week everything is in Windows link
that's why it's so ridiculously huge

273
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,489
but that also means you can't do
everything it

274
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,830
some so when there is one caveat to the
fact that

275
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:55,210
everything is in it with Lake shoko you
gots is calling its like

276
00:15:55,210 --> 00:16:00,050
I'm going to assist calls I like that
Cisco I'm going to college is called

277
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:04,000
so the complicated thing is when you
actually have

278
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,050
exploitable programming Windows you

279
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:11,540
late big and important any API they want
and that means that there isn't really

280
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,180
predictable unless you know that for
targeting you know if you know that

281
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,189
okay I know this the laws in their the
Steelers in there but I mean

282
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,440
you reuse your show code I mean what do
you want this should actually be

283
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,610
reliable center needs one for you don't
agree right shoulder every single time

284
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,270
so I mean what you have to do is you
have to assume that you have read are

285
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,170
going to be there

286
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:34,099
the only in in Windows because unlike
series is actually pretty funny

287
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,700
in Windows 2000 it used to be here for a
program not too important 32 you

288
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,350
and it would just be like no I'm not
hearing the United 4332

289
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:46,260
I get people to contribute this because
after a while like the Microsoft

290
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,680
implemented a hacked it was like

291
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,540
alright so every single program ever has
a lone TD allow which by the way has

292
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,980
turned 32 the dependency

293
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,410
why so now every single program after XP

294
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:01,160
automatically imports ntdll.dll in
kernel32.dll

295
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,470
but here's the thing link if you want to
get any other function

296
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:10,120
how you know that's awesome so
apparently that also helped me

297
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,530
tremendously smaller so

298
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:16,149
and help out those guys from bomb
solving the issue is you have to assume

299
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,770
that there are

300
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,829
any libraries loaded if you want to have
lunch okay

301
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:23,960
in order to get a function unified
library don't let a liar it's not there

302
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,730
it might be there might not be eating

303
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:29,690
fucking know your show go so you have to
actually get local Irish

304
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,540
and her to fight library you get for
alternative energy company to any

305
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,720
trouble original Refinery Limited

306
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,920
it just becomes a whole clusterfuck you
have to automatically load peux for a

307
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,380
walk through the viewfinder

308
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,160
the models even in there it is it just
becomes a rat's nest immediately

309
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,740
so you know like I was saying you're
only really guaranteed a MTG loan

310
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,820
kernel32

311
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,919
I just settle these lines oh yeah maybe
if you're up because because there's

312
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,170
there's also other issues were gone was
the fact that

313
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:00,370
you don't know their libraries I mean
you can't like what if you just want to

314
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,100
say okay well I know this is going to be
loaded

315
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,270
I'm just going to make this the address
will be windy los word

316
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:09,010
me any base address they want to be
there still way it's not theirs

317
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:13,840
now there's a SLR sure but I mean oh
with dll's I mean

318
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,540
if if there is an address collision the
low turn out to be like

319
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,810
of missing the shit over here and you
have to deal with that as well use local

320
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,330
every progress because

321
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:27,770
the chicken to change around and it's
different from language to language do i

322
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,210
mean

323
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,980
the Catholic starting XV might have a
different things is a 32 me tell you

324
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,650
there's been no you can actually use the
functions in a Hampton

325
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:39,190
your notes you have to assume that
nothing is hardcoded you can't really do

326
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,720
anything and it's scanning your dating
but it's also kinda why it's fun

327
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,750
so I mean this is this is also a really
interesting contrast

328
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,960
on average reliable election just
farming /bin/sh or something like that

329
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,990
yeah

330
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,690
unless it's designed to do all sorts of
things like 64-bit annex that things

331
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,300
like that

332
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,860
on average tough if you're 70 bytes sets

333
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,879
it's not a lot instructions when does
because you have to do all this

334
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,690
ridiculous lotta stuff to have really
hospitalized shakur to go every 200

335
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,300
bytes

336
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,070
shared okay no news fun for the talk

337
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,139
so I actually have some payloads that
were

338
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,560
like like a bunch of them use the
internet as they probably won't work

339
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,889
but home there's a there is a

340
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,360
two other ones that are fun I am yes so

341
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,530
virus is going to set up the internet
for me and I'm good at that the VM for a

342
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:31,920
bit

343
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:38,920
article you

344
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,280
her

345
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,060
okay

346
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:07,409
him

347
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:13,630
and needed

348
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:18,650
well since this is %uh on my VM this is
one of the pillars I will not be showing

349
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,010
because those debugging and news too
complicated

350
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,590
he'll notice and title for only the
media was called a parade

351
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:29,740
so on I can show because it's really
buggy but

352
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,270
I will we're gonna have contact
information the an ongoing releases

353
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:36,840
so that parade is going to do is arm

354
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,010
it's going to once it runs on the system
is going to inject

355
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,540
thread in every single running process
%uh with the

356
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:47,600
an infinite loop for message box is just
an ASCII penis so every single process

357
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,820
will be running an infinite loop

358
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,990
blanks so did today bread

359
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:57,280
resize

360
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,870
there

361
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:09,870
C

362
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:16,690
right that's over the top 11

363
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,690
copied you did nine

364
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,029
yes

365
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:25,379
yeah

366
00:21:25,379 --> 00:21:29,158
aren't so I N router show these of I
didn't have an exploitable program but I

367
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:29,679
have

368
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,809
the assembly compiled down and then
converted to an EXE so

369
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:37,200
we're seeing here is basically show code
running as if they were executing our

370
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,669
growing

371
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:42,649
arm is just learning it's often an EXE
so let's run that men

372
00:21:42,649 --> 00:21:46,879
up

373
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:53,879
so here's a folder named on the desktop
when

374
00:21:54,739 --> 00:21:58,529
a no it's cool over the next on work on
seven

375
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:01,950
but would see are

376
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:08,950
write this work on seven you in just a
moment

377
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,950
C

378
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:18,790
pretty much see this is why I see peace
in your court stuff does this always

379
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,510
happens

380
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:25,990
always happens I don't listen now pretty
much

381
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:32,990
parent the computer field

382
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:37,070
yeah it's lol this unfortunately and
testing

383
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:40,908
worked denoted them up because they're
all gone see me so

384
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:45,500
this I'm going to Tess's and republish
I'm so sorry if you like a jackass

385
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,620
so what this wanna doing well loop up
%uh 16

386
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,899
create directory nom nom nom nom na na
na Nana

387
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:57,260
na na na na na na na Nana Batman

388
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,899
a right now one that works

389
00:23:01,899 --> 00:23:07,489
so yeah im

390
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:14,490
no degree won't work I'm sorry

391
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:23,070
it so we have been hopefully less manual
work

392
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:29,990
of course it doesn't

393
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:34,279
yeah this is Adam sorry yeah I think you
can demagogue

394
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:37,899
so it's good to get one work and that's
not really curious about

395
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:41,320
announces there's an

396
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,580
wells

397
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:51,580
here 0 customers

398
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,720
some Russian Roulette is a us as the
show go that basically

399
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,820
generates a bunch processes on the
system skills what a random

400
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,689
so can kill itself working here some
really important

401
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:10,470
up so let's see what happens when it
doesn't work

402
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:16,940
into

403
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:22,030
access violation at now we're gonna all
right so we're over three

404
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:25,730
no

405
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,340
I'm I don't go away

406
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:36,340
makeup up

407
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:43,370
turn it off long as good idea so let's
see what else we a

408
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:52,610
well as measures

409
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,899
the

410
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,559
the you could just run Batman at this
point

411
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,570
a good

412
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:08,418
victory elsewhere

413
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:10,269
we offer

414
00:25:10,269 --> 00:25:11,279
no

415
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,279
right let's try this one down with some
plays around

416
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:21,279
in mp3 from the Internet book work

417
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,669
I know it's hard mineral it something
else is creepier

418
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:34,780
it so let's wait for this thing to
actually download the mp3

419
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,100
seems to be working hours downloading

420
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:42,439
cool writes this one might actually work
complete actually plays the mp3

421
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,840
up so I'm going to go although the other
one %uh

422
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:50,250
like we I want one mp3 players is bill
taken it is all their money

423
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,580
comical so I'm gonna watch the other one

424
00:25:53,580 --> 00:26:00,580
ever gambled

425
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,840
him

426
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,499
in 700 %um

427
00:26:11,499 --> 00:26:14,559
no one all a yeah

428
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,820
alright one before let's go over one
more I what I want to see some titties

429
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,968
in this thinking on

430
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:26,969
up bow pleated eased

431
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:35,989
ok

432
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:38,708
and

433
00:26:38,709 --> 00:26:45,709
Cisco Chinese we don't wrap

434
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:50,418
I'm downloading yes okay not there go

435
00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:54,469
chinese water dragon you I

436
00:26:54,469 --> 00:26:58,639
gradual you dicks everywhere your
morning

437
00:26:58,639 --> 00:27:03,279
her neighbors China by the way and
Chinese media traffic I have no idea if

438
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:08,319
no I a diff from now has pulled out

439
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:15,319
a first if I it's not bad still Sox

440
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:20,819
so like I was saying earlier

441
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:26,229
the caviar this obviously when you don't
test properly the demigods just stick

442
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:27,409
your dick in you know so

443
00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:30,549
you know I can happen I'm sorry about
that um

444
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:33,599
so I'm gonna test and publish it
eventually sorry about that

445
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:37,019
I'll try to have a big parade ready and
I told you about a while a

446
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:41,629
the main reason for that is when you try
to open a remote process in Windows

447
00:27:41,629 --> 00:27:45,649
and try to actually read a bunch data
like like you would think that okay I'm

448
00:27:45,649 --> 00:27:46,889
going to go see

449
00:27:46,889 --> 00:27:50,269
which deal overloaded in this room
process if

450
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:53,989
you hun a simple a whole actually is
fucking retarded

451
00:27:53,989 --> 00:27:57,859
because you have to like her head I have
to do anything for information

452
00:27:57,859 --> 00:27:59,859
processing and get the PV and then

453
00:27:59,859 --> 00:28:04,289
oh I can actually read the point where
that's at PV slap use reprises her to

454
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:05,149
get that pointer

455
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:08,119
there's another corner entry process
remembers another point and then you

456
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,408
have a leak was appointed

457
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:14,109
being repressed memory with it
irritating but yeah it'll happen

458
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:14,819
eventually

459
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:18,668
in they're pretty much quicker maths so
the data rate did not happen at least

460
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:21,179
there was at least one day going to do
it so having

461
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:26,959
like it all however is out hud

462
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:30,629
yeah exactly that's a good point the
bottom ways than one the dead word

463
00:28:30,629 --> 00:28:34,009
are actually really funny using your
coworkers and you can use any mp3 you're

464
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:35,119
a picture you want

465
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:39,059
so I asked so with winter show coating
on

466
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:43,229
you know the Holy I is there but I mean
what is certainly more complicated stuff

467
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:45,969
another one that you know we really
wanted to do obviously with Cookie

468
00:28:45,969 --> 00:28:46,599
Monster

469
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,869
but at at the point of trying to make
cookie monster happen

470
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:53,809
it becomes a virus because you have so
much Cody have to write

471
00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:58,339
that is becomes absolutely ridiculous
because you know you have to do

472
00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:01,428
okay have to create a window and I have
to move the window around you to create

473
00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:03,399
when you have to have a window function

474
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:07,168
but all that okay when a movie when does
this you have into you there's also a

475
00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:08,329
difference you have to do

476
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:12,029
suree doing a show code below me know
when they will be so inflated Irving

477
00:29:12,029 --> 00:29:12,929
okay anymore

478
00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:17,789
was very also stream avonex

479
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:21,669
bearish Sony and also there's another
one a caveat is that

480
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:25,450
home you know once those little harder
to do on Mondays and BSD because you

481
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,359
have the whole

482
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:30,029
it's like i don't know live-action I was
going to be there maybe it'll be there I

483
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:32,769
don't know I'll look for it but if it's
not there that's not me

484
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:36,969
funding is also urging good thing you
got a whole and it is open source you

485
00:29:36,969 --> 00:29:37,749
mean

486
00:29:37,749 --> 00:29:41,769
and it's just you don't have a difficult
day I mean it's not possible to do fun

487
00:29:41,769 --> 00:29:42,200
stuff

488
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,009
