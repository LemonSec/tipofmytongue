1
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,008
okay

2
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:10,300
also well I'm Evan my talks called Patch
Kids

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,490
hide your wife residents security and
monitoring the bottom line

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,350
we will cover you we will cover slot

5
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,350
we come that's probably its

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,949
missus exception like

7
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,099
okay I really am look at the anatomy of
a break-in

8
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:34,910
look at a very high level overview a bit
like it belongs to me find any

9
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,239
residents I'll talk about the benefits
an alarm system

10
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,440
as well as things that suck about it um

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,419
also how to make things up less which is
kinda the point whom all I

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,690
home I go by the handle tree fort
obviously not very often but

13
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,099
home country for because everything I
know I learned from Kevin Hobbs

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,960
okay I'm back some Evan

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,420
that sort a company called the curses
oral interact about five years ago

16
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,780
well for which I do development and
design work

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,869
I'm mostly interactive stuff a lot of
the

18
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,310
staffer at maddies all that stuff I
would never call myself a problem solver

19
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,880
um I break things like can I call you
guys

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,929
and the CIA that come from the Navy I'm

21
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:23,240
lots more organization Ackles fail at
winston-salem North Carolina

22
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,189
so we on we get together and we drink
and we look at Las

23
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:31,610
we also tend to New obscurity from
physical security

24
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,040
and we do that by I'm using electric
bills and cons

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,710
so like this I'll we'll sing together

26
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:41,729
every once in a while if you're going to
relax I'm

27
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,530
we go hard in the paint do know that
means like google it

28
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,040
and then come find me in time-out
enzymes like saying it

29
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,360
chemical I will look feel that concept
he has one more for mission

30
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,439
to rate their I'm any Raiders

31
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,630
skok

32
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,548
thank God that like re services in the
front page every every like at

33
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:06,840
October that's actually meet you seen
that it's me so

34
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,450
base aren't so I'm why do I care about
issues in residential security

35
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,170
that's a great question well I think
their bountiful ALM

36
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:19,670
also it's it's quite remains mind my own
skills and interests

37
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,530
I'm I do see it as an extremely
widespread issue

38
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,640
no I mean there's a no about love them

39
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,750
no homes with residents here's another
presidential

40
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,629
security systems but I think that opens
them as a set a lofty goal for

41
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:38,790
resin residential security more than
seven like substantial move things

42
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,620
forward

43
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,650
I'm yours and consumptions um this is
all up in the one-game

44
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,349
yet is a good thing about it not being
like a reflection of the the pin is that

45
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:48,649
your

46
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,260
employer but I'm my employer certainly
work I'm I'm not in any position to

47
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,049
profit from

48
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,849
anything anything at all I'm I'm
certainly not an expert on the subject

49
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:02,060
at all I I'm really just like a consumer
who enjoys thinking critically

50
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:05,180
and I'd like to share my thoughts with
you I'm

51
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,420
and a focus on residential security in
my tongue

52
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,768
that many if not most to these concepts
apply over to commercial as well

53
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:17,209
and on his own assumptions I'm let's
look at it simple setup

54
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:21,319
4 a.m. security system you got the
control board which is a work of art

55
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:25,109
control panel was is that brings the
user interface and things

56
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,200
you have your array of sensors report
back

57
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,619
so you get your your book contacts

58
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,930
and pleasures delight when is it worse
motion sensors

59
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,360
also glass break and this is a good time
for me to mention the

60
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,870
if I can tell him that image I just
picked one there and it's funny I'm

61
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,230
pressure map in some cases I'm in the
event of an alarm

62
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,629
it has to report someone which is
usually were installed at

63
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,739
so I'm networking communications are
required um

64
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,450
in like cases I'll girl fashion landline
is used more often these days you got

65
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,030
sailor

66
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,330
in the internet as well so I'm

67
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,939
I also like that and this on the draw
some interesting like hybrids love

68
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:08,420
I'm its it was described to me as is and

69
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,510
and mesh network love like furnishings
and

70
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:15,950
was the hardest part is that with that
uses almost like a ham radio despite

71
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,798
dedication to each other and sure it's
completely impervious to

72
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,849
many militants another look at my
concerns probe was you know the the

73
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,830
not grasp on our I'm thank the burglary

74
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,870
real quick al there twice as likely to
occur between the hours of 6 a.m. and 6

75
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,940
p.m.

76
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,000
which is done a country will something
we think alike

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,009
my medicine a break in an iPad is
usually when your work

78
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:44,270
integrated I'm very like that and the
pendulum

79
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,960
author the time and the back is falling
and I guess what features a padded

80
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,820
I'm 61 percent all burglaries involves

81
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,740
forcible entry 13.64 unlawful injuries
which is very much like

82
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,500
you hey you can be in here the 6.5 being
forced by injury attempts

83
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,919
some failed its on the academics dollar
last presidential

84
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:13,919
but it was a .263 dollars was actually
study then and Connecticut now and 42

85
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,789
percent alarm homes that were
burglarized

86
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:20,509
had the lantern all which is a a big
brick an issue

87
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:24,030
and remember that as we talk about that
later I'm

88
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,109
burglars generally stand no more than
one minute trying to gain entry to your

89
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,820
your home a fun fact many years that US
jurisdictions

90
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,259
no consider period might seem to be a
much more severe

91
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:39,780
I'm defense would

92
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,830
the service everything except for a home

93
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:47,609
the very last one came from the 2009
before May

94
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,240
yet be I'm so it gotta go go to their
unified

95
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,710
crime reporting statistics and the last
thing is actually in a book

96
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:59,310
that i think is published early 2000 so
it could be completely

97
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,900
nonsense that at this point but I tend
to believe that right for one person to

98
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,940
people's dinner along right

99
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,729
he said something you to be with what
the benefits and I'm here toons

100
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:12,909
completely trashed things just obviously
there's some good so let's talk about it

101
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,889
I'm financially there is less property
loss to you

102
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:21,479
the wooden ultimately reduced I'm a
burger was staying home this go to a

103
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:22,440
siren blaring

104
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,949
right for the tickets to gramm's I'm

105
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:29,590
you also pay a a bit less in your room
financial homeowners insurance

106
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,948
if you have more system how much exactly

107
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:36,069
he set up to 20 percent which means
tells me that's

108
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:39,650
never 20 percent it's always something
less than that I'm Security benefits

109
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,409
obviously like

110
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,569
you're less likely to get snow body rub
if up

111
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:47,009
no you have a security system someone
DNA I'm

112
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:50,780
a study a while back think it might have
been the New York Times that

113
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,710
they put it between 1923 31 I'm out
times more likely to be burgled

114
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,590
if you I'm you don't have a security
system also burgled

115
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,690
when the most awkward words ever learn

116
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,229
I can answer quickly notified someone
business here's the game inference

117
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:10,849
our investment in your home which is
good because you sir you FEMA shut down

118
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:11,630
there

119
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,990
home you hide the kids and wife team

120
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,680
and the police fire and EMT is
dispatched quickly

121
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,830
in an ideal world which is good

122
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,190
it just doesn't fire I'm a good
neighbors attention you know

123
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,310
love there's been a star you know turn
on the front porch you know me much the

124
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,099
only the only time you know your
neighbors that comes to your health

125
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:37,000
as other benefits these mines you know
as security theater

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,680
I'm that most systems that have moved
from the Navy said at the time the door

127
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,210
opens

128
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,628
which is good if you've got young kids
or

129
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:49,509
the the the zombie apocalypse stars

130
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:52,710
and the to come for you I'm all these
benefits

131
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,430
you know why am I not have %um I'll with
the second thought about it

132
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:00,680
um nineties hardware yeah it designed
for for these days is pretty much has

133
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,520
changed in twenty years

134
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,039
and you know what I will say the enemy
that standing the test time is the

135
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,378
over the a good thing I think in this
case did it comes to the expensive

136
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:15,160
no missing opportunities you actually
increased security

137
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,870
I'm so I do you think that in the least
at the very least be examined I'm

138
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,139
it one big names that doesn't even
mention commonly available

139
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:26,460
equipment in the house you know it's
pretty much like

140
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,859
the system its peripherals and that's it
right

141
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,330
others if you bring whatsoever so is
your you know you have a system install

142
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:38,630
and your environment changes later you
pretty much

143
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,219
no seven what you got I'm wondering is a

144
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:46,860
bad products and you guys thought about
this and like

145
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,250
it seems here with the terrible value
why is that okay

146
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,910
humans essentially a performance pass
the the contrary easily be automated

147
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,930
right

148
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,209
I would I would assert that your
thermostat is smart enough to make the

149
00:08:58,209 --> 00:08:59,489
same decisions

150
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,640
in terms and dispassionately some wasn't
ultimately looking for setting

151
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,640
conditions

152
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,269
and if that if that's any conditions is
met: it it you know

153
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:11,180
dispatches the police like that does not
require a human being

154
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:15,180
I'm at all and only these guys on the
phone on your your

155
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,739
monitoring that centers bill calling
probably the least qualified people to

156
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,839
make decisions about

157
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,920
your current situation right into
anything about your house

158
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,589
the toning belt like your status you
know are you on vacation

159
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:30,470
you know as you just have a party in as
much of my love balloons hanging out

160
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,420
setting alarm off

161
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,399
you know any that stuff so factor
dispatching

162
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,420
you know people your house is costing
you money

163
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,349
and can be the deal of the crash
expensive I mean

164
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,790
can someone do like a per incident you
know range

165
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,810
maybe I don't know %uh over there are
subsidizing the possible hardware

166
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,729
and I don't kid yourself using the
hardware right and you mean shut up okay

167
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,430
were to write in but why is that I'm

168
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,329
I think that ultimately the priority is
getting is as many customers on the hook

169
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:04,540
for monitoring contracts as possible

170
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,640
and I think again that is an awful
batting

171
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,250
all extends the ultimate goal the system
is you enable

172
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,399
someone somewhere else call center to
make a phone call to you

173
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:19,250
I think that that that shapes the
designed and the goals and hardware

174
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,560
itself

175
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,880
and i think thats a all it's a bad thing
for us right because %uh the focus that

176
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,339
was not security is on well

177
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:30,550
it's on this on the money right was
making his money

178
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:35,469
call centres monitoring so let's you
know this makeup running justify that

179
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,670
I so you know best-case scenario I'm

180
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,040
Esther the best result of monitoring is
that said

181
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,160
places best immediately and the show 15
minutes after the burger leaves

182
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,329
and you know that's that's good for you
know for the last month

183
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:53,339
and you might as well since I don't talk
about on the dornan

184
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:57,130
getting dollar-something I'm I do think
you're in there is room for improvement

185
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:00,420
obviously home but know why

186
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,000
why do I think that this is a bit
audience to know to talk about this

187
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,920
US I'm I think the world will send the
problem solved here

188
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,479
a look at the professions I have any
system engineer

189
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,700
an idea of how many people do any
consulting and security mall

190
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,490
me professional jugglers

191
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:28,940
okay I anything mean by kinda the ideal
collection skills required to

192
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,149
to broach the subject um so electronics
a.m.

193
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:36,680
summer development physical security be
seen next door

194
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,380
on policy reverse engineering and siege
on prayer Anderson

195
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,380
yeah the list goes on and on so why
should we do this

196
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,160
I'm I think that that ultimately we have
a renovation

197
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,370
which is a genuine genuine person to
increase security and a given system

198
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,959
I think that that mere afforded the
ability to be

199
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,888
infinitely more objective about the the
goals

200
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:05,410
you know a system like this because we
don't have to satisfy about one

201
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,709
so on the fun stuff but how can be
improved

202
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:12,779
and just just as bad as this is how the
resultant

203
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:16,740
again six months the meat is morning
about this in taking over

204
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,769
so some things to make any sense but fun
hardware

205
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:24,079
broken integrate existing also
components such as you know

206
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,769
laptops desktops network gamers as an
extension of the system

207
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:32,850
have any right now like a PC or laptop
sitting at your house open sitting

208
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,930
thing okay and how many others have like
you know

209
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,609
a back-burner up camper accelerometer
any that stuff

210
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,350
like they are very very good very useful
things right and effectively integrated

211
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,880
without much hassle

212
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,130
I think you can you do simple things for
instance he's a webcam to collects

213
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,230
video and ultimately Ling may be offered
in

214
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,410
difference am means of detecting motion

215
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,510
right so pager alarm sirens going off

216
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,850
right which laptop doing other than
sitting there waiting to get stolen

217
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,279
its earnings great video right set of
someplace something that's not going to

218
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,320
get stolen

219
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,959
you know I'm not hasta la vista chicken
chicken along amid

220
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:14,959
you know I i mean that someone is my
house and my

221
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,589
my learning of yet they you know got a
laptop they

222
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:23,070
the alternately will home it's a
perfectly good at

223
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,339
means detecting the you know something
has gone awry

224
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,820
I'm if you speak mister blast all manner
of illness like if someone breaking into

225
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,570
my house

226
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,680
it's gonna be disco hell for them not be
a good thing

227
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,209
I'm less let's let's talk about like

228
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:41,388
interfacing with the existing popular
protocols like

229
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:46,070
boxing the years the way or like and
return home is coming up

230
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:50,149
yeah exactly I thing about this like you
got you got to love your fights

231
00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:53,339
right and everything else in your house
and like

232
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:57,019
you know thing about like the things you
can do to make to make a you know

233
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:00,040
your your situation better pay cut off
all the lights but all the lights

234
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,029
downstairs

235
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:04,439
coming or Kamal water look her up for
whatever you know

236
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,510
I'm its it doesn't seem like the that
daunting a task

237
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,750
I'm enterprising users can write drivers
essentially

238
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,410
for all hardware so I'm you wouldn't
have

239
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,269
being pigeon-holed to one particular
manufactures stuff what they offer

240
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:22,649
I'm humidity sensors kill on sight
devices

241
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:25,920
flood detectors good examples um

242
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,079
a demo some early demo but Sam your
swatching

243
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:37,079
celebrate my house this is another one

244
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:41,199
that at like a nice laptop

245
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:48,199
ok here I come I'll take it

246
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:55,309
all-cash

247
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,270
alright so in from and obviously that's
kinda cheesy but but

248
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,390
really huge his main cover about this
stuff is anyone

249
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:12,360
I don't know alright so I user habits is
another thing that maybe we could be a

250
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,610
vastly improved right

251
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,040
that suggests the forty-one percent of
people that that leader the back of a

252
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,620
nearly as

253
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,930
like that's a big deal and like

254
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:24,599
what what things are in place for
another the possibly improve that

255
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,210
I can do everything okay so um

256
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,800
at have gagged problem exists between
keyboard and chair

257
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,069
in this case it might be like between he
added in car but

258
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,870
I'm what about introducing the game
application

259
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,250
do launched a management you get
familiar with the term

260
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,470
someone at like that

261
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,580
a TED talk about this basically it's
like like spending some like

262
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,570
you know arbitrary value will reward for
mundane tasks like

263
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,790
you guys probably russian teen three
minutes

264
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,819
you know if your ever to get some kinda
like if you if it goes well for your

265
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,910
gamertag right

266
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,439
and so I i mean i kno I would

267
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,440
just I'm know really what points I'll so
let's get a chance for good

268
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,870
good performance and the stuff like what
if the

269
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,910
you maintain a good morning security
brain-based habits

270
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,520
that would be interesting but here's
where can it gets real

271
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,250
like when she actually got rewarded for
having you know good

272
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,630
you know I'm delusional or used to train
so what you got like

273
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:30,600
discounts on new stuff discounted
monitoring k like al

274
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,720
car insurance we're trying to get the
racks to pay less so

275
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,410
I don't know so what you gonna look to
know hey you're gonna set for

276
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:41,240
30 consecutive days which either means
you like it her mentor jetsetter

277
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,040
something I'm take sometimes under 200
times that air

278
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,800
inside your robots %uh you pick the
three custom alarm States

279
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,099
you're you're a clever on your face i
computer the United

280
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,790
and the list goes on so what about the
centralized monitoring

281
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:03,160
in monitoring side of you guys got that
for one reason

282
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,420
careful product think about it I don't
need you so this

283
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,750
this whole concept expansion the fact
that everyone's in an interview

284
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,380
connected already so very very high
level I'm

285
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,420
basically I i want to i security system

286
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,770
that allow me to sign the indefinite
number people to become my monitors

287
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:24,250
right so what does that mean like no I'm
fine people that didn't like my

288
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,630
neighbors or something like that
actually knows me

289
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,900
you know that I'm current with I'll
knows about my house can easily just

290
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,360
you know you get out as chair walk over
and see if

291
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,590
you know something's going bad um and
then he would have the ability to

292
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,720
you know impact might might secures the
china doll whatever or dispatch please

293
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,429
write

294
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,720
I'm could implement simple rules and
permission so

295
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,410
let's say I've got a friend that like I
like a buddy

296
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:54,280
you he gets drunk election and I don't
want to be able to like the same myself

297
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,660
but you know I would like don't wanna
check in every once in a while

298
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:04,660
so I'll you could implement holes so i'd
like I'm

299
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:10,040
I like my sis and even up you send me a
text or an email for an automated phone

300
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,670
caller

301
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:15,540
you know it bringing Twitter rupaul sent
smoke signals or whatever i won

302
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,389
to that you've ever I want someone in a
hurry um

303
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,429
and this way you know hey if no one
responds after a you know

304
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:26,570
pre-determined amount of time call the
plays

305
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:30,129
that's what does anyways right it's
really not that hard

306
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,490
okay it very very very least

307
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,290
a system that allow users to choose from
on line service you know

308
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,610
for the sake of P as competition right
okay alarm notifications

309
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,939
you got burglars I'm not alarm is
triggered

310
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,890
I so you get this text message email
brian has got a a

311
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:53,550
at summary basically a free fall sensor
activity with respect to time

312
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,350
so you see Inouye you 809 back towards a

313
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,590
right you know eight or nine you twenty
seconds later

314
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,990
the backhaul a monitor that much
detective Richard

315
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,630
you know 30 seconds later someone no
walks into the kitchen

316
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:12,420
and you could look at a quick view the
stuff also many have a link

317
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,510
and that text to that email to a an
incident specific web page that will be

318
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,290
served up by this alarm system

319
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,570
right as its all you know connected the
eight-year your

320
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,590
bribing getting so I'm you click on that
link

321
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,530
a visit with this web page I'll you get
all this information is updated in real

322
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,080
time

323
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,610
right I'm so you have a Scrabble less
than all that changed your sister States

324
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,870
so it's basically like up like a
overview of what's going on in your

325
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:39,020
house at that moment

326
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,500
also have you have um output there or

327
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,669
your you have access to you you have
access to you

328
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:49,550
all the video and audio that all these
devices that are in your house

329
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,980
are collecting right and you can you can
call it does with

330
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,060
you know motion detectors or adding
stuff happens and for this computer is

331
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:57,620
season

332
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:01,000
you know take a picture that's relevant
you know you can see someone in your

333
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,380
house rain chances are

334
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,610
like this as your neighbor your friend
your you know your a casual

335
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,240
acquaintances Robin you anyways

336
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,630
and has quick links to your common
actions like other cops

337
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,940
you know turn off the alarm release the
crackin released crack

338
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:19,270
I'm also live communication between all
the recipients

339
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:22,740
a neural on that occasion right so I've
got eight people got this thing they're

340
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,380
looking

341
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,040
right maybe they've got some something
like and responses like nothing

342
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,750
everything's fine

343
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,500
or release the crackin or you know I'm
gonna head over

344
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,350
I'm checking out you know I'm but
basically you're able to

345
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,649
to all get a consensus about what's
going on so I'm

346
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,810
this is something you know maybe but it
might look like Brent

347
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:47,540
so you got the video been there and kind
to your kids

348
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,678
so no yet the time on self-explanatory

349
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,080
okay so how about powerful like the
forties respond to your situation is

350
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,720
this information to force a few

351
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,640
you allow them to have it you up ten
when he read it would be very helpful

352
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,429
writes like

353
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:06,310
wanna know now like the alarm went off
at this house so what is eighty they

354
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,409
were able to check the back near the
people who

355
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,690
Tom or in your monitoring loop right
what and access you can rest easier

356
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,870
sensor information

357
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:17,080
the really good stuff I think they went
back door you know start there

358
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,270
or sure the front bottom out I'm

359
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,980
what if homeowners can essentially said
status for their system

360
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:28,570
that that some you know authorities me
thinking they can check out like

361
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,389
I'll here's an example a rowton from

362
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:35,810
you 6168 Jolie coming in up

363
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,820
in any means to feed its payroll jobs at
this number

364
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,760
Joes and he's nerdy has brown hair like
the number six

365
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,100
I'll but that was about building your
very helpful information for cops

366
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,120
so here's our system is able to leverage
statistics and data

367
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,399
as well all being fed from the nanopores

368
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,260
I'm but you can adjust sensitivity based
on time

369
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,080
and your stack up against regional crime
statistics

370
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,530
I might be useful certainly seems
logical

371
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:08,200
I'm with you the option sharing your
data with other systems in your area

372
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,679
course like completely optional but

373
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,669
it will be useful for identifying trends
right so a with the past three hours for

374
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:17,000
housing but the back doors

375
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,480
you know Kingdom so

376
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,870
something something bad stuff going on

377
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,139
so you can pick up like minority report
a missing I'll

378
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:31,290
got any more data okay so custom alone
States

379
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:34,710
so you know give me away and thursday or
give me death

380
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,850
so you might have like some different
scenarios going on in your house that

381
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,320
would require different alarm states and
I think that a

382
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,520
a you know an ideal system that have
that

383
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,658
on ideally you'd you'd be able to set
for each sensor in your entire system

384
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,940
how it affects the overall stay right
and then I'll

385
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,970
just as importantly be able to set up an
A for response

386
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,550
based on what happens in those
conditions are met right

387
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:02,010
for example so if I'm

388
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:06,460
now work in an office right so between
the hours that 630 E

389
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,750
a.m. and 5 o'clock PM yes my

390
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,400
office motion detectors trips and then
within two minutes

391
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,110
I'm there's a motion from my PC then you
know

392
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:21,040
run use any attacks and you know minute
common life in telling

393
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,490
you but judging by the Sears you know
something like that

394
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,500
make it a lot easier for you to have
different structures

395
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,500
secured universe is Lexie at a bar or
something

396
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,060
now it would be like everything's on
earnings of scenario

397
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,408
would be like okay well the barn secure
and I was in the house million ransom

398
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:43,860
I'm I would like to see more
installation options the right now

399
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,600
looking in the right like you by kid
from a shock that sucks

400
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,699
and you put in your house and its it's a
trial

401
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:55,300
right or you know you get to you know
like some leads you to come and I'll

402
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,290
I'll lost all in and everything usually
free sometimes

403
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:03,010
sometimes not actual business I'm not if
you like a decent system but

404
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,669
that does come with a three-year
contract from really really crappy

405
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:07,290
monitoring but

406
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:11,120
I'm what if forced to use the existing
sensors

407
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,219
right if you you know already had a
large system from the eighteen hundred's

408
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,330
you can just drop and this new system it
would use all the all the existing stuff

409
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:18,820
because it's

410
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:23,240
its ostensible I'm additionally what he
did you like an array of wireless

411
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,850
sensors

412
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:27,740
that you can build in the common things
on your house for example I gotta

413
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,460
light switch or out the box butterfly
use of those out

414
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:35,550
like also like you wouldn't like replace
the functionality or remove that

415
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,990
but suddenly your last which has a
motion picture

416
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:42,399
you know what things were like actually
affordable

417
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:46,840
you can put a lot on your handsome
increase in coverage

418
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,668
I'm about this motion detector that is
very strict vigil levels I get

419
00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:54,679
but it doesn't like replace the light
unions mid-level

420
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:57,730
on you know it's like a it was in line

421
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,510
essentially well as not to impede %eh

422
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:05,060
functionality this witness would be for
everyone but like I would love to have

423
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,940
honey pot no

424
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,370
my alarm system right like you know you
know get everything all nice and tight

425
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:10,800
like

426
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,350
don't set the alarm Hall I said like the
place you go to a notification that

427
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:18,350
like this particular dress like there's
a there's a the flight locked in my

428
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,230
closet

429
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,270
you know at Bealls

430
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,480
percent actually improve security in the
long run

431
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,090
the same ideas and having anything

432
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,639
and you

433
00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:36,080
your money University please huge for

434
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,870
use her

435

there's concern

436
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,370

and used on responsibility and was a
huge hard

441
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,190
no I think the then I mean isn't common
sense I wouldn't every time I

442
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:12,190
neighbors say okay you know see someone
the housing charger go get them

443

10 who was boss is always have one
ability doesn't matter if it's best

444
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:22,619
customer softshell double the the light
bill

445
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:25,199
or you wanna army online them

446
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,999

00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,470
yeah I agree then third third

460
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,510
toughest sell right behind them for a

461
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:23,080
you know if you know why I am something
being on fire

462
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:27,250
you know if you wanted to do this
someone with serious about this

463
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,850
and with products like the SR extends my
home

464
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,870
using various car mostly devices you
just talk about exist

465
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:39,139
devices that screw into a light socket
and Jamal goes into it and to censor

466
00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:42,969
in montana carrie kahn signaling they
all have a long month

467
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:47,510
within 20 71 diligent and wanted to
grandparents and

468
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,600
and all that stuff doesn't primary in
like I'll

469
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,668
why can't get along its Atlantic best

470
00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:57,940
up looking to alarm dot com

471
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:01,000
all-or-nothing used

472
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,480
and a half there'd

473
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,580
and I think people are back home

474
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:14,460
hood

475
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,820
p don't get all a hole in the hall

476
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,050
here that it is

477
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:26,070
so through my system is II ever since
record

478
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:30,360
yeah in addition the network gamers huge

479
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,620
so on motion detection is a message

480
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,350
over the Internet alright but if that
fails worst-case

481
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,820
still got the word thats recording
everything about what

482
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:46,080
rather defensive yet russia is that
heads up let down

491
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,540
stupid you when you have time you know
the score cheap drinks

492
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:26,090
ascended with the system cost $5000 all
3 hell

493
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,659
and that's crazy okay so I'm how are you

494
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:33,180
right so I have as much work at didn't
recognize this image

495
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,200
your head thank you

496
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,690
yes art so must look at what is monster
cat

497
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:44,800
I I'm 12 years old and what is this I'm
much raises the train is like a

498
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,430
its medical alarm system nirvana this is
actually something that I I really do

499
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,490
want to do

500
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:54,960
home but admittedly you know I I don't I
don't give us like the college try

501
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,410
I'll actually get people in place in the
world you know experts in their

502
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:01,500
you know fashions later equally as
understanding as I am

503
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:06,330
um I this will be completely open source
open source hardware software

504
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:13,070
and would-be essentially a you being out

505
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:17,550
moment yes ok was exactly the subject

506
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:21,260
as with no clothes in a cover if there's
a lot of overlap there

507
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:24,910
as a great talk I'm looking for partners
offer

508
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:29,230
right I'm there's another Boston
definitely used to establish the answers

509
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:29,840
protocols

510
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,230
communications proprietary nonsense home

511
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,840
you have a blast playing in suffer
protection for creating

512
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,899
and Pearl Harbor compatibility so this
is the having the ability to generate

513
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,560
things that you make yourself

514
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:47,060
or things that exist currently which
doesn't happen typically

515
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:51,340
except for like that you know that one
like feedback loop that

516
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:55,459
that's on the higher end systems have
the probably on the team's I have a test

517
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,290
in Lahore

518
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:59,500
career I O so you would be able to add a
lot of lot of

519
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,820
sensors I'm have stupid simple OS and
firmware upgrades

520
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:07,070
as you we all know that everyone
involved in interpreting

521
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:11,830
stuff well it will be having to go to
the lamb

522
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:15,510
um be you know compact possible for next
season tickets

523
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:18,530
you know up in a closet somewhere home

524
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:21,649
if we can talk went away wide open
source

525
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:24,870
okay so insert the obligatory you know
recession here

526
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:28,830
but really like ultimately light and
make are many hands make light work

527
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:32,740
and leave that some I think this would
ensure that the growth in the system is

528
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,830
actually based on

529
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,870
real needs it would be like that well
you know

530
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:40,949
what you mean it would make people buy
this because that's not how I think that

531
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,730
we should approach the subject because
it's

532
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:46,670
not not an exercise in marketing is an
exercise in securing house

533
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:51,730
right alright so I'm this will also
allow for a new marketplace for products

534
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:52,490
and services

535
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:56,950
so more competitions good and I'll see

536
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:00,610
at at also apart from a higher so
generally towns

537
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:03,870
28 yes it will and we'll fix that 30 go
to 10

538
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:08,179
this is the nature of the beast I think
that's M you know help

539
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,370
help how will you handle this is
oftentimes determines a

540
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:16,530
not successfully what's next okay we
start this conversation

541
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:19,810
this is the first time I've ever talked
about this from anyone so

542
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:23,100
obviously you know there's all versions
toughened love unknowns

543
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,520
so hopefully you guys can help fill in
those gaps so combining

544
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,650
line together all some people and

545
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,870
eventually you know it in place we came
about simple functionality and

546
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:37,800
you response to develop the to the
foundation

547
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,889
suffer and and hardware for this thing
I'm individually and this is

548
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:45,270
when release in STK and let

549
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,700
you create genuine momentum and use the
word gumption

550
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,530
I'm from the south takeover that's it

551
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:55,870
okay so its main address in terrorism

552
00:32:55,870 --> 00:33:00,030
any questions withdrawal

553
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:03,300
Yahoo I think kids

554
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,879
II yeah at home I don't think that
happen

555
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,020
yeah

556
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:14,420
yet handsome where yes

557
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:20,270
yes i i all good

558
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:24,900
that also sounds the your word good

559
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,960
cool yeah and you guys have any
objections

560
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:34,960
do

561
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,090
your

562
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:43,750
No

563
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,820
I don't you going i'm ok modernized
