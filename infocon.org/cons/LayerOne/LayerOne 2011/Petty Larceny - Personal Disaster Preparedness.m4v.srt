1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,149
time okay

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,270
so where was it some to introduce my
cock

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:11,649
I'm penny Evan larceny also petit
larceny Bueller's me more sleepy

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,630
com just depends on context mostly I'm
here today to talk on the impact of

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,759
disasters on personal security

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,930
I unfortunately this topic years very
very broad chare

7
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,330
I'm gonna kind limited a little bit more
towards a

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,639
scope so first long introducing myself

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,149
buddy larceny I'm a FEMA certain
volunteer

10
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,340
I've been doing that since about I took
the Pima sir course back in 2005

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,360
are since then I've also become an EMT

12
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,809
I didn't go through the final
certification process or don't have a

13
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:45,129
license to do that

14
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:49,149
which means that even if you fall over
dead I don't have to help you

15
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,809
I'm I eat but I don't have to

16
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:57,320
that's why I think it certified but I do
have all the education I'm also amateur

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,309
radio operator

18
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:02,399
I know a lot of people out here are I'm
based on other talks are given

19
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,090
people when I'm also an array certified
personal instructor

20
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,799
2009 maker and I work profession is an
ammunition manufacturers

21
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,770
some my I'm Canterbury guy

22
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,259
that's me we r were up doing a natural
clean up and we had a problem

23
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:20,310
rattlesnake

24
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:27,310
so there was a boom headshot hot topics
in a comer

25
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,240
first wall was a disaster what is
personal security

26
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,509
and the official disaster affects the
disasters on people

27
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:38,619
that's kinda the main thrust what this
is going to be about

28
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:41,700
we'll talk a little bit about a couple
case studies especially Hurricane

29
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,479
Katrina

30
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,280
goes like they're not working to train
it was very much the

31
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,950
defining vent in the United States in
terms of disaster recovery and what not

32
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,479
to do

33
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,048
I mean it was a disaster on multiple
levels

34
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:59,560
Obama talk back in 2010

35
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,899
my house flooded because a burst pipe
and nobody who's was around

36
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:10,509
and it was Mandelson debilitating but it
was definitely problematic

37
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:14,769
I'm gonna talk a little bit about the
Japanese earthquake in that still

38
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,010
something that's unfolding before our
eyes

39
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,690
sonya's its interesting in terms of a

40
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,109
couple aspects but right now it's told
the jury is still out on a number of

41
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,700
things

42
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,769
and then we'll talk a little bit more
about what we can do to prepare for

43
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,550
disasters

44
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,610
definitions anybody know disasterous

45
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,900
well as bad

46
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:42,510
and okay disaster this is the Merriam
Webster definition

47
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,470
a glamorous event especially one
occurring suddenly causing great loss of

48
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:47,930
life

49
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,190
best available damage or hardship such
as a flood airplane crash business

50
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:52,859
failure

51
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,379
if your business fails and people dying

52
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:00,780
I'm really curious to know what that
stand

53
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,790
but any excellent security

54
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,879
come on it's a security conference

55
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:12,620
let's forget row

56
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,380
three

57
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,829
the OS

58
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,920
okay no adjustment skip that but

59
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,000
you're very very closer you know taking
it in a in a broader scope

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
applying to life property and

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,370
you know wanna some the CIA is a very
good action plan

62
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,080
once again merriam-webster freedom from
dangerous cancer

63
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,620
the thing I really when she goes to take
away from this

64
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,070
is that not disasters a personal if
you're affected by disaster it's a very

65
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,150
very personal thing

66
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,950
and what you have to do is you have to
prepare personally

67
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,269
4 a disaster because if you don't you
know

68
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,350
you may think it's like Army analyst
people got hit by Hurricane Katrina

69
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,739
man I really suck some %um some money
well

70
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,550
if you're there money isn't always what
you need it's like

71
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,730
yeah that's great well as it turns out
like all my life's work has been

72
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,500
destroyed

73
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,720
by businesses destroyed everything else
and in money

74
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,260
you know doesn't really help its much

75
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,250
easier to keep that from happening them
to try to take an repay somebody for

76
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:25,950
that loss

77
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,810
so how to disaster-stricken personal
security

78
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,640
number one

79
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,320
loss a shelter at your home your
livelihood kemp et Fort somehow

80
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,360
possibility this is another big one will
say roads are jammed destroyed flooded

81
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,190
anything else

82
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,820
you can around was gonna vote and even
then who knows if you want to navigate

83
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,550
those waters

84
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,669
loss a few water

85
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:54,810
well here in Southern California are
very prone to earthquakes

86
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,020
we get a big earthquake a cut of the
Equinox be getting water

87
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,750
I'm not to feed the her fill the bill
easily

88
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,890
18 million people we have a link here
loss electricity

89
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:09,560
this is an obvious warming the wind
blows to her lose electricity

90
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,900
loss of health and life more important
one

91
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,950
and loss of economic opportunity this is
kinda

92
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,180
want the mean things I want you guys to
take away from this if you're prepared

93
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,919
for disaster

94
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,640
the economic opportunity it's like you
may be at work for a couple weeks but

95
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,090
you're not can be crippled by

96
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,450
understanding main threats

97
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,409
they come in a couple different forms
you have direct threats

98
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,470
with your flood waters you have falling
debris is flames

99
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,610
and resource conflict resource conflict
when it comes in when you talk about

100
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,000
civil disturbances

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,930
and if you if we go back and talk about
Hurricane Katrina little bit

102
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,180
that was gonna very big ones resource
conflict

103
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,630
indirect yep hygiene and medicine

104
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,190
so let's say you have her condition your
family member with her condition

105
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,599
making sure you have enough medicine to
keep that person

106
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:06,650
okay is a very big one yells Aftab
hygiene products shipped enhance okay at

107
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,830
that point paper

108
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:13,560
get away for girlfriend if you're
prepared for that

109
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,430
special friend should be

110
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,760
very very happy with you if you prepare
for that matter well

111
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,909
that's just be that much worse economic
impact

112
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,360
is one of those indirect ones where
you're going to be at work your

113
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,979
your job may be destroyed so

114
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:37,150
start a case studies so go to hell it's
every man for himself

115
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,780
this is actually said to a person

116
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,989
who came up to New Orleans police
officer looking for help

117
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,740
that's what the police officer pulled
him so

118
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,410
in a disaster amor emergency you're in
it for you

119
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,610
yourself so you gotta prepare for
yourself into carriers of because the

120
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,870
police the fire

121
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,280
you know as much as they try to do we're
gonna be overwhelmed

122
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,750
first thing that happens so Hurricane
Katrina the interesting thing about

123
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,000
Hurricane Katrina

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,190
was that there was no local emergency
response everybody who have the

125
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,280
wherewithal have to

126
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,619
during before and during the evacuation
got out

127
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,300
that includes police firefighters
ambulance drivers

128
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,669
everybody who couldn't last which kinda
left

129
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:24,700
everybody else cannons income stock

130
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,840
so those for the reason why we had just
his

131
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,419
ongoing failures emergency response and
everybody's blaming george bush work

132
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:32,890
well

133
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:35,949
george bush thousands miles away were
the people live there

134
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:39,570
that's what I'm %uh the next thing

135
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:44,440
that came from Hurricane Katrina because
there was no first responders

136
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,330
got massive civil disorder bikers back
to the quote

137
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,940
you know that cop couldn't help anybody
because he was too busy trying to help

138
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,560
himself

139
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,580
going down to the 2010 house flung

140
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,800
pretty much what happened was I gonna
call

141
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,180
so hey there's a actual water in living
room

142
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,380
and the first thing I thought of when
I'm driving home slick

143
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,719
all gone my computers on the floor

144
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,040
around small business on on the sign

145
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,770
I had all my cat drawings and everything
else on my computer

146
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:21,570
if that got flooded I am screw there was
a year's work on their even though I had

147
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,370
backed up elsewhere

148
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:28,100
it still owes things that would set me
back as a was because I also have a shop

149
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,150
in my home

150
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:33,140
I had all the furniture from my house
that wasn't damaged or destroyed

151
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:38,069
in my shop I couldn't for two months so
that was a severe economic impact is

152
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,510
really set me back

153
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,729
you know stop in for so it's just
another thing to think about if you can

154
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:46,690
budget for things you can come up with
alternatives

155
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,140
ways working you know do it plan for do
it

156
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,660
Japanese earthquake 2011 the interesting
thing about this one

157
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,500
is that it's compound disaster their
first they had a pretty big earthquake

158
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,720
the nice thing about japan is that it's
a first world countries very

159
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,709
well-prepared for earthquakes

160
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:07,920
like they've been way well we get this
picture put

161
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,729
take your those the builder buildings to
a very very high standard they do the

162
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,660
geological engineering to make sure that
the Billings won't fall down

163
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,740
and for the most part the EU la to a
building collapse in Japan specially

164
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,150
after Kyoto

165
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,689
the no Kobe building without

166
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,620
hands their be remembered you all bills

167
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:36,620
him the Haas you'll yeah the goal of
gold

168
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,610
but some they get there not all the
buildings fell down

169
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,949
even though you got video of them having
liquefaction up

170
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:48,719
part the way when I look at the other
water shooting about the ground

171
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,030
that's weird rules go back and work
permit so

172
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,350
from that perspective yeah the rule on
electricity

173
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,790
but different one for the disasters that
came afterwards

174
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,530
they walked away from it Japan would be
like me

175
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,589
big earthquake so what

176
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:10,650
the next thing the Caymans they had in
wasn't 18 leadership Nami

177
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,060
do you guys have any ideas scale and

178
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,250
it's a tsunami waves higher than those
room

179
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,089
it's huge and on top of that

180
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:24,470
at them sweeps in New the nuclear power
plant and knocks out the

181
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,630
emergency backup generators that were
cooling the reactor

182
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:30,990
so now they have giant tsunami that
wiped out most the coastline which is

183
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,720
mostly

184
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,329
little land on the West Coast

185
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:39,780
me East east coast in Japan

186
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,720
and now a huge chunk that you can't
really spend a lot of time there because

187
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,430
the radiation hazard

188
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,510
a granite radiation in those levels

189
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,530
it sounds really hazardous really isn't

190
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:55,230
you know it's not something you want to
spend a lot of time in there

191
00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:00,589
but still you know its walls things were
now you can find people even more

192
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:05,550
this person a country with a comma
population that kinda topography

193
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,719
so getting a little more into the
survival planning aspects

194
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,560
I'm 10 things gonna survival experts and
everything else can we talk about quite

195
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,910
a bit is what's called the rule threes

196
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:20,870
rules reason three minutes without air
three Matt three hours without children

197
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,900
and granted these things to look pliable
you know

198
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,949
if you're out side here your you can
probably do more than three hours

199
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:34,650
if you're naked in your wet and it's
snowing you might not last 30 minutes

200
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:39,420
so three days without water once again
it's a little bit plastic

201
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,250
and generally three weeks without food
and water in the Arctic can you bring

202
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,069
2,000 calories a day just keeping your
body warm

203
00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:50,990
or if you're in the Sahara money needy
for months

204
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,610
maybe more problem she herself but you
won't need them

205
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,150
much

206
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,370
the main thing when it comes to
mitigating disasters especially for

207
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,670
yourself

208
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,429
is planning the number one rule

209
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:10,520
in the prerequisite is having a plan

210
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,980
when you're making your plans for C
after can force potential disasters

211
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,160
so I live in Southern California granted
you well I got a new yorkers quakes

212
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,290
well I'm you guys ever see the shirts
from late 90's

213
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,449
you know somewhat the Four Seasons Bali
work

214
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:32,329
to be remember those a C-one 19 couple
others

215
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:34,949
up

216
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,840
but will the forces lost sales were I'll
see from Rome

217
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,130
Ryan fire flooded and now I'm

218
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,150
earthquake there you're get involved
civil

219
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:49,750
okay there were no PCs

220
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,830
where it's alright

221
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,720
you know within I'm from the people the
unfriendly things other people

222
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,750
so you know that

223
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,700
that's what we have to do with your in
Southern California we don't really have

224
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,610
a big floods

225
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,050
don't floods the flash floods really
smaller usually very very constrained

226
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:13,000
you know if you're in the midwest to get
a deal today does he get a deal with a

227
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,410
very very large ones like there right
now

228
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:20,050
drought which you know it's a little bit
more min in direct threat

229
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,410
and comfort you economically verses

230
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,410
you know oh man the strauss-kahn's we
warehouse away

231
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:31,600
thing we talk about some um

232
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,290
next step up practice your plan the best
way to practice your plan is for

233
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,430
everyday disasters

234
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,859
and 10 things to talk about all that is
kinda though

235
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,110
the call typically the bug out bag um

236
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,980
I just fell apart my just in case
because

237
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,240
this is my just in case

238
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,800
it has pretty much everything I need
just in case

239
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,150
and it fits in case mil-spec

240
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:03,990
but we'll talk about that the second
them

241
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:07,310
the thing with having you're just in
case your bug out bag

242
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,709
is that your prepare for every day
disaster so

243
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:17,710
what everyday disaster everybody know
that's pretty close

244
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,280
Graham do you don't actually traffic on
the 405 is a good one because everybody

245
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,760
has that almost every day

246
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,930
what you want to see if you're sitting
there traffic you can't get offered

247
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,540
don't want to get off your religion it's
more you're hungry

248
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:34,530
region there snap into a slim jim

249
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:39,480
yeah I'm freeway collapse here

250
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,950
good

251
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:46,300
return yeah that you know should be
snowing on freeway in

252
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,890
so horny that her yeah

253
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,069
riverbanks yes I'm getting there

254
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,340
those loans you gonna a home

255
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,180
the whole idea is that if you have it
with you

256
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,459
can you handle advisers woohoo hands

257
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,360
in problem doctors you may want to talk
to you

258
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,300
them low-power you know dress

259
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,770
but over the years is that you have this
as bad in this case the

260
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:23,270
you just in case souls like you used to
relying on his earnings anyway

261
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:27,730
mare earlier hey along with birdies
bison and Dolores

262
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:32,470
pulls back I'm hungry well doing snack
until dinner

263
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,230
report on my back map in your fridge for
socks

264
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,200
aboard my bag and thirsty the water in
my bag

265
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,350
yeah on on so you're not really using

266
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:48,120
the extended utility the bag but it's an
everyday disaster

267
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,210
that allows to prepare for didn't want
to let you know what's in there

268
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:55,550
there are a lot of people build these
disaster kits they never open while

269
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,520
because it's on a disaster well then

270
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,970
they never cycle fear anything else
there

271
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,220
you know that

272
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:11,100
mister so and the next big big truck
comes along

273
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,650
does not have any plan is planning to
fail so that's why you should have a

274
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,180
plan

275
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,630
main elements you should have on the
planned

276
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:24,910
is where you gonna go usually that
somewhere safer most was that our house

277
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:29,500
in certain circumstances like what's a
wildfire where you been chased and your

278
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,140
house

279
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,860
%um maybe that's your office maybe

280
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,940
usually is a family member brand

281
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,330
somebody who lives relatively close but
after the immediate disaster area

282
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,590
and having multiples is usually the best
way to go on that

283
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,850
you can't distribute your room response

284
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:51,670
what to do if you plan for you can do it
quickly

285
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:56,219
and that's going on number one things
like okay there's a fire coming

286
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,810
what do I need to grab well I got my
family pictures

287
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:05,679
I grab my important documents nothing is
actually a gentleman here from

288
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,290
Australia I was talking to you the other
day was talking about they were having

289
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,170
big floods

290
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:14,250
and one other things you can do you can
text and your photos in

291
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:19,910
and here doesn't have a cell phone wow
no hands

292
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:24,209
so you carry this thing ever rate pretty
much

293
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:29,130
don't lose it too often was these things
have all SIM cards that you can put in a

294
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,190
means little

295
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:35,990
crappy phone drawing pictures on there
you might have for your 20 gigs in car

296
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:41,070
where the hell is yet comes with the 16
gigs incurred

297
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:45,510
you can put a lot of photos family
photos you can't replace anywhere else

298
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,780
lot of personal documents on your phone
ones you don't lose your phone

299
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:56,780
that's a big if I'm isn't your religion
from

300
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,440
okay so for everybody but those two guys

301
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,990
the three it's a good plan you guys

302
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,840
you'll have to come up with something
else for you now there we go

303
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,280
you got back so for that for the jury
you

304
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,670
the other need a man who's your phone
our from the second plant USB keys are

305
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,430
good one

306
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,520
but those with a friend or family or
something like that um

307
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,520
next we need to talk about is what to
bring usually if you're going to a

308
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,430
friend's house for family members house
or something like that you need to bring

309
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,510
your own food and water

310
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,900
if they're impacted by the disaster
they're not can be

311
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:38,670
exactly excited about sharing the
resources with you so the more you can

312
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,370
bring along the better

313
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:45,300
better off you'll get along above that
way up once again the more water you can

314
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,580
bring specially if the

315
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,879
the grid downs scenario war there's
damage the water system

316
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,500
the more water you can bring them
happier everybody will be

317
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,350
and the next thing I keep coming her
being honest hygiene

318
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:02,409
and First Aid wash your hands especially
if water is in short supply

319
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:06,690
you know waterless hand sanitizers are
very good you've probably seen Wall

320
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,890
things they have about mom the area wash
your hands

321
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,440
it keeps down almost and everybody's
sick

322
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,070
in a disaster scenario with not enough
food water they're gonna be really

323
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,689
pissed

324
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:22,850
some the next thing that you probably
want to bring special if you have family

325
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,570
that has a large spread

326
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:28,290
maybe a small house bring a tent
Southern California

327
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,850
even in the winners usually 10 the sleep
outside some

328
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:36,959
your sleeping bag yeah air mattress
makes you a little bit more comfortable

329
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,100
as well as shelter next thing you have
to do is you have to make the mental

330
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,980
preparation

331
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,390
good way during his role playing and yet

332
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,800
one other components role playing is
what gives so

333
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,970
you will play inside all with urs armies

334
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:57,700
well problem come up with a plan for
zombies

335
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,350
it's going to be pretty close to where
you have to do with Ryan more on

336
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,330
earthquakes like

337
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,379
well or mascot safe what his armies

338
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,730
were an earthquake what we're going to
do well we're going to Grahams

339
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:14,470
force travelers she lives 200 miles away
and I can take the following five rounds

340
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,040
together

341
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,100
so you got to take a plan your what it's
like

342
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,800
what if I go this way in this traffic
where there's armies

343
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,870
or there's meh the bridges falling down
something like that

344
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:31,070
next thing you have to do is after major
physical preparations

345
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,870
you have to make your virgins kid for
you just in case like a saint

346
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:38,360
you have to know where you're going
that's a very important

347
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,760
talk to your friends and family if your
gonna show up there you know

348
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,090
grandma might not be too unhappy about
it yeah showbiz that

349
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:49,850
weird brother in laws house the man
happy too happy about it

350
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,199
your friends they might be happy to have
you for a while

351
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,440
but I don't last for another important
thing in this is something that

352
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,860
a lot of people harp on as the contact
list so let's say you get somewhere like

353
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,469
a

354
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:07,980
a friend's house for family members
house who maybe doesn't talk to you

355
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,110
everybody you want to be able to call
other members your family and if your

356
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,159
phone gets wet

357
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,040
damaged or destroyed somehow well the
nice thing about going back to that

358
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,430
even if your phone does get damaged
typically that's him

359
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:25,030
was it submerged in salt water for an
extended period of time

360
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:28,480
still going to be good so that's gonna

361
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,690
makes a little bit more durable you know

362
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,980
but look so you don't have a real when
you get there so having a people

363
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,190
laminated contact list about the size of
a business card show in your wallet

364
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,660
showing your kid somewhere we can get to
it where you can call people want to get

365
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,810
an area in which you know

366
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:49,980
let them know you're OK very important
thing another thing you don't have a

367
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,930
list here

368
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:54,660
that kinda goes under physical
preparation is you know

369
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:58,280
a lobster computer geeks used to be a
computer geek

370

get a gym membership workout

372
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,850
a little bit take a 20 minute walk every
couple days

373
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,669
because the the more physically prepared
you are too

374
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:16,530
have to walk to extend distance from
anything like that the less likely you

375
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:17,750
are to be injured

376
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,270
and in an emergency situation injury

377
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,850
can be life-threatening even a small one
twisted ankle you can't walk

378
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:29,090
bad news guys you know work out a little
bit

379
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:33,080
mental preparation

380
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,820
once again role-playing especially if
you have children

381
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,210

even are echo Romeo

423
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,780

um de grâce humanitarian daily rations
to explore all

427
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,500
that is worse than this um I I can talk
about that a little bit more

428
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,850
but the advantage to these things worse
a lot of other foodstuffs like

429
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:39,240
Emery's from and a lot of things is the
density

430
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,160
calories mean this thing weighs I'm may
be.

431
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,560
mitzi Ichi names packet so it's

432
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,820
just over a pound and has 2400 calories

433
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,659
it's very hard to find that kind of
energy dancing a lot of foods

434
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:58,030
the next closest thing you're gonna find
is going to be like tandem

435
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:01,740
ok which and if you guys were trying to
drink and no

436
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,510
watering down at all is horrible

437
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:08,710
for trying said yeah

438
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:13,750
yeah diets are

439
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,890
not not good so these things are great
for that

440
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,950
the next greatest thing are things like
I laughed when James

441
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:23,710
because there's the 15 packaged in here

442
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,820
each one has a 160 calories giving it
all

443
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,220
calorie value 1800 calories and it

444
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,650
policeman's on

445
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,290
probably most amid its

446
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:40,980
its sugar flour and oil as

447
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,530
coconut oil I think a little lemon
flavoring thrown in

448
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:48,590
up sole discretion eso

449
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:52,669
LAS in

450
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:57,500
you should you should know that you're
pedaling them

451
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,190
and other things usually people
multi-tool

452
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:04,050
you don't have to buy the most expensive
one I think the 1i got there's like 25

453
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:04,500
bucks

454
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,380
former foldover tool next thing

455
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,510
are usually like to keep our a water in
camps at

456
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:18,510
with business any power

457
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,280
no

458
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,270
and pretty much with this is this is the
military canteen

459
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:33,820
titanium spork canteen for water

460
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:40,820
cop and stove

461
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:44,320
so I can boil water I can make fresh
water for any to

462

486
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:23,370
cars and by home I go there as opposed
to

later on we get to the 23 party

563
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:01,350
something you would like to sample some
ice you might will should

564
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:05,490
a slim jims these are like a buck 50 a
former

565
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:08,620
em FM radio is always handy to

566
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:12,770
keeping Conwell nonchalant keep in
contact but kinda keep apprised

567
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:17,100
the big one you always want in any of
your radios you always 1 a.m.

568
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:21,239
because if the local FM stations are of
the year

569
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,279
you know that doesn't do you any good
you're not really going here FM stations

570
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,040
from far away

571
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,580
a.m. you know here in Los Angeles
hartford kofi

572
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,969

573
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:37,909
so and I also usually get the San
Francisco stations on man on

574
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,049
a good wasiyu dark usually

575
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:44,850
so if you're really trying to hear
something from far away who may be

576
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:49,650
broadcasting disaster information and
news am really is the only way to go

577
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:53,370
other things are going on here

578
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:56,549
to consider important I got wheels for

579
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:59,860

585
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:23,040
it's a full-sized how little too small
I'll

586
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,370
you can usually get these a military P
actions don't like that for about 20

587
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:26,880
bucks

588
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,150
if you ever get the opportunity by one

589
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:36,230
okay as you forgot to take a picture my
toilet paper roll

590

592
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:50,550
were measured so any questions about the
emergency kit

593
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,119
yep that's that's actually good question

594
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:58,119
sure the things I most always carry my
pockets are

595
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:01,270

also smoke so you haven't used to

599
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,930

00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:16,970
so conclusions

618
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:20,299
we're the arbiters armed security thats

619
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,570
on them when it when the chips are down
nobody else is there to help you

620
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:28,720
planning preparation of tools that we
use to ensure

621
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,959
that's one of the things that's that has
been static in mankind since we

622
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,680
emerge from the trees some what happened
million years ago

623
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,350
so these are the things that you need to
think about

624
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:44,670
and I don't want to give you guys a list
of things that you go home in soon

625
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:48,260
do need this think about it think about
what you need

626
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,330
put in the bag see if the banks have
enough

627
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:55,720
truck carrying walk around the block a
couple times if that backs to happy

628
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,839
maybe trade something out you like 10
maybe you don't need this

629
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,870
maybe eight can you something that's a
little bit later little bit smaller

630
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:07,540
you know try it out that's why I say
live through everyday disasters

631
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:11,940
because when a big disaster nudes you
gonna be a lot more prepared

632
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:18,940
Q&A

633
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,730
in mine disaster %um their cars yet

645
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,580
you minimum 1 I'm

646
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,740
were don't fun

647
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:13,868
all those huge them name

648
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:18,980
just what had take small

649
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:23,050
%um yes time %um for a few years notice
this at all

650
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:26,470
but this bag has a couple different
features

651
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:30,459
has built in hydration pack in

652
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,970
the spurt down here which I kinda wish
it had a little bit more of its got what

653
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:34,970
they call morning

654
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:38,560
military attachment system

655
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,140
they've replaced but the nice thing
about these two things became more shop

656
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:45,330
of it for me

657
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:50,270
stuff that doesn't fit so the really
good way that you can taking to bolster

658
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:51,800
the amount of storage capacity

659
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:55,870
small bag from the other thing I can you
years will do is take

660
00:39:55,870 --> 00:40:00,839
tyson lieutenant my comfort blanket over
the top you make super easy to carry or

661
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,010
you can buy those will work

662
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:05,230
your ten dollars we sleeping bags were
wally world

663
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:09,450
a century is longer stay inside you stay
outside I'm

664
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:12,500
they get a little bit more marginal
nobody else

665
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,560
is ur yet

666
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,340
on the way think about

667
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:23,080
guard water California we live in a
desert

668
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,090
yeah but something about leach

669
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,690
to clean water only water

670
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:33,990
yes you can the question had was one of
everybody for that or not but

671
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:37,000
the question he had was about using
bleach

672
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,620
to use and at times water leeches
probably

673
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:44,400
one of the best ways to sanitize
waterfronts for the reason for me horny

674
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,340
water still

675
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:48,780
arm there's the number of pamphlets out
there

676
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,840
I could try to recite from memory I
think it's

677
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,860
a two drops per

678
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:58,100
porch for Clearwater in its

679
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:03,950
he drops per quarter for dirty water the
solution I usually wait to take us are

680
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,799
usually like to boil water first

681
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,880
because 1 the other problems we have
here in Southern California typically is

682
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,670
we also have solvent contamination

683
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:15,120
and will happen is when you boil water
drivers

684
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,850
columns of because the fault I'll and in
the

685
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:22,549
as long as you keep that a rolling boil
for under fire for 15 minutes depending

686
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:22,870
on your

687
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:29,870
multitude that will sometimes water
actually just

688
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:33,910
what actually just walk out hot water
supplies like not even a month ago

689
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:37,819
mean are people each or five-gallon
water

690
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,050
anything going on with two is we

691
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:44,100
walks instantly does not stable

692
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:48,130
to so what happens in Jaipur lesion your
nice clean water

693
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,730
and you seal it up but also realizing
come back in here

694
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:54,730
your gonna want to use Legion it again

695
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:58,470
don't worry is right for you because
over that hymie ovens and bacteria

696
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:01,819
it will stabilize yeah or

697
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:06,230
yeah or more I wish promised to do
anything with it were or just take a

698
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:10,070
you know beer water supplies and use
those were I G news

699
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:14,040
washing your hands yeah exactly waters
war

700
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,400
yes because figure around the house
tomorrow night

701
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,130
whatever got warm water heater print
more miles

702
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:24,590
here's why dishes did all those

703
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:28,000
that on resources also

704
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,810
the world way here

705
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:36,529
a oh yeah Aaron everything water the
whole season typically that makes a

706
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:37,510
little bit more

707
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:42,340
palatable afterwards on specially for
boiling water one thing your

708
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,770
kinda forgot to mention forget to put my
kit there um

709
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:49,280
one thing I usually 30 backs has
personally

710
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,210
if you're George trying to drink nasty
brackish water that you had a Borel

711
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:56,060
sterilizer you can add a bunch

712
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:00,450
each you get all the nasty stuff on
Michi have a lot more palatable

713
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:03,899
%uh another thing that works really good
as you can buy those little

714
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:08,240
you know single-serving Gatorade things
which haven't seen the cost about five

715
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,560
bucks for like 10 other

716
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,870
little packets oMG I usually carry those

717
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:18,630
least

718
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,740
in the nice thing is is that if you have
diarrhea

719
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:25,520
or something like that stuff like this
bull make sure that

720
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,060
those fluids that you're taking in don't
just tear right 3 a.m.

721
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:32,410
Matthew so in combination with ammonium

722
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:37,410
as a whole keep all that stuff in your
body you know hope you hired

723
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:40,450

726
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:51,189

727
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:55,080
right now is the smaller Costco host

00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:58,860
change world well as a smart

729
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:02,250
I'll those final or any other s ask why

730
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,430
yet it happens

731
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:08,879
history me typically five-gallon bucket

732
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,490
yes each year they're all fire times
cheaper

733
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:16,740
Eunice single-serving day on then you
can also use

734
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,200

735
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,480
for you know doing I'll time then

736
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:28,710
the reels South

737
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:32,210
World Water special water long-term

738
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:35,290
um typically will lose all gonna buy a
loser

739
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:39,090
55-gallon plastic drums well look around

740
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:43,450
because loss while stores all those
things to you for like $75 plus dollars

741
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:47,589
you know in don't go there it's like he
either knew

742
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:51,260
but your scribble water and then it's
going to get nasty anyway

743
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:54,680
um look around beverage companies

744
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,180
but places that bottle coca-cola and
stuff like that

745
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,649
get the syrup in same thing so the food
Greek container

746
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:06,440
that's been full syrup one thing that
will happen with a lot of those kinda

747
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,900
places believe the caps on quotes all

748
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:13,180
rain and get water in the coming from
nasty stuff take some

749
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:16,919
take those things washing out real good
thing when you're back urges Cozumel

750
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,560
thrown in about I'm

751
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,570
three or four tablespoons of oxy clean

752
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:27,240
and about half half a gallon white
vinegar

753
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,189
close-up shake up the kids all the
nasties out

754
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:35,210
and then just dump it out does it pose
it clean you know and you're good to go

755
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:39,380
it's just like I'm a brand-new the just
maybe a lil discolored from the city so

756
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:40,060
the chemicals

757
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:47,060
doing

758
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,319
mmm interest level is well

759
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:55,930
yet healthy arm some the other places I
found was one please those

760
00:45:55,930 --> 00:46:00,220
the sauce so your water comes up I will
consult easily tasting

761
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:03,839
volume a lot of people is

762
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,880
yeah he was yeah I'm

763
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:11,200
people's this question it goes and

764
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,470
missile fans one step up

765
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:15,930
up like having

766
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:20,560
generator yeah rain could discourage
people from getting generators

767
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,259
home one of the lessons we took away
from Hurricane Katrina was

768
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:28,710
everybody who had generators everybody
who didn't have generators the first

769
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:30,330
thing we heard was kinda thus far from

770
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:35,279
engine noise and the like I'm hungry and
I hear a generator

771
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,520
so pretty much that's like ring in the
dinner bell

772
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:41,590
