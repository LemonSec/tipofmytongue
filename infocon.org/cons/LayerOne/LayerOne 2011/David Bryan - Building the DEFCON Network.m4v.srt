1
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:04,360
alright

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,230
my name is David I'm in this is Mac

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,269
appear on stage as well he's our

4
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:14,759
I are double for Louise unfortunate the
reasons that

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,140
pH neutral so he's kind of our way I'm

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,900
but Mac is the next best thing he hire
on the network team we've been doing

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,599
this stuff for

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,900
quite a while together so right

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,788
feels like feels like quite a while so
we talk about

10
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:35,350
not going to talk about us a little bit
I'm talk about summer goals

11
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,660
challenges a the network at a high level

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:43,269
I'm certain the evolution the
infrastructure some the wired

13
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,510
components that go into the network and
Wales component to go on to the network

14
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:51,000
and then some future stuff that we're
gonna be looking at hopefully we'll have

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,059
ready for this year's con I and all
sorts

16
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,559
on star so

17
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:02,530
who hears prior to the hackerspace who
hears not

18
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:07,760
why are you not find your local
hackerspace there

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,950
they're great place to meet like-minded
people just like all the people that are

20
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,900
here in this con-

21
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,790
I I'm president in the twenties make a
group

22
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:20,689
basically it's a 4500 square foot
warehouse that we rent out now ur

23
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:23,380
fraction be increasing at T-seventy 800
square feet

24
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,429
in a couple days here we we've just
signed a lease last week but

25
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:31,420
anyway too good good thing to get
together work on projects

26
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,780
work with others that maybe have ideas
to help you out on things

27
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,100
it's a great place to learn great great
place to teach others

28
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,908
there's also something called the school
factory so if you've got if they're

29
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:44,960
people out there who want to start a
hackerspace

30
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,429
go check out the school factory they've
got a buncha programs for getting stuff

31
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,040
going

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,850
so I'm and I can read all the slides up
there

33
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,000
although the stuff that's on there also
DC

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,469
group group who here's part of the
seeker right

35
00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:03,759
um if you're in an area and you want to
start a DC group

36
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,990
you know please feel free to do so or by
someone who is

37
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,859

the

38
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,270
may be the primary contact for DEFCON
local dot com group

39
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,690
again these are also really kinda nice
places to get together

40
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,989
ideally no def cum group are not

41
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:24,440
and wanna call 2600 script kiddie

42
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,430
but they tend to attract some of that

43
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,370
and that the DEP 100 seem to be a a much
more professional place professional

44
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:32,849
realm

45
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:36,500
for people to get together and talk
about into sac arm

46
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,890
way

47
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:46,380
so this is our mean for today we will be

48
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,950
interspersing somebody's throughout the
slides feel free to laugh

49
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,630

69
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,680
a little bit a background some the

70
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,709
dc1 DEFCON 1 Sarah

71
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:19,000
no network sands no network Tropicana
for DEFCON 3

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,140
no network um Monte Carlo

73
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,390
apparently had some interwebs I am

74
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,650
we don't I don't we I don't know if
anybody was quite clear I think we all

75
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,909
got too drunk to remember

76
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,229
um Def Con 5 we actually 81 broad and

77
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:38,330
I unfortunate the maintenance guy went
home for the weekend

78
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,680
and didn't extend it up to the
conference for so it's like

79
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,450
k well that that's a mean it's Phil I

80
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,770
Def Con six does anybody remember the
Plaza Hotel ish

81
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,109
what a horrible hotel at me

82
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,720
just really gross um we had a t1 line

83
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,560
dropped and a DSL line dropped and were
loaded onto knows

84
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,860
on up I think up a little a

85
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,190
he was FreeBSD box that major male

86
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,919
put together um there's also capture the
flag network

87
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,370
and a public network so there wasn't
really a lot up sacred

88
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:18,289
segregation segmentation then it def
Connie

89
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:21,460
Street dock on seven we start at the
Alexis Park

90
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,900
I basically were there from

91
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,530
7 to 12 and I think we started out

92
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,510
piggybacking on the alexis is parked
Alexis parks DSL

93
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,719
and only thing keeping me back twenty
one that they had to the convention we

94
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,289
did that for a number of years

95
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:42,289
arm until Dec on 13 we actually got a
high-speed

96
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:45,460
wireless point-to-point link I'm which
was great

97
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,549
you were able to get and leave us 5
megabits might've been

98
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,280
eight by the time we left but I don't
think with anything up above that

99
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,960
then once removed the Riviera Hotel

100
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,190
we started out with 6 megabits kinda
increase that

101
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:04,229
ever you every year we almost double
that up until this last year we had 100

102
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:08,030
100 megabits is kinda funny story so

103
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,409
him a we paid for 80 megs

104
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:15,690
and I think it was a Friday or Saturday

105
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,930
they called us up I think it was
Saturday sir Saturday the

106
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,510
well into the weekend Saturday someone
from the Deaf guy network had been

107
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,640
running at de dos against some Amazon

108
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,560
environment was enough for me it wasn't
me I I was doing something else

109
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,840
up I I did present on that one yeah I
was the doesn't someone else but

110
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,849
so someone who didn't care but I am

111
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:42,010
make all this up and said hey you know
can you has blocked this traffic

112
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,250
okay shared wanna

113
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,800
what the hell like cocaine we've upped
your band with the 100 max

114
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,340
cool excellent so you know we scratch
their back

115
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,869
they scratch arm's reach do matter
there's really work in a cross-cutting

116
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,860
effect because

117
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,310
they give us more men with the dust by
yet more bandwidth

118
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,919
right with me here they they said shares
no

119
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:11,280
work them it was nice was nice to them
you know Tom

120
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,179
so I've been agreements and stepped on
six louise's

121
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,770
mean actually I'm when we started

122
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,770
when we bought the rebuke your I'm he
came

123
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,758
he kinda came along as an engineer and
at the end of the con-

124
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,780
he'd been very helpful helping out
getting things going

125
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,888
is always available so we kinda like a
raid you want to get to know

126
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:36,970
arm he said sure so

127
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,289
pays different but he's still upset yeah
pays

128
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:43,380
totally different anyway there is none
were all volunteers but

129
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,069
um and Mac started at DEFCON 16

130
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:49,860
and has been helping out with the
basically the wired network

131
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:56,860
infrastructure since then

132
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:04,180
all right sir suma goals for the Deaf
guy network I mean

133
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,690
it back in your up early days I think
probably

134
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,349
up until the point about the river
controller

135
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:16,569
I was sort of a free-for-all sur les
cartes let's get network out there

136
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:20,259
it may or may not work someone may or
may not owner switches

137
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:23,710
stuff may not work stuff may happen with
the best

138
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:28,299
effort really QTP traffic great arm

139
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,930
so weekend at back

140
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,269
when we started the real wood we've
kinda reevaluated and Saturday

141
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:38,860
we need to have something that's much
more reliable

142
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:42,079
rate reliable connectivity is is key

143
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:45,779
the other thing was secure ish I'm

144
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:50,260
you're not gone for topple tough want
security aide or 2.1 exxon

145
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,529
everything and you know all sorts of
extra controls that me

146
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:58,410
limit or inhibit the conference I mean
we're only there for three days straight

147
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,240
so has to be quick easy to do this stuff
um

148
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,360
wifi in every area I'm

149
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,180
when we see started at the Alexis Park
we

150
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,859
we had against I'm who worked for XO

151
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,320
borrow a catalyst 4,000

152
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,770
6 and so he shows up with this Inc

153
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:24,069
Cisco switch pulls out his truck them
like

154
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,660
what they're going to do with that
alright

155
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,899
well let's play again we plugged it in
in this is that the Lexus parked

156
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:34,899
and we proceeded to light up all the
ports in the hallway

157
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:38,529
all the ports everywhere rate got
everybody gone

158
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:42,120
and we soon realized that people figured
out the ports were alive

159
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,740
so they would will find a table move it
over into the hall

160
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,300
plugin and then there'd be this affect

161
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,969
daisy chain hubs going down the hallway
relate

162
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,670
yeah I guess the fire marshal might not
like that

163
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,880
soul that next year I think

164
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,050
Def Con eight or nine we basically said
I week

165
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,469
we can't let up ports unless there's a
need for it I'm

166
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,630
and we need to have wifi everywhere so
that people heart hanging out in the

167
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,550
hallways daisy chained down the hall

168
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,689
soul and he was interesting you had
these little communities people that

169
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,520
would say okay

170
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,569
cap again sure and and um

171
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,540
yeah I think we need to be able to do
with segment the traffic

172
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,349
new basically we wanted to make sure
that you know

173
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,860
the press wouldn't get owned by someone
who's sitting down and

174
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,890
on that the conference for I

175
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,949
and so we we create a bunch a different
view lands

176
00:10:37,949 --> 00:10:41,569
public the lawn speaker's press green
room

177
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:46,370
vendors I'm CTF networks he sir contest
networks

178
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:50,760
I'm info booth public servers
registration desk

179
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,949
mean all these areas had to be protected
and there's

180
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:58,859
there's more these are just examples arm
examples that we wanted to put together

181
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,990
now obviously if you're on the the local
network

182
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,069
local segment you're gonna be able to
manage your middle attack great

183
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:08,520
but reducing some %uh that scope ideally

184
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,140
if your press person you're sitting in
the press room someone I could do that

185
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:16,880
although that happened at Black Cat you
know someone who had press credentials

186
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,079
decide to do man and no attack up
someone who is

187
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,189
sit in the pressure on kinda annoying
but

188
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,529
what can you do yeah I mean people have
to have access without you saying

189
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:28,620
here's username/password at the at least
in this case

190
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:34,199
I'm Karen so

191
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:37,800
challenges money a we'd

192
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,579
don't tend to have a lot ovitz did we
mention it's a volunteer effort

193
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:48,829
rate I mean we're trying to do this as
cheaply as possible without breaking the

194
00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:49,329
bank

195
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:52,459
so I me

196
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:55,969
but the river controller was probably
the first purchase that was

197
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,290
the most expensive for us

198
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,399
I think there's also the the most
current

199
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,810
purchase you know reason year yeah here
everything else

200
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:09,949
tends to be saying and used equipment I
think you can

201
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,290
rubios use 90 yes yeah you know

202
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:17,620
um which I'll

203
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,230
Louise where are you Louise II

204
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,380
and it's like a 4,000 from

205
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,790
4,000 i think is what comes to mind up

206
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,449
we have the 44 yeah forget movie

207
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,510
me oh yeah we got a whole slide on that
shit so

208
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:40,710
army so the only problem we had was

209
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,500
at the Alexis Park it was not a union
hotel

210
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,090
which was good and bad was good from the
perspective that

211
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,970
hey we need to put something up okay go
do it right

212
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,930
I mean we be driving around on one of
those

213
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,910
you know scissor lifts the coop all the
way to the ceiling at three o'clock in

214
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,439
the morning

215
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,710
zip tying access points to the ceiling
rate and then

216
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,730
running around doing all that crap I
mean and that was all the network team

217
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,090
was

218
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:11,260
absolutely involved in doing everything
I'm wasn't like we could say

219
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,480
eighty hotel staff do this for us right

220
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,750
so was getting bad um

221
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,760
when we went to that Riviera

222
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,819
it was of a total union staff hotel
which means that

223
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,570
i cant get up on a scissors lift

224
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:33,380
and touch you know anything the ceiling
or anything on the the floor

225
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:37,900
has it all has to be run by their union
it's not run by their union

226
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,630
they can file a grievance and you know
do all sorts of weird stuff

227
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,680
for Arcon cost us money just stupid
stuff

228
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,839
so we you know basically had

229
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,500
plan a little bit better as well I'm

230
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,540
the other things it so that unique

231
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,630
actually go to the Lexus parked in that
tent

232
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,130
anybody remember that so him

233
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,140
we had that the first year we

234
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,890
we had the 10 we ran like five strand
the cat 5

235
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,380
was really Bazaar run would go home

236
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,850
can remember what it was but it would go
from our are head and

237
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,990
like I think the HP in 82

238
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,410
like a server room was back behind the
registration desk up there

239
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,709
and then from there went to I

240
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:29,310
cap 5.1 out the door around

241
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:33,180
down I one upped the the parking lot
area

242
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,829
and across the parking lot into the tent
and about

243
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:40,910
3:30 in the afternoon people say oh we
can't get on the internet and

244
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,240
in a tent Michael what do you want on

245
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,120
well the cable would heat up and would
start getting

246
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,330
huge loss because we're running well
over the

247
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,930
you know 300 feet distance I'm

248
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,989
so it's very frustrating very
frustrating for us to to

249
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,170
run networking all these rooms because
there wasn't an infrastructure

250
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,819
the Alexis Park when we got over to the
the Riviera

251
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,880
they had fiber rain between all the
closets most

252
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,550
most most most the closet there was one
closet that didn't have anything but

253
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,550
um we figured we got around that

254
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:19,020
it worked I'll and the fiber was a big
upgrade for us from the perspective that

255
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:22,000
now we could you give it on a backbone
and not have to worry about

256
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,880
you know stuff failing and and whatnot
fire catching on fire

257
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,310
yeah the cable heating up um

258
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:32,430
your thing so band with

259
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:37,020
I am remember what it basically couple
years ago

260
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,720
everybody got smart phones and decided
that

261
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,130
all I'm not use the WiFi see-sawed
asserted dip

262
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:47,490
users and then as everybody else got

263
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,610
phone that next year you you can decide

264
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,980
Ste a dip up because nobody use the 3G
network

265
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,170
in the hotel was like oh okay well
connect to wifi now because the wifi is

266
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:58,979
faster than

267
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,520
you know my 3G phone I and then people
start using mobile video

268
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,130
stuff like that so the band with
requirements kept going up and up yeah

269
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:11,380
knows the same time yeah we started
introducing W

270
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:15,750
wpa2 that people are more inclined to
use that word

271
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,120
rather than just being afraid yeah there
was this last year

272
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,570
yeah yeah we'll talk about them um he

273
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,680
no thing we have is device compatibility
there is a couple of

274
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,239
Android phones that wouldn't get on the
network and I think

275
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,520
the iPad wouldn't get on the network is
just weird stuff

276
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,490
on you don buddy Wednesday on ozone yeah
I could come up

277
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:41,700
do something and then went to sleep mode
and then just never came

278
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,010
you know network um user density is also
an issue

279
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,110
to get too many clients in one area
they're fighting for channel space

280
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,290
they're fighting for access

281
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,260
to the Act the peas and I mean is it
something you see in a lot of

282
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,870
conferences

283
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:59,950
yeah there's a lot of people in one
space our user base tend to have

284
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:04,780
a lot more devices wiring more than one
per person

285
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:10,439
yeah hopefully maybe rate I think we all
have computers train

286
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,990
and then reliability reliability is also
again you know kinda comes back to our

287
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,949
goals I've

288
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:18,040
hey this has to be reliable people have
to be able to get on the network people

289
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,178
have to be able to use it

290
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:23,890
they can't use that they're not gonna
trusted you not to come back to it

291
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:30,890
right

292
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,210
um

293
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,940
searched challenges continue time a

294
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,030
basically we have one week well we have
three days to complete the setup

295
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:48,970
we're I've where they're from Sunday up
before the con tu Monday after the con

296
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:52,100
at a minimum just from a perspective
that

297
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,600
Monday morning we hit the ground running
we get access to all our spaces

298
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,310
we kinda do a pre-deployment all our
gear redeploy the

299
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:02,320
though firewalls we deploy everything
that's

300
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,500
core infrastructure Tuesday we figure
out what rooms are gonna be wired up

301
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,280
and then basically patch all the stuff
and then Wednesday we test everything

302
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,580
30 we hope from there there's a lot of
issues that come up with that not only

303
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,240
on the

304
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,490
you know nothing ever works right first
time but also news we've had times even

305
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,550
if the referee

306
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,700
when rooms until Wednesday morning yeah
which is annoying

307
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,250
you know it may be patching at the last
minute hoping you could get

308
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,250
security guards escort you into these
you know into the idea of the MDS where

309
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:31,500
the

310
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:36,460
all the gear lives I'm me entry of the
Union personnel

311
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,470
take down the cables saws coordination

312
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,950
location um we typically

313
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,430
I think I would say it's about thirty
eight hours that we work

314
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:53,070
in the first three days so we took we
start at like eight or nine o'clock on a

315
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,970
Monday morning and were there till

316
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,300
you know para tener 11 yr 12 yr

317
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,600
one or two sometimes you know it depends
on how

318
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,750
organized everything is how how quickly
the setup going but

319
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:09,420
I'm had never thought accounting

320
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,580
is the Accord yeah goes on

321
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,330
need people come from across the country
that's another thing that kinda

322
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,639
coordinate schedules they are

323
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,800
many when you come in and yeah when when
you droppin

324
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:26,230
Canada so we have a the video guide
Derek

325
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,250
who does the DCT the deck on TV he
actually comes in from canada

326
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,360
I'm which has been a challenge from the
past because he's like

327
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,429
I I can ship your box because they're
gonna charge me for

328
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,790
what yeah so each

329
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:43,690
typically will either have one of us get
getting boxes or who go to frys when he

330
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,760
gets on Satan

331
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,740
pick up a cheap PC in that's what he
uses for them for con

332
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:53,100
I the team is kinda broken out to you

333
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,100
infrastructure wifi and video

334
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,100
a lot of us to jewel duties across all
that

335
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,149
so like management types might work on
the wifi or

336
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:07,350
or whatever arm and it does require

337
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:13,679
a bit of logistics and planning before
it slammed and that

338
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:19,650
the witches the logistics comes from the
fact that

339
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,830
being again we have to hand the stuff
after you remember

340
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:26,620
rate so either we have to have a she
documented with here's where access

341
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,610
points are going

342
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:31,770
or you know or something along those
lines so that

343
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:35,120
they then handed off to their home what
they call I doubt that

344
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,139
they're like Union rigors or something
that can climb up in the sea lanes

345
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,350
and you know put put up the access
points or something

346
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:47,000
so which is good because now I don't
have to play around in the ceiling

347
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,630
anymore

348
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,650
I'm although there was a catwalk at the
Riviera that

349
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,940
we had to go through an put access
points on

350
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:00,950
and do all sorts of fun stuff there but
heaney

351
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:04,580
spread so that the furloughs basically
all the lines are trying

352
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:09,470
directly to the firewall I'm you and
doesn't terminating where else we don't

353
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,010
have any

354
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:13,120
dynamic routing it's all static routes
on

355
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,370
and it's basically static routes through
the internet no okay

356
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:20,699
if you want to go someplace you have to
get the for all the go someplace I'm

357
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,730
this last year we actually did a FreeBSD
install

358
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,340
just based on fact that the S&P

359
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,740
in OpenBSD and also some other

360
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:34,060
then the packet drivers were also not be
maintained

361
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,280
or no essentially optimized for speed

362
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,370
we found it I think we will get a little
bit better performance of the FreeBSD

363
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,689
for all and

364
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,130
the networking components than we did
with an OpenBSD for all

365
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:49,550
on it was really very tough for me to to

366
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:53,210
make that decision I did not want to do
that I'm

367
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:56,540
I'm kinda paranoid as far as like rate
I'm gonna make sure that

368
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:00,100
whatever running has minimal services
and has

369
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,980
knows basically has locked down as it
can be rate I'm

370
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,500
I think we're at a hacker's conference

371
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,790
right right

372
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:14,030
yes I have to be an accident happened

373
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,290
would you think this is a clown show I
ended up in GJ

374
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:20,940
with yeah kaminsky one night and the
next morning

375
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,140
that's where did you take dan kaminsky
with you

376
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,380
no hair a way

377
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:33,090
a so prior to prior to last year was
obsd

378
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,459
every year I'll starting at Def Con 10

379
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:40,340
I think game

380
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,899
so it's easy the static routes you and
you have a 130 the UN's we

381
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:49,520
provisioned I'm fifty of them are
dedicated towards the

382
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,650
public wifi fifty of them are dedicated
towards the

383
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:57,110
wpa2 wifi I'm

384
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:01,290
and 30 are for all the other areas we
have out there

385
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:06,360
he any um

386
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,169
there's a table of doom and anyways for
this but basically

387
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:14,670
he wanna do some packet toms income up
in pick up the table dum dum

388
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:19,240
don't traffic from our our network with
USB important essentially up to that

389
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,700
I'm yet to pre-register with us you
can't just bring a box and say here you

390
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,500
go cuz

391
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,790
we kinda have to plan that base the help
with planning

392
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,409
you know if we have to buy equipment or
bring equipment so

393
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,550
on the wall sheep also gets a

394
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,649
SPAN port as well they get all the
unencrypted

395
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,810
open wifi and then the contests and a
few other

396
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:45,000
miscellaneous be lands I'm we kinda made
the decision that

397
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,820
you know if one if we're gonna make a
network available that has encryption on

398
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,370
it

399
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:53,770
and that is supposed to be secure then
we probably shouldn't span that over to

400
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,900
the wall she

401
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,940
I just made sense you know people are
gonna

402
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,250
for gun expect privacy and i won I want

403
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,630
people to be able to get on the network
having that same expectation

404
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:08,480
and if it goes over the wall she that
means that I can use it again

405
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,830
and and we actually ran into trouble
with that because there was a lot of

406
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,899
questions like

407
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,560
just not seeing that packet counts that
we expect in

408
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,389
you know finally do is allow to realize
it is with the use change

409
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,640
everyone it switched over to this your
network images

410
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,880
yancy nor no mean

411
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,880
very few people are using an intricate
wifi song

412
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,928
mmm got seashells

413
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:46,580
heyyy and macaroni any

414
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,720
so he's kinda the evolution

415
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,009
I'm this was obviously death comes 10

416
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:57,789
we had essentially to book PCs that we
purchased

417
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:01,870
and through I think it was to interface
is a huge

418
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:05,989
for a total of three in each box so we
had basically

419
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:09,539
for network segment a public

420
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:13,370
network segment to do network segment
private network segment

421
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:16,899
Anne I think there's one more but anyway

422
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:20,918
it baseball artist has the segmentation
segregation me

423
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,960
we also kinda plated of that we wanted

424
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,539
all the public traffic on one firewall
and all that semi-private some I trusted

425
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:30,009
on another fire also that

426
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:33,240
if the public for all got compromised
you know the

427
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,740
the private and the trusted stuff
wouldn't be compromised at the same time

428
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,549
arm and then

429
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:44,700
I yeah I don't think we've we didn't do
any dealings this year we basically

430
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,870
plugged it all into physical networking
gear

431
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:52,120
knows your IP

432
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,969
on year you

433
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,820
then I'm the next year I believe we went
on e-bay

434
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:05,580
her favorite place picked up with two
Dell 15 fifties

435
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,029
for pretty cheap basically put in

436
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:15,049
anybody remember that you have the
courage quite fast etheridge

437
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:19,230
from Sun power couple those stuck them
in boxes

438
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:24,159
and we had basically for or six
interfaces on each box

439
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,399
so 55 in five could be

440
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:30,469
segmented out on this year leave

441
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:35,250
I think we also had a couple loves which
is that we're

442
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:39,360
mean a Publix wage that was segmented
off with the lands and then we had a

443
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,699
couple other switches that were

444
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,840
segment it off with the lands so we're
an hour

445
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,110
we're moving it into the realm where we
didn't have enough year

446
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:51,330
to be able to support you know was it 12
network segments

447
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:54,539
rate so we kinda did the lines and it
worked

448
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:58,889
I'm and work quite well because now
we're able to create all these different

449
00:26:58,889 --> 00:26:59,279
neck

450
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,850
network segments at the bottom here and
keep people from

451
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:06,340
owning other other individuals across
the network

452
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:10,139
me

453
00:27:10,139 --> 00:27:13,860
Tom so then we continued on

454
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:18,418
I think we use the Dell 15 fifties for
two years they're kinda big boxes

455
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:22,559
you remember the Dell 15 fifties their
one-year yen

456
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,869
yeah law yes really long I know I'm

457
00:27:25,869 --> 00:27:29,529
readership those back to get yes buried

458
00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:33,580
button back ship that was several years
back and forth in

459
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,610
I think the second year we ship them the
box is finally gave out

460
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:39,979
I mean you know just a cardboard boxes
that you get from dollar whenever

461
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,019
but I'm right so it's the

462
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:46,500
loss was there next picture so

463
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,619
again a it's all going back to a Cisco

464
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:53,658
switch now we've now moved from multiple
switches to one switch because we're

465
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:54,200
kind of

466
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,740
we're getting a little bit comfortable
more comfortable with the fact that deal

467
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,250
and how

468
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:02,789
pop pop in attacks are not as prevalent
and the code has been patched

469
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:08,230
Appling I'm then the next year

470
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:12,350
I went to Ronnie OpenBSD and loaded up

471
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,918
got all for all voted on their and

472
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,679
can win the fight may have patch the
kernel to the most recent

473
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,850
recent Rev I can there is some sort of
an ipv6

474
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:26,740
issue in the kernel and it broke the the
Cross St thers

475
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,419
so here I am with but two boxes that

476
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:33,899
can't use you know that 8 interfaces

477
00:28:33,899 --> 00:28:37,869
but I was kinda shit bricks like no crap
what are we gonna do

478
00:28:37,869 --> 00:28:43,269
rate good

479
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:47,690
with are correctly unless it was in for
miscues not very meaner some

480
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,730
I mean that was yes I'm some reading on
this didn't even recognize the card

481
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,600
like it when he beat CD interfaces which
is very frustrating because

482
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,039
like clearly where you know I think
we're sentence up on a Monday we're

483
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:04,010
trying to get it going I'm like wide x
is not working it should just be working

484
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:07,519
arm so

485
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:10,700
as the car it's good revealing truck

486
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,179
created a beeline truck prophet the
backside of firewall

487
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:18,129
both those charge went into the the
central switch

488
00:29:18,129 --> 00:29:22,799
and you know lo and behold we now have
reduce the number of network connections

489
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,139
that we need and it's now all

490
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:27,899
virtualized essentially to the to the
firewall which

491
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:34,100
great I'm

492
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,360
so pretty much same I think

493
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,668
this year well I think we got a deft on
13

494
00:29:40,669 --> 00:29:44,870
seen Cassie this newland 102 132

495
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:49,580
that's what we kinda had slide engineer
a controller we didn't quite know what

496
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,260
we're going to do with it but that's how
we

497
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:56,070
service had set it up on next year we
had a little bit better idea of how

498
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,770
we're going to do that a remote
controller

499
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:01,040
on anybody know how those access points
work

500
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,610
there basically stupid you know they
don't have a

501
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:07,678
me to have an IP but it's on a
management network

502
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,210
and they basically get a load from the
controller

503
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,370
and they have a gr8 all so they take

504
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:18,000
Wireless frames pack them up throat
across to the the controller

505
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,340
and the controller actually does the
logic in a sec

506
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,590
to manage the wireless range arm

507
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:28,639
which is cool I think

508
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,690
got a slight the talks about that but
very

509
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:38,690
a 222 222 fun stuff

510
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:47,280
him so now move on to Def Con 14

511
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,830
is our first year at the Riviera we
actually had real-life

512
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:55,899
real life labor that we could use
essentially

513
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,240
our core switch rooms over here but

514
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,260
by that was at worry I'll

515
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:06,490
the kitchen yet with basically the
kitchen is back behind their

516
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,530
um we had switches

517
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:13,990
in this little bathroom idea but clearly
you walk in and there's a toilet

518
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:18,110
and then there's offense and then
there's the idea of so I was kinda

519
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,600
interesting

520
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,799
I think that good is for staff use only
but anyway

521
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,360
I'm we had a switch that was up

522
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,370
up in the catwalk the above the Royal
rock run a ballroom

523
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:34,229
me ads which is behind business center

524
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:38,750
and that would basically extend out the
wifi and anything else to this

525
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:42,299
the chiller areas but it was a this year

526
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:46,400
where that hearsay and then we had a
fiber run

527
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:52,289
went up to you are not no referring to
when it or not

528
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:55,559
I'm over here and then we had

529
00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:01,030
cat fines yeah catholics I think that
ran out to the rivers which that did get

530
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:01,440
a bit

531
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,600
out to the river and the reverse which
lived in the ceiling

532
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,500
I mean literally all the way out Center
the convention space

533
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,440
I'm just from the perspective that it
had all Power over Ethernet ports needed

534
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,039
for that

535
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,340
that density and you can see him

536
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:21,039
here's what I'm what the map looks like
for the access point density

537
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,700
so the river controller lived

538
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,770
kinda in the center this pavilion up
here

539
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:32,480
and basically power all those access
points up in the ceiling

540
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,510
weirdo really well from the perspective
that

541
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:39,158
you know we have to buy another peewee
injector peery switches that's the

542
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:39,720
hardest part

543
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,929
when you're doing all this stuff is no
we don't have any

544
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:46,470
endless budget to to buy stuff and

545
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:51,169
and has a was really the you know some
cables run up in the ceilings the is

546
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:54,409
and run power yeah what you do no power

547
00:32:54,409 --> 00:32:57,789
mean that's a whole nother Union right
on going to be

548
00:32:57,789 --> 00:33:04,789
Union anyway

549
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:14,610
and starts a six thousand

550
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:17,699
yeah that the little yeah little better
ones are good

551
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,330
so 87 the access points I'm

552
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:25,039
18 were eighties at DEFCON 14 that

553
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:29,710
28 he's now at Def Con A thi 18 and

554
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:34,480
foreign monitors at DEFCON 14 now right
10-year monitors at DEFCON 18

555
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,899
I so you know basically that if you've
worked with the river here

556
00:33:38,899 --> 00:33:42,189
and your monitor basically looks for
nasty traffic

557
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:45,990
works for things that are potentially
being you know man and middle that kinda

558
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,490
stuff

559
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:51,460
I and just general signal strength and
crosstalk between

560
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:54,639
the access points because they're
constantly adjusting

561
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:58,090
as they go along you know people move
into space

562
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:01,809
third time you know registering with the
axis data

563
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:05,830
it changes its signal strength as well
as much as on

564
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:09,149
to accommodate them and me

565
00:34:09,149 --> 00:34:14,578
so this year we had a upwards of 2,000
concurrent users on the network which is

566
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:18,139
the maximum I think we've ever seen on
the network at any one time

567
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:23,520
which is possible mean we we provide a
secure way for people to register

568
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,918
and then authenticate to the network and
it

569
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:30,098
it seems to be working out pretty well
so

570
00:34:30,099 --> 00:34:35,099
425 gigabits and turned 27 give it out

571
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:40,210
and mostly bit more yeah which I think
it

572
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:44,540
no no I don't know if we have that
quality service but if you use IRC

573
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:49,829
at Afcon you get like two percent of the
band with because by putting

574
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:53,669
quality service role anyway if the

575
00:34:53,668 --> 00:34:57,750
the poor use the park at 666 646 667

576
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,220
I think I've got both those in PF ok you
rules

577
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:06,689
on so again

578
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:10,150
you know it basically has to be
accessible public for

579
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,750
for WiFi requirements absolutely has to
be reliable

580
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:18,089
we you know if somebody's in an area
where they can't get

581
00:35:18,089 --> 00:35:21,380
chances are they're obviously I can be
able to use it so

582
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:26,869
we need to make sure that our coverage
is good right Tommy

583
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:32,020
we also want to protect the
infrastructure and protect the user's

584
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,119
so at DEFCON 18 obviously we prefer to
put up the

585
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,280
to BPA to which means that your have an
encrypted session between you and the

586
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:39,920
controller

587
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:46,920
on

588
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,940
and this is these are all the reasons
lights I feel bad because I'm like

589
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,119
trying to talk to Roman

590
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:57,240
I'm not the wifi guy be but

591
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,609
you know channel out allocation as a is
a

592
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:03,690
a definite issue from the perspective
that you've got all these access points

593
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,950
are saying the same area

594
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:08,339
there are going to see each other they
potentially could collide with each

595
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:08,880
other

596
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,510
by user density we kinda talked about
that at the beginning

597
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:16,000
that's also a big issue you know if you
get so many users an area

598
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,980
chances are that one's going to squash
the other roaming in mobility

599
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:25,670
so when a we started out

600
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,790
at I kinda had the the requirement that
okay

601
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:32,259
I'm a couple years ago well many years
ago

602
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:35,530
we have someone do DHCP pool exhaustion
attacks

603
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:39,920
you're basically had a perl script go
through and request all the leases

604
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,360
in a in a space be like actually we've

605
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,680
I you get a call high kick it on the
network can get on the network

606
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,609
go look at polices oh okay well when he
removed the

607
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,619
DCP dere try again um

608
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:57,480
or you know killin started again so

609
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,869
basically my my concept was alright
let's put up

610
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:04,310
30 the lands 30d lands with

611
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:07,930
you know like slash sixteens for from
these pools

612
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:11,500
so if you can't get online you shut down
your laptop

613
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:16,170
move you know 50c and start up your
laptop into being a different access

614
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,710
point and

615
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:21,900
the way these access points work is they
basically have a base deal an assigned

616
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,160
to each access point

617
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,830
so you come up in you see this access
point it's over your head

618
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,670
already you laptop does it it associates
with that access point

619
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:34,280
which has ballots that the UN wants is
tied to it

620
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,320
so now you get all these of appeal and
one which

621
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,450
you then roams with you throughout
conference

622
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:44,520
so do you as you move to other access
points that UN two switches to the

623
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,690
to the next access point now if another
user were coming in

624
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:50,980
you know save got access point three
over in the corner

625
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:54,600
and they see access point three there on
the land three

626
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,279
for all intents purposes net runs with
them as well on

627
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,490
just from the perspective that it's
someone's gonna de dos

628
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:06,060
you know one of those networks they have
to get on every access point and do that

629
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,990
right you have to walk through the
conference and trade associate with all

630
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:09,868
the access points

631
00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:13,700
in order to you de dos all other the TCP
leases

632
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,910
some extent and

633
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:20,430
in its owners things when you go into
the situation you know you not gon stop

634
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,089
everyone from doing everything

635
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:25,609
where you wanna Lisa bar such that it
his

636
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:28,710
there's an annoyance it's futile
hopefully rate

637
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:33,410
me whenever it's not like we're actually
trying to

638
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:36,950
do anything really cool release lie it's
just

639
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:40,500
yet just enough so that people though I
guess it's really not

640
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,369
there's not much to a point because I'm
only a docile one access point

641
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:44,140
throughout

642
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:48,230
from conference when there's you know 28
more that we need to go to

643
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:51,510
parents to do

644
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:56,070
00 minimize risks to the infrastructure
I am basically when you

645
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,230
connect up to the and we've been doing
this for I thinks

646
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:03,650
what's up that I think would be we've
been basically disallowing

647
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:07,050
peer to peer ever since we started it so
if you're on a

648
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:10,790
wireless network I the unencrypted
network you still can't talk to each

649
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,540
other you can only go out to the
Internet

650
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,630
and then now with the wpa2 network
you're on that network key

651
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:20,390
same thing you can only talk about the
Internet know the other parties inside

652
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,740
that wpa2 network can talk to each other

653
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:27,200
any traffic that's going to be routed
pass to go up to the firewall for all

654
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,830
has to make the decision whether or not
to

655
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:33,480
allow it out so only basically put rules
and that's a

656
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,830
your wireless client he can go off the
internet that's it can't go

657
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:39,890
to any other control networks unless we
say so

658
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:43,940
so these couple public networks that I
mean couple public servers like the

659
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,359
investor invoke info certain in public
services that

660
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:50,549
we publish the same good with a

661
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:54,810
pacific this a diff --git August 15
migration

662
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:58,090
registration yeah the registration
server which is available external and

663
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:58,680
internal

664
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:03,339
so so you can register for a user name
password for the the EPA to network

665
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:07,660
talked a little bit about

666
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:12,850
device compatibility downloads for sheep

667
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:17,799
for your sheets in self there's the rub

668
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,270
so this is a the river actually mounted
in the ceiling with zip ties

669
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:26,060
hung way up in the ceiling and although

670
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,470
the access point essentially connected
up to it which I mean it's kind of a

671
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,319
pain cuz I think there are a couple
times when we just like

672
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,330
shit I gotta go out there now home

673
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:39,000
you know I'm so you gotta go get the AV
guy get the new guy

674
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,410
and they bring out and push up on the
left

675
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:46,170
you plug in the council cable on Oakley
managed system

676
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:50,400
Sol in the powerful like I was actually
run

677
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,590
as well as the the network for was run
from them now yes we had a big ass

678
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,410
extension cords running out for

679
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:00,240
yeah 150 for texting to gift for
extension cord

680
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,620
and then they took these cables out
every year which is really knowing

681
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:08,740
but has anybody ever heard of Fire
Marshal

682
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:12,459
you remember how I think it was def on
14 Howard

683
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:15,550
two and a half hours late opening has
for Marshall

684
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:18,640
yeah so with

685
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,940
I think they left these cables and their
one year

686
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,570
and then the next year we came back
there right now we had a porno for

687
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,109
Marshall's coming

688
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:29,319
for sorry you know and have them

689
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:36,320
Rhino run brand new cables again

690
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,359
I

691
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:42,729
and again this is wpa2 for out the

692
00:41:42,729 --> 00:41:46,979
wifi stuff I'm blocking our user
communication that's what I was talking

693
00:41:46,979 --> 00:41:47,839
about as far as

694
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:52,499
we don't allow peer to peer traffic
proper use of the land in subnets

695
00:41:52,499 --> 00:41:56,589
kinda helps reduce some the risks how
everything is

696
00:41:56,589 --> 00:42:00,558
it was a big thing for us I mean we only
had another or

697
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,729
or one switch the power most to the AP's

698
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:07,069
and then where can I go well we gotta
get some some switches

699
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:11,579
I we got a Lexus which a cheap ass
twinks switch

700
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:16,199
for are a 500 bucks or something and the
management interfaces

701
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:21,089
atrocious the web page you have to like
wait for it to refresh and click

702
00:42:21,089 --> 00:42:24,509
wait for Japan just yeah it's deeds junk

703
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:30,079
I'm and would only power I think twelve
the access point even was a 24-port

704
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,089
switch 11 11 a.m. 11 yessir

705
00:42:33,089 --> 00:42:37,119
we're running in 15 months and they
would do yeah

706
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,289
Susie plugged in the the last one it
would power cycle and

707
00:42:40,289 --> 00:42:43,939
yeah just like traced so

708
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:48,638
were planning to we actually played by
five new power over Ethernet

709
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:52,449
switches this year because we don't have
the luxury of

710
00:42:52,449 --> 00:42:55,449
kinda trying to do jerry rig stuff we

711
00:42:55,449 --> 00:42:58,849
in basically we have at the

712
00:42:58,849 --> 00:43:03,449
the Rio we have a lotta closets that
this Tuscan have to go into

713
00:43:03,449 --> 00:43:06,909
cell yeah and me especially being the
first year 30

714
00:43:06,909 --> 00:43:10,769
we don't have a good idea exactly where
everything is

715
00:43:10,769 --> 00:43:15,129
sometimes the floor plan isn't even
finalize you know

716
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:18,939
period period yet yeah spose been rasmi

717
00:43:18,939 --> 00:43:23,279
but there's also some way with IPS stuff
that goes into it

718
00:43:23,279 --> 00:43:26,539
I'm I think but

719
00:43:26,539 --> 00:43:30,839
detecting you know man middle attacks
and

720
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:34,859
subverting them I'm couple years ago

721
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:38,339
this is that the Alexis Park many years
ago I'm

722
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:41,919
there is a wifi networking contest it
goes like putting in the hell or

723
00:43:41,919 --> 00:43:42,519
something

724
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:47,658
the people were running and apparently
there

725
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:51,079
their contest kept failing like the
access point just stopped working

726
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:55,759
and I think by the end of the con- they
came back in

727
00:43:55,759 --> 00:43:59,429
were kinda talking with us and like yeah
we we can't let this go on

728
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:03,599
so we just shut it down like all with
that this

729
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:07,389
access point yeah oh yeah we just tossed
it

730
00:44:07,389 --> 00:44:11,209
in Retiro GP I

731
00:44:11,209 --> 00:44:14,249
they like I'll

732
00:44:14,249 --> 00:44:18,948
K and so I mean we do have the power to
do that with the air monitors that

733
00:44:18,949 --> 00:44:22,130
that's pretty nice you just say kill
done

734
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:25,380
no matter how much you bring the problem
where you

735
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:29,589
more access point yeah nothing we're
challenging

736
00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:32,969
again making it harder

737
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:37,289
menaces own for watches breaking in

738
00:44:37,289 --> 00:44:40,539
it's cancelled all right

739
00:44:40,539 --> 00:44:44,579
at yep the morning

740
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:47,979
not anymore thinks it's real

741
00:44:47,979 --> 00:44:52,609
alright so

742
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:55,619
future plus conclusion right up

743
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:59,269
new hotel Rios gonna rock I mean
basically I

744
00:44:59,269 --> 00:45:02,799
we wanted a pre Connor in March this
year and you can fit

745
00:45:02,799 --> 00:45:06,149
all the convention space inside of the
Rio

746
00:45:06,149 --> 00:45:10,109
and have a lot more room so that's gonna
be really really nice

747
00:45:10,109 --> 00:45:13,259
hopefully that means no more waiting in
lines hopefully means

748
00:45:13,259 --> 00:45:17,029
more more room or more seats in a room
the gathering lines

749
00:45:17,029 --> 00:45:21,349
yep better lives all I'm

750
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:24,749
mortgage exhibits the record that edging
avenge

751
00:45:24,749 --> 00:45:27,859
see go to your vendor and he said it's a
night game to bed

752
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:32,098
or give it go you know whenever to give
it interfaces he say could you give its

753
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:36,269
after while catches on and they start
saying it

754
00:45:36,269 --> 00:45:40,638
get to give its yes we want the one with
mortgage you give it

755
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:45,169
you have the wifi as it prints money

756
00:45:45,169 --> 00:45:48,769
i wanted to have my horny

757
00:45:48,769 --> 00:45:51,808
iPhone 4 away when anyway don't care

758
00:45:51,809 --> 00:45:56,249
I don't care more addresses obviously
we're

759
00:45:56,249 --> 00:46:00,488
you know we have to have more address
spaces are you 96

760
00:46:00,489 --> 00:46:04,559
yeah we're going on six yeah we had over
got some things that the river

761
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:07,650
yeah we have to do with anything
firmware upgrades

762
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:11,759
the rhythm did all yeah it is

763
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:15,299
me is very easy on that Williams

764
00:46:15,299 --> 00:46:18,969
vision figures are names yeah

765
00:46:18,969 --> 00:46:24,079
there's we witches yeah holding up signs
that on a budget you know

766
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,719
switch Israel you know regardless
government

767
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:32,959
word yet since yes is the news releases

768
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:36,138
so I will hazard ins

769
00:46:36,139 --> 00:46:39,429
a used

770
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:43,759
K minutes and controls to be put in
place promising minor

771
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:47,909
for which is absolutely no yet you there

772
00:46:47,909 --> 00:46:52,289
yeah just money matters and put up their
ideas and just see what happens

773
00:46:52,289 --> 00:46:55,679
home Yap

774
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:59,380
you'd like yeah money you have no time
to tune in and

775
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:03,479
good luck yeah I would we had I'm oh
he's an ex

776
00:47:03,479 --> 00:47:06,729
was working for a company we had access
to add your one-year

777
00:47:06,729 --> 00:47:11,729
that was supposed to like do some sort
of inline packing houses or something

778
00:47:11,729 --> 00:47:15,388
and within about 15 minutes after being
on re like okay turn it off its

779
00:47:15,389 --> 00:47:19,279
blocking all traffic so got removed very
quickly

780
00:47:19,279 --> 00:47:23,959
I'm no it was blocking everything

781
00:47:23,959 --> 00:47:27,649
it wasn't doing his job here yes more
secure if you can't get out the internet

782
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:29,269
wait a minute

783
00:47:29,269 --> 00:47:32,848
yeah that's that whole you know
confidentiality or no

784
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:36,339
costs security and usability it's not
usable

785
00:47:36,339 --> 00:47:40,749
had very effective anyway I

786
00:47:40,749 --> 00:47:44,249
locking week we do have a syslog server
that we like stuff too hopefully we'll

787
00:47:44,249 --> 00:47:44,808
have

788
00:47:44,809 --> 00:47:48,009
some more locking I I think I might
bring and

789
00:47:48,009 --> 00:47:51,059
wanna Trustwave a

790
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:54,699
sins that we have I i've been promised
one of those

791
00:47:54,699 --> 00:47:57,919
soul and a lackey I'm

792
00:47:57,919 --> 00:48:02,259
and Mira and we're trying to think
there's some ways it's actually

793
00:48:02,259 --> 00:48:05,949
miss sending some is only gonna mislead
the the table you more

794
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:10,380
cheaper there for people be packing
houses but yeah he wanted

795
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,769
start doing stuff along lines that all
right you can

796
00:48:13,769 --> 00:48:16,988
you can listen to ours is like
trafficker you can listen to you

797
00:48:16,989 --> 00:48:20,219
you know someone the any in the IDS
reports that comes

798
00:48:20,219 --> 00:48:23,319
you want to see this likely so

799
00:48:23,319 --> 00:48:26,999
you know you haven't gone through in a
talk about it happens frida

800
00:48:26,999 --> 00:48:30,999
find this welcome to ideas Def Con
networking .org

801
00:48:30,999 --> 00:48:35,118
is in sight we you know if there's any
updates for announcements about the

802
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:35,869
network

803
00:48:35,869 --> 00:48:38,959
generally up there okay we're doing this
or

804
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:42,589
WPA doesn't work or this is how you get
your iPhone to work for

805
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:46,159
whatever we've had a postings to that
serve the people know how to

806
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:49,179
how to do stuff on the network arm

807
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:52,299
and then EQ day book

808
00:48:52,299 --> 00:48:56,009
his photos are all throughout this
presentation great job

809
00:48:56,009 --> 00:49:00,689
and effort as well I think he did the
one up on the scissors left

810
00:49:00,689 --> 00:49:05,538
but anyway use

811
00:49:05,539 --> 00:49:09,130
fun stuff cue you

812
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:12,259
so you guys have any questions

813
00:49:12,259 --> 00:49:16,339
when we're of the times the a walk
through our

814
00:49:16,339 --> 00:49:19,409
you know whatever you need to at the Rio
star

815
00:49:19,409 --> 00:49:22,709
yeah I did you actually how actually did
you did you actually get to

816
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:25,808
go through all the closets did you get
to see where things in me or is it

817
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:27,049
mostly paper

818
00:49:27,049 --> 00:49:30,739
and so the walkthrough um

819
00:49:30,739 --> 00:49:34,429
you would've been nice if they had paper
with all the stuff because then we could

820
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:37,959
have pointed to it like okay we got up
with stuff here and here and here

821
00:49:37,959 --> 00:49:42,379
I unfortunately they like it I'm yeah
well we have this so

822
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,619
you know building layout oh okay

823
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:50,109
where what goes where well you we just
know that hoskin

824
00:49:50,109 --> 00:49:53,150
there's no such thing as an as bill and

825
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:57,789
yet doesn't exist so we did literally
walk through all the closets that we

826
00:49:57,789 --> 00:49:59,089
would potentially be using

827
00:49:59,089 --> 00:50:02,609
like oh okay we can put equipment in
here you put equipment in here

828
00:50:02,609 --> 00:50:06,598
here's this block a fiber that goes
somewhere and hopefully we can

829
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:10,339
look it up I think it goes back to their
head in which they didn't wanna show us

830
00:50:10,339 --> 00:50:16,308
sold in the river in your life

831
00:50:16,309 --> 00:50:20,329
no yeah there are more sophisticated as
for ya yeah because they've got

832
00:50:20,329 --> 00:50:23,349
Labor Day every closet every area Salt
Lake

833
00:50:23,349 --> 00:50:27,880
the Rio is broken up into multiple areas
I think as they

834
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,140
yes expanded maybe I don't yeah

835
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:35,449
as so they've yeah they've got a new for
a new space and an old space the old

836
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:38,169
space is closer to the centre the hotel
the new spaces

837
00:50:38,169 --> 00:50:41,848
further out and like the wiring closets
Arcana

838
00:50:41,849 --> 00:50:46,789
weird but we'll figure it out
relationship

839
00:50:46,789 --> 00:50:50,059
with they are for the reviving a slim

840
00:50:50,059 --> 00:50:54,130
the at the Rio you have their IP people
freaking out her

841
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:57,519
so that the questions you know with we
did though the trust

842
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:01,368
relationship and reputation with the
Riviera is the real gonna be the same

843
00:51:01,369 --> 00:51:02,130
way

844
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:06,759
on well it it's in our resume in our
contract they can have to be nice

845
00:51:06,759 --> 00:51:09,890
you know I mean if they're not nice
we're gonna say well

846
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:13,489
you guys have to reduce your price or no
change something or whatever

847
00:51:13,489 --> 00:51:16,630
its contractual obligation that the
network is part of that

848
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:20,319
arm and and I think I think they're
going to be good

849
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:23,979
you know we've we when sat down with
them they're very amicable to

850
00:51:23,979 --> 00:51:27,209
all the stuff that we're talking about
they weren't like I'm not going to do

851
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:27,739
that

852
00:51:27,739 --> 00:51:31,009
you know i i think to some degree
they're kinda relieved that we bring in

853
00:51:31,009 --> 00:51:31,259
our

854
00:51:31,249 --> 00:51:34,799
our own network because then that means
the AA they don't have to manage it

855
00:51:34,799 --> 00:51:38,169
and be there are two worry about
crosstalk you know if

856
00:51:38,169 --> 00:51:41,259
if it were their own network equipment
they may have to worry about something

857
00:51:41,259 --> 00:51:44,499
right right now left the focus on India

858
00:51:44,499 --> 00:51:48,209
guestrooms in the and their public
spaces

859
00:51:48,209 --> 00:51:52,229
%um we were about whom we've got to talk
about the CTV

860
00:51:52,229 --> 00:51:55,239
yes so also in our contract

861
00:51:55,239 --> 00:51:58,809
we basically said we want a hotel
channel

862
00:51:58,809 --> 00:52:02,630
or actually won four of them so

863
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:07,039
that's what we're doing and I'll be idea
yes right that hard and work on the ad

864
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:10,819
the head and couldn't do high def we
negotiated yet

865
00:52:10,819 --> 00:52:13,919
but so we're gonna broadcast the talks
in all rooms that's our goal

866
00:52:13,919 --> 00:52:17,209
just like the Lexus parked so

867
00:52:17,209 --> 00:52:20,948
I'll probably be on the pay-per-view
because we kinda

868
00:52:20,949 --> 00:52:24,449
you know there's bosley other people
hotel or something you know

869
00:52:24,449 --> 00:52:27,640
we since we can actually get yet

870
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,699
television rating on Def Con

871
00:52:30,699 --> 00:52:34,170
fairly if we did we'd probably one

872
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:38,080
may NC-seventeen yeah you know those
people danced around the stage

873
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,870
anyway yeahh thats just be an hour

874
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:45,370
so yeah we're gonna TV channels back
which is good

875
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:52,370
other questions

876
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:57,160
I hear her are you need something but
here it's over

877
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:01,759
I don't know that the EP seventies will
do the five gig starts and I don't have

878
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,390
enough

879
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:07,650
the when the firmware doesn't do that
the front we have we're actually

880
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:11,850
we r in the process of figuring out what
the cost of the support licenses so we

881
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:13,750
can upgrade the firmware on the
controller

882
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:19,090
and then we can see if we can do that by
getting art

883
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:23,990
be by hers times back power

884
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:28,029
I hope okay you

885
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:32,450
the desktop fold

886
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:35,919
yes said

887
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,890
I he said

888
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:42,819
okay me who believed

889
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:45,940
me 5 eating 5 will be five years

890
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,089
so 0 you might hear messages okay

891
00:53:49,089 --> 00:53:52,460
will back up averted for

892
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:55,740
cool me for you

893
00:53:55,740 --> 00:54:00,319
yeah 44 he's yet the fire

894
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,530
yeah never trust you byron hood

895
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:08,430
yeah it might be weird you yeah I think
it would be

896
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:12,589
I think we've got SLE one and you were
even

897
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:16,230
125 I think yet a little little guys

898
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:20,500
Ono yes only another 1.5

899
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,990
no eighties yes said

900
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:28,790
they're like little biscuits some anyway
with

901
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:32,000
with you know influence on buying
decisions a lot of corporate networks

902
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,500
oh yeah absolutely you know and any time
I talk about

903
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,520
stuff I've done I'm pentasa done

904
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,520
architecture reviews a at you know I
love the Cisco here versus the river

905
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,380
here hands down this is good here just

906
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:48,920
doesn't work right the river here just
works

907
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:52,830
you know as far as like detecting rogue
access points for detecting

908
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:57,040
attacks I'm there if there's much more
sophisticated and Cisco gear

909
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,430
it's a pain in the ass to manage the
Cisco gear as in my opinion

910
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:03,910
but you know that's what happens when
you just bike by companies and try to

911
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:07,430
