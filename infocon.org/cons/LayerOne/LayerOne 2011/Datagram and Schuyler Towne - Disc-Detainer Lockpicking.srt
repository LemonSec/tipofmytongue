do who

31
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,200

34
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:51,579
little its fully owned my own Lexmark's

35
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,900
are

36
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,010
okay so I I would normally gives an
introduction

37
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,489
but a datagram this is Skyler I'm if
you'd like to know where u Pixar

38
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:06,489
I talk I we're going to

39
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:10,190
this detail which are a very particular

40
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,970
type a block I'm they were gonna talk
about how the different how the better

41
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:14,840
how they're worse

42
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,650
arm and the reason I think both of us
wanted to do this talk is cuz

43
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,320
we focus a lot on the pin number seven
years

44
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,329
and and you know when when we go to
other countries we go anyway

45
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:31,530
can really use the same stuff we do and
just to dinners are slowly in

46
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,010
getting more and more popular around the
world I'm because

47
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,298
a lot of the companies that make them
make specifically high-security just two

48
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:38,810
teams

49
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,690
I'm and in Asia the companies that make
this detainers make

50
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,829
the worst of his ever but they also
question that we are

51
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:51,579
be the least expensive locks ever and in
places where nobody wants to

52
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:54,709
afford a walk that's more than one euro
this is what they buy

53
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:57,940
Andrew we're seeing a time have the

54
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,750
we're seeing it on the yeah can emit 0
Lake

55
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,170
not very good but passable locks pouring
into the country right now

56
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,480
we'll talk a little bit of bike locks
later on rye well and we're

57
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,480
I don't know I'd say we're on the verge
of another Big Ten

58
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,750
situation with my kryptonite as other
brands because

59
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,399
nobody's actually moving to a new
generation I love they're not very

60
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,549
good walks right get so

61
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,950
up the main thing is is only one way yes

62
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:30,700
okay I water just it we just kept
getting close hand

63
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,070
water just interlock so the channel
locks are a specific type a lock

64
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,700
mechanism so a lot you have on your
doors are probably pin tumbler locks

65
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,060
which means these pains

66
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,220
to prevent you from rotating the plug
before you have

67
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,260
the cranky inserted or obviously
lockpicking all that other stuff combo

68
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,800
lawsuit with the crack key

69
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,880
and so distant is a very visually
distinct just from looking at your tech

70
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,530
crazy lock

71
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:58,640
and so the majority a bomb are mishap
circle thing like in the center

72
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,909
but there's also the more exotic
varieties such as on the left

73
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,960
actually if you look and the game room
the game room has nothing but

74
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,469
I just a tener padlocks and if you look
at the vending machines further down the

75
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,830
hall they have nothing but just in a
padlock swell

76
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,750
excuse me a cylinders built into the
machine so

77
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,450
to blame the way this started was
actually very also a lot of people

78
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,200
assume that anything that's not a pin to
lock

79
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,539
I must be new right that's not true so
these

80
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:32,000
a are pretty close to about 1 pin number
started become popular which is late

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,330
eighteen hundreds so the first person to

82
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,550
I invented just a tener as we know it
today

83
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,979
is this a.m your hendrickson and he
founded a company called ABLOY

84
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:46,580
which is now 1 I've I the biggest la
companies in the world beyond

85
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,880
everybody yeah happen

86
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,940
and so here's some examples the early
Apple iPad locks they look very

87
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,900
different than the padlocks we use

88
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,520
army as well obviously the keys in cuba
is a very different and so here's

89
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,740
example some keys and so the general
concept behind this to 10 or locks is

90
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,840
that instead of raising components

91
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,349
like mostar are common American locks we
wrote a components

92
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:12,719
and when all the components rotated in
the proper

93
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,890
position then the walk now open

94
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,200
and so here you can see the way they
accomplish this is by putting

95
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,640
angled cuts on the key and when you turn
it obviously

96
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,669
the components will stop a specific
position depending on

97
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:29,210
the angle so here's an example

98
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:32,270
a all the disks and components inside

99
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:38,490
NAIA a distant a lock here's an example
have all the discs inside

100
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,860
and CC each desk has

101
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,620
or keyhole cutout some them have the
support have

102
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,599
and all of them have the sole cut over
on the side in a car is what tells us

103
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:54,990
tells the lock when it's properly routed
I

104
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,120
to prevent picking all of these locks
will have all skates so

105
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,320
you know obviously if they're if they're
nothing but correct Gates who would be

106
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,870
considerably easier to just

107
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,700
try everything at the Philip click into
place and then you know that discuss

108
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,669
entrance by so

109
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:12,250
most if not all a serious distant and
manufactures will include some form a

110
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,370
false case to

111
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,599
deter this custom and one other things

112
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:19,960
that is the the main reason that's I am

113
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,450
just locks are becoming more popular is
because they don't use a pin mechanism

114
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:27,669
and as as a result tonight using a pen
mechanism that can be bumped

115
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:31,200
and everybody you know in our way of
looking at things

116
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,550
we go low bumping was a big problems I
wanna lock can be bumped

117
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:37,229
so this will not be bombs but that
doesn't necessarily mean that you're

118
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:38,700
buying the block

119
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,080
so I think of it in terms I love in all
our computer security stuff we all look

120
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,830
in just one specific attack and then say
well as long as I'm

121
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:49,479
protected from that I'm fine you have to
look I was in the big picture

122
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:52,539
I O is sOooo have is actually function
so

123
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:56,719
I this is an Eveleigh classic style disc

124
00:07:56,719 --> 00:08:00,940
you have your open half moon which is
your key hole this shameful correspond

125
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,460
to the

126
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,570
shape on the awsome

127
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,770
was gonna pass many thanks mediums ago

128
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:13,029
I am so yeah we've even happen kilo
which corresponds to the shape of the

129
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,779
key

130
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:18,649
I you have your true gate the gate being
what a sidebar which you'll see a second

131
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:21,169
going to drop into you and your Tabares
stopper

132
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:27,339
I'm which is going to an online thing
newsletter rotation and there's a

133
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:31,419
your zero discharge will see in a couple
seconds here have a specific purpose but

134
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:36,380
okay Paso you your sidebar the sidebar
the locks is between the plug in the

135
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,939
lock in my house on the block

136
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,899
this is what's preventing the plug from
turning this is what's preventing

137
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:42,580
anything from turning at all

138
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:47,029
now the sidebar wants to go into the
gate let others do it so

139
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:50,080
when you are misaligned here

140
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,800
the cyber can't wait go in as a result
the plug & roti

141
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,380
blah blah here with the proper p.m.

142
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,240
and rotated to the proper angle was a
market dropping a place in the whole

143
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,200
season concerned really

144
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,480
okay words hope their play in

145
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,370
do dude been

146
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,649
Mac again you do whatever cut

147
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:18,430
I am difficult decisions then

148
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:22,469
you know I never open that on this
laptop

149
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,529
in I mean I feel like

150
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:29,430
we couldn have given a better talk to
them

151
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,209
still Walker talk anyway now so good

152
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:37,449
okay so here it is so this is the name
is plus or looking at the concept is

153
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,950
exactly the same

154
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:43,610
I was recently learning how to use
Blender I'd really like it I recommended

155
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,720
I'm anyway see your Kia Motors the
different angles came to the key

156
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,700
the angle cut into the key corresponds
directly in with the

157
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,480
number of degrees out from center BD is

158
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,430
was just double ball mechanism inside
the padlock

159
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,760
the law mechanisms are awesome they're
perfectly should improve

160
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,990
but nothing to do with this team's right
here comes the important part

161
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,050
let's look inside so the reason

162
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:14,079
that've I'm yeah awesome were eight
there

163
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,300
alright so the reason that the sidebar
pushes itself into the discs whatsoever

164
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,469
is if you look rate here

165
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:28,130
this large piece of metal is actually
protruding from the plug

166
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,269
when this 0 desk in this case the disk
back here and there's another discredit

167
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:33,260
the front

168
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:37,529
when these are fully rotated by the key
they actually collide with that tab

169
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:41,120
beginning to put a turning pressure on
the plug itself

170
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,820
by putting a turning pressure on the
plug that then transfers that pressure

171
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,100
to the sidebar

172
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,610
and as you'll see you right now the
sidebar is mounted in an angled

173
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,830
chamber and soul wants to slide out in
that chamber

174
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:57,899
into the gates if they're available to
it

175
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,560
in

176
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,739
yes done there's chaim their

177
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,920
science their gun II passed around a
couple different as two tenors they're

178
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,740
all made by Apple I am now basically
work

179
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,180
on be at the same principle there's a
minor differences

180
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,620
in the that the way that each at the
things I passed around works

181
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,030
but they're basically the same

182
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:27,780
to make sense you are welcome to tell us
if it doesn't

183
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,530
okay straight through just let it go

184
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:38,530
no problem

185
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:45,380
it is yes you that resource will be at
the end of this

186
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:50,930
metzger's pretty directional microphone
there's min man im good im good

187
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:56,689
but

188
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,940
to at least train coming 10 been in
there they're watching there much in a

189
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,690
good

190
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:07,050
you guys good pppppp shop

191
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:10,880
who'd

192
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:17,880
mmm

193
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,900
so feel free to ask us questions we're
very open to

194
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:27,510
what

195
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:34,180
wallets told mechanical means moving
every this has nothing to do with it

196
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,969
doesn't drop in its four-step

197
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:39,610
correcting the sidebar

198
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,130
the sidebars force10 every time we try
and turn it together it tries to push it

199
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:48,120
just like when you try and turn the key
on a pin number lock it tries to move

200
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,780
but if there's anything blocking can
going in the right position

201
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,980
where'd where'd okay

202
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,680
so here's some examples a different

203
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,140
sidebars for different models and
they're all pretty much the same thing

204
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,110
is just

205
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:07,020
a barber that interfaces with the gate
on each dis

206
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,400
I'm and the only real reason for variety

207
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,610
is I'm one is sort of security so for
example you can see the difference

208
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,620
between the one on

209
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,420
the laptop and what bonham I'm so the
reason they change this and the reason

210
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,229
it has a hook

211
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:24,190
in future designs this is the applicant
Pasig on the top left and this is I

212
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,100
believe the appli-

213
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,880
just talk which is the later model are
the reason they did this was because

214
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,320
if you don't have that little hook you
can just drill a small hole in the face

215
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:32,920
block

216
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,130
and take the sidebar out and then
there's nothing preventing you from

217
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:36,800
Rokan

218
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,839
the the cylinder and %uh I'm walking the
walk

219
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,150
so adding subtle hook you have to draw
all the way through

220
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,160
and and that could be harder depending
on you know

221
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,500
up a steal steel desks to make a
hardened real and so on

222
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,150
I so here's an example of a

223
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:57,050
Ablett profile this is it with the
sidebar in the sauntered

224
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:01,339
this is the sidebar removed and all the
disks are misaligned

225
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,090
so you can see there some fall skate
summer and the true gates

226
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:08,510
but obviously the side was not gonna be
able to attract with all these mixed up

227
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:08,970
like that

228
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,440
and hears them all correctly aligned so
they they try that nice little pocket

229
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,650
for the sidebar to fall into

230
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,930
I'm

231
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,620
so 10 questions is okay well that's
really cool I get home works

232
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,760
I'm I get wires kids I

233
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,200
you can bump it and I can see how it
might be

234
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,050
different a pic on behalf what if I have
like a large

235
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,439
institution I wanna master kisses
several approaches I'm in the photo the

236
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,720
main thing they do is they just add
extra cuts

237
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,650
so this would be you know I don't know
the actual numbers but say this is a two

238
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,870
guy and a three-time

239
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,100
and so either those would work depending
on the rotation

240
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,800
on what they can also do which is
slightly worse just make a really long

241
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,520
day

242
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,819
and the reason that slightly worse is
because this little did break here will

243
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,320
actually prevent the side marker
tracking fully

244
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,790
if there's another them because it's
slightly higher so it

245
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:03,849
you know it is different but it's just
an example

246
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,740
I'm this cut out here if you're
wondering what that is and on the fourth

247
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,540
one as well

248
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,760
that little extra shape is so that
trying to move this with

249
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,150
manipulation tools will be more
difficult because you have less room to

250
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,860
grab onto

251
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,370
and there's actually a funny story I

252
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,840
I didn't bring the tool because it
shames me to look at it but that there's

253
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,780
a company that makes

254
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,050
a pic for the ABLOY classic

255
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,599
and it's it's the and bronze padlock
being passed around

256
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,650
I'm and these are desks from that and so

257
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:40,420
the reason it sucks is because they
didn't account for these desks which

258
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,300
very much every

259
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:47,490
block ever I'm and so the tools like one
millimeter half a millimeter too short

260
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,720
10 pick up these discs that have the
anti manipulation feature

261
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,910
which I find hilarious because it's one
of the basic fundamental features a lock

262
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:58,329
and you know for some reason they just
didn't account for that

263
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:02,540
we have some photos up picking tools and
whatnot once included later so you can

264
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,520
see what it looks like

265
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,350
I'm and then there there's other
variations so that was the basic and now

266
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:08,840
they

267
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,010
they add more to it so I was next idea
it was to add warning

268
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:16,720
to the keys so if you if you remember
the previous lot just had the half

269
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,200
circle

270
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,230
and so they give you a pretty good range
movement with

271
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:26,230
manipulation tools to try and pick the
lock and so they started adding profiles

272
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:26,920
in

273
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,939
a anything past the classic model and
they can do pretty extensive warning so

274
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,030
not only can they do you

275
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,310
morning that's the full-length the
Keyblade but they don't make also new

276
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,040
warning that's just in the back

277
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,520
or in the middle of the lock and the way
that they do that is that as you're

278
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,579
inserting the Kia passing through

279
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,870
each of these these cute key holes on
each day s

280
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:50,220
and somewhere further in the back the
keyhole will have

281
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,850
I reduced area so your key has to match
the whole

282
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:57,540
farther back in as you can see some
examples here like such as this third

283
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,040
one

284
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,689
has a partial aback Q-eight cuts aims
here

285
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:06,110
tim is here and so there's a lot of
variation even though it's such a simple

286
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:11,679
concept and here's some better pictures
so this is a falling for

287
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,370
here's just in the back and this on the
bottom has no warning

288
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:19,939
on this site at least

289
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:24,070
the next talk to blame a tan and really
like it it might sound funny that we

290
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:27,139
just talk about however an hour but
they're really the company that may be

291
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,050
lost popular

292
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,919
and remain that have the keep yeah an
end really the only reason other

293
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,780
companies make these is because I was so
successful

294
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:39,020
so it was kinda funny zappa lawyers you
know a hundred years ahead of everybody

295
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:43,270
right now everybody else is making disc
just blocks are kinda

296
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,570
catching up and all this although they
start to resemble the more modern

297
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,350
tabloid

298
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:52,709
yeah it's painful how many of them just
resemble that same exact 1907 model

299
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,150
without any invaded very very competent
iterations the tablet made over the

300
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:57,530
years

301
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:02,540
William but this is the dislike pro I I
believe the one main feature of this

302
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,800
was that this was the first tabloid that
you can turn both ways to unlock so you

303
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,860
can have a lock and unlock feature

304
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,399
the early ones don't do that because
that you know if you TriMet it the other

305
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,070
way

306
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:16,980
then that the gates on each disc or not
the right position CFD account for both

307
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,770
rotations

308
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:21,000
still very few are able to do that damn

309
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,540
and so here's an example and here's the
dis- they look pretty much the same with

310
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,159
a slightly different

311
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,340
on to talk about washers I've Nadia

312
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:34,709
so there's these are the desks and then
these are the washers and the reason

313
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,840
there's washers

314
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,629
is because you have this big stack up
discs and when you put your key and try

315
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,190
and turn you don't want

316
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:45,520
discs to be stuck together and then your
key cut picks up two discs and pushes it

317
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,560
too far too short so there's washers in
between every desk

318
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,830
in a disc lock to ensure that each key
cut only picks up

319
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:57,010
a single this so here's an example again
upon

320
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:02,810
discs aligned I this is actually one
locksets getting passed around

321
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,440
similar again what this added this the
Amway

322
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,040
exact I am they added this dimple

323
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,139
and so what they found was what you can
do an earlier models is

324
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,410
you can insert the key partially and
then try and turn all the way

325
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,550
and that's obviously not much want for
normal use and it also

326
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,980
slightly helps against manipulation
because you don't want them to be able

327
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,460
to test discs

328
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,920
without having whatever it is although
inserted as well as accommodating for

329
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,590
this

330
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:31,040
so it's not a big security features more
reusability feature but it does have

331
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,320
implications for later models

332
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,730
so here's an example though this those
discs and again

333
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:42,340
they're they're all very similar these
can also turn both ways to person

334
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:47,570
I am and the way that be key retention
mechanism works is that it's just these

335
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:48,970
little pieces

336
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,990
and wage rancher Nikki it tries to push
and and it

337
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,490
there's you know and he's partially
inserted there should be material there

338
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,530
which will not allow this to retract
which will in turn not allowing the

339
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,170
soldier turned

340
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,300
so Boozer those are going straight into
that dimple

341
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:07,720
allowing them to retract im I'm so
passive element if you've just remove

342
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,950
that section from a key that you made

343
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,480
it would still fall into place it is
just looking for a lack of material at

344
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,550
that point mickey

345
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:18,500
I and the other thing is that he's up
from the just talk on

346
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,060
that what he's also reversible see you
can insert it in either orientation was

347
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,200
obviously not the case

348
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,180
nap circle the not actually not no
longer the newest but they're they're

349
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,570
most well-known currently

350
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,750
is the Ablett protec and this is what's
used on vending machines

351
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,300
over in the hallway and yes

352
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,450
it's a very strange looking at why
particular event it is a project

353
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,890
I'm and these are pretty interesting how
they work

354
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,490
so they look very similar to all the
other stuff we looked at me say they

355
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,040
have two temples

356
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:56,050
I am and the me dis themself looks much
more intimidating but they're

357
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,540
essentially the same thing

358
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:02,710
I am out what really is interesting as
they also have this

359
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:06,200
this dis iraqi retaining mechanism

360
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,160
I these ball bearings in this i think is
it takes a little bit less space

361
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,910
it's probably cheaper nom same idea as
the exact

362
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:18,090
but what's very special is that they
have what's called the disc

363
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,310
locking systems and talk about or

364
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,889
home have a car like this is not like me
this is the part that you should talk

365
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:25,870
about them

366
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:30,149
when %uh up but leave a VM

367
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:34,430
you want to talk about it first go ahead

368
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:38,180
so the weather just walkin system works
is that and

369
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:43,050
in an ideal lock you're not allowed to
test discs individually when I sit asses

370
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,110
you're not allowed to

371
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:48,060
manipulated just individually to find
where the correct position it's

372
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:52,620
you guys out obviously know how any keys
work and when you pick up into lock

373
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:56,010
that's what you do is your testing each
can stack individually and setting them

374
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,000
individually and then you open a walk

375
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
you know how many view have ever used up
into virtual were you

376
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,230
you raise everything at once it's called
the key

377
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,590
so you've all used it but it's not the
same thing the

378
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:11,760
I'm so the way that the protect works
that has these serrations on the bottoms

379
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,890
up the desks

380
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:17,120
booty over here I as well as these to
return mars

381
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,379
and so what happens is you insert your
key and you turn in as you start turning

382
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,590
at a certain point

383
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:27,050
these bars will lock up into these
serrations on the bottom each desk

384
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:30,240
which will in turn keep them in place

385
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,270
King and so at that point then they can
touch the sidebar and see if they're in

386
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,040
the correct position

387
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,580
so it's its the idea that it makes it
considerably harder to manipulate

388
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:43,120
because now you have to move everything
together and that makes it much more

389
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,860
time consuming to try and pick the lock
is you know when we pick a locking okay

390
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,909
in a move this year filled with this
year feels consider you enact

391
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,930
you have to move everything at once the
correct position that's considerably

392
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:53,790
more difficult

393
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:57,860
separating tension from manipulation of
the time where is the holy grail of

394
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,530
making a mechanical lock

395
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:03,910
what we've been doing sense the eighteen
thirties

396
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:08,220
is called the tentative method replied
tension to the tumblers a plate direct

397
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,170
forced to those

398
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:12,970
and then we manipulate each one of them
individually to feel how they react

399
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,800
what ABLOY have succeeded in doing is
make sure that we cannot

400
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,360
applied tension to then test what we
feel from the cylinder

401
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,189
as the moment the you apply that force
you can no longer manipulate the

402
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:28,560
the individual tumblers and you can
manipulate individual time where as bad

403
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,770
as you manipulate them

404
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:33,530
you can feel nothing because you can
apply any forced to the sidebar

405
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:36,600
I'm so the big maybe hit this holy grail
moment

406
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,399
yeah and and even know that desk house
as a holy grail

407
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,990
its in the ideal it's it's the future is
what we want to have is this sort of

408
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,880
thing because it makes so many things
more difficult

409
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,350
I it's not perfect there's been problems
with it not

410
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:54,320
in the past few years for example
there's a specific model

411
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,370
love the padlock with Ablett protects
where the

412
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:00,959
desk in the front would have enough for
the whole the you could put a wire and

413
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,480
indirectly tension the actual sidebar

414
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,980
overcoming this I'm so there's no
problem with that

415
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:11,550
and you know it's not perfect but its so
far its exceptional

416
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:15,100
considering all the other just block dis
locks on the market

417
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,659
thus a bbm a

418
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,750
on them yeah

419
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:25,990
to yep

420
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:29,010
okay this is going to get there from
some my

421
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:32,490
protect marketing for injection I see
this is just the lock

422
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:37,770
in its assembly

423
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:41,860
ok been technically advanced
construction

424
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,550
possible return writer that locking bars
here actually made his locks

425
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,560
a lot easier to assemble their
predecessors to you

426
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,030
big not only dramatically advance the
security blocked me tomorrow I'm is

427
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,320
really mean to you

428
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,270
and don't forget there's some discs and
in and gave us earlier

429
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,910
news is that the model you

430
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,950
okay this next bit is actually kinda
cool because the yeah

431
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:08,080
interior the radiative the

432
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,389
have the key because I'm a key actually
manipulate to different sections

433
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:15,650
I'll the desks so the number one cuts my
number two cats

434
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:22,650
operate on this exterior service

435
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:27,050
who whereas 336

436
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,919
X has been a little bit further and
you're gonna see six in a second year

437
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,670
six actually just avoiding any
interaction whatsoever

438
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:38,060
down the lower right corner

439
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:42,678
because the sex is directly aligned to
decide where to begin

440
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:48,610
oh and lastly is just an animation those
walking by as you can see them in action

441
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:52,250
yep thank you

442
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,390
if you guys wanna see a I slightly
better representation on this

443
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:00,070
9 gonna delays amazing King dot com

444
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:04,919
on A's a friend of ours who has made
very very nice

445
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,400
three models at this you can see all the
different parts working together

446
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,780
and they're all about Iran's website so
the amazing teen

447
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,950
dot com book that's gone her

448
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,120
are there any questions about the
project employed Center in

449
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:25,580
if you're about to dive into attacks on
other stuff

450
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:31,330
yeah ok are except the a first-class his
class and some other just to relax where

451
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:34,620
been a pet project mind most don't last
year

452
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,699
I'm some

453
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,710
nothing too crazy about them we look at
the model the earlier

454
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,910
I'm the word that says housing is
because the safe love you for giving

455
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:44,540
back

456
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:48,600
on as I was saying earlier the angles
Kentucky correspond directly to the nth

457
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,199
degree

458
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,770
have the gate along the exterior of the
desk I am so you have your 0 just in

459
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,100
your profile desk

460
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,110
will be at opposite ends of the a

461
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:03,129
plug I both of which are going to put
pressure directly on the sidebar being

462
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:03,970
termed by the

463
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:08,760
uncut portion above the key this was the
video you watched earlier down this

464
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,730
putting in slightly different territory

465
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:14,970
okay I am 0 up but between them

466
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:18,440
besides Deepika God om so

467
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,600
most loss we talk about my column up
they're very specific to you

468
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,909
door hardware or padlocks I

469
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,800
there's one walk in particular that's
very interesting pastor yep

470
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,649
Jim yeah he called me a his

471
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:37,320
I'm 1 lakh that's very interesting is
the love our 2200

472
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,590
and it's made specifically for safes and
vaults I'm

473
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:45,189
we're passing on around now it's kinda
funny is that this key

474
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:48,580
is actually the small ski you can buy
and and

475
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:52,830
this is I believe the 8-inch and it goes
up to something ridiculous like two feet

476
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,879
and so the reason for that is good
obviously have the law inside the the

477
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,710
ball

478
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:01,030
and you put your janky through and then
eventually the typically gets the lock

479
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:04,740
and then you can actually turn and I'm
we had one

480
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:09,540
we have one of picking a village but the
giant he's having a removable Ted

481
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:13,350
so that when you the final minute
drinking

482
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:17,139
obviously you don't care I'm to fuck in
your pocket might be slightly

483
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,290
primitive I'm so what they have is it

484
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:23,440
tip that you can remove you keep the tip
in your pocket because thats

485
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,580
the important part and you just keep the
long Kieron

486
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,010
you know in the storage closet next to
the water or whatever

487
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:33,600
I'm funny story about that there was a a

488
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,790
a story that's very famous now that the
book flawless is written about this big

489
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:43,250
diamond heist and for and the cards were
super lazy and left the two for key

490
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,679
just in the closet with the tape
attached

491
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:49,870
same I don't know that it was this
particular lock but there there's

492
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:54,310
you know variations on a theme in that
was fun part sacred

493
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:58,620
so this is actually very similar it's
sorta a hybrid love the distillers we've

494
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,820
been talking about

495
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,810
and standard combination safe box and
again we have

496
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,639
standard commission say blocks in
lockpicking village like to learn more

497
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,679
about them

498
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,590
they're made explicitly to fit into that
footprint

499
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:16,678
7 so it slightly different we have all
our desks

500
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:20,730
and me this portion here and then we
have this big arm

501
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:24,270
that goes in Germany feels the same role
as a cyber there's also some additional

502
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,780
security mechanisms such as this

503
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:30,010
PC rosary locker but if the back is
knocked off then don't the Loch Shin

504
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:34,879
lockup here's a picture out the key and
it's essentially the same thing

505
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,380
we just have a slightly different like
cuts and that translates to

506
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,410
different positioning of the desks when
you rotate the key

507
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:47,280
here the dis- themselves as well as the
washers between each other

508
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,139
you see their little bit different they
also have this cut out here as well as

509
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,040
some polls

510
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,050
so there's two reasons for this: the
cut-out down at the bottom is for

511
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,110
reaching

512
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:58,649
the cut outs in the top part to
distribute weight evenly along the desk

513
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,890
so problem with traditional safe locks

514
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:05,420
is I'm in like pre-world War to date
find

515
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,740
like I if you're on a a big boat for the
navy

516
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,770
locks which is kinda open with and they
couldn't figure out why for a long time

517
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,320
what happened was just the National
vibration the ship

518
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,530
would slowly rotate all these discs in
the

519
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:22,139
the combination lock and it would
eventually hope Inc they'd eventually

520
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,420
all go to the right position which is

521
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,730
putting all the gates up yes the Middle
East material was facing up and if

522
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,340
you're locking bar was directly
vertically above it

523
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:35,659
yeah so now all modern I say Fox do this
to distribute weight evenly on which

524
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:39,620
disc the rekeying is very cool all
you're actually doing is slightly

525
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,429
polling that arm back

526
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:45,430
which allows the inner wheel to rotate
around the outer disk

527
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:48,930
changing the position at that gate
relative to how the key interacts with

528
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,420
them

529
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,690
this fall also uses false case of course

530
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:58,130
they go unlike that other distant as
these go around the entire

531
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:01,340
diameter there that whatever

532
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,899
the caller on the desk I'm and then
there's obviously a single

533
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,940
since that's how one single issue
conference come

534
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,060
said I'm and so beside that

535
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:15,070
there's a million shitty ribs now

536
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:19,340
pass around a city rebuff yeah and
they're mostly they're mostly asian maid

537
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:23,110
I'm again I said this because of what
they and their shelves

538
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:27,479
I gave each row one so

539
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,580
okay so there's a lot of these and
pretty much if they're not

540
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:35,360
these couple grams we talked about
they're probably really really bad

541
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,110
and so the reason I really bad out
without pictures eyes because typically

542
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,510
they don't use false case

543
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:43,530
they don't use any sorta key retention

544
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:46,950
a any of the features we talked about
except having the Esks

545
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:50,890
they probably don't use which makes them
very bad music very bad tolerances Welsh

546
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,480
like about him

547
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,740
I'm so I what's up next doing

548
00:31:56,740 --> 00:32:00,040
the broken picture the Birkenstock so

549
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:04,060
there's a funny story we had friends in
Malaysia and ask our friends

550
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,850
and they this the Solex lock here

551
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,969
and and variants have it are just
everywhere

552
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,450
and they went to a locksmith task you
know hey how would you how would you

553
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,230
open one in these

554
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:18,120
because you know they're their lockers
in 10 it up and they wanna me local

555
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,280
locksmiths

556
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,720
I and a locksmith just kinda laughed and
pulled out an Allen wrench

557
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,330
and he says well you just put it in and
then he turned really hard

558
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:30,919
and they sent me some movies that that
had been open this way essentially they

559
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,330
just

560
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:35,480
force the sidebar into the brass and the
desks and make a gate

561
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:40,050
what and it looks really funny if you
look on my website there's there's some

562
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:43,139
photos at this this defense sidebar with
all these all matches:

563
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,460
forced into it I'm and that's apparently
considered legitimate

564
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:51,410
attacking in Asia's care and allen
wrench in open when everyone

565
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:54,540
higher security locks in fall into the
same problems yeah

566
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,700
it's considerably harder with some the
other stuff we've talked about but

567
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,080
because these obviously a slightly
better material slightly better

568
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,230
tolerance is something fishy in
particular

569
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:06,360
yes yet I'm so now let's talk about ways

570
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,800
that we can open these law word and has
a slight

571
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:15,149
process I don't do these a lot you don't
know or have permission to pick

572
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:18,850
not so mmm the first question is what do
you use

573
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:22,360
because you know you gonna walk ignored
you see the the strips a metal that uses

574
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,110
pics

575
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:26,490
to open the paint on the locks in wafer
locks and warlocks are all fairly

576
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:27,440
similar

577
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,990
but these watches very specific tools
and the reason for that is because

578
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:35,410
there's a DS in a lock that provides
tension

579
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:38,600
as well as the discs you want to move
into position to open it

580
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,870
so you need to be doing two things at
once and in

581
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:46,030
interlocking lockpicking we accomplish
this with a a separate tension tool

582
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,700
but because the way the key works for
can't really do that

583
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,890
and because retention against a
component we have to have this kind of

584
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:54,840
2011 school

585
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,370
it's very similar to lever locks which
are in order to block

586
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:02,179
thats are popular in certain parts to
europe and so essentially

587
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,880
what it is is just the pic is a
combination I have a tensioner

588
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,260
and something to manipulate each each
Jess

589
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:13,820
and Dave very quite a bit because the
the positioning of where you have to

590
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,230
tensions on some watching a detention

591
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:20,300
that the disc right at the front and
some locking in detention the desk all

592
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,280
the way in the back

593
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,629
and some somewhere in the middle yeah as
those in a real dick locks

594
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:28,060
yeah that and so here is

595
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:32,429
a photo of a pin a pic for the Avis bus
which she had if so

596
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:35,639
which we'll be picking a belief I'm

597
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:39,120
and scalable time or cost I

598
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:43,100
okay so again in his place as one might
have projects a lot last year

599
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:47,210
I yeah go figure lean good friend of
hers Finnish guy

600
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,520
I as they say in rally car racing if you
want to win higher if im

601
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,810
hmm good for is OK address the nation
version Medicine do and actually there's

602
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:59,330
even next version is angel sitting at
that table

603
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,950
I'm not gonna ask you has ran because
it's the only 1i know the country them

604
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:07,560
I home buy it is I I father is the
ugliest thing I've ever seen him but it

605
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,410
feels amazing like acne

606
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:13,140
okay so the really important thing about
he goes to is that it isn't just the two

607
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,650
in one picture doesn't just apply
tension

608
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,890
and then manipulated to the individual
tumblers

609
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:23,000
those markings also let you know

610
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,490
exactly at it let's you did hold block
as you're picking at

611
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:32,720
so by aligning be long straight line on
the barrel there to be individual marks

612
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,450
hashed around the

613
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:38,290
the section on the left the online that
they

614
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:42,880
the one who when they lie and you know
that you are on the in this case third

615
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,140
position you've turned this to what
would correspond to a number three cut

616
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:50,210
on the key and bats reveal its at all

617
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:54,120
you jot that down so by the end when you
open up a lot not only if you open the

618
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,759
lock

619
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,980
but you also have the code to reproduce
a key

620
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,970
an Avis doesn't include their keys
whatsoever see you can request a key cut

621
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:05,750
just by giving them the direct billing
email mail it to you I am

622
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:09,640
which I did with many local seems names
and I usually called

623
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,759
I I'm additional aim the

624
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,250
castration is running I around the man
don't let you know what disc you are

625
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,350
working on any given time

626
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:22,880
and I'll I think almost most importantly

627
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,300
in order to help you differentiate
between the fall skates and the true

628
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,500
gates

629
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,720
using the amount of movement that you
get

630
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,770
this piece year with the hash marks is
the part that's turning when you're

631
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,810
manipulating the wafers

632
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:41,850
watching the amount of movement that you
get when you are locked into in GATE

633
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:45,370
will tell you if you are in a false gate
because you will not be able to move

634
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,540
very far

635
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,870
already trying gate where you'll get a
significant amount of freedom and

636
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,520
movement inside and out lock

637
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,259
because the tolerance in the travelgate
is much more open and tolerant

638
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:58,270
the fall skates and it's one of the
easiest ways to tell if you're caught up

639
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,660
in a mosque a tertiary gate

640
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,920
which can be a real bastard otherwise
I'm so you can use those marks to

641
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,660
indicate yourself

642
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:09,170
you know where you were here and we're
working on

643
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:13,780
I'm additionally you can now if you're
if you're getting kind of not being able

644
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,040
to figure out what do you not know

645
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,580
whether you're in a fall skater a true
gay we know a lot about locks when we

646
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,680
approached them you know what

647
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,069
lot about individual brands like to be
bitten tumblers be the distillers

648
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:25,319
whatever the case may be

649
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:29,980
we know about amos's van the

650
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:35,319
true gates are mirrored by false gates

651
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:39,660
to and three positions away from
themselves

652
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,850
now that may not seem amazing yet but
when you take that information

653
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,750
across Egypt the discs that you're going
to be working on you can dramatically

654
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,069
reduce the total key space

655
00:37:49,069 --> 00:37:53,140
as you're creating a church for yourself
that describes the code block as you're

656
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,920
picking

657
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,640
on these are all the small tools that we
can use to accurately and quickly open

658
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,350
this lock

659
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:02,000
and determine the key codes we can
produce a key in open it for

660
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,350
I'm Geico me to really nice too old for
this

661
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:08,470
really specific

662
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:11,959
okay and I really importantly when it
comes to being distant unlocks

663
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:17,900
I am what I wouldn't I was saying
earlier about be on

664
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,980
about though washers is incredibly
important

665
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:25,510
in the ABS plastic and several others as
one apply to every lock the work on

666
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:29,170
but that hit this tool is very very thin

667
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:32,520
and that's because when you overlay one
way for

668
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,050
her sorry one disc over another you can
just proceed

669
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:40,160
into the next desk they're blocking each
other now

670
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,290
however by their very nature the spacers
in purple there have to be completely

671
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,540
open

672
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,170
they have to be completely open
completely stationary so if we build the

673
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,240
Temple Bar pick to be is been

674
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,200
as the one as the washer as that spacer

675
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,160
were able to push just into the spacer
and then rotate freely in that space

676
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,589
aligning ourselves to the opening up the
next desk within push

677
00:39:04,589 --> 00:39:08,700
into that mess next disc said it and so
on and so forth

678
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:15,700
I believe this will yen

679
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,609
so

680
00:39:25,609 --> 00:39:29,558
the you think your portion is turning
just a friend 0 disc which will start

681
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:31,029
applying pressure to sidebar

682
00:39:31,029 --> 00:39:35,679
now watch the been tipped as it moves
forward

683
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:40,890
yeah sets and desk

684
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:45,308
moves forward into the spacer turns
freely to align the next is

685
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:48,329
use forward sense that desk

686
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:53,339
terms in a spacer et cetera et cetera so
the spacers have to be there to allow

687
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:55,619
the discs not to interact with one
another will

688
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:59,319
during normal use the lock but that is
the feature that we use

689
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:02,519
to allow us to move through manipulate
aged the individual disks

690
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:07,279
in the lock and

691
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:11,189
there's it opens along

692
00:40:11,189 --> 00:40:18,189
misspent I am Marion

693
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:21,799
okay I'll the

694
00:40:21,799 --> 00:40:26,390
yea cuz story with a bus actually
started with a really cool attack for

695
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,390
the Avis plus

696
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:31,288
he eventually built this tool the eva's
pick and decoder jewel

697
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:35,619
as a response to Gerhard Mack back to
present the 80 S corporation

698
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:39,779
the reason he has been named the No and
then hit the reason the news in contact

699
00:40:39,779 --> 00:40:43,130
with Paul Gerhardt to begin with was
because a mess

700
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:46,169
now it's a little breaks you can't quite
see what's going on I'm even larger

701
00:40:46,169 --> 00:40:48,419
vendors yell at you action

702
00:40:48,419 --> 00:40:52,259
okay so when he got discovered poland
are

703
00:40:52,259 --> 00:40:56,229
year

704
00:40:56,229 --> 00:41:02,649
weird

705
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:06,400
we corresponding he

706
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,409
now they were peacing out where they
were

707
00:41:09,409 --> 00:41:14,329
facing toward BM toward the user you can
just program and look at it

708
00:41:14,329 --> 00:41:17,859
but if you apply a tacky substance

709
00:41:17,859 --> 00:41:21,299
push past the disc you wanted to
impression

710
00:41:21,299 --> 00:41:26,640
turn 90 degrees in poll backward when
one this was overlaid over another 90

711
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,469
degrees you can still get just enough so
that number

712
00:41:29,469 --> 00:41:32,559
the when you hold your tacky abusive
whatever out

713
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:36,239
you would see clearly the impression
that number and be able to decode the

714
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:37,380
lock just by

715
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:42,239
looking behind the desks it was awesome
yes

716
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:47,119
yeah I'm sowwy a co I with myself and
the guy named Michel Euler was able to

717
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,439
get in touch with the

718
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:53,178
it is corporation I'm you human meeh
Michel Euler was the

719
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:57,449
the main point of contact I met a lot of
work to make that happen I'm gerhardt

720
00:41:57,449 --> 00:42:01,919
said good work very good that we will
get rid of the stamp desks

721
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:06,429
I'm so on their own factory line now you
get mixed cylinders were some dust will

722
00:42:06,429 --> 00:42:09,529
be stamped some discs won't because they
probably had them

723
00:42:09,529 --> 00:42:13,159
you know millions of the stamp this they
were just going to ask them I'm but you

724
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:13,769
can only earn

725
00:42:13,769 --> 00:42:17,729
use this attack to fully open or Dakota
lock however

726
00:42:17,729 --> 00:42:21,259
he also sent me a Kobe meets maritime

727
00:42:21,259 --> 00:42:24,449
the nobody's clapping with you give it a
lot

728
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:28,549
all I'm dicks I

729
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:34,589
I'm using a coastal I but I'll should
you ever have a working this 10 good

730
00:42:34,589 --> 00:42:37,699
actually use other 3d animation you can
see the live video Jim

731
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:40,909
yet 3d animations helped okay I am

732
00:42:40,909 --> 00:42:45,839
so I so get hurt actually sent Diego a
lot without a key

733
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:50,029
up the new mix Ellender and said if you
can send me back

734
00:42:50,029 --> 00:42:53,659
the bidding which is the combination of
cuts you can send me back to the

735
00:42:53,659 --> 00:42:56,059
building I will send you the key is in
this will be your trophy

736
00:42:56,059 --> 00:42:59,309
and so Geico invented this tool

737
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:03,479
and decoded the lock wrote the whole
thing down. send it back to me received

738
00:43:03,479 --> 00:43:04,058
the keys

739
00:43:04,059 --> 00:43:07,909
is one of my favorite stories from 2009
only I was

740
00:43:07,909 --> 00:43:11,259
in okay so

741
00:43:11,259 --> 00:43:15,569
I'm I'd ever has but the company name I
don't have them but this is the

742
00:43:15,569 --> 00:43:21,319
have a classic pic I think stocks
because I'm they also make a neighbor's

743
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:22,529
plus tool which is

744
00:43:22,529 --> 00:43:27,029
fairly similar to yeah it was too
although in the photo this is a back

745
00:43:27,029 --> 00:43:27,939
tension lock

746
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:31,839
as you can see by the the tension is
very large that wouldn't be able to fit

747
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:32,709
between our desks

748
00:43:32,709 --> 00:43:37,009
as missus you know it's weird %um you
can tension on the profile if you want

749
00:43:37,009 --> 00:43:37,819
to but thats

750
00:43:37,819 --> 00:43:42,538
yeah this is different yet I'm says the
opposite wave tension in from

751
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:46,499
from a coastal by the public very
similar they also have the scales for

752
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:51,569
for decoding and knowing which disc
you're working with this is

753
00:43:51,569 --> 00:43:56,219
a talk about Fisher of 42 pics on my
favorite I am sOooo

754
00:43:56,219 --> 00:44:00,939
reported to be herbal paste when okay
I'm sued to block a leg

755
00:44:00,939 --> 00:44:05,109
just a lock for automobiles who've seen
very little innovation appears to be

756
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:06,229
very easy to open

757
00:44:06,229 --> 00:44:09,499
I'm but with this does what I love about
this tool

758
00:44:09,499 --> 00:44:14,019
is that each the heads are connected
directly to each of those

759
00:44:14,019 --> 00:44:17,988
I little from a thingies

760
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:21,109
all words I don't take exams Minister

761
00:44:21,109 --> 00:44:24,709
basically you can manipulate every disk
unlocker once

762
00:44:24,709 --> 00:44:28,658
without having to move anything you push
on one of those you manipulate the desk

763
00:44:28,659 --> 00:44:31,449
associated with that it runs through the
whole thing

764
00:44:31,449 --> 00:44:34,979
and it's very cool to watch people use
because they kinda like slap it on one

765
00:44:34,979 --> 00:44:38,828
side slab to the other side window
around a little bit and loving opens up

766
00:44:38,829 --> 00:44:40,779
and it's amazing and they may have the

767
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:44,019
mckeon can reproduce and everything is
very cool tool I love it a lot

768
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:47,799
and I like most about it is that I think
that it could lead to brute forcing to

769
00:44:47,799 --> 00:44:49,849
all the way up in most american bike
locks

770
00:44:49,849 --> 00:44:55,589
im probably under three minutes lot more
about that Sep

771
00:44:55,589 --> 00:44:58,828
that's you I I'm

772
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:03,529
so when we get locked talks I hope you
realize that

773
00:45:03,529 --> 00:45:07,599
despite are international fame and
acclaim and all that that were mostly

774
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,219
just two assholes

775
00:45:09,219 --> 00:45:13,619
on stage there and I'm was rapping for
that six

776
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:16,709
are I there are

777
00:45:16,709 --> 00:45:20,719
ate lots government level 20 stopping
these locks and the reason for that is

778
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:23,159
because they are government level locks

779
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:26,439
a lotta governments use these locks for
very important stuff

780
00:45:26,439 --> 00:45:29,649
arm and so obviously there's Associated
market

781
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:34,279
for making tools that will open them I
these are some very cryptic photos

782
00:45:34,279 --> 00:45:38,499
I'm difference I opening and decoding
tools made by

783
00:45:38,499 --> 00:45:41,959
a company called false its securities
from the UK they make

784
00:45:41,959 --> 00:45:45,029
a lot of tools not just just tools but
I'm

785
00:45:45,029 --> 00:45:48,259
a lot of different tools for a lot of
different amazing locks

786
00:45:48,259 --> 00:45:51,749
I'm and you say seemed mostly they're
very similar

787
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:55,538
I'm mostly is also come out come with
what's called a makeup key

788
00:45:55,539 --> 00:45:59,309
which will talk about in a in a moment I
believe bill clinton's

789
00:45:59,309 --> 00:46:04,069
to stop okay that's why I'm and wanna
make a key is that

790
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:07,269
if you pick the lock that's great but
what if you want a pic again

791
00:46:07,269 --> 00:46:10,198
and it took an hour and a half the first
time or you don't wanna said they're

792
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:11,609
picking again for an hour nap

793
00:46:11,609 --> 00:46:15,679
so you use these tools to code lock and
then instead have

794
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:18,869
making a real key you might not have the
time to go back to do that

795
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:21,679
his keys are taking the time to water
them or whatever your so what you have

796
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:22,150
is a

797
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:26,209
a tool that has all the different key
cut possibilities and you

798
00:46:26,209 --> 00:46:30,158
basically assemble a key your sample the
key to whatever beating you want

799
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:33,219
and then you can use that as a a a fakey

800
00:46:33,219 --> 00:46:37,029
but it also solves like essentially you
know obviously keys are just pieces of

801
00:46:37,029 --> 00:46:38,689
metal that move other pieces metal

802
00:46:38,689 --> 00:46:44,069
in the in the right places test old open
in Iraq is the key we love making keys

803
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:48,359
the Lagarde that we passed around also
has a commercially made

804
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:53,319
tool made by Lotfi technology I may see
its very fancy but essentially the same

805
00:46:53,319 --> 00:46:53,999
thing

806
00:46:53,999 --> 00:46:57,319
where it's just the picking and as well
as a tensioner

807
00:46:57,319 --> 00:47:00,729
I'm and they also have the scale to
decode

808
00:47:00,729 --> 00:47:04,408
like if I was in Dec and had shipped
datagram

809
00:47:04,409 --> 00:47:08,369
cutaway a month ago when I told him I
would he was gonna build tools

810
00:47:08,369 --> 00:47:14,339
I'm batsman 2013 baby yeah

811
00:47:14,339 --> 00:47:18,659
yeah cool okay so I'm last layer 1 this
actually this

812
00:47:18,659 --> 00:47:21,929
this photo is from companies Angeles
there one

813
00:47:21,929 --> 00:47:25,130
very brief story about last year when I
should've meyers was we staying with a

814
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:28,349
friend in a way for three days to catch
up an old friend from school

815
00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:32,709
heey when I arrived said although I'm
not in the state sorry I totally forgot

816
00:47:32,709 --> 00:47:36,669
I am a ride to the rental car company
they gave me a convertible for no extra

817
00:47:36,669 --> 00:47:39,859
money because I was really late May
didn't have my car and they're very nice

818
00:47:39,859 --> 00:47:43,519
and so will read after layer 1 at the
gate Instagram for any legs and it was

819
00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:44,508
there is anything

820
00:47:44,509 --> 00:47:47,589
I got Matt convertible and I drove the
circumference California

821
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:50,828
and it was the best road trip ever taken
away yeah

822
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:55,839
will sell yeah but the plan the whole
time some guy in the mirror of Patel

823
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:00,069
really cool guy was hanging out in some
higher see channel talking to people

824
00:48:00,069 --> 00:48:01,619
about the fact that he started

825
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:04,959
Rep wrapped introducing he is virtually
complex at

826
00:48:04,959 --> 00:48:09,658
box somebody in this random IRC channels
is all you need to tell scale a town

827
00:48:09,659 --> 00:48:11,170
about that

828
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:15,959
so he sends me an email to use icy moon
waco fantastic he's in the Bay Area as

829
00:48:15,959 --> 00:48:19,769
in LA at the time is like ok cool I'm

837
00:48:43,749 --> 00:48:46,928
to be a really cute movie actually
recommend is really good

838
00:48:46,929 --> 00:48:50,639
like orphans and interested in getting
these anyway I'm

839
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:55,509
set up a few I also sorry there's
nothing to live I had when I should

840
00:48:55,509 --> 00:48:59,329
do drinking buddies my my local bar in
Boston happen to live with them

841
00:48:59,329 --> 00:49:04,459
ten-year-old okay so we II should I say
hey this is fantastic i love you I love

842
00:49:04,459 --> 00:49:04,939
you

843
00:49:04,939 --> 00:49:08,678
wonderful non-locking herds that say hey
twenty-something blocks

844
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:12,679
every damn wanna be u solves for quick
set in slaying

845
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:16,819
we don't need you to solve for quick
said usually quintessential Ingersoll

846
00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:21,689
were if you look at it he but I can say
treated could sentence leaky use

847
00:49:21,689 --> 00:49:24,808
this would be a good call me every day
care community beautiful photographs

848
00:49:24,809 --> 00:49:25,909
that he's on the Internet

849
00:49:25,909 --> 00:49:30,179
and all I wanna do is mail their keys to
them and say oh you've got some beauty

850
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:33,670
anyway on I have a folder on my laptop
just called Crydom

851
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:37,519
where I is sushi people's key is with
their Google Maps lighthouse

852
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:42,089
on anyway I hung you know those being
recorded

853
00:49:42,089 --> 00:49:45,359
hi no i'm just talking and talking
missus million

854
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:49,259
I'm my minutes and then

855
00:49:49,259 --> 00:49:52,650
okay so I'm as showbiz house

856
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:55,880
and I say you know this isn't as we
don't need people to solve a quicksand

857
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:00,179
late really boring in the mid-late you
guys are doing amazing stuff

858
00:50:00,179 --> 00:50:04,359
applied something cool I happen to have
a high love the it was is because again

859
00:50:04,359 --> 00:50:05,869
was may have specialist aaron

860
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:08,459
eyes and you know do you think you can
make with these do you think you can

861
00:50:08,459 --> 00:50:09,638
make a key for

862
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:13,619
this lock and we sat down I was your
measurements are trying to actually get

863
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:17,869
on the horn Geico in Finland million we
covered several more hours after it left

864
00:50:17,869 --> 00:50:21,630
I'm and just being guess work in him
working in the open Skadden

865
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:25,779
something like that anyway he was taping
like crazy was making

866
00:50:25,779 --> 00:50:29,609
amazing he seems on the commuters
incredible I'm it looks like actually

867
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,409
real physical world hacking women

868
00:50:31,409 --> 00:50:36,029
okay I we know we're doing we didn't
have the specs we had no idea but just

869
00:50:36,029 --> 00:50:36,400
being

870
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,789
guesswork after five hours back key

871
00:50:39,789 --> 00:50:43,389
this key open the lock that I had left
it was 1am

872
00:50:43,389 --> 00:50:46,670
I left after thinking that we were
failures and I got an email from the

873
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:49,019
have nearly the same you know I went
back to the lot

874
00:50:49,019 --> 00:50:51,819
and I played around a little bit I put
the key back in I just tweaked it a

875
00:50:51,819 --> 00:50:52,519
little bit and a

876
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:56,299
top trade open for me and so this is
very cool because he's no threat

877
00:50:56,299 --> 00:51:00,909
rap printing keys to moderate security
locks compared

878
00:51:00,909 --> 00:51:05,619
remarks you want to this country on but
the really crazy think I'm crazy

879
00:51:05,619 --> 00:51:07,179
implication is the fact

880
00:51:07,179 --> 00:51:11,529
the soft plastic allowed for a
miscarriage

881
00:51:11,529 --> 00:51:15,739
key to function in the lock here's why
it's awesome

882
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:20,569
okay let's see that we wanted had locks
that have slightly open tolerances would

883
00:51:20,569 --> 00:51:21,669
have cuts

884
00:51:21,669 --> 00:51:25,439
so this is a 3.5 comic he it turns the
foreign desk

885
00:51:25,439 --> 00:51:29,499
to hear interns are three desk to hear

886
00:51:29,499 --> 00:51:32,658
but if we are using a malleable enough
material

887
00:51:32,659 --> 00:51:36,199
because as you saw on the video has been
repeated several times that Sabres being

888
00:51:36,199 --> 00:51:37,309
forced

889
00:51:37,309 --> 00:51:41,499
into the gates the cyber wants to go
into the gains

890
00:51:41,499 --> 00:51:47,229
it for material is a all malleable the
sidebar will force its way in

891
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:50,629
and will open up the lock on the half
capped and services

892
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:54,509
exponentially should leave how often do
you really can see exponential

893
00:51:54,509 --> 00:51:57,849
exponentially reducing the key space

894
00:51:57,849 --> 00:52:01,339
on the locks or attacking okay so take
bad idea

895
00:52:01,339 --> 00:52:05,979
and now apply it to the four-team idea
where you're manipulating each disc once

896
00:52:05,979 --> 00:52:09,589
okay so you have six cut cs6

897
00:52:09,589 --> 00:52:12,788
typical cuts in a key for most Americans
to tear locks

898
00:52:12,789 --> 00:52:16,309
fun you bring that down to three cuts
were using have cuts

899
00:52:16,309 --> 00:52:20,919
Brite now you may cancel even brute
force your way through those three cuts

900
00:52:20,919 --> 00:52:24,249
and thereby clocks out there that only
the i've seen by

901
00:52:24,249 --> 00:52:28,428
likes that only have three in actual
coded desks

902
00:52:28,429 --> 00:52:32,089
and the two on the energy 0 dis we
always know how to send a certified just

903
00:52:32,089 --> 00:52:35,029
walk with only three discs that we need
to figure out

904
00:52:35,029 --> 00:52:40,429
3 desks in three positions

905
00:52:40,429 --> 00:52:44,539
81 somehow I got 281 a difference like
that but if you want

906
00:52:44,539 --> 00:52:48,049
you can dial your way through any way
possible combinations in a

907
00:52:48,049 --> 00:52:52,069
battling it probably as you please 1433
walk the fine

908
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:56,209
additionally I'm the real the real fears
that we're going to find ourselves

909
00:52:56,209 --> 00:52:57,828
another pic pens actuation

910
00:52:57,829 --> 00:53:01,889
were for using malleable enough
materials just bashing around facing our

911
00:53:01,889 --> 00:53:04,109
way inside locks

912
00:53:04,109 --> 00:53:07,630
is not to work on every bidding is not
going to work never really did cut

913
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:09,939
against a really shallow tech is your
valuable

914
00:53:09,939 --> 00:53:13,558
services are gonna be able to make that
transition clear enough but any building

915
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:15,400
that is close enough to one another

916
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,509
you're gonna be able if I was opened in
10-15 seconds

917
00:53:18,509 --> 00:53:22,409
just like the Big Ten's used him this is
a very exciting moment and I'll because

918
00:53:22,409 --> 00:53:25,729
I insisted on being a total creeper
engine at a guys house

919
00:53:25,729 --> 00:53:29,618
he did most work bomb you

920
00:53:29,619 --> 00:53:32,959
ok adults I I one other

921
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:37,428
Monday as thats I like we talked about
replicating the skis

922
00:53:37,429 --> 00:53:41,469
you getting a real key for if you know
the code can be challenging

923
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:44,509
ass that's my set of keys exist that's
why scholar on

924
00:53:44,509 --> 00:53:48,989
this on if you have physical access to
it he is something we talked about

925
00:53:48,989 --> 00:53:53,069
to use going to I you can actually just
cast one

926
00:53:53,069 --> 00:53:57,029
you can take the key may come on with it
and cast it with whatever material you

927
00:53:57,029 --> 00:53:57,809
wanna

928
00:53:57,809 --> 00:54:01,889
so in this photo is an app where protect
he on the bottom

929
00:54:01,889 --> 00:54:05,239
is a casting virginity key and so it's
obviously not

930
00:54:05,239 --> 00:54:10,179
wanna percent perfect by it opens the
lock which the only important part

931
00:54:10,179 --> 00:54:13,889
and as intimidating as the keys look for
these types of locks

932
00:54:13,889 --> 00:54:18,789
be cast beautifully and the reason for
that is because they have such a solid

933
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:19,499
core

934
00:54:19,499 --> 00:54:22,549
so there's no heavy undercutting and
there's no

935
00:54:22,549 --> 00:54:26,150
real weak points you know if you think a
ver a traditional pin

936
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:29,279
tumbler key they can have very deep cuts
which makes it

937
00:54:29,279 --> 00:54:33,779
conserving more fragile but all the disc
locks have a very sturdy keys

938
00:54:33,779 --> 00:54:38,809
I'm which lends itself to making very
sturdy cast includes

939
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:41,919
ok well sorry we talk about this yep

940
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:46,479
I am and that is basically it where we

941
00:54:46,479 --> 00:54:50,888
flogged and put a slightly older version
of the slideshow do much to

942
00:54:50,889 --> 00:54:56,529
I see ap but that is it a scholar wanted
to show you some other tools

943
00:54:56,529 --> 00:54:59,719
yeah just for those up americans are you
yet to skim through them out what was

944
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:01,179
going on

945
00:55:01,179 --> 00:55:05,439
okay so I'm this is a guy who made his
own decoder for

946
00:55:05,439 --> 00:55:09,259
because the game is on the counter for
Mabley classic locks

947
00:55:09,259 --> 00:55:13,009
I'm almost certain I found these in the
men's section blog 21:01 bat comment

948
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:15,209
found my computer in all resources

949
00:55:15,209 --> 00:55:18,399
I feel terrible that I can I give this
person the credit they argue

950
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,319
but they're part of the OP 11 community
that much of Europe a battle to prepare

951
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,489
is going ahead

952
00:55:23,489 --> 00:55:27,449
is going to actually slide along the
exterior all

953
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:30,630
up in through the desks you'll see a
picture in a second or two

954
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:34,539
discover the gate good ongoing

955
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:37,799
okay so although it's kinda hard to see
you see where the

956
00:55:37,799 --> 00:55:42,349
discs are separated from one another
bastard timber that after the best team

957
00:55:42,349 --> 00:55:43,739
that actually erupting

958
00:55:43,739 --> 00:55:48,189
up through separate in the nest and then
it rhymes along the outstanding grades

959
00:55:48,189 --> 00:55:51,209
on the essay that is until it feels the
gate

960
00:55:51,209 --> 00:55:54,538
and uses the guy has a gauge good

961
00:55:54,539 --> 00:55:58,069
I'm speaking discover where that gate
has appeared

962
00:55:58,069 --> 00:56:01,650
men's all yeah yeah and that's the marks

963
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:06,349
in best gauge

964
00:56:06,349 --> 00:56:09,789
obvious to its Annie gauge gauge phone
here we go

965
00:56:09,789 --> 00:56:14,369
okay so he didn't have like traditional
materials to make him a curfew from 6

966
00:56:14,369 --> 00:56:15,749
just took a bunch

967
00:56:15,749 --> 00:56:20,468
other key is for have the classic rock
since lace them into pieces

968
00:56:20,469 --> 00:56:25,229
and you can't little live capitol a
openings into them so that he can stack

969
00:56:25,229 --> 00:56:25,529
them

970
00:56:25,529 --> 00:56:28,789
go ahead so here's a piece on the end
this

971
00:56:28,789 --> 00:56:31,829
this piece is permanently attached to
his makeup key

972
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:34,429
because there's gonna be turning the
disc in the back to block and every

973
00:56:34,429 --> 00:56:35,949
other one

974
00:56:35,949 --> 00:56:39,809
gets stacked along and using using that
method

975
00:56:39,809 --> 00:56:43,849
it is a completely functional key and so
he is not only the currency to make you

976
00:56:43,849 --> 00:56:45,709
pee in a more permanent session later

977
00:56:45,709 --> 00:56:49,069
but right now he can pop it open again
as often as he needs to do with his made

978
00:56:49,069 --> 00:56:49,920
a key

979
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,190
yeah and this is just homers that is
some dude plan around his locks

980
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:58,059
wanna one other thing that I just
realized that include was that

981
00:56:58,059 --> 00:57:01,420
is so we talked about walking we talked
about one thing I we talked about

982
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,779
various forms coding

983
00:57:02,779 --> 00:57:06,259
one thing we haven't talked about his
impressions mom and so the

984
00:57:06,259 --> 00:57:10,459
if for those you don't know you come to
the village a later on or tomorrow

985
00:57:10,459 --> 00:57:13,629
to learn more about impressions a
technique where you start with the

986
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:14,839
blankie

987
00:57:14,839 --> 00:57:18,940
and by forcibly trying to turn the
components

988
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:21,969
in this case obviously discs you leave
marks on a key

989
00:57:21,969 --> 00:57:25,029
and then you file those down and then

990
00:57:25,029 --> 00:57:28,440
as the component start to go in the
crack positions

991
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,159
the mark stop appearing and eventually
you have a working key

992
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:36,190
this work something tom was as works on
on dis parks pretty much

993
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:39,650
every kind the block that we have I'm

994
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:43,929
basically anything that tentative
methanol worked on will be impression

995
00:57:43,929 --> 00:57:47,699
I'm and so

996
00:57:47,699 --> 00:57:52,339
I our friend you go also was working on
impression the oblique classic

997
00:57:52,339 --> 00:57:55,449
comment again it's kinda funny cuz the
law community

998
00:57:55,449 --> 00:57:59,459
I'm as far as the public eye goes with
you we seem to keep focusing on the

999
00:57:59,459 --> 00:58:01,549
older versions aboitiz the new ones

1000
00:58:01,549 --> 00:58:05,479
just hard it so it might not be true
other not public community

1001
00:58:05,479 --> 00:58:08,828
bites out of my eye I found it very
interesting so what he did was

1002
00:58:08,829 --> 00:58:11,829
he took a blankie and he cut a little

1003
00:58:11,829 --> 00:58:15,859
slices in between each Kiki cat so that
the material would deform easier

1004
00:58:15,859 --> 00:58:19,078
as a solid piece it's hard to harder to
make a mark

1005
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:22,190
so you can always all slots I and then
they would

1006
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:26,150
more usually to form and then he had to
figure out a way of making the angled

1007
00:58:26,150 --> 00:58:28,269
cuts I believe he ended up using

1008
00:58:28,269 --> 00:58:34,089
Sam LaHood yessir something like water
plus be the lasting solution

1009
00:58:34,089 --> 00:58:37,369
because he wanted perfect i cant

1010
00:58:37,369 --> 00:58:41,909
is often disguised I'm and I think was
that stuff is up online on his blog

1011
00:58:41,909 --> 00:58:45,319
unfortunately the name isn't finished so
I don't remember it

1012
00:58:45,319 --> 00:58:48,769
can I am unplug this just to come to
rely slide yes cool

1013
00:58:48,769 --> 00:58:54,209
I we'd have to skip a slide that is
sadly in this presentation shouldn't be

1014
00:58:54,209 --> 00:58:58,799
sorry secrets and we'll bring you to our
last labor resources he did concede that

1015
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:01,909
uncovered ask whatever questions you
have

1016

1023
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:31,610
usually in talks about I'll first and
foremost got a lockpicking village

and every time like arm and check out
this awesome thing I learned about this

1027
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:45,090
lock is like it's an article on lock
rekey

1028
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:48,310

down the 80 s blog because I don't know

1035
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:15,060

translates to disk lockpicking in

1036
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:18,810
finish heavily I am but I'm not sure but

1038
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,120
a lot of information on his work with

1039
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:28,960
with Avis tabloids is dis locks in
general is very very informative

1040

01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:10,330
armed you can buy it's a kid from a
company called the lunar light

1051
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:14,069
I believe I'm and I believe it's just

1052
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:17,440
silicon molding and

1053
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,520
urethane casting a believes the post
