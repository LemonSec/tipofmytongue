4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,840
by an issue and Andhra I have a good

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,269
be when

6
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:44,270
I'm first of all thanks to everyone for
attending my talk

7
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,089
and so we're today we are going to talk
about mangling the park max

8
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,260
up sick typically we're

9
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:58,010
I'm going to take you to the Jenny on by
the bought next nominees are looking

10
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,710
it's not about us and the like 10 years
back like how the montana do like denial

11
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,400
of service attacks in sauna things

12
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,420
is something that I have aq this kind of
information

13
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,009
the Dove over which the doc has been
east on has been extracted from the

14
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:12,070
final walk I'm doing on my thesis

15
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:16,520
and it's not going to educate all I have
some really interesting demos

16
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,160
but I'm going to run in a real-time SL
sudden

17
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,860
me to me you're the one that so was can
decided

18
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,020
a little bag on or mine the

19
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,780
I mean to Venice going cuz I Denver
right now I've been working with

20
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,660
I think partners and I'm a PhD candidate
at Michigan State University

21
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,520
all along there have been days stock has
been done with my advisor

22
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,459
is not able to come here so this why and
only one that is selling the stock

23
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:50,350
agenda study we are going to talk about
the bells in mathematics on me

24
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,530
a little bit about the matter in life
cycle and then how the

25
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,319
mmm actually bought some getting
implanted and that information stealing

26
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,039
tactics

27
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:04,009
of present deepok next and a then I'll
be introducing than

28
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:07,490
the one of the finest doing you
bottlenecks in the low

29
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,160
right present time then swallow small
bought and I spot

30
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,609
and will be going to that a man in
control panels and see how things logs

31
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,069
a lot I think that's what bob has not
been discussed in detail

32
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:22,739
so we're going over it and try to see
how the design and

33
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,879
thanks working so before laying the
foundation of the start i really wanna

34
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:28,920
talk about the fight

35
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,290
like the fear and said anything in doubt
any malware

36
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,280
on any militia sample that exist in this
world is beast on the three things

37
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,450
I mean it exploits the Spanish stuff in
humans like

38
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,569
you fearful on sidechain and menu
doubtful

39
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:46,429
me a breaking some lame you don't know
what is going to happen at that point

40
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:52,150
they really yes exploited death fly as
fun as I really a

41
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,870
and even if you go into the underground
farms and try to such a different kind

42
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,140
of samples the man may utilize a stumble
on fight

43
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,529
and which is also being taken for like
obvious cation

44
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,870
kinda hard then cream decamp to imply
polymorphism

45
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,909
and that of other obvious kitchen
tactics to hide and

46
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:12,179
seen the execute done called it looks a
lot

47
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,390
so was a bad i'm ok now you're a mean
one day one

48
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:21,429
at last they want your information yes
that's you and

49
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,090
what they're going to do with that
information it's like i dnt tops Kansas

50
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,109
of other things

51
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:30,819
it lies here and extent by this it was
because the same like

52
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:33,969
ten years ago and is still going on a
strong

53
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:37,608
who is it I mean

54
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:41,120
what bob guys behind spending bob maddox

55
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,930
spending box and find a funny thing for
love those guys what they really want

56
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,359
near Minden

57
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:50,260
began be anyone but the reality lies in
the fact that you don't know

58
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,530
which is better than that interface and
behind the interface

59
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:59,099
the Rio Maghrib allies and bad the
reality of

60
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:02,670
gas and a and that is happening really
fast game

61
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,518
for example with the advent of my
generation bought next do this by I

62
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:10,049
and I bought next that I'm going to
discuss today is the

63
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:13,150
extended version of those so I can talk
about anything

64
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,149
spying views miss all the techniques
that have insider used by

65
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:21,029
not present yet so the interfaces

66
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:25,159
defend but i dnt that resides behind it

67
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,670
completely different now so

68
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,070
writer John discussing the defense of
topics that I had getting the start I

69
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,030
want to lean on

70
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,429
benchmark of browser ballot exxon ami I
mean this

71
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,600
why we need it takes on a mi I always
use law says caution to me

72
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,440
we need takes on a me because we want to
build defenses and in order to build

73
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,170
defenses we need to have a lot

74
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:52,060
we need to have us we need to segregate
Madhya from one party and other

75
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,790
which means we had a blast the finding
out where if you're not able to classify

76
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,760
the matter where we are not even have
been strong defenses against it

77
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,789
so here in the summer last year I A

78
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,920
all these texts on I mean really they're
stopping by splitting

79
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,860
and is all about treat us as of now
we're

80
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,880
that typically exploits the browser
functionality first one is a classy

81
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,080
goes amalya what they're supposed to be
its kind of malware that is ax inside a

82
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,200
browser process

83
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,729
that means any add-on they get since all
in a browser ex-wife think the video

84
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,760
browser process

85
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,230
the mean browser process and they don't
have to perform any privilege escalation

86
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,710
and follow things

87
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,620
because all the functionality and access
right to get by default

88
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,330
and then actually it is I said that's
why it died down box lies inside a

89
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,930
browser process

90
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,190
let's get onto the glass bead to the
Class B Maller

91
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,520
actually exploits the indignity of
blogging architecture in browsers

92
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,549
it is a tight body right flash and Dobby

93
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,360
job as a lot of other things demanded
that exceed ex-wife's the liability in

94
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,250
this plugins

95
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,720
is the class be mad and what is going to
do of course

96
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,480
drop anything into the system but that
entry point

97
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,790
is the plugin architecture since plugins
a sandbox

98
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:11,050
they have to really perform the Pew
religious collation which means they

99
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,930
have to explain to one ability

100
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:18,740
in those plugins Adobe Flash by this for
a long period of time

101
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,880
and talking about that classy browser
value

102
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,280
when exposed to meet its kind of malware

103
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,200
that may be exploiting a function i do.
Class A and Class B to get ending to a

104
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,450
system

105
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,610
basically use their land I can be a
panel at

106
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,820
and that's why did they %ah diamond boss

107
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,990
has an interface between the operating
system gonna and the plugin process

108
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,460
it can be anything it just lacks in your
system use that land performs DLL

109
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,650
injection

110
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:50,090
France adjust revoking a B I O king
assault on these kinda things to

111
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,340
money blade been on the functionality of
the operating system

112
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,780
but adding then she by days two browsers
to the ex-wife something in browser one

113
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,030
or the other way

114
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,830
to the other three classes of browse
amount it really need to understand to

115
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,890
jump and down into the

116
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:11,340
by the conceptus so talking about the
bot Magnus

117
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,210
it's really good to talk about them and
their lives like it how the matter

118
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,989
actually get into your system

119
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:20,010
can be anything fight always used to say

120
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,020
any malicious sample I anti-malware
actually

121
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,590
exploits the human fast then the
technologies

122
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,099
maybe send automated and UI system
solution payday may disagree on how do

123
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,660
you have declined I saw nothing sexy
monitoring system

124
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,980
bite back me to the board meeting always
open right

125
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,370
and you have a browser which is an
interface to the internet

126
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,490
ex-wife's you fucced then the defense of
technologies

127
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,500
if you used to call by passing and URSS
stamps

128
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,050
doing any sort of things may be using
obvious key sure services and some of

129
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,740
them

130
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,150
the talking about a matter life cycle
and pointing to a job like slide which

131
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,479
may be SMPI Nissan it thinks it is being
used by Donna

132
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,570
browser exploit backs and their holiday

133
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,950
staff work basically in step 1 with my
back is trying to do the

134
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:12,340
actually trying to exploit a system
maybe our high volume at site

135
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,349
maybe I'll let's share about costing

136
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,550
any kind of thing me that traffic is
really hot

137
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,090
so they will what they want to do of
course to simply blackmailed here

138
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:26,729
can be out which can be accessed by
anybody from the tight body to me

139
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:31,900
and so so I've been planning this eleven
analysts how we have to analyse the

140
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,429
thanks

141
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:37,019
if you look at once the liability in
space the back side is exploited

142
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:41,320
then you're going to detect malicious
iframe in their website being an analyst

143
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,399
I had to go to the source got on that
page

144
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,760
and how we can do that we have different
saddle NX the mountains of other things

145
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,510
how we actually analyze it and you
extract what kinda back inside the air

146
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:56,439
maybe like obvious cation back transcend
simple life remain hidden iframe

147
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,610
yet they are pointing to you next up why
days the once you do that

148
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,120
and then given you some other analysis
by and we don't

149
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,950
rapid run in browser emulated and the
preferably stupak do you think that you

150
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:09,780
can't

151
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,959
call you utility and a leading systems
try to get it wrong

152
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,850
source page so what happens afterwards

153
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,300
it might be a bit blood because Obama
solid

154
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,530
color at the back in but typically USX
the iframe attack to see where the truck

155
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,910
body to mean is

156
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,010
right made my famous pointing at my body
to me

157
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:34,850
once you do that you try to access those
web page

158
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,320
with is another second level web page
and i download the system

159
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,320
spastic man here so he didn't like a job
of line

160
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,510
which can be a JAR file you nd combine
it

161
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,189
may be different thing and find system
can be pretty stale

162
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,440
if you install a job like being
armenians Jolla Jolla

163
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,500
ap lead it can one JavaScript I'm

164
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:00,240
explanation you used to go like keeps
playing in all that and can be executed

165
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,430
in esteem demand in your system so you
never know

166
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:07,229
difficulty if you know you have used in
banishing testing on it likes extreme

167
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,300
low social engineering to continue that
this kind of technique a lot

168
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,300
set by analyzing malware can Eisenbach
bass this penetration testing Bob assess

169
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,189
manage Mad Men analysis testing caps on
and dry

170
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,029
all things you know get into a psycho
soul if you know all the skill sets

171
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:25,279
really well

172
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,390
then that's up eighty-three fruitful so
bad what we used to do and that brings

173
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,970
us up in Eagan

174
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:35,630
so and the last time out against
installed in your system

175
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,600
and Ed that's all if u'd combined 85 so

176
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,500
you know it's twenty Mike and sexy I'm
actually discussing on FB stating that I

177
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,720
have here

178
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,410
and see if you look at the pool source
code here is like in the Jolla

179
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:52,020
the actually embodied the VBScript 5

180
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,199
and food om Document Object Model in
browsers

181
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,740
while the job wise stranded and that
things get executed as a scripting way

182
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,740
so this innovative in the format and
it's pretty grueling love you the steps

183
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,710
which has been known from the needs of

184
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,940
BB language you may see show but this
thing to do and

185
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,870
attackers are still exploiting these
things

186
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:19,910
so after discussing about the fact that
when a classy browse amalya is class B

187
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,860
bells and magnetism classy Belgium
outrages

188
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,430
we're going to look at the present a
technique sow the boss so the man who is

189
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,010
getting implanted

190
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:32,210
and how the outer system on the lab or
getting exploited and I get into your

191
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,190
system

192
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,920
softer this I'll be running some very
good demos and all that

193
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,569
but they're so I can hardly be used so
that we don't waste time

194
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,890
if it's not run properly so

195
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:47,660
the very first thing I wanna lay as fast
as they exploiting grandpa staying

196
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,060
so most of the dice and tears like what
you're hosting server some

197
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,209
accountability

198
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,390
to host difference at all what should
host on a single server

199
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,529
maybe they are not dedicated but they're
like than 10,000 web sites are hosted on

200
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:00,060
a

201
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,910
one lengths platform and it has been
seeing

202
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:08,740
BSCI we presented haradim even on this
explanation about lecture hall staying

203
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,880
out now in Madurai to do then

204
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,130
it got indyk in the Box 397 label

205
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,580
anybody interested in going dollars for
your labor

206
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,620
so data centers other really target
price because

207
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,710
why the attacker had to go along above
that side which is a highly

208
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:28,350
have a high set of traffic why it's not
going far like

209
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:32,610
member just asking me down like 10,000 a
website's right

210
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:36,779
and there is a trifecta lies here is the
fact that

211
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:40,330
if the 10,000 capsid the fact that
define a wonderful evening what

212
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,540
one bats an eye for example file
uploading functionality doesn't have an

213
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,730
Applebee's sanitize Asian

214
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,320
and other saw nothing say back is able
to upload

215
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,970
maybe to Sgt by: jacking are maybe to
http

216
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:58,120
that DMV matters back it is able to
upload anything on the maps are were

217
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,500
and they have even some other very
sophisticated scams like the nineteen a

218
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,950
shall be an existing for a long period
of time

219
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,360
and nowadays our study has shown that
they are using

220
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,790
automated I famous what they these

221
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,480
battlefield and as I want CIS one
website is compromised

222
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,650
and attack and they look more like
automated I famous K

223
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:23,680
so all the ten thousand cost on baghdad
Eagle mucho Sarah

224
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,270
is going to be in fact david that
particular iframe to run the clinic's

225
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,360
cape is going to go

226
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,529
every directly for a particular cost and
then backs the I free minute

227
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:37,750
and so you can look at this is about as
gene explanation

228
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,180
are maybe I exploiting the poor location

229
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,829
all same and then what meanwhile and

230
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,960
within a one speck of time ten thousand
ap psych sign in fact aid

231
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,190
and you must have seem like some other
pieces that hadn't discussed in the

232
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,160
media

233
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,839
in a last year about this

234
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,130
and is in the summers or snow but it is
used to inject

235
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:02,350
on a meeting I frames in different cost

236
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:06,670
fine example mean bad files indexed on
HDMI default on its Deanna

237
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,770
sidewall so this has been taken from 10
that the study that we have analyzed

238
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,779
an unlocked g1 so they slide down

239
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:17,149
exploiting them hosting is i really
wanna the major tactic that attackers

240
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:18,330
are using

241
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,970
to you implant million

242
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,640
and again is an example of some sort of
the ninety 90 the shall we get new shows

243
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,260
you

244
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,939
on the privilege escalation can be done
pretty easily once you upload the file

245
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,020
maybe you out in a sec did you there

246
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,510
did outweigh these shouts what beauty
while I'm

247
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,770
at least give you gas basic set of
information and reading

248
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:42,589
password fis which you can use do

249
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:47,730
bomb compromise the website later on

250
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,570
not and other interesting study which we
have dead recently light

251
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:56,070
the about in fact in the black truck
seats some black boxes are opened BHP

252
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,020
steps

253
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:01,339
geving used and a heavy scary fart
anonymous surfing

254
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:05,130
and why this works for you because in
some dog nyse: asians know you had not

255
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,670
restricted

256
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,420
traffic serving there you can stuff
Somerset a website's

257
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,880
next here people use Google implies used
to go to the open guy proxies in trying

258
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,649
to surf a Spokane sort of other things

259
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:20,740
and because there's little bun

260
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,810
they can use that and it's not being too
strict and the bad image a level of the

261
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,609
organization

262
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:31,250
and it is being used for I have a set of
infection nowadays

263
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,040
and this black box defense open you can

264
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,610
make more money kitchen into the PHP
code is an open source you can do

265
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,830
whatever you want

266
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:44,839
so here is a simple example a small
Democratic to show you

267
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:48,170
why do you say nothing about to go back
side for example Facebook dot com two

268
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:52,270
black boxes how weekend in Jackson and
saw nothing so that all the proxy fight

269
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,540
back pages

270
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,140
I embodiment some solemnly she escapes
and

271
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,880
other things small damage can gives you
a

272
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,010
mara understanding all one can abuse the
black proxy for

273
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:09,720
distributed in factions we used to call
it distributed not targeted because he

274
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,180
do that from different

275
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,599
like countries are different places can
visit by proxies

276
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,450
you get the Kingston so what I'm doing
here is bad I have lost a like this

277
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:23,500
like broccoli PHP source code on one on
my server

278
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,520
and when you decided not be hp5 and try
to show you

279
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:33,520
but kinda defense adding these black
boxes paper lives

280
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,640
the basic is like a centralized
configuration Badami guess you can't do

281
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:46,020
based on the configuration scripts
deserve a simple proof of concept I'm

282
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,170
showing just write a backup document and
making in front of you

283
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:53,329
white black boxes can be abusing you're
getting abused

284
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:57,500
so then the smog jQuery plugin rewrote
and we put into the light

285
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,760
footer of family beach the what it does
like

286
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:06,180
every time a user login to apply proxy
and try to stuff to any website

287
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,880
after the proxy fight Ahmad %um

288
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,339
when the party by Madhu runs this gift
will be executed

289
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:18,649
in every script page again this by proxy
for life the hot linking

290
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:23,190
within a site design of on on vacation
Badami der Sande

291
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,330
adding some on the additional gold you
can remove the heart linking to

292
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:29,840
so you you will not get any sort of my
proxy body in it

293
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,860
and that looks legitimate so then

294
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,969
anybody you'd like to opens up Facebook
web page here

295
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,350
says by proxy spores

296
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,330
liking for Facebook Twitter and other
things the next flight schedule and in

297
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,030
this way

298
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:48,020
but Facebook has implemented some sort
of like pasta me sharing

299
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,810
and restricting sign of rain busting
defense

300
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,270
that's why you gonna frame it so you
have to use some sort of PPIs

301
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:59,830
to actually try to plug in so what I'm
doing getting that I'm jest

302
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,110
adding any random strangers and

303
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,909
at the bottom you can see Dad in the
proxy fight about page

304
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:13,910
basket has actually get inside it here
so what it does lights

305
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:17,670
so you want to log into Facebook you
provide your credentials now what

306
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:21,420
will go back on now that the mind
control and power outages in case is my

307
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,060
server

308
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:29,020
and I'll show you so that it doesn't
belong in step

309
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,010
I mean just the longer we have
implemented anti-ballistic banks that

310
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,480
comes from declined to get login to the
decks 5

311
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,050
I'm a simple be you see the show %ah
like boxes are being abused

312
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,430
so this actually show you when I was a
daddys and

313
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,580
is being entered by the user is actually
guest login

314
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:50,129
so you it really because I was surfing
through guy proxies

315
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,700
and just really hot be determined I
rather than

316
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,170
those black boxes I bring some militia
suffer not but this actually sent me

317
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:58,900
show you

318
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,940
million assemblage small a jQuery plugin

319
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,090
then you might want to extend the
functionality of light

320
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:09,449
will actually leave each you lot of
functions and Nana

321
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,510
a exploitation games that you can't
light

322
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:16,770
we expect of grain shows a lot of
information out of use this machine

323
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:22,250
so there was a once a big gamble and
then either 1 I'll be talking about like

324
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,680
bows x-pipe backs

325
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,580
automated frameworks so black hole you
might have heard that name

326
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,179
Phoenix a lot of abetting the Blackwell
we think alike

327
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,810
them in that study on the brow blackhole
exploit back

328
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,210
and that complete with presented that
studying why does bulletin conference

329
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,770
for the two teams in the paper is
already out

330
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:45,080
and if you look at this time the browser
exploit backs

331
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,300
is an automated free love for example

332
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:52,690
if you had use like me just like so many
apps by his eyebrows at Autobahn

333
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,380
my dude so bad don't have one would you
like actually based on the design a

334
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,720
browser exploit box

335
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,500
all the ex-wife a bundle together you
know one thing work

336
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,190
may never use over this I malicious
website the browser

337
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,940
will be fingerpainted and if there is a
lonely beloit jenin

338
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,560
plugins are there is a wonderful large
in the browser compliment

339
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:17,679
ben de and going to solve the exploit
and expired resonated in manner

340
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,590
in an obvious getting men and actually a
system gets compromised

341
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:27,929
and in order to make operations more
still so that you cannot to immerse

342
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,510
engineering the source code of

343
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:32,580
some other php5 that the browser exploit
back users

344
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,110
saddam most other did I love you's

345
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:41,580
X buyback writers and authors user PHP
Eid you been called it it's a very good

346
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,330
encoder

347
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:46,350
and you can I read the source flies be
easy even if you compromise the

348
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,699
command-and-control server

349
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,990
so you have to behave good testing in
some sense and to get the source code

350
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,500
out of it how they're written in the
Java exploits

351
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,540
as some sort of thing but other

352
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,680
he said he would hit on Phoenix exploit
bag really seemed at next light like

353
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,890
was actually using an expired from the
Metasploit

354
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:08,330
which was intending to be so it was
directly using text

355
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:11,699
exploit but it mostly lower

356
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,210
for the Browns the next flight back to
use in collaboration with bottlenecks

357
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:19,890
for the payload for the people can be
anything any malicious bind the Sun

358
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,960
so what the band that does actually when
day

359
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,280
actually install a browser next flight
back to be in order actually holds the

360
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:26,760
BART

361
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,650
maybe is used by spy marked school long
RNG on

362
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:34,140
Libyan other side along which one can be
a I spot to

363
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,210
so the Venda exploitation in the success
the ball gets downloaded

364
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:43,070
India system it may be a dropper I would
I would depends on the design that actor

365
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,530
want to use

366
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:48,580
us i'm pointing to a job less than me
when the meeting which was exploited the

367
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,250
most

368
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:54,130
by the black hole im during the day like
and I was the fight infections

369
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:59,470
but it looks pretty one so I mean to
jail SMB exploited that phone

370
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:03,890
of dade then we analyze a peaceful like
the VLC Media PA 5

371
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:08,690
so the try to use August cation I like
extension met mismatch

372
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:12,580
but got bored is actually execute a
Belcourt safely remove them yes the

373
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,199
extension and then

374
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,560
maybe IKEA extension and then janitor
job files is actually a gel applied

375
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,560
CD come by later you get the source code
to do you have a small tips and tricks

376
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,649
you always want to apply

377
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:31,470
why you doing now but analysis comes
with a very fruitful results

378
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:34,690
and the other one is like with the
advent of belviq spike backs

379
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:39,070
get it like a drive by freeing walks to
drive by a dollar to the symbol exactly

380
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:42,040
you foresee the user to music on a leash
is so mean

381
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,000
and then the browser actually gets
exploited and your system is compromised

382
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,280
in any manner

383
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,580
to do the lead as the energy adve
relieved like

384
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,889
within a speck of light four to five
months be

385
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:58,670
what really wow this Ajala driver
download fring walk

386
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:02,430
and driving expired 10 elections on
challah and then connects back to the

387
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,770
command-and-control shop

388
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:07,030
think back to gives you how many systems
have been compromised

389
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:10,510
and do we end up a lot has been loaded

390
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:14,360
and if you look at this and now you're
the sexy show you a glimpse

391
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,760
the number of infected machines that has
an NHA ice

392
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,230
making the system to be wonderful and
making it compromised

393
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:25,780
so the point is like the automated
frameworks play a critical role

394
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,899
bitch actually give us the point that

395
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,500
maybe that s don't have that kind of
time maybe undergone Caminos

396
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,310
don't want to spend that much amount of
time and they want to do something

397
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:41,190
be fast mass always been here

398
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,560
let's take a look at the dam of the
blackhole exploit back

399
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:49,000
just trying to show you are exactly
drive-by downloads

400
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,210
so you might need to be a bit of
attention because a

401
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,200
this attack Watson St more you might not
able to get but I try to show you like

402
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
how the traffic is

403
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,600
you know being connected between the
domain and how the man is being sought

404
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,129
it's tough love madly life like you know
how the drive-by download books

405
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:12,210
cystocele like you there simply log into
into the

406
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:16,480
email provider and try to see

407
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,160
any kind of union that has been
receiving as they found that getting a

408
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,550
very interesting link on your end link

409
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:27,590
maybe steer so the author uses a light
think twice before you click

410
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,840
good it's really hot for the users to

411
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:37,840
Belinda so what happens you find
anything going and try to click the link

412
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:44,500
for the browser actually guess you got
back to the fading light feat Facebook

413
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:48,930
page

414
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:52,040
see my not able to get back to find
anything but if you look at the source

415
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,430
code

416
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,600
this is an obvious cake and ice cream is
here

417
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,590
and is the breast saga skating is really
hard to analyze

418
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:04,350
by thank you have already boosted that
baby it means

419
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:10,330
something has already happened

420
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:13,480
so that the show you how the iframe is
being rendered

421
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,470
it's not easy to decipher it but

422
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:22,980
it's there

423
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,600
so it looks legitimate in that sense may
be ending it can be any page

424
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:33,600
safe you look at the traffic

425
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,040
it will show you that when you click
that link it gets redirected to this %uh

426
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,950
mattered to me

427
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:44,720
and that actually sounds like you send a
GET request from Backpage because

428
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,250
mavis did that page actually knife frame
get stranded and

429
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,690
it has to fetch that her body you wanna
link and what I wanted a siren with the

430
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:54,549
mouth being

431
00:25:54,549 --> 00:26:01,049
I may be any malicious kept said did
that and you can see that all the Supt

432
00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:04,490
basis for that will be able to use like
that two hundred okay mas h.

433
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:11,490
and is a permanent redirect the and
other domain

434
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:19,939
so now what happened in your system you
don't know so what we did like bennett

435
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,499
wat

436
00:26:20,499 --> 00:26:24,019
so we driving to a small scan and this
man made by

437
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:27,840
says the the 91 disassemble has a book
scanning engine and a

438
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,908
would update for the signatures so the
said again that act

439
00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:35,789
it and basically detect these use body
face get infected

440
00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:40,980
so it gives you an idea how this
drive-by download is working from

441
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,059
popping from one domain to the end other

442
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:46,470
and then downloading the band and into
your system meet you

443
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:53,470
I'm not able to see

444
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,799
same actually do it communicated back
with the blackhole exploit back which

445
00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:00,269
has ended this kind of the Mahoning
control interface

446
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:07,269
where you got a lot of status sticks and
all that

447
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,780
should depend song like get the domain
is like

448
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:15,020
the tight body to mean film where the
boundary actually downloading them out

449
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,360
here

450
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,090
as a few see you at the mouth as a
stylist B&B

451
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:22,418
it actually gives you wanna look and it
was like a V bought

452
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:25,650
begin next year's you spot and a

453
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:30,710
that actually getting stoned your system
a census of the Lakewood bullion for the

454
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:34,190
signature was there and thank you I S
was able to detect it can be fine

455
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:38,620
but the whole world blind in changes
just a little down with that how the

456
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,889
drive-by downloads while

457
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:46,169
so you force the user by sending a spear
phishing email and stay long so fishing

458
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:50,059
I think it's been on for like while I
mean number of years trying

459
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:54,850
its tempers sp1 and it cannot use for
targeted axis of anything

460
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:58,480
but that's all the blackhole exploit
back lots and

461
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,309
are used fishing in drive-by downloads
to work together let's get onto the mat

462
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:05,190
on the cloud

463
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:10,100
so we came across a domain Justin study
where we find that analyzing something

464
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,459
and came across that this

465
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,270
baghdad Amazon a.w.s i misses were
actually

466
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:19,520
as a storage bins so hard about what it
is simply

467
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,510
up it for life like that access to
defend number of cost

468
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:27,309
well actually gets the services from
Amazon at every host has us

469
00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:30,889
individual been so now you can scan bad
because

470
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:34,549
you need to have an all-state Benn is on
don't allow you to scan

471
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:38,600
dare that cloud infrastructure but they
provide Benz

472
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,059
you need to have an explicit boss to the
bane get the Mad Men is being Austin

473
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:46,870
but we came across with this fact and
this is on now and where it is actually

474
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,610
%ah

475
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:52,149
package installer has been like it
cannot be like 10 or 15 bind with

476
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:56,120
and you get that you dont know and you
came across with this fact that the

477
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,649
number of plies

478
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:01,549
the DL absence of other things to being
an ass like Tom

479
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:06,720
response but just know you're I so we
found that we do I'm is on the move did

480
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,220
but the point is they hear that even the
Amazon

481
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:15,049
even the bobbitt structure is not
untouched by the man here

482
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:19,030
the matter is already on the clout to
since

483
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,700
it actually did you stop business
perspective a lamb is on to allow the

484
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:26,200
tight body vendor web sites to know the
scanning engine that actually goals

485
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,070
across 30

486
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:30,280
clouds structure and then

487
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:35,309
if you some results but if something is
compromise you get a Hostgator get a

488
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:36,570
financial you can

489
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,840
no cost them out with that would anchor
so doing

490
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,970
and talking about the matter in that
light on the last slide in this case

491
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:45,600
studies

492
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,820
if you look at all these things although
da

493
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:53,139
the things in the grad you the 13th
adopt binding

494
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,710
better malicious in nature but has been
undertaken by the

495
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,500
Malwarebytes this I did you see an idea
that

496
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,799
all the back against dollars many shoes
and have 10 different set of eyes which

497
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:05,950
can be droppers

498
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:12,110
are extending matter let's take a look
at the and other factors

499
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,399
the social network's I mean

500
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,140
stare and re having to run a small damn
little

501
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,809
trying to show Hall the social networks
like Facebook and Twitter can be

502
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:23,710
exploited

503
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:27,070
are how we can inject some family just
read some malicious

504
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:30,168
nights in bad used to call in like
jacking

505
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:33,730
all is being there so with the passage
of time I classics

506
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,909
last year to do this by halftime women's

507
00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:42,040
analyzing lot of case studies now using
like jacking and getting collaboratively

508
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,780
and try to force the user to inject
malicious link into the peaceful profile

509
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:51,178
to like checking and then do you think
that okay to come from my friend it

510
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:54,710
began to legitimate I can click on that
and the whole process a drive-by

511
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,210
download walks and then

512
00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:00,130
then comes the automated drive my frame
loves which do the infection

513
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,540
let's take a look at this one other like
checking

514
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:10,540
wats it basically exploits ta

515
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:16,830
like functionality did it to you this
communicating and a light something on

516
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,059
Facebook for the click

517
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:22,149
again like that your body and then
distributed across the chain of users

518
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:26,350
and so there's nothing I use a half I
log into my account

519
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:32,020
testing the town and this is the like
getting Beach so if you move your

520
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:35,570
personal aide you can see that there is
a like page we can make it hidden

521
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:39,970
is based on the Dallas game how you
write so we actually got his dollars

522
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,470
they've done wanna be mad we're doing

523
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:44,809
we can to bed to make it on hand and and
make some changes

524
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:47,980
and I'm just

525
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:52,409
setting up a traffic control your so
that you can see how the traffic has

526
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:55,870
been communicating the Facebook so this
is %uh like jacking

527
00:31:55,870 --> 00:32:02,870
source code

528
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:11,580
so here I am going to play and you see
that better best has been sent to you

529
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:16,050
Facebook somewhere the first thing you
got to see whether Facebook the sets

530
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:20,690
that are not and you see did the nasty
be 200 ok it means Facebook asap said

531
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:26,890
and we go back into love my ground and
refreshing the page

532
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:31,740
and you can feed a dazzling bow their
rejection is binding to some time but

533
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,890
now I make a mean

534
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:37,030
and you go out there it's a simple

535
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:41,860
a load I so actually a backdoor the
Windows Media PA file in it

536
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,899
so even if you go to that page ride you
were not able to see that from your the

537
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,040
mattress them in a

538
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,690
so it is actually a bad example and I'm
in this meeting up there

539
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:53,820
so we actually scripted that and try to
inject knife a minute

540
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:58,189
and you can see the traffic and you see
that man I would you say that page

541
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:02,970
for the malware local start downloading
into your system here

542
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:07,070
so the binding that you can make it he
did as much as you can you can make

543
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,830
existing

544
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:11,480
as much as you can butt fungus down-home
he just might

545
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,540
try to show you how the things well and
that's how like checking

546
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:18,090
walks so

547
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:21,189
now we're jumping onto the bed and they
bought next

548
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:25,320
information ceiling and many policing
tactics ha what kind of like the tactics

549
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,750
these bottlenecks I'm using

550
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:30,130
nice talking with you since II as a poet
generation

551
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:33,790
because they have a motivation to impact
the financial industry and a

552
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:38,320
banking industry some other techniques
how they had developed

553
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,720
in nineteen it by dgap during the design
phase has been used by the pass and if

554
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,390
not next

555
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:47,270
and the first one is a farm grabbing

556
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:51,720
so it came with the fact that in the
matter is installing a system and mute

557
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,790
writing something typing on a keyboard

558
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:57,000
and there's a lot of garbage toda to
debug logging right

559
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,900
so the game is also the fact that we
don't need that we we want to some sort

560
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,100
of information

561
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,760
baddest be compressed optimized and that
is to the point

562
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,920
to the game came across as backed off on
grabbing and it only if your system is

563
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,000
already infected

564
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,260
what can we do more i mean so he saw if
he remembers a port 80

565
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,030
browser is going to be done bindle and
to this not exploiting

566
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:25,420
the bell then head and functionality
here the haha I do not attack us do that

567
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,680
we're going to take a look at it

568
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:31,089
so tough on grabbing mostly fine so
anything you some it to a farm bill be

569
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,250
capped by the bot

570
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:36,929
and was sent back to the command and
control panel okay so you going to

571
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:38,989
stocks up in your cheese bank website

572
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:42,379
and then you but your credentials
overdue account number everything you

573
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,040
some made

574
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,469
to the bond actually hope want to keep
an eye on your system

575
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:49,649
it books that request sending back to
the command-and-control

576
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:53,410
even present the end right now is also
doing these kind of things

577
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:58,500
depending upon how to collaborate with
the bot next and death

578
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,650
Hall it is being done but some other
them both that we have analyzed Dec

579
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,420
superfund DLL injection

580
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:09,010
so typically in previous times we have a
p-type a DLL injection

581
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:12,330
we have Navi whole game then we have the
registry and then

582
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:16,310
find Windows 7 does look px in Windows
operating system

583
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:20,970
but in this particular case some other
reason samples we have also seen that

584
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:23,189
the mattress topper using ABC beast

585
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:27,130
isn't done as per season I'll be
sticking to but that is not a bottom the

586
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,630
samples that we analyzed

587
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:32,080
they break Firefox in breaks I E

588
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:37,410
simply simply copy the DLL in your

589
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:42,100
Firefox process between suppliers are
that uses in a dynamic link library IEEE

590
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,819
Xplore

591
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:47,060
and then the Firefox process behind the
respective dynamic link like

592
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:51,370
libraries which I've been booked by the
bought so whatever the traffic is going

593
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:54,089
to wait for example would have the guys
going to it

594
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:58,060
in the formal get couple's request it
took six send it back to the command and

595
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,360
control panel that

596
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,580
eighty the because they are already in
the system

597
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,080
and exciting look so your SSL is a
solution against it

598
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,319
but as a man in the browser that it
looks pretty fine

599
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,270
game from and the meadow and ate with
respect him although there will be a man

600
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,340
in the morning do that's already being
here

601
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:22,450
so two-factor authentication is not
being much difference but that because

602
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:24,439
if you're using about based farms s

603
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:29,720
completely different the earlier side if
an so the Xbox Live CD lol hijacking

604
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,330
technique

605
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:33,680
typically aim for exploiting online
banking

606
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,490
a sense da concept is pretty genetic it
can be used against social networking

607
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:42,100
website on any website where you provide
your vehicle information

608
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:47,880
that is used for getting access to your
gums and if you get into the back in Jax

609
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,890
after the fun grabbing it again based on
the concept of man in the meadow

610
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:55,330
basically man in the browser I would say

611
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:58,950
so the Bab indexes have a simple
technique a game

612
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:03,839
the mandate is axing your system so the
chemical also the new fact that why not

613
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,330
do

614
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:08,660
stop injecting some militia stand and in
that incoming HTTP responses

615
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,810
for example you sent a request for
Facebook doc bomb and the Facebook

616
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:17,440
you know a sex that a question sent back
to the content right

617
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,020
so the bond with their senses already
hooking da dynamic link library so the

618
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,220
incoming traffic

619
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:28,290
bought actually has a number to go back
about binge XR txt five so based on that

620
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:29,150
crusade

621
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:33,200
it can inject effect on a federal
mediators so you can see dat began

622
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,509
inject any kind of input box it can
inject any kind of gal aspect

623
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:40,950
that get stranded in the browser as soon
as the Bowser

624
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:45,240
opens the content it actually came to
the US

625
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,580
banking to spy on a damn all the other
bottlenecks cool

626
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:53,509
I spot are using this technique by
dismal

627
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:57,080
%uh difficult defense against that then
in mock

628
00:37:57,080 --> 00:38:01,130
my thesis bonior working over it to bed
some solid defense

629
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:05,570
I asymmetrical one we try to reduce the
impact of

630
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:08,650
these kind of infections

631
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:12,350
and that's actually give the Anaheim
idea how that injects

632
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:15,950
who looked like so if you look at this
and I know it gives you

633
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:19,149
it has an hour three different set of
backs

634
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:24,050
bad I before not after and I'm jacked
soviet you want to inject an About page

635
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:27,650
what kind of got a you want to inject
into that be and dole

636
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:31,780
which bach you want to inject %uh Donna
so you have to render all that

637
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:36,010
each year lots to the blogging framework

638
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,930
as soon as the system is in fact a if we
set up index file okay there's a cheese

639
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,339
dot bomb I want to inject some input -p

640
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:47,110
and try to expect some more information
out of it so it looks pretty fine

641
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:50,820
and Isis by has announced back in Jax
than nothing

642
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,760
typically designed for Bank of America
be used to call a Buick amber

643
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,980
in both be fine so this is another
interesting technique

644
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:03,560
and then the back in Jax look it looks
like this

645
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:09,390
and it gives you an idea that in the
rules set by and a mutual fund not bad

646
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,720
that I go by you can feed bad better
than in Jack

647
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,609
happen actually so this is a very
interesting technique I mean

648
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:19,900
a game back and force you to provide
information

649
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:24,810
he won't write and Ashley Wilkes and
objects see 'em

650
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:28,590
and other one is about fakes safe you
going to likely send you must have

651
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,730
seemed to get a lot of DNS changing my

652
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:34,550
mad we're are endless that actually

653
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:38,230
money blade the DNS settings in your
system

654
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:41,890
and then this is a and other a plugin
framework bad

655
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:45,040
present-day bought their site using all
have an about-face

656
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,660
it simply do a deal but the system is in
fact a

657
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:53,240
the again have a bad a doc txt file
which has been a set of rules

658
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,220
if you want to visit a cheese dot bomb
it cannot amend the browser will

659
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,910
automatically deduct you do

660
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:01,330
some another domain so typically asking

661
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:06,180
how the DNS changing man we're also you
can put up an angry they need easy host

662
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,919
file if you're on a Linux

663
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,320
my boss fight on Windows are based on
the DL hijacking

664
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,350
on DL injection you can typically
exploit

665
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:19,200
all the fines that %uh public DNS is
using on the blindside

666
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,919
so can you can hope and we don't act the
functions

667
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,960
to some any antibody to be one

668
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,560
and it looks pretty fine looks be fine
and M

669
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:35,070
def actually the summer the function
call us that by a user's

670
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:38,250
and dad effective you feel bad Best Buy
and

671
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:41,300
find a bought and actually using a
bottle a min fame walk

672
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,730
I've done that is quite from us of a
tournament for a while

673
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:48,840
and the air again their own function
both in DC plus plus

674
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,470
and whenever you ride this function it
hosts

675
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:55,700
and perform the best fix for you &s I'll

676
00:40:55,700 --> 00:41:00,120
you do the things a game XD try to map
out the back fence then you sending a

677
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,080
GET request

678
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:05,500
and the post request so big based on the
concept the ball back and legs

679
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,630
so you get a GET request it ball back
something

680
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:11,800
and perform this functionality

681
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,950
and when you do that a typical example
of some this may be tried to open

682
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:19,589
something the Bank of America that site
by you look like this

683
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:23,780
and they found about banks actually woke

684
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:27,340
other information stealing tactics
actually include

685
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:30,720
a bloody not be Dec share which can be a
fag got grabber

686
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:35,490
said it gave grabber softback connect
have to be back Mac Bobbi be distributed

687
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,020
denial-of-service

688
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,790
and the latest one is which we have seen
that that game by jacket

689
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:44,460
if you buy the flash can control maybe
he did

690
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:50,740
badla le mando spy hi a has stopped and
the

691
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,149
there is no more development taking
place from the spy button

692
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:59,340
by somewhat alike custom-made my views
like these that can I check again still

693
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:02,550
in testing phase we have seen some bad
things but

694
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:06,290
is being there in the white and if you
do that it typically exploits the

695
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,710
fashions not any

696
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:11,800
and typically expires the standings
thank settings finding a system

697
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:15,880
me some money pollution and that and now
you tried to do something

698
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,520
stocks automatically stocks you about
cam and a

699
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:23,480
microphone to start recording and then
transfer that 50 gimme

700
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,350
climate control and a flash ROM if the
remote

701
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:31,870
the typical once out the lab in Jax the
farm grabbing these are the two most

702
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:36,710
exploited techniques and I used by Beth
and a botnet

703
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:41,050
soul less talk about the smoke bought
and ice but I think it has not been out

704
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:41,850
yet

705
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:45,830
the smoke bottler try to give you love
you outlooks

706
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:49,560
and we'll go through these mind control
panels and none of dem

707
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,900
I'll be showing you how the farm
grabbing lots and how that back to steal

708
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,370
sensitive information

709
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:58,330
if they open back web sites

710
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:02,040
for the small boat bought mining control
looks like this

711
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,310
that gives you an idea other bought ban
on walks

712
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:09,360
it's a new bought is made effective
implement some the really interesting

713
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,260
tactics

714
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,440
far in an execution

715
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:18,140
and if you look at the %uh bottom it has
an A

716
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:21,370
some options side that if you want to
run your manhood as I

717
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:26,080
execute a bow you want to use library
DLL injection techniques

718
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,330
are you 1 I'll you the simple registry
so what I need to try to install the

719
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:30,930
madness iris

720
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:36,660
I may be using any this TV stand tree
and then it can do the trick

721
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:40,580
let's just a small walk through for one
minute away us mining control panel hard

722
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:47,580
looks like

723
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,480
defect to get an idea severe than
factions have been taking place

724
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:00,980
12 the lawn and what extent dear so then
we actually capture that any deal

725
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:04,019
it was an initial stage had that by
halftime

726
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:11,019
that is the very fact Inc bought to get
this kind of option it delights

727
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:21,350
so even if you look carefully on the
force me to see it has lot of infection

728
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:22,150
on the Windows

729
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:25,320
x64 operating system does this not only

730
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:32,320
related to x86 typically to that side
those up the text files which has your

731
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:37,529
all information so I wanna may appoint
hear that

732
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:41,780
this information not only released we
got the information that I bought cactus

733
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,850
from the browser's

734
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:46,759
by all kind of information your Cisco
VPN client and NGOs

735
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,180
Windows admin user see more accessories
on TV's

736
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:57,180
at DB's they'd get Jess all the very
fact you bought

737
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,370
and it also bizarre a shadow for every

738
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:06,290
IP address safe David and in fact this
system's going to bed at ten different

739
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:06,930
shells

740
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:10,169
solo from Shan you can send a come-on
back to the

741
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:14,370
in fact in machine and that's all the
small broadband

742
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:18,940
mining control panel looks like and the
last 1 I'm going to talk about is I spot

743
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:23,670
is an icon it was like an abuse you can
say

744
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:28,040
some really some nearly different some
really good changes in this bond

745
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:28,550
actually

746
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:32,570
from those use perspective is as
effective as USU

747
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:37,150
and this actually gives an idea how the
command and control panel looks like

748
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:40,490
if you will hear this up on grabbing in
action

749
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:44,209
a technique which we had discussed
earlier and this actually show you how

750
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:46,910
the guys been captured on the command
and control panel

751
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:51,160
to give you the in track debut you gonna

752
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:58,160
look at the down here

753
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:09,759
so here's the ball so we actually try to
execute this bought an emulated

754
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,610
environment

755
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:17,070
the second get just a simple executive
black 64 so we are using and now been

756
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:17,850
does XP

757
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:24,850
know what's real and what I meant

758
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:31,340
it

759
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:35,180
so many to freshen the body's gonna

760
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:39,819
so in mouth a terminology in a tax
perspective this process is known as

761
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:40,600
making

762
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:45,140
so the so the drop it can be a dropper
it can be any kind of malicious program

763
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:48,410
that message South do drop any and

764
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:51,819
second album programming to your system
so

765
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:55,030
and this what I we are not going back
into the command and control panel

766
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:59,320
very excited the NGO bought side I spot
here

767
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:04,950
so if you look at

768
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:08,589
death and now use all the systems I in
fact and come in getting back with this

769
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:09,940
command and control panel

770
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:16,940
if you look at our IP address you see
the system has been acting back to the

771
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,420
command and control panel here

772
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,830
saw system is in fact a

773
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:24,960
it's gone its time in getting back to do
attacker

774
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:31,960
solar not now that's a really quite done
seven up on grabbing

775
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,680
place a spot so I open a cheese account
and I want to login into account

776
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:40,299
maybe a at this point of time I'm not
using any real credentials because there

777
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,610
is no while using them

778
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:48,610
so I use anything credentials and tried
to summit

779
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:57,160
just bad to project that this guide is a
a tactic me

780
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,580
is not only aimed at exploiting banking
infrastructure banking website

781
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:06,330
involved any on any website but the
concept is be denied

782
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:10,500
so I'm just sending any random
information

783
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,940
these input boxes just some at the farm

784
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:17,400
so then I go back on the
command-and-control banner here

785
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,480
you see there the one request from Chase
that has been logged

786
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,060
and it comes from the infected machines
a few look and

787
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:28,070
and yes you bought it.

788
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:32,700
some other stats they used to collect
and if you good the

789
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,759
and you see that would ban all the form
is submitted

790
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,950
from the infected machine so the matter
right and becomes more sophisticated

791
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:42,759
they're also using that

792
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,380
logging technique so the user input some
some sort of dot that could also get lot

793
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,000
there

794
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,940
and at the back you gonna farm grabbing
this like you sure you holla back fun

795
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:53,920
Gavin walks

796
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,020
now that they steal information out of
it

797
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:01,460
again on the Facebook one

798
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:08,460
you logging into your account you don't
know what is being there

799
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,970
so I go back into the mine I'm going to
abandon fasho that I get up

800
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:20,799
and a request from Facebook from the
infected machine

801
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,370
see can see that all the dot I hear so
all you can chill

802
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:31,370
bath salts and everything is here this
technique looks very fine is very very

803
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,750
fact they've

804
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:37,800
all the present they bought Nextel using
it phone grabbing

805
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,710
not been jacks that fakes and that has
really made

806
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:47,190
now problem really hard to and

807
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:50,600
what happened said then now this data is
not Yas

808
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:55,779
so do all the credentials the section
taken from Don of eyes on the smoke but

809
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:58,900
you see that all the browsers are being
compromised here

810
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:02,060
one or the other week and be withdrawn

811
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:05,610
and we have all of crowd Firefox

812
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:09,140
all on one level to this kind of attack
techniques

813
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:13,750
and the next one not even bad because it
actually gives you I did that even the

814
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:17,100
Windows credentials Cisco VPN client
outlook that ensures

815
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:23,190
camfrog I didn't vote for everything is
on so I banda died

816
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:26,450
not yards and that's what da decker want

817
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:29,740
bed with a book and operator wants and
once they get your Dada

818
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:32,870
is all about processing that da da bitch
gets them the information

819
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:36,640
and information is the key key to every
attack you

820
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,920
so I just want them to some point flight

821
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,540
up is the true that we were and we are
still living in the age of what next

822
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:48,529
the problem is like a cat and mouse game
which is very hard to navigate

823
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:52,040
and again if some mean by remember

824
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:56,290
Madbury ex-wives you and me the first
not the technologies

825
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:59,620
and I think we're left with

826
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:06,620
five-minute any questions

827
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:13,609
it

828
00:51:13,609 --> 00:51:18,440
a I think they have last couple of
months back due to investors on a fact

829
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,050
flash OSX malware

830
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:24,660
that came to exist yeah but again it was
using a someone ability in the plugin

831
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:25,500
architecture

832
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:30,820
stunned by the plugins Ryan but I think
it was in fashion all that but latex

833
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:34,700
I don't see any much but def I used to
say always like

834
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:37,819
I love Microsoft because they give that
the Mad Men industry

835
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:42,080
and the business for the anti-malware
renders and but still

836
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:47,109
if you look around s more soft like the
movies like a compromise and even those

837
00:51:47,109 --> 00:51:47,730
machines

838
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:53,100
its top 100 Mac OS X to and it was like
the one of the largest one in Mac OS X

839
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,100
but I think stan

840
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:57,380
as compared to Windows they'd faction
Austin

841
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:01,119
rare and less something else

842
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:08,119
Ave North as like have children does
right

843
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:15,160
and thanks to Microsoft further if that
huge business

844
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:22,410
yeah hola for that perfect it's good for
them too because their billing solution

845
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,390
and

846
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:28,759
citing then that film thanks a lot for
the air on conference pure fun

847
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,130
given me an opportunity to discuss some
other concepts that I have

848
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:36,190
and some other people then what that
mean and is my email ID

849
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:39,430
the slides will be up later on and thank
you very much

850
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:40,569
its
