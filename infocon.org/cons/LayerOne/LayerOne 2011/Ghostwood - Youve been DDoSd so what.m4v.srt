1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,029
hello yes

2
00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:09,379
%uh so go by Chris because my name's
kinda complicated to bring us

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,900
from Austria said as you have questions
you can dismiss case

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,410
I'm abandoned houses mediation for a
while now and I do some research

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,490
I am on no operation a botnet San

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,659
this kind of stuff in my spare time I'll
also professionally as well but

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:31,140
most which is actually hoping I'm so
what reaction would like to achieve with

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,539
this

9
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:35,170
but did your presentation s I am to look
at some other

10
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,290
technical aspects about you know good
enough service attack

11
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,190
but also all I'm look at them on the
medication side

12
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,339
what you can do to actually be more
efficient when you're done that in a

13
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,820
and that an attack I'll so that's that's

14
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,230
if I if I can did you could think about
changing it is how you prepare yourself

15
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,660
that will be be much successful talk now
I will not be able to teach in the state

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,349
machine PCB or any

17
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,789
up the other you know did the technical
stuff that you need to do that but you

18
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:05,590
might you know you have a lot of stuff
to

19
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:10,229
back to be learn on your own but let's
get started and see how it goes and you

20
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:12,720
have questions please feel free to ask
questions

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,000
actual like make this isn't active as
possible up

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,409
that's the first time I'm talking to a
on yes that's not very good at that

23
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:22,920
so I know there's a lot of video so if
you have questions something is not

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,460
clear

25
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,130
let me know I will definitely would like
to clear it so

26
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:31,170
%uh just the usual disclaimer opinions
expressed in this conditional

27
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,790
necessary to present this as my employer
on the topic %uh

28
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,329
and also each you don't understand
because it's big too fast and

29
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:43,110
with the accent just let me know I'll
try to slow down the middle call

30
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,820
out so I look at the business that was a
motivation I want considerations you can

31
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,320
have and what kinds missions you can

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,929
kinda think about and how to be better
than hope your money thing

33
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,439
as well as what are the different attack
types a

34
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,350
I'll try to make week was vacation of
some of them but then I want more

35
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,899
details cost find them by

36
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:06,990
they have USA stack there may be some

37
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,280
drums the different from other people
Cola Vick Asia

38
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,870
because Indian the internet stack the
implication that covers everything that

39
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,370
these

40
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,500
application presentation session that
you know it's I I was going to get a

41
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,770
more details they're so

42
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,730
don't get confused you'll hear something
called session then attacked when it

43
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,299
actually has been called a beautician
led by other people did you see for

44
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,349
they have a different preference model
for that I'm

45
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:36,090
day we already did you and your spouse
to have an ideal four you are and what

46
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,640
you can afford to hear some

47
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,790
what is what is it you know someone to
Eagles is not

48
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,929
so a lot of companies think with
something that is random that's never

49
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,010
going to happen to them

50
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,940
and then just like the walkers happens
one day and they're all we know

51
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,079
well that's not very creative you know
but that's not very productive for

52
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,040
projection a tool to the situation

53
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,440
yeah um and you can be the best you can
also

54
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,170
have up in a way insurance and the been
able to do with the situation

55
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,018
now when I see interest I would operate
more morning the next slide

56
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,659
but the most important thing is not bad
just back its coming your way

57
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:12,849
your site is most likely down but what
does that mean to you your

58
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:16,510
Eagle Ford are you losing X amount of
money you know that a lot of things that

59
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,399
the from there

60
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,290
and you know it's not the end of the
world for some companies may be in the

61
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,200
end the company

62
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,298
but %um I that's where you have to think
about

63
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:29,780
yet know how much a minute that don't
cost you and so on but we're going to

64
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,340
get into

65
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,849
for details I and another thing that
these of my misconceptions

66
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:37,869
you don't need a magical powers nor the
student will

67
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,260
be able to better yourself and to be
able to appropriately

68
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,329
act injected with the mouse is that you
really need to know what you doing doe

69
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,920
so you have qualified personnel and you
don't need to have many in the mood to

70
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,369
have

71
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,810
people didn't actually know what they're
doing and that's it

72
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,189
the at actually I have noticed that in
more we more rooms when there's

73
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:01,549
something going on in there are a lot of
people usually know what gets down

74
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:04,640
I in many cases I ahead to dissolved

75
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,010
running in another room with a colleague
of mine just working on a plan

76
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,518
executing the plan having a dreaded but
when you have a lot of people in their

77
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,090
own

78
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,620
doesn't work okay motivation so what is
the official why would somebody

79
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,358
effectuate a botnet

80
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,198
well you can have financial gain you
have political statement you have

81
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,889
you know though might lead to mister

82
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:30,270
he was it mostly for financial gain
complete statement so it could be

83
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,270
your competition for example you're
setting furniture on the Internet

84
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,770
and you have up competitor man doing

85
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,469
for sure the market they may be willing
to denounce the issue of course which is

86
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,600
probably not the best

87
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,759
example but just with anything that this
time since did you have to say oh and be

88
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,180
sure of the market people

89
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:52,169
sleep switch your competitor they
actually have done some studies that

90
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:55,240
show that huge a customer

91
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,540
buttresses I don't they always go back
to the previous supply into the used

92
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:03,570
and put up with the use you but your
available now they'll go to your

93
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,419
competition

94
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:07,599
and then from there on that would be
much less room for the competition I

95
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,620
also

96
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,060
usually takes about 45 seconds for users
to give up on the website you go upside

97
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,289
does not warrant that much

98
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:18,449
I'll soul you know be much you have to
be able to serve

99
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:22,400
a page and a function within 45 seconds
on my saying this

100
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,400
the kind of up you know weird Mobile
11.5 seconds

101
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,960
but again up think about it you can

102
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,698
be able to protect yourself against
thank you can begin a series but this

103
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,530
will cost you a lot more when you may be
able to sit with you a second

104
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,520
but again you may be able to sit within
four seconds and used to keep your

105
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,639
clients with much less investment so
it's

106
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,949
home a metre balance how much money you
spend

107
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:49,960
political statement actually a hectic is
a minimum

108
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,469
everybody's been talking about that
anonymous lately so I won't even

109
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,889
mention it a person to something's cell

110
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,940
the other one is I'm a quick and then
you I am

111
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,699
this is becoming less and less popular
but about 15 years ago this was probably

112
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:04,150
the

113
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,388
most you know the biggest driver Tarino
services

114
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:11,539
I'll nowadays much much less and the
kids usually don't have that much

115
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:13,199
resources

116
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,479
I'll if you need to have I once bought
net they will not only use it for

117
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:19,150
something else

118
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,840
so to use your bought net for the house
is usually means you're losing a lot of

119
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,568
money

120
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:27,100
because you could be using that botnet
stupid cuts impossible's

121
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,410
million units to Prudential said
something else over right now the house

122
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,680
in this news release is a cute invite

123
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,770
botnets did up but dole's the Chipmunks
several stages you

124
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:42,500
stealing finish information sending spam
and signed that black is the be badly so

125
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,810
they cannot be used for any of the
previous

126
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,810
but this is so damn the drop into the
United States this

127
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,569
dean of the state first people said
sexually sell both missed each other but

128
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:53,690
I want more details

129
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:59,090
little later up now thing except the
look at the farm considerations

130
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,138
how is it now so is different from let's
see you coming up with a purely for new

131
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:04,090
product

132
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,258
and then CNN I'll pointing their you
know

133
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:11,270
advertising on their major you're having
a like having a Art Deco

134
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,400
about your product or you have a lot of
requests how is that different from

135
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,080
somebody securing millions gets per
second against your site

136
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,210
not very different right I'll

137
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,258
how is it different be one of your
eyepiece where you're coming from your

138
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:28,919
front that's

139
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:32,680
is being attacked and completed taken
offline

140
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,520
mmm if you had a proper backup site you
from you or did you already sent by

141
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,198
I hope in the standby of a call your
backup safeties or did they come over

142
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,990
so you know where you can also consider
this is an outage so when you're being

143
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,110
your planning

144
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,289
you can actually look at the house
expenses outage

145
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:55,500
and you can see for example I want to be
able to stay have a gigabit

146
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,530
up traffic for let's see 1 million
packets second

147
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:02,258
against me and do not call this
knowledge condition that mean that you

148
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:05,139
just get a provision in this city gives
that you can think to some of the

149
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:06,129
traffic

150
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:12,020
and has to be up now you can also say no
no I really need actually think it's

151
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,109
of traffic per second to be give you
checks and

152
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,590
against me and ice you need to be up
about that

153
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:22,060
well just spend more money your more
free bet

154
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,210
there of course other ways you can also
use stripping providers this is the

155
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,299
companies that provide that this series

156
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,509
you can also think about moving stuff to
the cloud well

157
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:33,750
cause the new mail the Internet anyway
so you know you can have

158
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,019
from things that scale now of what is on
the end there's that the stateless

159
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:41,089
so you can watch on past the front dance

160
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:45,890
on Amazon or other providers and have
them props your traffic so they can take

161
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,880
a lot of the abuse and actually deliver
to you

162
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,230
only the the gym in traffic up

163
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,430
so they don't love with sexually skill
that but again eat some interviews

164
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,109
knowing

165
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,560
your company how much I mean it's about
time for that minute

166
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,560
don't own costume I'm in terms of

167
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,829
a lost sales or even your name

168
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,839
because you know for some companies to
be down even for five minutes that's

169
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,899
really big big big problem

170
00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:13,910
like going to be down for five minutes
everybody's going to laugh at them

171
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:18,779
not be really happy about it now for you
know my pop shop to be down for 15-20

172
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:19,260
minutes

173
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,550
an hour maybe nobody will care

174
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,829
I'm some again it's about changing about
it

175
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,360
this is not something that happens
randomly it happens at some point in

176
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,350
time

177
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,630
I'm how big your profile customer you
are also

178
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:38,320
company you are depends on you know how
much your titties

179
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,560
also depends what you say or what you do
online

180
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,250
so you issue which makes you may be a
little more prone than others

181
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,589
up so consider your risk and based on
your risk

182
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,670
assess how much you want to spend a
question of how much it will cost you

183
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,769
should not so

184
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:57,589
those those defectors and change your
attitude you can be bad

185
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:01,220
arm and it's not just like you're going
to be over one actually

186
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,990
in the end though show some pictures
some just is based on the

187
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,350
Arbor networks report on and

188
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,769
you see that things can get pretty
brutal but they did

189
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:14,850
like brutal the four times a year for

190
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,190
you know over the internet or at least
that's what is based on the Symbian

191
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:25,180
they have failed to watch population so
the scenario call that a representative

192
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,390
ok im she was about the trust is a
mission issuances

193
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,660
basically many did you pay ahead of time
to be protected against something and

194
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,170
then

195
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,189
you you know it may happen that may not
happen

196
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:39,180
I am and that's why you the with
insurance this is the investment you do

197
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,670
in equipment to be able to

198
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,089
take a dubious I am things that you
really need to K

199
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:48,300
dole apart from the chest you need to
have a sit in the spa spent

200
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,800
plant even if these years response plant
means I had to call that guy

201
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,359
but people on the on the job your
operations at the zoo in this is very

202
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,760
junior

203
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,380
people you need to have demanded a have
to know what to do when something like

204
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,630
this happens they also have to have some
threatening to be able to

205
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:10,320
distinguish between the houses and urged
him up to exigent some

206
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,329
you also need to have some tools as I
mentioned your

207
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:18,769
and also partnerships partnerships up
tend to be fairly

208
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:22,920
useful if you're a while just to provide
the city is your having

209
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,979
committee for about 50 to 60 commits for
more

210
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,310
upcoming %um you are going to be in a
very strong position

211
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:34,140
to be a button with the larger providers
because at this point

212
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,640
arm you normally will not have any
problems which more than offset its

213
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,790
attacks

214
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,529
and if something is large enough to
actually cause problems

215
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:45,689
that means that it will be causing
problems to your up

216
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,730
they don't up to your upstream provider
or providers

217
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:54,160
because you can't 50g you probably
should at least three or four openings

218
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,980
so nor the exact people dead that you
need to talk to

219
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,990
don't don't have 'em number up for them
dock and you know you called them and

220
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,040
they spent half an hour to first level

221
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,380
technician then another half an hour per
second level technician

222
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,680
and all this time you actually know have
did names exactly we need to talk to you

223
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,899
update them for one from time to time
you did in your area just

224
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:18,709
you those relationships because when
when things happen you need to be able

225
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:19,089
to

226
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:22,589
escalate fast and I'm I have found this
to be one of them

227
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:25,750
very very efficient ways

228
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,750
as I said within just you know you may
have no blends properly

229
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,940
maybe this how it looks from your
business perspective go

230
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,880
you know you maybe don't may be cheaper
to be done for today then having to buy

231
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,269
extra half-million dollars

232
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:42,160
German you know this is a business and
I'm a bit much a business guy but

233
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,550
I'm just trying to raise the awareness
about this because a lot of people

234
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,089
I tried to get here from mediation and
they don't

235
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:53,589
give anything from there business from
from the business side

236
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:57,500
and then they did blames when something
happens and they don't they will to

237
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,839
respond what this is

238
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:02,639
basically a failure on their site to
communicate properly the risks

239
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,589
to their management at least that's how
I view it

240
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:09,790
okay so in peacetime have mentioned have
an incident response plan

241
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:14,510
I am you should have morning think set
up ahead of time boys weren't important

242
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:18,180
all if you are suffering some that were
given I'm not saying it's now six but

243
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:18,989
whatever it is

244
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,320
you need to know how it is actually
impacting you and

245
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,480
you not know how it's impacting how do
you molded when you do something to me

246
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,959
begin its actually working

247
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:31,800
is no way be just for example ever seen
you know we have like 20 levels that you

248
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,709
can pour in you

249
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:36,500
the combinations do we stop slow is but
if you have some money thing actually

250
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,560
see how that goes to changing

251
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,779
and arm what is happening as you are
applying your changes

252
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,889
I also lemme know when you need to
escalate a

253
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:49,829
especially prior arrangement this is
very interesting point here because

254
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,888
not the damage will do something but in
many cases

255
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:57,459
you can know what i'm looking into
getting no service attacks or other

256
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:00,699
condition similar to that and they may
not be aware

257
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:03,729
and then when you goal next time to ask
for more year

258
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,860
or did you want to say hey expect too
much time fighting this

259
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,350
a the just don't know about it and you
they don't

260
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,100
although it's not a problem for them
that they have to so and it's not a

261
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,769
problem for them that they would like to
invest money in

262
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:19,870
so it's about the speedy I really hate
to kind of push on the business side but

263
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,050
it in many cases it is a matter of the
business

264
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,750
some I'll

265
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,760
wanting backs up as I mentioned this is
all the

266
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,800
demanded that important the most mmm in
his video from neglect that many

267
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,430
companies that thinking about money

268
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,630
thing when they already have had some
kind of problems and

269
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:42,630
from have suffered significant I'll
teach times

270
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:46,170
mum and is a mention here

271
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,639
you all up may be ending of service
attack

272
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:54,100
but into your users addiction suffering
and to you you cannot be given the page

273
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,360
within those four seconds

274
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,240
stocking and beginning you have some
problem but it's not that he is serious

275
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:00,769
but I'll

276
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:04,139
right is used to service you use it
everything's working fine you have more

277
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:05,010
time for action

278
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:10,319
act am you all you don't have business
impact basically you may be paying more

279
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,769
for your internet but it's not like
you're not saying

280
00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:16,560
on your website or your website is down
I'm

281
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,079
you can use in you should be shit you
should use internal meetings in nineteen

282
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:20,540
years

283
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,930
you should be mantegna systems infinity
and externally because

284
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:27,370
in many cases something may not be
visible from the outside

285
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:31,459
especially when you have just two being
I'm you all when you had your

286
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:34,939
what we think it will be only made
things begin to different data centers

287
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,880
you have

288
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,870
I'll but from the point of view of the
end you that you want to see how the

289
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,709
GOP's often uses between data centers
and how its accounting for the logging

290
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,180
system data centers

291
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,579
so you should not have external mic
thing you may actually have everything

292
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:51,689
looking good on the site and then uses
may still be going to

293
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,940
a certain data center and be suffering

294
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,940
I'll higher late that's because
developed it to the US one that actually

295
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,290
someone in Asia

296
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,680
instead of being served by what would
they send the asian teen asian

297
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,410
or other things that have seen is a and
their autonomous systems moved around

298
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:12,350
spammers do that sometimes and some
that's something that these

299
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:16,720
a yo really want to have external mic
thing question

300
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,000
yeah decide whether there is i I've
noticed is that sometimes people seem

301
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,070
that there's a denial of service attack

302
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,079
because the look at a measured by
simultaneous connections

303
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,269
and I'll go out but really what's
happening is that

304
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:32,920
they have a performance issue with their
site which means that the collision of

305
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,889
people simultaneously using it is
increasing

306
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:39,519
because he said he is taking longer than
just moreover lot

307
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,449
you I guess it's just not a matter
marido really understanding what metrics

308
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:44,740
indicate

309
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,940
performance from within the cypresses
actual

310
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,730
unique trafficking estimating this point
a.m.

311
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,870
so do I need to be in this for the rest
of the audience

312
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:58,190
you guys get that okay IOM

313
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:02,550
that's a very valid point actually from
no infuse lays down I'll go into the

314
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,990
into looking at the different
bottlenecks because I'll

315
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,120
action and she was there okay

316
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,159
I'll go back to that in a second but
that's that's a really good point

317
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,610
you need to understand your vacation you
need to know when you actually did you

318
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,240
know service

319
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,620
or when I'll trees up with your big
media site when Michael Jackson died

320
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:23,619
all men all traffic through the roof

321
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:28,079
so and you made you okay with last year

322
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,480
losing customers because you don't want
to spend the extra year

323
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,020
to actually be able to save to serve
those peace now these

324
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,530
10 years ago that was kinda the case
know they spied on BBC

325
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,610
did businesses may have an excuse when
opal

326
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,879
to be able to sift then buy it or even
fifteen times that normal traffic

327
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,480
you read that's not a problem but you
don't forget it's a business decision

328
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,530
it's not so much taking criticism I am

329
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:57,010
okay in the heat of the moment up what
action what what is actually happening

330
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,789
kinda back to your point actually you
need to North given its not like the

331
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:03,840
site is down the site is done is a very
very very big

332
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,100
I'll wait to see that something's not
working unical

333
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,740
is the DNS not the sewing I we unable to
establish connections

334
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,559
establishing connections to a balanced
but they're from their own bouncy

335
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,970
sitting there with us it was actually
down

336
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,559
I was feeling in the connection they
want the old us that there are a lot of

337
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,410
things that

338
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:25,049
UV me to look into the details actually
were based on facts

339
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:28,260
I defected the previous week you get
something that kinda looks like this

340
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,169
thing and the problem was something else

341
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:33,620
yet maybe it but it may not be so focus
on the facts

342
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,590
domes look at um what he's got

343
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,980
I'm just some awareness that certain
types of attacks going on the internet

344
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,500
that particular week or

345
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,700
because usually they come caffeine in
you know

346
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,380
somebody finds an attack everybody gets
tacked but a

347
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,679
look at the facts seizure running out of
stock its usual running out of

348
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,049
connections on the wheel balancer

349
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:57,418
but whatever's happening that just be
focused on the fact

350
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:01,240
and old on what you're good things good
things here but you need to be able to

351
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,330
look at the facts behind it

352
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,730
so I'm collect data

353
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,679
up from your hotel so from your sisters
from your you know network year

354
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:14,650
catches traffic that's also something
that this video from the elected

355
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:19,240
evening many networks the way they've
designed these naughty it choke point

356
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,710
where you can actually stop to check
traffic

357
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:26,299
because in many cases a dole losses and
directly connected to the center of a

358
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,879
short hair or the graphs and data
connections usually

359
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,620
energy or multiple 10 G's and it's very
difficult XD policy for their

360
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,750
so think about this case what will
happen if I have my site possibly

361
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,289
crashing

362
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:41,299
or if I have something cheating and I
don't know what it is

363
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:44,520
well if the problems with the will
balance it and you don't have to wait

364
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,010
recent the device between 2007 doubt
that

365
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:50,100
you will have no wait to see what is
going on there so

366
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,860
think about that when you're designing
the network a and

367
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,780
if it's not something that's shooting
that will be awesome body skimming the

368
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,470
coast

369
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:00,630
but on this beat them that's cheap you
know you can just go to speed up on the

370
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,490
fly

371
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:05,919
a hand on it no one seems focused dump
on the plane because you normally don't

372
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,409
fifties damn and other power tools
constantly stalled as much as you please

373
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:10,320
to get benefit

374
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,418
so up again have response plan

375
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:17,580
you know okay I have this kind of half
possible you know cities

376
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,039
is hitting those machines my steps code
is going to call his guy

377
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:26,070
he spoke to speed them and on this beat
them collect X amount of traffic and

378
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,580
that's it

379
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,299
I am and very important but this post
last executed

380
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:34,309
a so you may not get the inside the
first time it happens

381
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:36,889
no matter how smart you are there may
always be factors that you have not

382
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,179
considered so

383
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:41,570
arm don't go into up you know I

384
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:45,289
but at least three you know drama this
message is don't don't get stuck there

385
00:20:45,289 --> 00:20:48,460
everything you have a plan make sure
these things not going to

386
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,929
action did your site further down here
that some level religion that point

387
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:56,960
and execute the plan after the pennies
executed a

388
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,960
morning to but look at him what your
mind getting and see if the problem is

389
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,600
being a result or not

390
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,620
if it doesn't work ok included in your
plan look at the facts use jewell

391
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:10,260
won't be able to pour some information
based on what you DN

392
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:14,260
in if something change she didn't change

393
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,039
okay this took a little longer does then
came up

394
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:21,830
anyway so affect text their menu
especially from

395
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:25,928
classified index I'm obviously medic
anti-semitic

396
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:30,210
usually asthmatic a box out more useful
for a text because they have to spend

397
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,130
less resources

398
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:35,220
am getting cause more more damage but
you have a botnet in many cases that

399
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,740
doesn't really matter systematic thanks
just like a simple get food

400
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,280
is actually very efficient in taking
sides to

401
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,480
I am him only listing officially
dismissed

402
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,870
Inouye's exhaustive asthmatic

403
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:55,870
Dennis place she said the DNS query you
know how big is the US play

404
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:00,629
abs I'll eight bytes wall

405
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,220
if you can't get that back it's about 50
bytes that ongoing exactly that

406
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,940
independent the letter that I could you
looking up

407
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:11,510
know if the second just 15 ID's is a is
an ass

408
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:14,850
well you're looking at 512 bytes don't
pack

409
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:18,110
so if I was to send the idea a

410
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:22,178
DNS plateful this Dennis Siver over
there and I for lunch

411
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:25,940
my source I came to be your IP because
I'm attacking you

412
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,650
I'm going to send 50 buys their election
64 and then

413
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:33,070
did you send 512 to use of shit I
immediately gain

414
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:36,270
what weight advantage so if I can send
one megabit

415
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:39,309
out a different result was I can have
aidid you

416
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:44,899
it's also out this is an example for us
medic at that

417
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,179
he in a sec believe that one other

418
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:51,890
focuses was the amplification factor for
unisex I'm query

419
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,250
much higher yes these days yeah yet
they're also what are the implications

420
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,120
action on DNS sec

421
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,168
a and you doing some kind of wow just so
bee

422
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:05,120
because a depending on availability you
may be.

423
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,090
you may have to in calculating the sign
your answers

424
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,139
so somebody came in some way make your
challenges will be

425
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,710
think that the data center walls you
know 'cause on and off on and off you

426
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,610
may actually at

427
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:21,840
are also at X 30 a hold on the actually
DNS server

428
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,250
but the that's a that's a good point
I'll okay

429
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:29,440
souls a schematic schematic reflect as I
just mentioned actually

430
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,950
attack with where you actually for your
a source up

431
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:37,210
at this in the US but he's also defected
that was about fifteen years ago there

432
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,059
was an effect called

433
00:23:38,059 --> 00:23:42,690
slip which was basically being the the
broadcast and the Seven Network and then

434
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,990
everybody went respond to you and then
he forced the address %uh the source

435
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:50,020
that this so the ICMP echo request
packet

436
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,200
days with all this will go to somebody
else

437
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,200
so to a fully subscribed across the
network you can get one

438
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,940
250 implications which is in the bed

439
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,220
I'm be a now another question missions
but for services produced

440
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,919
watched the attacks so before his wings
and a lot of packets

441
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,529
and you consume a lot of bandwidth and
you make this view all

442
00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:15,919
pro-peace you for you cause high secure
because of the number of packets

443
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,320
and also somewhat a most cases the

444
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,770
at least several blocks away from the
connection between because you can see

445
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:26,150
the increase in traffic on the face and
anything can figure out where they're

446
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,210
coming from

447
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:31,529
I'm did they think I'm more concerned
about it %uh the 162 pics

448
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:35,460
those attacks usually I'm evade ship
very small

449
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,770
up traffic footprint but these old
installed the changes somewhat unique

450
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,279
at in yeah I'm 6.2 the state machine

451
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,570
though target system and it is also keen

452
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,779
asthmatic the social position so for
example if you have a weighty

453
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:54,179
I against think about a at his book

454
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:57,640
if you haven't as book a $5 million
users you can send the Wildcats

455
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,090
equity so this end of quote covers
quatie

456
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:04,570
the result is over the five million
years is being made them or at least the

457
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:08,668
the database is this behind us has to go
to all those same

458
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:12,419
to something out or even more
complicated great and you can send many

459
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:14,570
of these initial these cost you

460
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:18,330
what I'll simple get with this shares
will be

461
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:21,689
under 200 bytes you're sending 200 bytes

462
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,820
in one direction and that your causing
the Cebu on the machines

463
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:29,710
bike and you may make it then if there
were actually many many years ago

464
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:34,000
know that I hate article but to Steak N
Shake responded well

465
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,940
based his issue network because
apparently only had four pence

466
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:42,559
I'm and difficult process a and the
price is the place

467
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,620
and I fire for place against this
particular

468
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,760
database and it was gone for several
hours actually wanna be admitted to

469
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,450
going to stop the machine submitted to
cover

470
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,630
so you know that Symantec overstate that
serve an example state

471
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:00,740
affect other one he said the nobody is
safe with me that's that's kinda funny

472
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,289
but has been over 10 years now the
templates to effective and

473
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:07,500
kinda funny but yeah these two are I'm

474
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,049
watch him for his work will look into
just like to size down

475
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:14,590
%uh another thing I wanted to look at
his best get there so I'm

476
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:18,500
YouTube using as your coming soon and
thank you

477
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,860
send the packet told 22 the victim in
you know twenty-four to the source

478
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,729
the source ID love the sender which will
result even though I'm

479
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:30,419
victim responded with a scene act to the

480
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:33,980
forms IP address so do we see in this
traffic for them

481
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,200
that will not look like anything
specific I

482
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,260
buddies what amount of traffic then the

483
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:45,140
this may cause some you know some
morning to go off

484
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,510
usually the backscatter from a fax is
very small and it's not that

485
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:51,970
the relevant but depending on how you do
your stuff

486
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:55,620
you may have a broken that on them just
no random number generators to me and

487
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,939
the boys in with the same

488
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,070
source IP address which is not your
source a few but if somebody else and

489
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,700
they may actually get the four diff

490
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,570
c-max so keep that in mind that you may
be also seen back skip sometimes

491
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:09,720
you may not be direct effect I'll

492
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,539
in all cases at the house if this is a
game apiece be resource exhaustion as I

493
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:14,690
said it could be banned when

494
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:18,380
it could be the ability of the up from
the vices or switching devices to

495
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:18,909
process

496
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:23,140
X amount of tax per second it could be
in the ability of a database

497
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,140
on a web server to from to have

498
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:29,779
X amount of waste per second it could be
storage you could be appalling ran the

499
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:30,980
fastest settler

500
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,169
you know than anything that may have the
temporary directory

501
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:37,720
said that X megabytes and you may follow
it up and then as a result nobody is

502
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,809
gonna put that fast that said

503
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:43,168
I'm it could be Cebu as I mentioned you
could just give her some

504
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:46,669
attacks where Cebu just chosen tries to
do something but

505
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:52,440
you know it eats stays busy and doesn't
have a legitimate customers

506
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,409
um and you had implications specific
class where you actually exist

507
00:27:56,409 --> 00:28:00,820
a.m. exporting specific for within a
specific application which you have

508
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:05,168
researched and while those very very
rare that

509
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:08,960
dead the most damaging was because
usually no bus to all kinds and

510
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,289
IDS is because that mean that somebody
the water research on you

511
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:17,549
and normally the will be

512
00:28:17,549 --> 00:28:22,260
they don't be just like it so for very
big very clear on the lower level so the

513
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,140
specs on

514
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,360
the IDS not find anything that he's
unusual

515
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,549
I'll but you know you we should heart so

516
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:35,049
that's there's been a actually yen I
only remember one that I had to do with

517
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:39,710
and I'm yet i'd at least maybe my will
be knowing the place where I have with

518
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:42,980
this hasn't happened there was maybe
happens about the other places

519
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:46,260
I'm some cases depending on how the
effect is motivated

520
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,590
you know it depends on how patient there
they may actually go away miss you don't

521
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,490
seem to be

522
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:55,000
dying fast use your site doesn't go down

523
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,700
they may actually go away I have seen
cases where they will be smaller

524
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,330
extra long for a long time when the site
is not properly joined any cost because

525
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:05,480
all you do something you fix the fees
have the chance to

526
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:09,250
said goes up then the attacker tracing
send some more

527
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,659
my traffic so issue

528
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:16,169
stay up they don't have we can all how
far

529
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:19,620
from exhaustion and resources your she
constantly goal down

530
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,309
and then come up because added new
machines or you change something they

531
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:25,158
know that you're about the age

532
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:28,480
so it's much easier for them to go in
for some more boats send

533
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,580
attack against you I'm

534
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,879
so in a way up you know the way you
stand on the net also

535
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,549
is important okay a Texas so I said that
in many ways to classify defects

536
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:44,179
I will just focus on them %uh Texas is
based on the

537
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:47,770
on the the CPE model or on your sexxy I
wud

538
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:51,320
on US air mother but 12 show you that

539
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,389
the application they tend to be more
though is actually coming application

540
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,380
presentation session there

541
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,020
I'll somewhat confusing the network that
is called into in the network in the

542
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,629
other in that the scheme although but

543
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:06,870
anyway I just a little history yet few
models clinton's long long before you're

544
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,629
someone else. I love them

545
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:13,649
costs have seen from you know in the
internet don't quite fit in USA mobile

546
00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:16,979
that's the latest just the skeptical
mother

547
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,659
Sonam lead one to attacks can you give
me some ideas action you know what

548
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:22,270
stands out

549
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:26,750
what it is that they want you

550
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,820
am

551
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:32,600
okay why it is all things I'll cable
okay if I don't think it's

552
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:37,549
years leaders switches him

553
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:42,590
okay so let's see how well can with what
kind of attacks can you go against their

554
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,010
will

555
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:46,540
and he's available

556
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:50,129
yeah back home they've always been at to

557
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,510
are noise I have my saliva samples yes

558
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:58,200
okay electrical interference

559
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,590
great in life yes this from

560
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:08,149
young so now look at look at all these
polls somewhat localized at home having

561
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:08,470
you

562
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:12,370
name all those is because they're
somewhat localized you need to have

563
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:17,209
axis up some what's have axis course the
physical location that's why does it not

564
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,240
that popular

565
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,540
I is a general internet vandalism
because that means that you like

566
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,639
actually have to invest some money to
fly somewhere actually if risk

567
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,950
to be called by the police which is the
of some for the different

568
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:31,340
now if somebody wants to take a dang
they will have a bad cold

569
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,629
do actually have to put it on the sea
and

570
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:38,240
I'm young so I'll

571
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,240
located connecting cables posted and so
on I okay

572
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:48,530
left with the ex p

573
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:52,950
actions you know classify that as they
are for up

574
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,320
%uh 10 that's a good one without

575
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,939
okay

576
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,530
I have once general I seventy words

577
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,668
UK different well I don't know

578
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:10,740
actually what one thing I want to
mention before us that we don't get this

579
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,870
almost you know them you can actually
have for overflow condition

580
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:18,659
other I things that the exporting
improper passing of the pro quo here

581
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,190
there's

582
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:22,740
I'm both I did not explicitly state but
that actually possible

583
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,900
each wanna get except for level one
basically I'm but you can have but

584
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,610
problems

585
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:30,899
implement bet bus am but things happen

586
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,100
and Europe is actually one of the
examples in this

587
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,530
a when you have I P sweet overlapping

588
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:41,059
segments this was causing the limits
couldn't crush

589
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:44,690
it was about ten years ago om
fortunately we don't have

590
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:48,270
from from that such as that type but
good too

591
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:55,270
no keep in mind therefore seen floods
was already mentioned

592
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,240
are

593
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,029
excellent

594
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:05,269
or condition they were in general so the
same thing but that

595
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:08,789
for what else it will be only a state
connections States

596
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:12,330
mmm what does

597
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:16,529
K seem to last a 14-foot you name it
anything that

598
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:20,110
any flag that can be set in the back to
get half I

599
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:23,979
why is it so important what what would
seem for your own exporting the BBG

600
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,669
overhauls

601
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:28,149
mortgagee human actions and inactions
some waste defend against that

602
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:31,350
we can digest the food you're eating
something else I'm

603
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,509
you have a ice tea set in a package

604
00:33:34,509 --> 00:33:39,539
um the postseason that the has to go to
the entire state they would at least

605
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:43,408
every single connection it is handling
and see hey do I have

606
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:46,950
a connection from these I P two-d_ zaidi
from the sport disbarred

607
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:51,330
and then only way finds that connection
can actually applied to the citadel

608
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:54,990
so if you have toward balancing that
he's going to continue learning about

609
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:58,980
$7.8 million connections because it's
just to watch fireman said was behind it

610
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,970
and she send a reset I could be to have
to go to although sessions

611
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:07,019
and make sure that you know the I texted
back and does not match

612
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:10,809
any of them before that she drops the
packet so from that point of view on

613
00:34:10,809 --> 00:34:14,440
at st. will be much more expensive than
a scene attack up now

614
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,599
ship only 100 connection see that they
will obviously have that would be more

615
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,290
expensive because you have to do more

616
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:22,879
calculations into into about the picture
did it didn't seem hokey

617
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,168
and what is you're going to second so

618
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:29,328
another one on that for techies connect
the doc actually

619
00:34:29,329 --> 00:34:32,770
I'm it's also more just look at these
options this when somebody connects and

620
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,899
disconnects Stockport

621
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:38,750
they can also loved jet but this will be
more of a session that effect but

622
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:42,210
connect disconnect the pic is like
getting disconnected connecting

623
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,809
disconnecting connecting disconnecting

624
00:34:43,809 --> 00:34:47,770
does anybody know what will happen if I
connect and disconnect the festival's

625
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:52,418
time with

626
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:57,129
banquet why do you have time what am

627
00:34:57,129 --> 00:35:00,390
yet I'll excellent

628
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:04,970
call so up going on it s second so that
some of the getting in for joining us

629
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:08,759
I and yes I was actually thinking about
their 40s moulin

630
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,970
I'm glenn was something that was again
used only about 12 years ago was when

631
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:13,500
you have

632
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,700
packets and that has the same sources
and this nation IP address

633
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,649
and is not confuse them did the at
though it was the next attack

634
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:22,970
specifically intellectually

635
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:26,209
cash to come so happens

636
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:29,589
began left for because it is exporting
it should lead up

637
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:33,619
that if if she had to be against these
people that's what I forgot to mention

638
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:36,790
his other way issue just about five
years or so kisses

639
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,950
you or because first be that the there
five

640
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:44,328
I already mentioned get fourths what he
sees one of the examples this is when

641
00:35:44,329 --> 00:35:45,200
you have a connection

642
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,419
open and use and gather by Heather not
something that is actually more

643
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,770
efficient than that

644
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:53,869
I'm is from issue open

645
00:35:53,869 --> 00:35:58,880
up fourth so you open port 80 for
example issues testing bite bite bite

646
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,970
I'll when you sending headed by heather
is warnings

647
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:06,808
use you have some ability to actually
passed the heathers

648
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:11,500
and cancel the connection different
that's up to his different ways you can

649
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,030
write the play in the DEC

650
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:16,670
take some that the person that in the
head that being said against you

651
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:20,210
and possibly you know they said the
connection before

652
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:24,170
a just wasted too much time for you now
when its bite bite bite and when there

653
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,790
is no newline in it

654
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:29,650
it starts to open these before the first
landed call girls girls girls girls

655
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,359
girls

656
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:34,119
I am I have seen software that would
actually go pee much

657
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:39,079
and do 50g something about a cat percent
every second

658
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:43,970
50,000 characters before action is off
to the side at a North

659
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:48,270
I don't think I'm interested in that
connection so yet think about if you're

660
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,150
running Apache

661
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:53,579
just kinda chillin that means you have
to come up with connections in bed along

662
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:57,119
and if I have to send I'll bite

663
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,880
a second that needs to come that bites
second against the budget we're at the

664
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,440
education there with Olin corporation
that the 65

665
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,250
at packets what is that we're gonna have
thinking

666
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:11,619
15k traffic connection E fifteen cubits
per second

667
00:37:11,619 --> 00:37:14,750
you can do that with more than you can
keep your budget PC

668
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:18,549
I'll so that's another

669
00:37:18,549 --> 00:37:22,060
that protect up I don't think his name
actually from

670
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,920
they should be there was some
speculation since this was something

671
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,910
similar but the

672
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,940
I come 320 arm

673
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:32,569
okay left six

674
00:37:32,569 --> 00:37:35,869
presentation that this is where all the
different following colleagues examined

675
00:37:35,869 --> 00:37:36,690
some

676
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:41,549
said where

677
00:37:41,549 --> 00:37:46,280
you get a very high pressure good one
from like that 02 that file

678
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:51,030
present 0 and then if they have like a
something that across the US

679
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:54,390
expecting for an hour in which I don't
know if I'll memory or something like

680
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:54,828
that

681
00:37:54,829 --> 00:37:58,339
that's been going on doesn't up

682
00:37:58,339 --> 00:38:04,009
anything else

683
00:38:04,009 --> 00:38:07,180
you okay Vegas on and as an example

684
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:10,549
to have

685
00:38:10,549 --> 00:38:16,079
a wall while is defined as wall to wall
to is defined as well one thing you've

686
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,589
ok and that you have a cousin

687
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:21,609
that there was also another one actually
this one

688
00:38:21,609 --> 00:38:25,009
I'll post be said it was was wasn't
doing much

689
00:38:25,009 --> 00:38:28,269
no it was actually in February this year
to advocate

690
00:38:28,269 --> 00:38:32,038
from and there was another said the
victim of accidents were basically

691
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:35,200
using the fact that by applying watching

692
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,240
you can have huge expansion

693
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,430
I am once the document the sparse
another one

694
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:45,740
left six I could be just expensive place
just think about a

695
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:49,319
asking I website to generate the very

696
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:52,808
you know graves best finish that
comprises collecting information from a

697
00:38:52,809 --> 00:38:54,900
different place in you that many times

698
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:00,359
okay their seven that's kinda tricky one

699
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:04,690
were you we can call spam and shit shit
up I'm I know that I'm not exactly

700
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:08,630
picture with the last seven thanks but
act anyway

701
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:12,349
second justin is crazy now servicing the
DNS said when I'm

702
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:16,369
because it's very going is a session
attack it could be spam

703
00:39:16,369 --> 00:39:19,829
black fax is actually an attack that is
their seven

704
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:24,690
back exactly

705
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:28,170
been so yeah from

706
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:32,190
and you know you can just skip something
that sustains the user which would

707
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,039
effectively be there Symantec

708
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:37,390
Mary I also want to speak

709
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:41,640
I most if you know what the CG is
bombing not most the actual you know

710
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,549
what disappears

711
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:47,150
a few things to consider on TCP I'm a
lot of people are bashing it and how the

712
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:50,089
people did very bad job about designing
the protocol

713
00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:55,200
you know I can have a different take on
that um because this protocol designed

714
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:55,598
the first

715
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,960
I did she was from 1981 King I'm

716
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,319
yeah I was born but it wasn't long
before that so if something was able to

717
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:04,589
survive for that long

718
00:40:04,589 --> 00:40:08,450
II other about Shannon's and I the other
learn it

719
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:13,730
so Tom there is a lot to be learned from
the Odyssey for TCP

720
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:17,700
it's just amazing how much information
there's every time I did you decide to

721
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,710
see I find something else that I haven't

722
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:23,309
paid attention to the biggest I'm so II
based on the

723
00:40:23,309 --> 00:40:27,339
imported you to read between I 790 and
they're also follow up with some

724
00:40:27,339 --> 00:40:31,650
deseo d your success on but it fairly
interesting information

725
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:36,880
I am no I don't how many how much does
you want me to go into the back

726
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,910
a into the Heather yes

727
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:45,549
okay so we we stuffed with the source
portents the nation what's all this is

728
00:40:45,549 --> 00:40:46,130
the 5-2

729
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:50,680
an address a player it left for address
at Liberty will be the IP address

730
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:54,558
address it lived would be the mac
address the frame um

731
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:58,190
so should we have to address it left for
which is for Spartans teenage pop

732
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:01,579
we also have cyclic a sequence number
and I am

733
00:41:01,579 --> 00:41:05,289
acknowledgement number balls used in
order to keep

734
00:41:05,289 --> 00:41:08,339
to see it out she have all the data that
was sent to you

735
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:12,740
and I am basically this will be used for
they go off said

736
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:17,129
used tool what you have options in the
file you actually can

737
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,250
said you can specify how far along a

738
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:23,430
the pack and your did the actual date in
the back stops

739
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:26,819
then you have the six flags which a a
genetic knowledge when bush

740
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:32,259
reset seen in from goal overseen fee in
the set then

741
00:41:32,259 --> 00:41:35,670
acknowledgement in a few minutes urgent
and push a half

742
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:39,650
the following implications if bush he
said that means that the receiving

743
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:40,460
application

744
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:45,369
at the CD bistec pistol immediately push
today to give the cation

745
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:49,069
under normal operation what will happen
is you have two sites talking to each

746
00:41:49,069 --> 00:41:49,529
other

747
00:41:49,529 --> 00:41:53,640
and in the despues de que has buffers so
when this case ends

748
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,098
what information will stay in the
Beaufort do the police when they it will

749
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:58,569
be for stuff to the implication

750
00:41:58,569 --> 00:42:02,269
I am in she said the bush like all

751
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:06,189
that means the the moment the back at
the scene even if the bodies 50 bucks

752
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:06,470
for

753
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:09,740
it will be sent up why is this important
well

754
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,459
whenever you moving from from the spec
which i think a myspace

755
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:18,390
to use myspace a you have complex which
context which is extremely expensive

756
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:22,368
extremely extremely stressed so issue in
talking to web server

757
00:42:22,369 --> 00:42:26,279
in use and bite bite bite up packets

758
00:42:26,279 --> 00:42:29,380
yet warm up but he was doing something
that the actually a

759
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,410
normal I just system may not catch

760
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:35,680
up but he kept bush like said in each of
these

761
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,279
this will cause every time for their
contract we passed through the probe to

762
00:42:39,279 --> 00:42:40,009
the skating

763
00:42:40,009 --> 00:42:43,920
sent to the process userspace which will
take a lot of resources

764
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,000
I'm next choice at some point if this is
houston

765
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,420
up in communication if you have
something that said

766
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:54,369
this notion other back to me kitchen
where you can have a lot of that going

767
00:42:54,369 --> 00:42:57,549
green then you can send out-of-band data
which is very important

768
00:42:57,549 --> 00:43:01,940
just be taken care of first I'm not
quite like the push like but

769
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:04,989
I'm dead by mentioning it

770
00:43:04,989 --> 00:43:08,720
0 there was an attack called when you
close them ago what action you could

771
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,700
exploit this to close the windows como

772
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:14,348
just improper implementation of the out
a band-aid peddling

773
00:43:14,349 --> 00:43:17,700
I'm some window

774
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:21,828
outweighs wendell we do is when 22 but
it's just talking to each other

775
00:43:21,829 --> 00:43:25,309
wanna thank you sequence number and then
this guy

776
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:28,839
acknowledges sequence number and says he
I receive that they'd

777
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:32,210
up to that point actually squats number
plus one and then gives

778
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:35,900
a window says in I actually have space
in my before

779
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,739
for X up more bites soul

780
00:43:39,739 --> 00:43:43,839
if you have a world record that needed
you can its you can acknowledge a packet

781
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:48,038
and then yes that can send many packets
do you do when he's exhausted

782
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:51,500
I'll while let's look at the other side
if I say that they have wonderful

783
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,569
one point of view that means that the
other side can

784
00:43:54,569 --> 00:43:58,940
only send one bike second pretty much if
they have 120

785
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:02,009
I'll so from unleashed quiet

786
00:44:02,009 --> 00:44:05,680
me from talking to watch him any
fighting consistently said my we do is

787
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,629
you know

788
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:10,519
not and he's fighting for us to watch
page this page will be attending the

789
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:11,919
memory of the seven

790
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,239
and then it will have to bite bite bite
deliver it to me

791
00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:19,599
okie one bite will have to be
encapsulated with the CPC other

792
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,420
I P sheldon and then don't you my fam I
own

793
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:27,489
say the data link layer frame that's ok
don't that's a lot of work

794
00:44:27,489 --> 00:44:30,920
for the website but actually to send the
data back to me so this is another

795
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,829
asymmetry that you can have in in the
way %uh

796
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:39,089
Europe your existing this list does it
cost to really affectionate

797
00:44:39,089 --> 00:44:43,099
cost a lot of work for from 70 open many
pages

798
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:47,059
and it'll take a while okay check some

799
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:51,359
a check some is calculated to only over
the control information she's committed

800
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:52,640
over something called

801
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,650
met Heather because it not only covers
the from

802
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:00,009
therefore information that is in this
had to be done something the source and

803
00:45:00,009 --> 00:45:00,519
destination

804
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:04,000
IPS I am and

805
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,710
if any of these days cut off the check
some not mention it will be dropped out

806
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:12,430
up Jim wanted eat is used with the

807
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:16,328
together with jim plack when you have
out and they that you do is whether that

808
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:17,569
other men they've actually

809
00:45:17,569 --> 00:45:21,230
hands options you how you can use
different

810
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:24,509
dish notions that that's a long story
that and

811
00:45:24,509 --> 00:45:28,130
the have a date so that this Public
Enemy

812
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:32,470
looks know what is interesting to know
about this be

813
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:35,680
um DBZ implemented state machine

814
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,750
that means that you have distinct stays
in which the machine can be

815
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:43,839
for if the connection and to move
between states you have to meet certain

816
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:44,690
conditions

817
00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:48,029
those conditions arms some II

818
00:45:48,029 --> 00:45:51,930
those conditions are coming from the
fumes in the packets that their arriving

819
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:55,558
in the receiving implication that you
simply stack

820
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:58,700
I am so for example issues you seen flag

821
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,879
that he's all somebody has to talk to me
now I'm going to switch

822
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,430
dole at the first it when I'm going to
actually send them a response

823
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:09,890
and now wait for them to confirmed and
soy sauce on the state machine is

824
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:13,250
about fifteen to twenty different states

825
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:17,230
ET's it easy in and out of the I did not
want to go into more details there but

826
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:21,359
if you have questions after the after
the topic ensure the machine

827
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:25,420
I'm that she stays action you may want
to know about it that policing

828
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:29,779
seen this eve establish on that if you
wait one if you wait too

829
00:46:29,779 --> 00:46:33,559
and then this don't waste time with
which we talk a little more

830
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:37,049
about sony says the host application has

831
00:46:37,049 --> 00:46:40,859
a touch support and he is ready to
accept connections

832
00:46:40,859 --> 00:46:44,219
I am then eking going to CNBC

833
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:47,480
when the others party

834
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,640
and ago yeah shift from

835
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:55,549
has like okay I use disliked this is
actually a scene for the tech but

836
00:46:55,549 --> 00:46:58,599
from or use it to you straight the room
how it works

837
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:03,440
song the right side is our a similar it
will be in the statement to ABC is the

838
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,670
first impact

839
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:07,759
then it will respond with a scene and
acknowledgements to the

840
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:11,219
quien and it will move into our state a

841
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:14,329
in the sea then from there

842
00:47:14,329 --> 00:47:18,200
the quiet would normally respond with
another acknowledgement that actually

843
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,859
from that point on their way possibly be
sending acknowledgements to each other

844
00:47:21,859 --> 00:47:24,930
I am and the connection going to be
established

845
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:28,239
state once they decide to get the
connection now

846
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:31,799
I am depending who initiated the

847
00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:35,700
you the 10 the Bible with anything wat
laughing way too

848
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:39,439
and that ultimately when the connection
is completely portable going time wat

849
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,029
so why is this important not first thing
in the world like not is that

850
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:48,230
home you can did the difference shooting
PCB's that

851
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:53,910
you can have you actually had to one-way
connections is not want to wake connects

852
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:57,299
up so one of the states compose the
connection but the other side can

853
00:47:57,299 --> 00:48:00,250
continue talking to the other side he's
perfectly legal

854
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:03,670
in from in this be and

855
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:07,380
one example would be issue of dealing a
wall following hehe X

856
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:11,299
you're showing six years as a session
may not die because

857
00:48:11,299 --> 00:48:14,270
used to receiving that you have closed
the connection to the civil but the

858
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:17,920
citrus to head the connection open to
anything you sending information

859
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,029
I am some that's about the few ways

860
00:48:21,029 --> 00:48:24,079
now I'm want thing which is a very very
interesting one

861
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,190
as you mentioned the protocols designed
some

862
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:30,599
something years ago and I'm at that time

863
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:33,650
I am thanks for moving much faster Massa

864
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:37,190
saying much slower I so

865
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:40,239
I don't you have read the the honesty
about 2 Geo's

866
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:43,690
but up that he's it is called geo

867
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:46,849
thanks to you in local count up

868
00:48:46,849 --> 00:48:52,099
is because a the definition is that the
TG of you has to be decreased

869
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:55,489
by one for every second the packets said
spends

870
00:48:55,489 --> 00:48:58,829
individual have that out there for every
second

871
00:48:58,829 --> 00:49:02,730
I that means the 24th talking about it
initially they were considering that a

872
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:06,200
house in the back from here to share it
stay there for three seconds

873
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:10,328
put it next time stay there for two
seconds and hopefully within 60 seconds

874
00:49:10,329 --> 00:49:13,190
it will probably go from Alabama on wall

875
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:17,589
let's say shit was seeing was engine is
well mom

876
00:49:17,589 --> 00:49:22,828
I I forgot which interest is at that
point were am

877
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:26,549
yep sup yeah so then there's the way
they were thinking

878
00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:29,549
I'll and at that time they were right
now they said

879
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:33,219
something called MSL at you know what
the issue is

880
00:49:33,219 --> 00:49:36,690
mean things like that so they sent
seconds

881
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:41,390
and they said okay so if we have a
packet that you sent from this forced to

882
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:42,489
disclose from these

883
00:49:42,489 --> 00:49:46,150
so spoke to the Spanish apart and

884
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:49,369
in this connection get get squalls and
then immediately

885
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:52,569
a connection from the same source IPS
spoke to this

886
00:49:52,569 --> 00:49:56,099
to do same destination IP in this nation
parties open

887
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:59,819
I am this assumption is that some
packages lost somewhere in the network

888
00:49:59,819 --> 00:50:03,869
any may choose to come back and media
reject in the second connection

889
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:07,230
and we don't want this to happen because
we have some data corruption so they

890
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:07,940
said okay

891
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:12,219
we know that the a.m. is so we find that
to be sixty seconds that means that

892
00:50:12,219 --> 00:50:15,789
no packages arriving network for more
than 60 seconds

893
00:50:15,789 --> 00:50:18,849
I and I'll let's double that so that
means that

894
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:23,259
you should actually stay in time wait
for 120 seconds

895
00:50:23,259 --> 00:50:26,819
now and even these committees implement
an assistant 50 seconds

896
00:50:26,819 --> 00:50:31,219
which means that you only have two same
in I'm wait for another 60 seconds

897
00:50:31,219 --> 00:50:34,480
which still too much time so you can
drop Damaso and you can actually

898
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,910
week stay in that weighs state for much
less than that

899
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:42,328
I found at five to six seconds is
actually in the weakest

900
00:50:42,329 --> 00:50:45,769
for six seconds this is the packet
containing you're not using satellite

901
00:50:45,769 --> 00:50:47,549
links you can go around the world d

902
00:50:47,549 --> 00:50:50,849
world about the times second something
like this

903
00:50:50,849 --> 00:50:55,329
so sought a problem on this and

904
00:50:55,329 --> 00:51:01,100
K

905
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:05,630
say

906
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:09,500
okay so want he really fast what will
happen to the circuit here we have a

907
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:09,920
team

908
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,970
Lisa state then we have been established
they've been waiting time with state

909
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:18,740
them within 60 seconds and there's
nothing there

910
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:22,160
um your best best friends actually

911
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,359
and this is very basic no: most if you
probably know about the story but

912
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:29,380
their income that's that's you works
just you don't learn all

913
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:33,010
different options that you can use with
it then dispute them

914
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:37,390
be no exactly what you need to do stuff
capturing traffic as soon as possible

915
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:37,850
because

916
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:40,980
in most cases this will be your loony
you know

917
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:44,340
your most junior guy in the network
operations center that has to run this

918
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:45,980
command did you park at night:

919
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:49,500
because these when some people in Asia
awakening

920
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,200
pages from you know take somebody's
website because

921
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:57,189
they said something mean high school so
up

922
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:00,260
you have to have this document that I
know it's very simple i'd

923
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:03,600
Marie have you know most people don't
have a problem with that but

924
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,240
I have noted that genuine ok engineers
need to have it

925
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,640
and of course the cato other detection

926
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,970
that the kids no and yes stuff like this
but thats

927
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:18,350
different a bowl game there education so
mitigation depends a lot on the leading

928
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:19,029
the attack

929
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:23,200
depends on the specifically so that is
affected I am

930
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,040
you can do it yourself you can get your
own dedicated hardware that does that

931
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,759
there's several vendors that I actually

932
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:33,020
a like a while I don't depend on going
to advertising and vendors but

933
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:36,420
definitely a networks and the other way
a

934
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:40,600
really good good you have sex with
tradition devices um

935
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:44,080
there are others but those are going to
have personally tested and have survived

936
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:44,460
so

937
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:48,730
I'm really like them you can junior
software you can also

938
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:52,080
change or architecture that's something
that's also

939
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:55,990
that can be considered but you
definitely can't do that

940
00:52:55,990 --> 00:53:00,640
you know short term us could be
prevented this thing companies that you

941
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,740
can send your traffic to and then they
will

942
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,910
but it did in your the clean trafficking
a GRE tunnel back to you

943
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:09,180
as an option so

944
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:12,549
as I said for example is killing you
can't just send stuff to the club

945
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:15,770
and so on doesn't seem would work

946
00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:20,240
King

947
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,359
Surekha running out of time so I'll do
you want to just calcium was work

948
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:29,100
show cans okay

949
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:33,839
okay so I'll visit the receiving several
his

950
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:37,060
system sites the state they would can
team

951
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:40,529
how many connections how many request
this

952
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:43,940
are wanting to talk to them so this user
is about

953
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:47,020
2048 that's what the default for

954
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:50,980
limits for up to six fifty-something
colonels

955
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:54,710
from so those connections

956
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:58,760
basically if somebody opens more than
his more than 2,000 pending request to

957
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,030
you

958
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:02,050
you be out of us what's and you will not
be able to convey

959
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:06,850
anymore arm thus effectively using this
service will be denied

960
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:10,330
up to all uses the data trying to talk
to you in the meantime

961
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:13,660
no what you can do

962
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:17,029
he's you can actually and actually how
it will look

963
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:20,650
you have issues what so this is a next
step not the CDC state for

964
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:23,940
most the sockets and

965
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:27,000
known when you see something like 2002
these or more

966
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,640
I'll what you can do what you can to see

967
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,900
PCP swallowed a.m. actually better with
mitigated

968
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,970
do with the celebs keep you in passive
um

969
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:41,270
single key basically is a speech ash

970
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:46,500
these she then toward the she was number
fueled when you responding so

971
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:50,410
you actually be seen the packet you some
cool medical condition that you send it

972
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:52,629
back and then forget that you ever talk
to that guy

973
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:57,420
I now if they needed me back in the
shares the same education last long

974
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,530
because the technology

975
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:02,020
in the packet then you know that you
talk to the game the best

976
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:05,360
established for connection in this Dec I
am

977
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,910
how's this calculated want let's look
here

978
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:13,790
up basically you think thanks them I'm
what went into that means the

979
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:17,020
war shifted to the is will be to their
rights

980
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:22,530
64 a say five beats which means that
you'll lose positions

981
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:26,300
for 64 seconds which is actually useful
because the spectral everything around

982
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,330
and I'm will be passing is the traveling

983
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:31,940
so 64 seconds maybe a little bit of an
overkill but it's safe

984
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:36,820
song I am then it also adds the segment
size and then it also has

985
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:41,770
24 be changed in the hash it they should
look on the civil right he said reports

986
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:43,460
filed by people on board

987
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:47,270
and the place that they mention about
I'm

988
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:50,370
then this number is actually a 32 bit
number is hidden in the sequence number

989
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:52,109
can be sent to the other party

990
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:55,940
you the other parties only thing that
with the you what's which they basically

991
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:56,560
doom

992
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:59,680
they're going to increase that by one
return it to you you

993
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:04,690
deep dark one needed same calculation if
numbers match that you talk to that guy

994
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:07,860
so that's what housing his work what is
that about them

995
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:11,800
well the problem is that if there were
any TCP options cent in the first packet

996
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,820
you just lost those

997
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:16,130
something called extended to include the
allow you to keep some of this

998
00:56:16,130 --> 00:56:16,920
information

999
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,990
but I am there's fuel not very efficient

1000
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:25,600
however in most cases you're on the
right track you don't care yeah because

1001
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,670
those options that is your chance
normally jump you optimize the the

1002
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:30,910
connection with talking about saving
something like

1003
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:34,460
five to 10 milliseconds on 52nd
interconnection

1004
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:38,080
not that big of a deal so you know

1005
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:43,009
you can lose endured an individual being
able to take the connection at official

1006
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:49,540
which one to choose I'm how would I get
a quick or actually circuit exhaustion

1007
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:53,330
when you have everything in time wat
basically unification to open the

1008
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:54,270
workforce

1009
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:58,300
a lot of sockets in them which state how
do you need it is

1010
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:01,560
well the easiest way actually
communities to enable security setting

1011
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:04,680
its ok to use you don't even need to
drop the episode on

1012
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:11,680
you can just recycle the sockets so
that's how you enable that

1013
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:16,830
I am okay mitigation above the upper
layers

1014
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:20,560
basically you can change the way your
petition look as I mentioned

1015
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:23,670
for example a patch uses persons based a

1016
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:28,250
more though where you have one thread
handing one connection

1017
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:32,450
I am and if somebody opens many
connections to you in just

1018
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:36,279
sense bite bite bite bite bite bite bite
of your plans and BC you can't take new

1019
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,180
connections

1020
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:40,720
engine X it basically has long queue in
the stuff

1021
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,709
from connection that is processing in
just seconds between them

1022
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:47,880
very fast video efficient also up much
use it

1023
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:51,240
on the next particular jus gonna level
that's what is the problem that will

1024
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:54,729
comply with its you basically have a new
process for every test

1025
00:57:54,730 --> 00:57:58,990
and because that have system thank you
switch between the different processes

1026
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:01,180
and this time is very expensive in
general

1027
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:04,250
with engine X everything stays pretty
much in the same process he's just

1028
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,860
before

1029
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:10,870
within walking I O I'm you can book an
engine X on the web dev social

1030
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:14,350
actually Alex behar from another way to
Remi's

1031
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:17,569
I'm fortune for engine X called Global

1032
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:21,110
I'll go to your website and you can get
more information it's basically a

1033
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:21,990
poignant did

1034
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:26,379
EADS the incoming packet cather's and
make some decisions

1035
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:30,400
and drops you need you need you need you
can but traffic

1036
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,860
also it will change plans for example to
give it to other jobs can challenge

1037
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:38,300
in the plan can pass the jobs could
challenge if you actually

1038
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:43,040
let's see the video page it also uses
Silverlight so for PC to Windows buzzes

1039
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,420
when she sends you were white

1040
00:58:44,420 --> 00:58:49,030
instead of just skipped I'm juga teased
you have a simple botnet

1041
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:52,080
just opens sockets you can have it look
at

1042
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,960
G pages agent that really fast generate
an exit from memory

1043
00:58:55,960 --> 00:59:02,670
and then from there sent to the more
expensive s more expensive pages

1044
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:06,130
K help you need us to how we doing on
them I guess work out

1045
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:09,880
right is next to cushion object cool

1046
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,050
okay up before I finish heads on mention

1047
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:16,760
and the call for some organizing in the
north you know in the

1048
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:21,150
Bay Area San Francisco so if you is that
